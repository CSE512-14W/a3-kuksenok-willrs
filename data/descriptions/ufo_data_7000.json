As I was traveling down rt 50 to my left, witnessed a strange orb that moved along the horizon of what looked like corn or wheat. Moved in a east to west direction and then did a sudden dip and disapeared. The movement was that of a computer curser. The orb traveled horizontly and then a sudden dip. As I turned to see if my son saw it we look at each other at the same moment and said to each other&quot; what was that&quot;Well I hate to repeat again what I witnessed, but this orb&apos;s color was that of a soap bubble. Odd collection of hues on this orb. I would only like to add that the same type of orb was witnessed again almost 1 year later in Virginia, 2 miles south outside of D.C. at about 2 am on April 20(approximation) of 1998. Orb was moving in a south ward direction just in front, don&apos;t just how far, of me. It was up in the sky moving south and then took a quick upward direction a such great speed and disapeared behind ? blackness of the night sky. Must note that it was a clear cold night and I had just got off work. Perhaps this orb has the ability to move inter-dimentionaly. It just vanished into nothing as far as I could see. Perhaps it docked or crossed into another dimention. ((NUFORC Note--This is an anonymous report.))", "A triangle-shape object that looked like balls tied together, flying in formation.My daughter and I were out in our backyard, looking for meteors, and noticed a wispy-looking thing approaching in the sky from the northwest. As it approached, it seemed to form a triangular formation. I remember thinking that it looked like geese, but realized it was a &quot;string&quot; of glowing balls. The balls were golden/white in color, looking like dimmed light bulbs, and the formation appeared to be, perhaps, balloons tied together. My daughter and I figured that&apos;s what it was, catching the reflection of the moon, but as it went over our yard, we realized that balloons could not hold the triangular shape we were seeing. Also, the breeze was coming from the west and this formation was travelling north to south at approximately 25-30 mph. It made no noise whatever. It was very large. I have no way to determine the altitude, as it was dark outside, but I could clearly see that the individual &quot;balls&quot; were round in shape. The formation continued due south and then appeared to veer southwest as we lost sight of it. I called a friend who lived in that direction and asked her to look for it, but she didn&apos;t see anything. We were surprised to not hear anything on the news about it or read about it this morning in the paper. We are both sane females and as we discussed the event, as it was occuring, there is no doubt that we both saw the same thing at the same time.", "It was a very clear night, so I went to do as I always do and climbed onto the roof of my carport to look at the stars with binoculars, when I noticed these little lights in a triangular shape silently gliding through the air over some houses in front of me, but the lights did not seem to be connected to anything solid in between or in the center of them. All I could do was watch in amazement at my very first UFO sighting, too bad I was alone.The object(s) looked to be triangular in shape but in a connect-the-dots sort of way as if there was nothing in between these dots of light, there were just staying in silent formation very low over a group of houses next to mine, and seemed to look as if was being looked at while it was behind something hot.(like hot roads look like they have water on them on a hot day) Also (maybe just my imagination) I think I saw a vey faint yellowish whispy trail being left by this object as it went and dissapeared through some trees where I finally lost visual contact. The lights on this object all three of them seemed to be some sort of yellow-orange-reddish color.", "We saw a metallic silver cigar shaped object flying slowly from N to S, it turned away, turned transparent and then dissappeared.A friend and I were driving from El Centro to San Diego West on Highway 8 in the mountains approximately 50 miles East of San Diego.  The elevation was 4100 feet.  We had just passed a sign, so that is how I know it was that elevation.  I was driving, and something made me look to the sky above the mountains to my in a Northwest direction - I think it was the movement in the sky.   I was surprised to see something that was clearly not a plane because it had no wings or tail, no lights, and no trail behind it.  It looked like a silver metallic cigar-shaped craft that with rounded edges, and was larger at one end (the left as I was looking at it) than the other.  I could not see if it had windows, but it was very large.  I am not a pilot so have no reference for size, but my guess is that it was quite a bit larger than an airplane. The object was moving very slowly from North to South just above the peak of a mountain.   It would periodically slow down and then speed up.  I said to my friend a couple of seconds after I first sighted it - &quot;((name deleted)), what the heck is that?&quot;  To which she replied that she had no idea, and that she had already been watching it for at least 1 - 1 1/2 minutes and was trying to figure that out herself.  She kept thinking (and hoping) it would show some wings or something to indicate that it was a plane.  We both got very excited and said &quot;oh my God, I think it is a UFO&quot; at the same time! At that point I looked at my watch to verify time, and it said 4:20 PM.  The sun was setting in the West, and it caused the craft to shine quite brightly.  We were behind a mountain at the time, so the sun was not shining in our eyes.  I did look for signs for some reference as to the exact point, but there were none around.  There are quite a few mountains in this area.  We both watched the object for approximately 30 seconds, and were discussing it when it took a 90-degree turn very quickly due West, became transparent, and then disappeared.  ((Name deleted)) did not witness it becoming transparent first, only that it disappeared instantly.  We believe she must have blinked during this time because that is how fast it occurred.  I then pulled over on the side of the road and grabbed my camera and video camera in case it came back, because at that point I was convinced that I saw something otherworldly or perhaps an experimental craft of some type. We both remarked how it began to move away as we were talking about it.  We then kept looking to see if we would see anything further, or perhaps see planes in the area that would indicate a flight line to or from an airport, but saw nothing until we reached the San Diego Area.  We saw no planes or helicopters whatsoever going to or from El Centro at all once we reached the mountains.  We are from the Midwest and are unfamiliar with mountains, but perhaps a topographical map would indicate the tallest one (the one we were on) for a better reference. ((name deleted)) had never seen a UFO in her life (she is now 53), and is convinced that this was a UFO.  I should also mention that ((name deleted)) was driving first, and then I got very sick and made her let me drive to minimize the sickness.  I do get carsick, but this time was probably the worst I&apos;ve ever felt.  Also, about 10 minutes after the sighting, I was compelled to pull off to the side of the road to collect rocks two times.  The second time, we pulled 100 feet behind a stalled van, and right as I returned to the car I looked in the rear view mirror and saw a semi truck cab driving at around 90 MPH on the side of the road straight for us.  Just before it would have hit us, it swerved back onto the highway.  I have the overwhelming feeling that that was a message of some sort.", "Encountered large triangular object while night fishing off Farlon Island and fired 100 rounds of 22 ammo at it.On the evening of Super Bowl Sunday, I was hauling up a line of crab traps off Farlon Island with my dog aboard our 25&apos; boat. While leaning over the side, my dog started to bark furiously. I looked up and saw a huge triangular object hovering above with NO sound. I was hit by a beam of white light and fell backward onto the sole of the cabin. I grabbed my Ruger 10-22 rifle loaded with a 100 round banana magazine and stared firing as fast as I could until the clif was empty. I was able to shoot out the light. While grabbing for a second clip, I saw a hatch open up on the bottom side of the object and two people leaned down to yell &quot;STOP SHOOTING AS US YOU IDIOT&quot;. The only other noise I heard was a hissing sound like air escapeing from a flat tire or something. As the object move off to the south, I saw a helocopter come out off the top and move in next to my boat about 20&apos; off the water and 50&apos; way. Someone in the side door held up a camera and flash off a picture of me in the boat holding the rifle. The helocopter made no noise and had no markings on it. It was solid flat black as was the huge Triangle. The chopper then took off toward the Golden Gate bridge climbing up. The Triangle slowing gained altitude and was last seen heading south. I left the area for port and went out Wednesday to finish hauling in my traps. At first I thought it was an alien UFO and was genunly startled by it. However, I now believe it was an experimental military platform for transporting a small fleet of black helocopters that leave and enter out of the top of a huge silent floating triangle the size of a football field. A rigid airship if you will.((NUFORC Note:  This may be the first report we have received that has the occupants of such a craft using a camera with a flash attachment..))", "WHILE DRIVING EAST BOUND APPROX. 3/4 MILE EAST OF BURNA, KY AT APPROX 6:30 PM 4 BEAMS OF LIGHT SUDDENLY APPEARED ON THE HIGHWAY DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF OUR MOVING AUTO AND REMAINED MOVING IN FRONT OF OUR CAR FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS.

Roughly 30 deg. in elev. from horiz they appeared at first like cars going over an overpass with headlights shining on the guardrail. I watched for about 20 sec. as the objects, travelling horizontally, finally dimmed and went out roughly together. The largest of the objects were obviously still intact when they cooled and would have landed. As distance was difficult to judge from one position its hard to determine rough location but from my perspective they were heading in the direction of eastern Lake Ontario My questions are:1, Would they have been leonids travelling from west to east? 2, Would they have been leonids being that big? 3, Could it have been an opertune reentering of terrestrial hardware 4, Did I report this to the proper authorities &amp; if not, please advise.

Second object appeared to be very high and yet its lights streched from horizon to horizon.I was only thirteen and my family where very protective.  I had never seen drugs nor known anyone who had. My family and I had just gone out and where returning from an evening of diner at a favorite pizza place. When we got out of the car I looked South and saw what at first appeared to be the moon.  I was about to comment on its shape and how shiny it was.  I couldn&apos;t make out any craters.  It was just white. Then I noticed that I had to many shadows. One shadow from the street lamp, one shadow from what I thought was the moon, and another. When I traced this third shadow back to its source I saw the moon almost directly overhead. I was about to yell at this discovery when I noticed the bright object begin to move.  I had to watch. I was nervous, but not frightend. My family by this time where in the mobile home we lived in at the time. I flattend my body against the trailor and watched by peeking around the corner as the object moved in a northern direction. The object moved till it seemed directly above me, then it stopped.  It seemed extremely large and high in altitude. I wondered if it where even in atmosphere. Then, wish it flew up and away into the out-there and was gone. I looked around the corner to where I had first seen it.  I saw something else.  I became filled with terror and dread. There, from one end of the horizon to the other were lights.  Red,Orange,Green.  Each one spaced evenly like many objects all in formation, or one huge object. It followed the same course as the other object and stopped over me just as the other object had. In the glare of the lights, and the blockage of the stars, it becaame aparent that these lights where all connected to one object.  The outline of the lights was striking.  It reminded me of that of a bird of prey symbol.

At times it would make quick moves up/down and diagonally, and then move randomly again.My wife noticed a light in the night sky. The night was clear and the event was witnessed from our livingroom window. The object appeared to have a white and red light.  At first, she thought it was a plane.  It is very common to see planes in the sky due to the air traffic between the Portland, Me and Boston airports. We usually can determine an airplane in the sky by the lights and the way they appear to move.  What made this so interresting is this object moved distinctly different than the planes.  She watched it for about 15 minutes, then woke me up to take a look. I immediately could tell this was no ordinary plane.  It appeared to be dancing, or moving in random directions, not fast and not in right angles.  It would periodically seem to move quickly up or down, and diagonally, but not far. From our vantage point, we were looking toward the northeast.  There were other air traffic in the sky, but these were normal airliners from the aiports.  There were no other objects in the immediate vicinity. We could not determine any features of the object;  just the lights.  I estimate the object to be approximately 2 - 5 miles away and about 45 degrees up past the horizon. My sister-in-law who lives adjecent to us has said she has seen this in the past also. My wife is 34 years old, administrative specialist for a major supermarket chain. I am 35 years old, ex-navy, submarine, nuclear reactor operator.  I am currently a technical trainer for a semiconductor equipment company. I am baffled as to what this was.  It appears that this object is not an airplane, commercial or military.  My only explaination is maybe a remote control airplane (like a toy), but why at midnight?", "A beam of RED light came out of the clouds, like a flashlight beam in the fog, only very bright and large beam.I was driving south bound on toll road I35 in Kansas looking a little to the left side of the interstate at milemarker 84.5 when I observed the beam of light project from above the clouds toward the ground. From my vantage point I would guess the top of the beam to be approx. 100 ft. and the bottom to be at least 500 ft. across. It lasted for not more than 3 seconds maybe less. The weather was nice approx. 68 degrees, slight wind, puffy clouds, no fog, best I could tell there were no airplanes in the area I was driving.", "A bright flying object sped across the sky.I was building a garage and I looked up in the sky and I saw a seagull, but that seagull started to form bright colors.

After that I couldn&apos;t sleep.  When I get certain feeling it is usually right.  I had that feeling.  Not only is this the only sighting, I have seen 5 others. I have the strangest feeling that my hypothesis is correct that it was an ailien space craft.", "sighting of object traveling at high speed with unusual movement and shape.A friend of mine and I were discussing how clear the sky was on this night, when he asked me if the little dipper was made up of stars. At that instant he looked up at a easterly angle towards the little dipper, when he did he said wow,what is that ? I had already looked up by that time and noticed a disk shaped object with a dark center and white around the outside. it was not a light but more like white against a dark sky. the object traveled from about three feet of my sight to the left of the little dipper as scale to about a foot to the right of it in a straight line and then dipped downward at about a seventy degree angle for about a second and then turned right at a 90 degree angle and traveled directly away from me for about a second and a half before dissapearing from sight. This area is near L.A. international airport and there is alot of air traffic and after seeing the object we compared times of airplanes covering approximatly the same diastance and by our estimations the object was traveling 50 times faster than a commercial airliner. and covered the complete horizon in about three and a half seconds. I am a 39 year old male and my occupation is a printer. my friend is a 39 year old truck driver.

Noticed a object along side my truck at a distance. It first apeared like a large plane with a row of windows. I thought it was a plane atempting to land on the highway. As it grew closer i realized the object was to large to be a plane. In addition it had no flashing lights or landing lights. It was very long in length, possibly 200&apos; to 500&apos; feet. It had a row of what apeared to be windows yellow orange in color, with several lights in the front and rear the same color. It seamed to slow as it got closer to my truck, almost directly in front, about 1/4 mile away. It dipped down behind some trees, and dissapeared. My son as well as myself witnessed this object.

This lasted for approximately 1 min. then completely disappeared. Within 2 minutes, 4 planes appeared to be flying in formation looking for the object. We again saw this object and it&apos;s beam in what seemed like a closer view and we were able to see what looked like 5 exhaust &quot;pipes&quot; from where the light beams came from. Then the light beams seemed to slowly extinquish themselves until there was nothing. We witnessed the object and plane formation two more times while driving to and from this area.As we drove through Stoughton after taking the exit 19B to rte. 138 enroute to Canton Christmas, my son and I saw a Bright round luminous object in the sky.  This object was much bigger than any star we have seen and the beam of light coming from it was straight and round, long and thick beam. Then after about what seemed a minute, the object suddenly disappeared from the sky.  About 2 minutes later we witnessed 4 planes take v-formation in the sky and they appeared to be searching for something. As we drove down 138, we again seen this object. This time it appeared to be bigger, perhaps closer and we were able to see the exhaust area that the beams came from.  The exhaust area looked like 5 round holes, brightly lit. As we witnessed this object for the 2nd time, we both felt our hearts stop and were extremely frightened. Just then the object disappeared, shortly thereafter, the 4 planes took formation.  On the way back from Canton as we approached the Christmas Tree Shoppe parking lot, we again seen the object, it appeared as it did earlier with the beam of light but now it sort of had a trailing light also. As we watched, a young man approached and looked into the sky. My son pointed to the object and the young man stood looking with his mouth wide open.  He yelled to us that he could see it also.  Just then, it disappeared and sure enough, here comes the 4 planes in formation.  We then went inside the Shop.  After approximately, 40 minutes, we left and while driving on rte. 24 towards Brockton, we witnessed the object again. This time it seemed very brief, but once again the planes came in formation.", "During a Hawaiian Huna training on the Big Island of Hawaii, myself and about 12 others in our group witnessed a formation of UFOs that lasted at least 1 hour and 15 minutes.During a shamanic training on the Big Island, our group went to what is considered to be a &quot;sacred warm pond&quot; for what our group leader referred to as an spiritual initiation. During this &quot;initiation&quot;, all of us were bathing in the warm pond, pretty deep in the Hawaiian woods.  I think it was near Hilo, but I&apos;m not sure because we visited many different sites considered sacred to the Hawaiians.  Some of these sites are called Heiaus, or ancient Hawaiian temples. Others in our group probably could give a better description of the events, as I was personally immersed in a process known as rebirthing with the instructor/shaman for what I estimate to be approximately an hour based on what another in our group said, which was prior to this sighting which I witnessed personally for only about 15 minutes.  (Rebirthing is a breathing technique considered to be a &quot;Western version of Eastern Yogic Pranayam.&quot;) Anyway, this rebirthing was done with my eyes closed, and so it was not until I came out of this process that I saw what the others in my group said they were watching for at least an hour.  I looked up into the sky towards the horizon above a mountain and noticed the stars blinking on and off.  I asked what was happening in the sky, or if I was seeing things, and the others laughed at me, saying they had been watching these UFOs for the past hour while I was undergoing this rebirthing process. I saw, over a mountain, a formation of several, I&apos;d saw anywhere between 1 and 7 at any one time, lights that looked like stars.  They sometimes blinked on, and sometimes off.  They sometimes changed colors (blue, red, white, green), and they moved into various formations including a triangle and a square, and sometimes just blended into the sky to appeared to be star constellations (with the exception that the &quot;stars&quot; would turn on and off and occasionally move to different positions). The instructor of the group, whom some consider to be a kahuna (Hawaiian term for &quot;Keeper of the Secret&quot;), told us that the government was working with Grays in that area in that mountain, and that that was a known base.  They told me they knew where that base was (inside the mountain), but it was not wise to go and visit it.  I don&apos;t know if any of that is true, but I just want to give you some background.  Perhaps it seems nuts.  That&apos;s fine. But, I saw what I saw, just as I described.  It was the only encounter I ever had with anything like that, other than seeing a mysterious green light over the ocean at night in Hawaii that seemed to just move across the water and back.  From what I understand, many people have seen this and call it the &quot;green flash.&quot;  Anyway, I was kind of in an high state of mind after this breathing process, and when I saw them everybody laughed at me.  One person laughed, &quot;Peter&apos;s baaaack!&quot;  I pointed up at these &quot;stars&quot; and said, &quot;The stars are disappearing!&quot;  The others just laughed and one of them said, &quot;No kidding.  We&apos;ve been watching them for about an hour!&quot;  I thought it was amusing how they (the UFOs) seemed to be putting on a show for us and I remember exclaiming, &quot;They&apos;re playing with us!&quot;  Anyway, they disappeared from the sky, just blinked out a few minutes later, and that was it. I have to add that our group used no psychotropics as it might seem by such a sighting.  At no time did any of us.  We followed a strict vegetarian (organic) diet, mostly fresh fruit and nuts for the during of the training which lasted several weeks.  We were all of very clear mind and were not delusional by any means. What this was, I don&apos;t pretend to know.  But, I am sure they were not meteorites, nor swamp gas, nor aiplanes, nor helicopters nor anything man made, due to the precision with which they moved, and how swiftly they moved into such precise patterns.  At times, many of the real stars in the sky seemed to just disappear, like they just got blacked out, and then brought back, and there was no cloud cover whatsoever.  It was the clearest night you could imagine.  The whole experience was extremely strange to me, but our group just sort of &quot;went with the flow&quot; and I don&apos;t remember much talk about it afterwards. So, that&apos;s what I saw.  Probably old news being that it was in 1993, but I figured I&apos;d share it just in case others on the island, or elsewhere witnessed anything similar.  If you find that there has been anything similar from others, I&apos;d appreciate a call.  I&apos;ll call you back on my dime.  Thanks, and keep up the great reporting. By the way, I bet that warm pond is the best place to experience ongoing sightings if you just ask a Hawaiian elder to direct you to it.", "Observers a Cylinder shaft cross the road above us and in front of us and then depart the scene quickly after pacing the car we were in.This event happened in the hot summer months. We had been to a family function. Our car at that time had no air conditioning and we had the windows down. My father was in a rather foul mood and had the radio off. We were approx 3 miles away from a small city on a rural paved 2 lane highway travelling East. We came to a T intersection and turned south. This road was the Fremont road. There were houses on either side of the road. The moon was out bright that evening. As we started south my sister sitting in the back seat drivers side asked what is that in a startling tone.. We all looked and my father immediately stopped the vechicle. Less than 300 feet away at tree top level we observers a black cylinder traveling very slowly north to south paralleling the road. The object traveled approx 100 ft to the left and front of our vehicle and stopped. No remember it was a hot evening no wind and quiet not a sound could be heard except the car motor. The object only stopped for approx 10 seconds and then made a 90 degree turn on it&apos;s axis and started moving again east to west it crossed approx 100 feet in front of the car. I was in the right hand back seat. I lost site of it for a moment and then it appeared on my side of the car. It stopped again approx 200 feet on the west side of the road made another 90 degree turn and started heading south again very slowly. My father must have been really terrified as at this point he acclerated very quickly we reached speeds of up to 100 mph trying to outrun the object. After he had accelerated the object kept pace with our vehicle for approx 4-5 miles. Not a word was said in the car during this whole encounter. Finally after what seemed forever the object climbed and turned at a incredible rate. I quicly left our viewpoint. I have seen high speed jet aircraft make 600 knot passes and this object left the area by probably a multiplier of 5. My family talked only that evening of the encounter and for nearly 22 years it has bugged me. Recently we talked about that encounter and agreed to test our memories Each one of us took turns and made a tape. We then all reviewed them together and our story lines stayed pretty well true even though it has been 20+ years. Other generations of our family have had encounters and one was even interviewed by the world famous blue book team. My grandmother who is now in here 90&apos;s has black and white photo&apos;s of pictures she took in the early 60&apos;s. What ever we saw that night was no way from this world. Why we were choosen to observer the object and why it played a cat and mouse game with us while my father was trying to win the indy 500 is beyond me. But I would like to hear from anyone else in the Southern Michigan area that has had a similar encounter.", "Me-LOKING FROM CAMPER-SKY LIGHT-SOUTH TO NORTH WESTAT the time I was laying down to sleep.

It would fade out and and glow back in another position in the sky. As i reached hwy 27 i turned south and saw toward the eastern sky three (same color) fireballs. Theses three fireballs would be as far apart from each other as two miles, and as close as 200 feet. The last one I seen that night was @ 8:45 South of Lake Placid, Fl. There is a Air Force bombing range nearby, but I know of no activity going on there at night. It is mostly a reservist base. I also hunt the land there through their lease program, and I never have seen any activity at night. Also two years ago when a friend and I were going to go hunt there, we saw the same thing (two orange fireballs) east of Wauchula, Fl. nowhere near the bombing range. I think this in my mind rules of any kind of military flares. I am a truck driver so I headed South towards Miami, and did not see anything else.", "This is a little long, so please hang in there. On Nov.5th,1989, I, along with cousin, were listening to am radio KFI in Los Angeles.The guest on the show was a man named Bill Cooper.He was stating that he knew why John F. Kennedy was assasinated and he was giving a speech on it at Beverly Hills High that night.Well my cousin and I attended out of curiosity.At the meeting he revealed many things including he was ex Naval intelligence and found out things.His reason for going public was to protect his life.Mr Cooper stated that JFK was taken out by the CIA because the CIA was hiding the fact that aliens were here and JFK was going to use that fact to break up the by then  way to powerful CIA.In short, Mr. Cooper said if you did not believe his story you could venture to this valley on the other side of a mountain range to this not yet known then, but now famous place called GROOM LAKE and watch UFO&apos;s fly out of a base they had there!Well my cousin and I took him up on that and next wednesday we drove up from Palm Springs and got up off of what I believe is Highway 95 and went down the dirt road towards Groom Lake and parked our car about 24:30. The sky was unlimited visibility with a full moon lighting up the desert.I state the clarity because of the bizzarre activity of what I think were special forces personel running in Dodge Ramchargers on the dirt roads around the valley.They obviously spotted us and drove right up to the back of our car and took what I think was our Licence Plate.We got out to confront them and they put it in reverse and peeled out of there.Under the full moon I could see them spying on us driving around without there lights on. This went on for an hour then stoped.Then at about 02:00 while kicking back in the car, I looked over towards the Groom Lake area and saw this super bright light heading towards us.I awoke my sleepy cousin and shouted &quot; THERE&apos;S ONE&quot;!! It was the shape of an egg with a sparkly tail behind it coming right in front of us. We jumped out of the car to try and take a pitcure.It lit up the whole desert overpower! ing the full moon and made no noise whatsoever.Just as it got in front of us (about 3/4 of mile) and just when my cousin tried to snap a pitcure it changed color from bright white to burnt orange with its sparkle tail sucking in.Then to our amazement, it grew transparent from the center out and vanished into thin air right in front of us!! Thats my story", "i was arriving at a 4 way stop when i saw a blue green haze in upper right hand corner of windshield,i first thought was my engine overheating when realized it was a haze in the sky, i pulled over as the object moved past my field of view. i exited my vehicle, along with another driver, who had seen the object, in time to watch a bluish green, luminescent glob( about size of fist at arms length) move southeast slowly for a few seconds before suddenly shooting straight up into the sky and out of sight, the other fellow was as glad as me that someone else was there to see it.it had no lights but seemed to glow from within, it seemed very large as it also seemed very far, i couls see it clearly in the dusk sky but could not make out  any more detailsit seemed more like a changing blob than a solid object, no lights but it glowed green then blue from within it it seemed, it also seemed to move around within while it moved straight through the sky, like a water balloon filled withjello, it went in a straight path before suddenly shooting straight up at a terrific speed till it was gone", "SAW OBJECT IN SKY  , BLUE FLAME TAILING BEHIND ,HUGE9;35 P.M.

They were in an east/west line, hovering somewhere in the vacinity of the town (we were 1 mile north of town). As best as I can remember they appeared about the size of a silver dollar at arms length. They were clearly visible--there was absolutely no mistaking what we saw. We could see white lights revolving around the lower part of the upper section of the craft (just above where the larger bottom part began). They hovered for 4 or 5 minutes, then the one on the east flew very, very fast to the south, and the other two craft got in line behind it and in just about 3 or 4 seconds they were totally gone from the horizon. My Dad never reported it because we didn&apos;t have pictures and he figured no one would believe us back then.((NUFORC Note:  We presume the sighting was an afternoon sighting.  Hence, we have changed the time to 1800 hrs. here.))", "Three bright orange in color, objects came across the sky, seemed very close. hovered in a triangle, then went into a single file. Moved North.My neighbor called me again, but this time I never made it to her house. My daughter and I were stopped in our tracks when we looked up and viewed three large orange objects moving through the sky. They were not blinking, we heard no sound. They appeared to make a triangle shape, then stayed like that for about a few minutes, then went in to a single line formation. I called a friend a few streets down, she saw them also, but looked at them in a different direction, meaning they must have been closer than I ever thought! She didn&apos;t heard any sound either. Then it went off towards the north.((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date after submitting report.  We have corrected report here.))", "As we prepared to go for  the drive home after a dinner party we noticed that our vehicle would not start. It was strange because the vehicle was brand new and the gas tank was full. We felt a chill sensation, dead silence and then a bright flash on the far horizon.

It moved very fast...and darted first down and then into the sky upwards.", "Everyone saw it!It was coming towards us overhead, so it came from the north of us, then went over our heads, going south and then went north north east and disapeared.

I was riding with a friend and as we pulled in there was another truck stopped and the driver, our supervisor,  was speechless and just pointing directly above us from his drivers seat.  We craned our necks and could make out something quite large and round passing , what seemed like, directly above us.  What was weird was that it wasn&apos;t making any noise.   There seemed to be light on the edges.  You could just feel its presence.  Suddenly, it accelerated in a westwardly direction.  We all began to follow it.   It was travelling well to the west of the road we were on and I lost sight of it completely at this point. By the time we had pursued it a few miles , we noticed it joining three other like crafts above Urraca Mesa.   That was where we stopped and just watched.  They began to move in formations.   a box...then a line....all the while moving at incredible speeds.   Then just as quickly as we saw them manuvering ...they all exited ...following each other in a line up Urraca Canyon.   They exited to the west.   We stood there in silence then went back to the bunkhouse.   I asked the supervisor about it a few years ago and he says that he has no memory of such an event.", "Glowing circle flying east-&gt;west twice the speed of a jet.Flying east to west in a controlled manner at twice the speed of a Jet airplane.

Next day the paper reported ufo&apos;s but later said it was space junk.Not sure of the date but could find out! The reason for the altitude is it looked like the height of airliners or higher.

It was &quot;hugging&quot; the highway and only approx 200 feet off the ground.  It was westbound on I-70 in Utah west of the eastern border with Colorado at about 2300 hrs.  The object then returned a few minutes later and was eastbound in the same manner.I am not sure if it was only one object passing us and then returning or two seperate objects.  When the object flew over our car and down the highway ahead of us, it was almost surreal.  I wasn&apos;t sure what I had seen.  I asked my wife &quot;Did you see that?&quot;  Her reply was she wasn&apos;t sure what she had seen.  A few minutes down the road (westbound) it came back at us (eastbound).  Only about 200 feet off the ground and without any lights.  That part of Utah is mountainous and not well lit.  There was a mild snow shower occurring which also impaired clear view.  The object made no noise and there wasn&apos;t any kind of wind blast or anything that should be associated with an object of it&apos;s size and so low to the ground moving at such a speed.  If I had to say what shape I believed the object to be, I would say triangular or at least multi-angular.  Not long after that, the F117 Stealth fighter became public and I remember thinking that the shape of the object we saw could be described as similar.  But I was in the Air Force, working on the SR-71 program.  I am very familiar with U.S. aircraft and even some of the &quot;black&quot; programs being that I was in aviaton and worked on a program of secrecy.  This was not an aircraft that I then or now have been familiarized with.  When the object made it&apos;s second pass, I said to my wife &quot;Now don&apos;t tell me you didn&apos;t see it that time...&quot;  Her reply was &quot;I don&apos;t know what that was and I don&apos;t want to talk about it.&quot;  You must understand that my wife was raised in a family that was and is still very devout Christians.  Her father was a Pastor of a church most of his life and now teaches at a Chrisitan college.  I too believe that Jesus Christ is the savior of mankind.  But in conflict with or maybe just not congruent with my beliefs is this experience.  I am not ready to jump up and say that this was some sort of alien craft, all that I do know is that it was something that I cannot explain and that even with the experiences I have had in dealing with aircraft and &quot;black&quot; progra! ms, this event is still beyond my understanding.", "Objects were shaped like short contrails. But upon accelleration a round  object appeared at the front of the contrail11/27 99 3:30 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. From my sixth floor Apartment window facing due west, and without any obstructed view, I observed the formation of contrails in the southwestern skies. They were flying at high altitudes and moving from west to east and east to west. Later others started to form from north to south making a matrix in the southwestern sky neat the setting sun. I noticed two very short contrails that were changing speeds and at times stopped in mid air and changed direction these contrails appeared as right angle slashes and could have easily gone unnoticed as they blended in with the whispy clouds. I observed them moving under independant control! They seemed to be able to lengthten or shorten the contrail emission. I also observed jet aircraft flying toward these objects. The objects would change postions when the aircraft was remotely near them. One object seemed to park in a postion facing the setting sun. The other was further west from the sun and was also parked for a good bit of the time. A jet flew toward its postion at a higher altitude. It took off from its stationary position in a 90o angle to the south west. Then it accellerated leaving a long dark colored contrail( all other contrails were white) behind it. When it accellerated I could clearly see a round reflective object at the head of the contrail. Its speed seemed very fast. Much faster than any of the other movement I saw. Then I decided I should try to report it.", "While on vacation, I stopped to take a picture of the &quot;Extraterrestrial Highway&quot; sign at the intersection of Hwy 6 and Hwy 375 in Nevada. I saw nothing unusual when taking the picture. When my film was developed, a grey rectangular object was visible in the left side of the frame of the picture.  Air planes flying that day were leaving contrails in the air and this is not.  I can not determine speed or direction by the picture.  If it had not shown up on the picture, I wouldn&apos;t have known it was ever there.  No other pictures in the two rolls of film I shot over my trip showed anything like this so I assume it was not faulty film.", "Saucer shaped craft,that faded in out of view 3 times.I had just turned off of Granny White Pike onto Murray Lane (four lnae road),in Brentwood, TN. For some reason I looked left over the Brentwood Middle School, and saw an object flying approx. 1/2 of a mile away and at an altitude of about 500 feet. For 1/4 of a mile I had a totally unobstructed view of this object until the road became divided by a tree line, though I could still see the object through the tree limbs. The tree line ended about 200 yards from where Murray Road ends into franklin Road, and I had another unobstructed view of the object. The object appeared to be keeping pace with the speed of my car. The object then faded out and I could see it no more. After turning left onto Franklin Road I looked left, then right and saw the object again. It appeared to be flying once again at the exact same distance and altitude. Again I had a totally unobstructed view of this object as it now flew over a farm field. Again the object faded from my view, then about 3 seconds later reappeared. I watched this object for another 10 to 15 seconds, until this object faded from view for the last time. Again I noticed it seemed to keep pace with my car. The object had no wings, was a silver pewter in color,and I could hear no noise emanating from the object. There also seemed to be an aura or hazzy like disturbance in the air around the craft each time it faded from view.", "((deleted)) saw it before I did. It was a cigar-shaped thing.

I looked out the window and framed between tree limbs there was a large light that caught my attention. I proceeded to leave the room and tell my brother and husband that the North star was sure bright that evening and went to stand in the back yard and observe this star. After being out there watching the star the others in the house joined me at which point I was told that is not the North Star. The object was far enough away that it looked to be the size of a quarter - we then observed that the lighting changed to red, blue and green flashing. With this came the observation of two additional spheres one on each side of the first sphere. Lights continued to go on and off and then I observed what I concidered way out in space a V formation of lights that traveled in different directions instead of a straight path. Finally after 45 or so minuets all lights just disappeared. This was only one sighting for that period of time.

After watching the light for a minute or so, she decided to stop and try to figure out what it was,shortly after she stopped it zigg-zagged downward and disappeared.

These objects appeared to be less than 2000&apos; in altitude. Unknown speed, but very very slow. I work in an environment that is located right on the water of the Duamish River, and adjacent to the West Seattle Bridge. As this employment results in working all shifts day or night, I physically see numerous aircraft arriving and departing Boeing Field which is very close by. The ONLY two times that I have physically seen ANY aircraft in this area that were as low as the two objects sighted was the departure of Air Force 1, and the Blue Angels. Even Air Force 1 was travelling faster on dearture (which went directly over me) than these two sighted objects. Although the shape was hard to discern, there were two distinctive white strobe type lights on what appeared to be the outer edges of the objects, both had the same lighting structure, which I also will state I have never seen this type of lighting on commercial aircraft landing at Boeing Field. NOTE: C17 link below has a excellent pic of a up close wing tip, I cannot see a large type beacon/strobe that would simulate the type of strobe I witnessed. Both objects were (to my experience and location) too far east for a Boeing Field departure, and were almost directly above the River. They then passed over the West Seattle Bridge and did not appear to change altitude or speed, they continued this heading until my view was blocked by buildings, and cargo cranes on the north side of the bridge.

Family awoke at home the next day unsure how they arrived only recalling seeing UFO.Returning home on Christmas night from an out-of-town trip to Oklahoma, a family of four decided to make a restroom stop at a I-44 rest area just outside of Mt. Vernon, MO at about 11:00 pm CST.  While returning to their car they began to notice a buzzing noise.  The son told his father to look up at an object just above the trees.  The father, mother and sister also looked up.  They observed a dark chevron craft hovering nearby. The next thing they recall is waking up in their home the next morning. They didn&apos;t know how they got home, parked the car in the garage, unpacked luggage and presents, put presents under their Christmas tree, or got dressed for bed.  The father said his eyes were very sensitive to light when he awakened, but no other unusual bodily effects were noted by any family member.  They were perplexed how they arrived back home which was only less than a half hour drive from the rest area. An investigator from OARG checked out the rest area the following day and did not detect any evidence of trees damaged, parking lot debris, or ground vegetative effects.  HE also checked the family car for any signs of unusual marks or debris.  None was found. The mother is concerned as well as the father and daughter about the incident, but the son said its &quot;cool&quot;.  The mother is considering regressive hypnosis but a recent dream on Jan. 7, 2000 may have changed this opinion.  The mother had a dream which she was out on the back deck of their house with all of her family.  They were looking up the same craft they saw at the rest area like they were in a daze.  She screamed to wake herself up from sleeping.

Upon slowing down to get a better look the craft began to glow and then suddenly diappeared.Myself(the driver) and 3 others were driving back to college in my car when a supposed airplane was seen in the sky.  The airplane was being discussed because the lights were in the wrong position and were slightly brighter than normal.  I then began to decrease my speed to get a better look at the object which was then observed was more circular in shape.  This cause me to then stop the car entirely on the road and to attempt to get out to see it better.  As we stopped the shape then began to have a glowing nimbus around it and promptly diappeared.  We all sat in shock none of us believed what we saw.  Upon arriving back at campus we asked the other cars who were ahead of us if they saw anything as well but they only remembered seeing a plane in the same spot we say the unidentified object disappear from sight.", "Sighted bright light about 35-40 degrees eastern sky that pulsed, dimming to barely visible, gradually increasing to bright again.My husband and I were returning home from Lincoln City to Albany, Orgon about 2 a.m. 11/17/99, when we noticed a very bright, white light in about the location Jupiter had been a few weeks ago, but about 3 to 4 times as large and pulsating very slowly from extremely bright to so dim it was barely visible. It did not seem to move at all, just to hang in the same position. It was visible throughout the 75 mile trip, and we stopped at a gas station in Monmouth, Oregon, where the attendants also commented on it.

PD))", "Got up early to see the waning moon and how close Venus was to it. Sky is very clear in the desert - no lights near because we are in the north part of town. Looking up at the stars I suddenly saw two lights moving very very high up, from west to east.  I said to my partner to look at the lights and she saw them as well - no form discernible.  It was the fastest thing I had ever seen (I was an Air Force brat and have been around planes since I was a kid).  We followed the lights to the east when they made a very sudden ZIG ZAG and disappeared.  I timed this afterwards by counting the time it took for me to move my head to see this - it was seven (7) seconds, and then it was gone.We rose early in the morning of Sunday January 30, 2000 about 5.15 am PST to see the last quarter of the moon and how close Venus was to it. Our property is in the north part of the city of Palm Springs - higher than the town itself, so there isn&apos;t light reflection from the city.  My partner went outside on to the patio and turned all the lights off.  After looking at the moon we then tilted our heads to look at the stars in the clear desert sky -it was exceptionally clear.  As I looked back to the east I saw two lights, very very high, moving very very fast and said to my partner - look at those lights, what&apos;s that?  The lights moved eastward and then after a few (maybe 5 seconds)seconds, zig zagged sharply to the left and then disappeared.  I was very careful to note the time and then timed the incident again by moving my head (I&apos;d previously timed it by saying one and two and - to get the seconds count.  I subsequently (during the day I timed a jet) and found that the jet was 5 times slower than what we had seen.  The lights moved together; they were tiny, almost pinpoint but the lights themselves were really bright even though small.  There was just one object even although we couldn&apos;t see any form. This incident took place at our weekend home in Palm Springs, CA.", "Craft a cross between Triangle/Chevron/Arrowhead/Diamond; clear, starry night; witnessed what I believe to be: quiet, low humming craft with 2 bright banks of lights, approximately 500-1000ft above ground, seemingly aboutI did not report this experience before, because I did not think anyone except my spouse would believe me.  I am a pragmatist, based in our known realities of scientifically proven facts, but what I saw was most tangibly real...even my dog stopped and looked up at this item.  I decided to report this today after reading about the police in southern Illinois who gave descriptions very similar to my own. At age 47, on or about the 15th of October, 1998, (may have been 10/10-10/27), I took our Cairn Terrier outside for her last &quot;potty break&quot; between 10:31 and 10:37 pm.  My spouse had gone to bed just minutes earlier.  It was a very mild, clear, star-filled evening.  As I stood looking at the beauty of the stars, facing a slight northwesterly direction, an enormous flying craft appeared--almost as if it had been &apos;Star Wars-like uncloaked&apos;. I was immediately struck by it&apos;s seeming closeness to the earth, it&apos;s relative silence, and it&apos;s almost COMICAL display of two huge single-row banks of lights on either side of it&apos;s triangularish front---it looked almost exactly like the row of lights on police cars in these colors: red, clear and blue.  My next thought was: &quot;well, if this is a secret USA project, they sure want to be seen!&quot;.  It was close enough for me to wonder if those inside would wave at me. As this object approached, I choose to stay and watch what would probably be a once-in-a-lifetime experience instead of getting a witness.  As this seemingly slow and quiet craft approached our property, I tried to gauge it based upon a 40-50 ft. tall pine tree in the next yard.   My mind was trying to move fast to get a size estimate.  With it&apos;s unusual shape, it was difficult.  Nor do I possess the advanced physics/mathematical skills to measure items based upon horizon/angle, etc.  To me: this item was rather symmetrical, i.e., width from widest point-to-widest-point appeared to be 150-200 feet; front-to-rear, perhaps 200-250 ft, based upon it&apos;s distance from the pine tree&apos;s top and width of view it took up in my line of vision.  Our city block is approximately 250 feet long, and each lot facing our street is 150 feet deep.  I believe this object, if on the ground, would have just about filled the property space of one-half of our entire block--perhaps more.  I remember won! dering why anything so huge would risk flying this low so near to 4 electric company smoke stacks located on the waterfront of our city. Description: first impression: a triangle.  When I was directly underneath it, my next impression was: pentagon with a flair; my last impression: pentagon with enough of a flair to be considered an arrowhead.  Rear of craft as it was flying SE, away from me over Lake Michigan: flat rear/slight sides to main body, just like the back end of an arrowhead. Other descriptive items:  as it passed over me, I thought I detected some type of circles on the bottom of the craft; the bottom of the craft was the darkest part of my visual experience.  As the craft first came toward me, I was fascinated by the banks of lights--what appeared to be rather halogenic red/clear/blue....but then I noticed that there was a beacon light on the top of the portruding &quot;cabin&quot;.  This craft DEFINITELY had a curved cabin with either windows or perhaps black reflective surfaces.  However, this cabin was NOT sharp-angled like the stealth bomber type.  This cabin seemed proportionate to the rest of the object, i.e., it was not a small bump in the middle of a disk.  This craft was not a &quot;thick&quot; craft...at least it did not appear so to me from the front/bottom/rear views I had of it as it almost silently cruised toward/over/away from me. Behavior of Craft:  seemingly &quot;slow cruising&quot;; it did a flat bank from it&apos;s more southerly direction of travel to a southeasterly direction and it did this RIGHT over my head, i.e.,our street runs perpendicular to lake michigan on a slight NE/SW angle, so when I was watching this craft go directly away from me after it passed overhead, it had to be traveling in a slight southeasterly direction over Lake Michigan (I believe a straight-line shot across Lake Michigan would have placed it in Indiana/Ohio eventually?--it did the bank directly over my head; at no time did this object exude any type of exhaust/exhaust noise--only a low humming.  We experience many helicopters flying overhead here.  If one takes a typical Flight-For-Life type helicopter on a scale of 1 to 10 for noise, with the helicopter&apos;s noise being a &quot;10&quot;, then this craft, many times the helicopter&apos;s size, was barely a &quot;1 to 2&quot; in noise level.  At one point, it felt as though I could almost reach out and touch, it! seemed so close to me. Other Characteristics:  Nothing struck me as it being &quot;out of this world wierd&quot; except it&apos;s enormous size and quiet functioning, and two bizarre banks of &quot;cop car gumball&quot; lights.  This object seemed to have a dull body surface in a darker color, i.e., it was not silver/white/red/blue/green/purple/orange, etc.  It was, perhaps gray/brown/black.", "Egg shaped silver object flying approximately 2000ft directly below a comercial airliner.On my break at work I was outside looking into the horizon and a comercial airliner caught my eye.

We went to get it, and noticed an unusually bright light.  We looked up and saw a strange, round yet triangle looking craft.  It moved low and fast, seeming to follow our street.  We decided to follow it though it was late.  We jogged half way down my street after it, then suddenly it stopped, hovered, and then blazed straight upwards into the sky and faded into the stars.  When we returned home and sneaked back into my window, I saw a few faint stars that seemed to move then disappear.I was having a sleep over with two of my friends to discuss the facts about a new club we wanted to make concerning that of, ironically enough for that night, UFO&apos;s.  We had all had our own experience in seeing such strange things and we highly believed in it.  The only thing is, all of us have one belief.  If they land, it will most likely be not to make peace and exchange happy little gifts to us, but to take earth.  But who&apos;s to say what?  We have many beliefs, one that might make this bringing together make a little more sense is that we believe that if we evolved to look like this, what&apos;s to say that aliens don&apos;t look like us and walk among us.  And if they were to try to take Earth, we all agreed, it would be through the back door.  Well, we were talking about other matters as I sat up on my windowsill.  my room faces the street so I can see the clear acre of land across the street.  My two friends were talking when I noticed a small light shine off of something across the street.  I had lost my necklace near there earlier that night when we had gone out on a walk.  I jumped out of my window (we live in a one story house) and walked across the street.  It was near midnight, I remember that much, and no one, almost no one, is awake at that time.  I picked up the small necklace and one of my friends brought up the obvious, how could it have glinted if we don&apos;t have streetlights?  None of the patio lights are bright enough to cast that much light to make this small object shine.  Call it hunch.  The moon was bright, but there was an iridescent light that seemed to shine besides that.  We didn&apos;t notice that till a little later, but at the same time, we all felt the hairs on the back of our neck stand on end.  We all looked up at the same time and saw it.  it was a triangular object, too big to be an airplane and not shaped like it at all.  It was a triangular shape, with no wings.  It was round though, no sharp edges.  It didn&apos;t have blinking lights, it just glowed.  the light was yellowish.  I mysel! f notice d what could have been a small, red light in the center but I didn&apos;t tell my friends. &quot;That&apos;s not a plane.&quot; 1 of my friends and I both said at the same time. &quot;Let&apos;s follow it.&quot; The other said.  We all agreed and began to jog after it.  we all realized it moved too slow to be an airplane.  We ended up walking, rather slowly mind you, just to follow it.  It seemed to follow the same path as our street, which confused all of us.  I think I was the only one who could really tear my gaze from the object to look over at my other friend with long hair.  Her hair stood up almost on end.  I looked back up at the object.  It was moving a little faster.  We jogged after it, then it stopped.  So did we.  It hovered there for a few seconds, then flew upwards fast and faded into the stars.  we realized we were halfway to the end of our street standing in the middle of desert.  we jogged back to my place and I prayed my Dad hadn&apos;t woken up at the sudden silence.  Luckily, I didn&apos;t hear my name being called.  As my first friend began to climb back into the window, I felt a weird feeling wash through me again.  I looked up.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but still... I stared up into the sky and saw a faint star off in the distance.  It had more stars around it like it was a galaxy, but the stars around the first seemed to move rather quickly.  I tugged on my friend&amp;#8217;s arm. &amp;#8220;Toto,&amp;#8221; I said, &amp;#8220;We ain&amp;#8217;t in Kansas anymore.&amp;#8221;  She looked at me weird and then I pointed up to the stars.  She strained her eyes then saw them.  My other friend did the same. &amp;#8220;Now all we need is the Leprechauns,&amp;#8221; One of them said.  I smiled and watched till they disappeared then we climbed back into my window. &amp;#8220;Well, this turned out to be a pretty awesome meeting.  Now all we need is some &amp;#8216;Take me with you&amp;#8217; signs, and we&amp;#8217;re all set up.&amp;#8221; I said. (On the bottom, I have checked that I would like to be contacted.  I&apos;m not to sure though.  My parents still don&apos;t know about that night. i would like to be called though.

Confirmed by FAA Low Flight Complaint office in Seattle.))From south facing window, witnessed two aircrafts heading north,  low and close together.  Each had two very bright headlights and they appeared to be flying one on top of the other. They passed over the house seemingly skimming the trees; it was then apparent that one was flying just behind and above the other. On the left underside of each were bright green letters and/or numbers, large enough to be read. There was a sound like an airplane, but not as loud as a jet that close. These crafts looked man-made, but I&apos;ve never seen this large of a craft fly so low, slow or close together. I almost grabbed my daughter and ran from the house because they were so low. There was a small airplane flying above and east of the crafts, heading the same direction.", "Driving on I-5 at night. A spherical object  the size of a bowling ball swooped down in front of the windshield from behind and to the right of us, hovered and rotated(or rolled in all directions). The sphere was a melty blue and green metallic object with a luster, and was about the size of a bowling ball.My best friend and I were returning to So. Cal from a short vacation up north for the 4th of July. At almost half past midnight, Saturday night going into Sunday morning, we were on I-5 almost to the summit of the Tehachapi mountains when a spherical object swooped down from behind and to the right of me (on the passenger side) and stopped directly in front of the drivers side windshield, some 18 inches or so out from the glass. Despite our speed of travel, the rotating sphere appeared to be absolutely still and stationary,except that it was rotating freely in a rolling motion going in all directions. The object was quite beautiful. It reminded me of perhaps a metal globe which had gotten melty, and the continents and oceans were all melting together. It was blue and green, with a luster, but I would not call it shiny, as it did not seem to reflect light the way we normally see a shiny object do. I do not have the English vacabulary to vividly describe what we saw, because we don&apos;t have movement and color exactly like that in everyday life. The sphere stayed  in front of the window for maybe 45-50 seconds and then took off. The take off was really nice to watch. It zipped laterally away from us for a moment, momentarily forming a sort of tail, like an elongated teardrop. It then paused for a second (maybe 50 yards ahead of us) and recollected into a perfect sphere, and then shot off much faster out ond up and was quickly lost from view. Two things awed me about the object; how it was able to exactly match our speed so as to appear suspended, and how we were able to see it so well as it was above the hood of the vehicle (a Toyota 4-Runner) and well out of the range of the headlights. I don&apos;t pretend to know what it was, but it was quite beautiful, and I&apos;m glad to have been able to observe it so closely, that had the windshield been absent, I could have leaned forward and touched it.", "J&apos;ai observer 3 objets (2 en forme triangles)(1 en forme de point)direction du nord-ouest vers l&apos;est.J&apos;aitait &agrave; cot&eacute; de ma voiture, j&apos;ai observer en premier lieu 2 objets en forme de triangles qui se dirigaient vers l&apos;est et un second objet en forme de point (&eacute;toile de couleur rouge)qui suivait les deux triangle.

It was approximately 1/4 the size of a city block in circumference (approximately 100&apos;).  As it traveled away we could see that it was soucer shape.  The craft had markings on the bottom, but I can not remember exactly what they looked like.  We could see the shape easily because of the reflection of the street lights and the clear starry night sky.  We watched it follow the street (due south) for approximately one quarter mile it cruised at a speed of approximately 20 mph, at which point it made an immediate change in direction to the southwest and shot out of the sky into the atmosphere within about a second.  There were no lights or sound.  It was mid week and no one else was around.  There was no traffic or other witnesses that we know of.  Neither of us has mentioned this or reported this information.

The lights were not very bright but easy to see in the dark sky. We walked from the garage to the front of the apartment and they seemed to follow us. Then, we went inside our house for about 10 minutes and then went back out to see if they were still there. We saw only one at this time circling alone above the garage. It could barely be seen. After about 10minutes, we went back inside. When I looked out the window all three lights came back and had moved once again toward the front of the apartment where my window was. There the three lights began circling and colliding again at regular patterns and intervals. Then after about 1hour, they disappeared from my view. It was too cold so i did not go out again to see where they were.

Again, I emphasize, this thing did not flicker at all, nor did it streak.", "We were traveling West to East on Pomerado Road. On my left side above the tree tops, a very large white bright light circular in shape caught my attention. It was approx. 1/2 the diameter of a pencil eraser in the sky and traveled North-East to South-West for a few seconds remaining constant in size and brillance then without diming was just gone. There wasn&apos;t a trail and it traveled upward diagonally not downward.One object seen on 11/27/99. While driving to friend of my daughters house. Area where sighting took place is about 2 miles from Miramar Military Base(Formerly known as the Top Gun location in San Diego.", "We witnessed 3 green and 1 pink light flying in formationWe witnessed 4 lights flying in formation in the West to East direction at about the same speed we were traveling at for about 1 min.

We have attempted to reconstruct it from the data in the original report.))", "Upon coming home one evening in the early spring, I saw in the eastern horizon three circular objects that looked like three full mooons. They were placed in a straight horizontal line in the sky. They stood still for several minutes.  I called for my Mother to come and see what I was witnessing.  she saw them too.  There was no sound, They were up in the sky several miles away.  (we lived at the tallest point on a street and could see across to the other hills.)The two outside &quot;moons&quot;  then moved into the center &quot;moon&quot;.  It did not grow any brighter or larger.  Suddenly, the &quot;moon&quot; disappeared entirely.Nothing more to add other than at the time this was in the same general direction of the greater pittsburgh airport.  There was absolutely no way these were aircraft as they stood perfectly still and shown like three full moons. They were about the size the moon would be as it rose in the horizon in the east.  That area was quite undeveloped back then. Lots of hills and valleys. sightings of ufo&apos;s were pretty common back when I was growing up though most people, my Mom included saw actual crafts.  These &quot;moons&quot; were the closest I ever got to seeing an actual ufo.", "red drifting light about 50 degrees in the western sky slowly drifting up and to the north would get very bright then fade but not pulsating finally disapering all togetherabout the 2ed week in oct 98 at aprx 7 pm I was riding in a golf cart at the hotel where I work when i noticed a bright glowing red light high in the western sky. so i parked and went around the back of the hotel and walked up a fire escape to get a better look. it was glowing bright red and about the size and brightness of venus or jupiter at there closesed approch. it seemed to be very high in alt and very far away. it was drifting very slowly up and to the north (i was looking west) it would get very bright and fade but not pulsating just kinda intermittently some times fading out compleatly for a few secs or fade to were it was barely visable and then slowly brightening again. i saw several aircraft flying nearby so i know they had to have seen it also. i observed the object for about 10 mins and finally walked down the fire escape to the side door of the giftshop and ask the cashier to come have a look at this. she and i watched for about 5 more mins and it finaly disipeared compleatly. we discused it for a few mins and i went back to the bellstand in front of the hotel. a few mins later 2 guys from housekeeping came by on there rounds and i was telling them what i had seen.  there imeadate reaction was &quot;it was a tower&quot;. i was telling them how high it was and what direction when one of them said  &quot;is that it?&quot; it was there again in the same part of the sky i had first seen it. so we went back around back (there is 2 doors leading throught a corodor that takes u from front to back where the gift shop and the proshop are located if u r wondering how we could get from front to back so quickly no lost time here LOL:) i got the cashier and we all 4 watched for about 5 mins. we all agreed it was very strange (except for 1 of the housemen he said it was an aircraft (hes not very bright) lol). about then i got a call on the radio so i had to leave. the cashier had customers so she had to go and one of the housemen said he didnt have time for this(guess witch one) but the other houseman told me later that he watched for about 5 more mins and it had drifted back up and to the south (we were looking west) and finaly faded out. the next morning it was reported on WLOS that a number of people from the leicster community (wnw of the hotel 5 to 10 miles away) had reported a bright glowing red light in the western sky. it was also reported that they had checked with asheville regonal airport controllers and nothing unusual was seen on radar. an astronomy professor from UNCA stated that was prob a star that sometimes glows red during that time of year.                                                                                     iv worked as a ((deleted)) there for about 6 years and iv lived in asheville for 32 years.  im very fimilar with the geography of the area and the numerous cellphone and communication towers on the surounding mountian tops. this was not a hotair balloon flying at night nor was it a star or any other posible explanition i can think of  any segustions?? Regards", "Incredibly close sighting in broad daylight.I am not sure of the year although it was sometime in the early 80&apos;s. I wish I had reported this then or made notes. Maybe this is the time? We were at a friends apartment in Mississauga near the QEW and Erin Mills Parkway. It was summer time in the afternoon. The skies were blue with little or no clouds. The apartment was fairly high up. 7-10 floors facing north. I was inside when my friends start to yell. I ran to the balcony. Standing on the balcony looking north, the Credit River to our right, runs from Lake Ontario behind us, north. In the distance we can see Erindale University. There Credit River forms a natural green belt. Not more than 2km&apos;s to our right, hovering slowly and quietly south down the Credit River about 500m above the ground was a saucer or disk shaped object (craft). There were no lights. I remember distinctly that it looked weathered. Rusty, brown, black. It looked like it had been exposed to the elements. I would estimate that it would have been 200m from end to end. Fairly low profile compared to the size.  The craft continued to slowly hover south for approximately 45 seconds. It was hard to tell if it was spinning. It then stop for 15 seconds. It rose instantly about 500-1000m straight up. Stop briefly then appeared to take off south and vanish again silently. I do not believe any of my friends that were there that day ever reported their sightings. I looked for other reports in the papers for a couple of weeks, but never read or heard of another sighting of this object. This experience has effected the way that I live my life.

Brilliant white lights around it with intense red light on top.It was an artic January night when my husband and I were going to a relative&apos;s house.  We were getting into our car when my husband noticed this object in the woods across from our driveway.  It was hidden behind the trees at first, then it came above the tree tops.  It was enormous!  It was oval shaped with huge white lights around the perimeter of the craft.  Including red and white lights on the bottom of the craft.  There was an unusual brilliant red light on top of the craft, it was a blood red color, very strange!  The craft darted up and down through the trees within seconds then all of a sudden the craft shot up over to the west and disappeared.  We were both terrified!  There has been alot of UFO activity especially in this area for the past 4 years, but this by far, was the closest and scariest encounter we have had!  There was no noise from the craft, but the strangest thing of all was when it was darting over the trees, my husband called out &quot;come closer so I can get a good look at you&quot; and it would come closer!!

It also was seen to blink out after a couple of minuets.My friend, my wife and a physician from the local hospital were looking at the Leonids when we saw a hot pink ball of light above the tree tops to the south west rise up and zig-zag across the sky.  We watched for about a minuet or two and it to blinked out of sight in the middle of the sky like the first sighting earlier that evening.  This sighting occurred approximately three hours and some odd minuets after the first sighting which we phoned in.  The difference in this sighting is we had more witnesses this time.  The physician has a good knowledge of the stars and was at a loss for words about the sighting.  It was almost as if he didn&apos;t want to believe what he saw.", "n amber colored star. It moved under a lot of clouds often seeming to stop cmpletely or to &apos;bob&apos; up and down. Thank You.It was New Years Eve 1999. My sister and her husband were lighting firecrackers outside.  this was nearing 12;00 a.m. My sister came to my door to say&quot;you have to see this&quot; I went outside not knowing what to expect and what I saw was a beautiful Amber colored light.  It was a very sweet, deep color and it looked like a star, except that it was moving,not datring across the sky l;ike a shooting star.  This  &quot;star&quot;  had a very deliberate motion.  It move continuously west to east,but not always in a astraight line.  It would periodically &quot;bob&quot; up and down.

My wife thought it was a disc, but I can&apos;t say, I&apos;m not sure. It appearted illuminated by the setting sun. I did not see any aircraft lights. I have never seen anything like it.

As young boy playing outside, seen 2 silver round crafts high in the sky, being chased by 2 fighter jets.I was born on March 27, 1959 I cannot remember the exact date, between 1970-1972, I was between the ages of 11 -13. My cousin and I were playing on some foam filled mesh bags, used by pole vaulters, at the local high school football field. It was in the afternoon, a warn partly cloudy day. If I would not have been looking at the sky at the exact time I did I would not have seen them. Laying on my back looking at the clouds ( day dreaming) I seen 2 silver objects, side by side, coming out of this one cloud. At first I thought they were planes? But then I noticed they were round (no wings). So then I thought they were so high in the sky that they appeared round, still thinking they were planes. Then I thought if they were that high in the sky, would they not have vapor trails? Still watching them slowly cross the sky, I got my answer!  Out of the same cloud they had came out of were 2 fighter F4&apos;s (I think) chasing them!  At that time I thought WAIT A MINUTE THOSE ARE AIRPLANES, WHAT ARE THE OTHER 2 ?!!!  I continued to watch as the 2 silver round objects entered another cloud, with the 2 jets following behind them. They both disappeared into the same cloud. Not really understanding what I had seen I rolled over to ask my cousin if he had seen this? He was looking at another part of the sky, and did not see it. Rolling back over and tring to find the exact place they had entered the cloud I seen the same 2 jets flying back out of the cloud the same spot the entered it, heading in the exact opposite direction, as if they lost the 2 silver round crafts in the cloud and were now heading home. I took me 25 years to realize how important this sighting was, to me. I always remembered it but never really thought about the importance of it. I have always been fascinated with ufo&apos;s in fact the reason my Mom said I did not do well in school ( at that time) was I was always thinking about ufo&apos;s and Star Trek !!!!! I also have another sighting I think I witness but I cant remember it?  But I know it happened! And another time I woke to find 2 ceatures standing beside my bed ( I think? or was it a dream ?) It seem every time I read one of&quot; Whitley Strieber&apos;s&quot;  books I have strange things happen !!!

It sounded like it could have been a half a block away. The sound occurred just after I had seen a &quot;shooting star&quot; pass overhead from the south traveling north. The sound continued for about a minute and I looked up in the direction of the sound to see a chevron-shaped, pale blue-ish lit object passing overhead. It was traveling at a great rate of speed with the sound accompanying it, in the same south to north direction as the &quot;shooting star&quot;. Then in the blink of an eye it and the sound disappeared.  It was chevron-shaped with individual pale blue or ultra-violet lights in precise and equal distance from one another forming the sides of the chevron.  It was either one unit or several smaller units moving in absolute, precise unison with each other. I couldn&apos;t tell how high or how big it was, but I could hear the pulsating sound with it as it passed overhead, so it couldn&apos;t have been out of audio range and deducing from that it must have been pretty big. There was about seven lights in all.  I&apos;m 48, a single female, I have a MFA from the Univ. of Alaska.  I don&apos;t have any particular interest in UFO&apos;s and have never had any previous experience or &quot;sightings&quot;.  I don&apos;t have much of a scientific/mathematical background and my interests have usually been more of an artistic/creative nature. I just happened to be out walking to my motor home on some friends&apos; property that night and saw what I saw. What prompted me to file this report is: I saw an article in the Everett Herald (Wed. Jan 19th, 2000)about sightings in SE Illinois that fit the description of the object I saw this last August. You can contact me if you want.", "I was only six, but I was playing jacks in front of my home, I looked up at the ball, and there they were..no noise..I know now, they were traveling in a southeast direction..I can&apos;t remember what they looked like, only they were not airplanes or helicopters..It might be accociated with the Roswell incident...I can&apos;t remember what they looked like, it bothers me today..I couldn&apos;t get my mother to come and look.  It happened in the evening, it must have been warm weather, because I was playing Jacks outside, if it was daylight savings time, it could have been as late as 8:00 pm.  THey were in formation and made no noise.  The only reason I saw them is because I looked up at the little ball I was playing with. This happened in 1947..((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At appox.6: 02 PM I went out back into her small yard to have a cigarette (she doesn&apos;t like the smoking inside). About a minute or two passed when I thought I saw movement in the sky (It was mostly dark with indirect distant light from further down the street, the sky was devoid of any clouds, only stars were visible) I looked up quickly I moved further into the yard to see what it was when I saw these three rectangular objects moving in tandem. They were not like anything I ever saw in my entire lifetime. They were moving at a quicker pace (based on their approximate altitude I would estimate much faster than any commercial or non-commercial aircraft I have ever seen. They glowed with a subtle consistent amber color, rectangular in shape but with smooth edges. I followed them without a blink for about 6 seconds before they went out of view over the rooftop. When I first saw them they were in tandem, before they went out of view the were going out of tandem. Needless to say i was stunned but excited. Before I went back into the house I just reaffirmed to my self that I really saw this and did not imagine it. That only took about a second.", "Awakened by flood of light through bedroom window.This may seem silly, especially since my usually acute memory has failed me re. date and time. I was sleeping with both my children who had come into my bed. My husband had fallen asleep in our basement rec room. There are two windows on either side of my bed at the head. There is another window on the oppisite wall. The light entered only through one window, one that flanks the headboard. This would be Northeasterly. I was sleeping and awoke by a flood of light on one side of the bedroom that shone onto my daughter, the bedside table and the whole side of the room. I felt that it shone directly in my face, which was what awoke me. I remember wondering if a helicopter was searching for someone, but I couldn&apos;t hear anything that sounded like a helicopter. I may have heard a buzzing sound but I am not even certain of this as I was half asleep and confused by the intensity of the light. I looked at the clock and remember thinking that it was still early and I couldn&apos;t have been sleeping all that long. I believe it was a little before midnight. I kept thinking that this must be a huge spotlight and couldn&apos;t figure where it came from. I still thought that it was police or something. What didn&apos;t make sense then or now, was that the light was shining down into my second story room, not up. It definitely was from above and I continued to listen for helicopter sounds. Then suddenly it was gone. I went back to sleep and figured my neighbors would tell me if something had happened. I mentioned it to a few people including my husband and kids but no one heard or saw anything. I know I wasn&apos;t dreaming but don&apos;t know anything else for sure.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

The object did not emit noise. I went back in the house. Then the object shot down a blue beam of light down from the craft. The object itself was a white light. It did not pulsate.After it shot the blue beam down it moved very slowly back toward the north.", "I was pulled off the road(rt.80). Fighting sleep what i saw was as in a dream. I was pulled from the cab of my truck. Bright light all around. Max of 8 shapes around me. I fought for a pistol under my seat.As ststed above I was driving truck, got real sleepy all of a sudden. Pulled my truck over and layed across the full seat. It was as if only a few min. went by. all of at once the cab of the truck filled with a very bright light. I kept a pistol under my seat because I carried a valuble cargo. ( McIntosh Stereo Equipment) I strained very hard to reach it but was moving in very slow motion. One strange thing to all this is my eyes would not open no matter how hared I tried. This seems like it just happened to me no matter when I think of this or tell some one it never changes its always the same. There were at least 8 figures outside the trck looking in. Next thing Iremeber is having the same figures around me on some type of flate surface. I still kept fighting to open my eyes, but couldn&apos;t. I dont have anyother remberance of that the moment. For several years after tha I would get a burning in the back of my head. It stopped for a long time then once in 1990 it came back for about a week and then it was gone. This all happened over25 years ago but it still is on my mind. I was your web page and thought it was time to tell it to some one that might take it seriously. The one real noticible change to me is after that had happened I am very emotional and cant seem to get a handle on it at all. Thanks for your time.

We got out our telescope out and realized it was something we had never seen before. Electrically charged we could tell, very colorful straight out of Star Trec looking thing. Never lost it&apos;s line shape, traveled at speeds no plane could and changed colors often. We watched for hours and could not figure out what it was any ideas?

Just before returning into the house I looked straight up overhead and saw what looked like a red &quot;smear&quot; of light, moving South.  I pointed it out to my wife who stood and watched it with me.  At first we thought it might be a shooting star, or after we noticed that the light remained constant, we thought it was a piece of &quot;space junk&quot;, but we thought it was too large for that.  Also, it appeared to us that it was &quot;wavering&quot; a bit on it&apos;s path, not going in exactly a straight line.  As it approached the Southern horizon, it made a sharp right turn, heading West, for approximately 10 seconds, then stopped and sort of &quot;looped&quot; back to the East disappearing.  I mentioned this event the next morning on my local radio show, and received a phone call from someone claiming to be an Air Traffic Controller at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, who said they had picked it up on their radar, could not explain it, and had turned the tapes over to &quot;the authorities&quot;  When I asked him who he meant by &quot;authorities&quot; he said the FAA.", "l large triangular object reported on our ten oclock news. Also their broadcast showed excellent footage of the craft. We called the station (WQAD in Moline, IL) and learned the cameraman works for them. He will call us with more info.

Will send more information after we speak to photographer(he has no phone at home.)", "Appeared to be a star moving at great speed, breaking up, disappearing then reappearing in another location.  Very erratic behavior.While parked at a dead end street with a couple of friends I observed what appeared to be a star moving slowly accross the west northwestern night sky.  I thought it to be only an airplane and didn&apos;t think anything else about it. The following is my recollection of the objects relative position, distance, movement, speed, shape and size elevation: 45 degrees distance:  unknown movement:  approximately 45 degrees left and right of center. shape:     round light size:      alternated from a pinhead to a dime at arms length. As mentioned above I really thought this was only an aircraft as we have heavy air traffic in the Wash. D.C. area.  This point of light however would move from it&apos;s central position approximately 20 degrees north or south then return to the exact same spot.  I watched this and said nothing to my friends as I still thought this was an aircraft of some sort.  Suddenly this point of light moved at incredible speed and stopped instantly in a new position and just as quickly returned to it&apos;s exact original location.  I grew up the son of an Air Force pilot and have a very good grasp of what various aircraft can and cannot do. (I since have become a private pilot)  This thing is moving like nothing I have ever seen.  I finally ask my friends if they see this funny light.  They both responded yes and that they too have been watching it.  So now there are three people seeing it do the same thing at the same time.  We got out of the car to get a clearer view and for the next forty five minutes watced in amazement at what happened next. This &quot;star&quot; would shoot accross he sky in all directions and return to the same point as stated earlier however now it would take up a new position and begin to pulsate and grow/shrink in size.  Then, in one of it&apos;s hyper speed moves it seemed to blow apart and leave glowing fragments in it&apos;s wake.  These fragments would then move in various directions then rejoin the main &quot;star&quot; Then it would completely disappear.  After about five seconds it reappeared in yes, exactly the same begining position!  It did this several times in all directions and as always, would reappear in it&apos;s starting position.  At one point it remained motionless while it pulsated and began to grow in size.  Within ten seconds it exploded with fragments going in all directions.  This time it and the fragments disappeared right after this explosion only to reappear in another part of the sky. This behavior went on for approximately forty five minutes before the &quot;star&quot; began to move off and finally could no longer be seen. To better envision what we saw and it&apos;s relation to the sky, try this, take a piece of letter size paper.  This represents that portion of the sky the object moved in.  Now draw a dot about the size of a pinhead in the center of the paper.  This represents the object. If you place your pencil on the dot and draw a straight line about four or five inches in any direction as fast as you can you can get an idea of it&apos;s relative speed. Even though many years have passed since this incident, it remains clear in my mind.  I believe this is due to the spectacular way in which this object moved and the fact that two other people saw it perform the same maneuvers, at the same time, as myself. I know this information may be dated.  The only reason I am reporting this is because of an episode of Sightings I watched this week in which they reported on what they referred to as &quot;Cluster UFO&apos;s&quot; and how rare  they are supposed to be. If I can be of any assistance feel free to contact me. Thanks,  ((name deleted))", "I was coming home at aproximately 10:25 on Bellevue Highway in Eaton county at the southeastern tip of the county where the southwestern tip for ingham county begins. As I crossed over the county line I saw an object in the sky.As I crossed the county line I saw what appeared to be two blue lights in the sky to my left. At first I dismissed them as an airplane, but apon closer observation it did not appear to be lights to an air plane. It seemed to be moving to slow, and the wingspan seemed a lot bigger than any airplane I had ever seen. The two blue lights were on both ends of the object. I proceeded down the road watching this object in the sky. It came from the southwest out of Jackson county. This area is farm and woods, within a few miles of a tri county junction. Eaton,  Ingham, and Jackson Counties all come together in this area. It came in from Jackson County in the southwest sky. Slowly moved in at about 25-30 miles an hour. I watched and tried to figure out what it was. I then thought it looked like a helicopter, carrying some kind of lighted shaft or tube. similar to what is used for major construction for setting or carrying posts.  but I had never seen one at night and no post I had ever seen had lights on it.As I approached tucker road it was just starting to clear some trees and coming across an open field. I noticed it was moving very slow and was only about 35-40 feet above the tops of the trees. I was driving by the open field whatching and saw that it was not a Helicopter but it appeared to be one solid peice as though the shaft or tube was not being carried but was actually part of the object. it was about as wide as an airplaine is long but skinny in the middle. It did not move straight through the air but actually sideways.  From looking at it from underneath of it was shaped like a crooked star. Realy long sideways  but all ends pointed with a tube sticking out of the middle pointing at the ground. At the top of it it seemed to be a dome type lid that was poited ontop. It actually resembled a cigar tube that was pointed on each end, that had some kind of tube or shaft on the bottom and had apointed dome shaped top. It had a light on the top of it that resembled a search light but it did not point in any! one dir ection it seemed to be cicling the top and wasnt like a spot light, it just seemed to glow bright. On the bottom shaft that pointed at the ground there were blue and white lights that appeared to be stationary and did not move. however on the side of the object there was a very bright red light thatmoved from bottom of the center pieceto the bottom of toppiece it would move up disapear reapear on the bottom move up and disapear and continued doing so for the entire time I whatched it. I was able to get a very good look at the object since it flew directly above the hood of my car. It floated slowly across a field to the right of me. It headed toward Ingham county on a direct path. By this time I had already stopped the car. I rolled down the window andbrought half my body out of the driver side window and looked across the roof of the car and watched as it flew past the next tree line. I never heard an engine or anythin coming from the object. I have a very quite car and that was all I could hear everything was practically silent. I got back in and started driving slowly owards home going farther into eaton county as it made its way into ingham. I contimplated since it was moving so slow to turn back around and follow it but when I  turned around to look at it again it was gone.", "I was lifeguarding at a local pool when i looked up to the sky because it was a pretty sunset when i saw somthing move from behind a large cloud then return.It looked like the video from Mexico on newyears when all those people saw objects in the sky.It was white and i thought it had wings at first because the white part moved like it was not solid.It did not resemble any aircraft i have ever seen.I was lookinhg up at the sky when a object that look like the film from Mexico that showed a white object move from behind a cloud then return behind the cloud.It had the exact same movement pattern as the object from the tape.I thought it was just a trick of light or something until I saw the film on Sightings that lokked exactly like what i saw", "I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d call it a CRAFT, but I saw 5 or 6 extremely bright white balls of light clustered together, with red/orange/purple-blue trails arcing behind themI was standing outside, about 7pm. Out of the corner of my eye, an extremely bright light in the sky caught my eye. I turned to look, and saw 5 or 6 very large balls of light in the sky. The moon was full and I had the porch lights on, but the balls of light were highly visible. They were as bright, if not brighter than the moon. What was remarkable, to me, was their size. They looked like baseballs, compared to the other stars in the sky. The main one was about the size of half the moon.  They seemed to travel in a cluster, but not necessarily at the same rate of speed, but it may have just been my perspective. I said &quot;oh my god!&quot; and ran along the deck of the house to keep it in view as it went behind a tree.  There was a trail arcing behind the cluster, each ball had it&apos;s own trail and they merged into one tapering trail. This trail was very colorful, starting with a green, then red, orange, then sort of purpleyblue. It was beautiful, and I&apos;ve never seen anything like it before. It arched across the sky and was visible for about 30 seconds, maybe less, and then suddenly disappeared.  The tail didn&apos;t linger after the balls of light went out. I called a friend who is &quot;into&quot; astronomy and he said it was probably a bolide. I looked up &quot;bolide&quot; on the Web, but none of the picures of bolides looked anything like what I saw. This was very crisp and clear, my first thought was that it looked incandescent and like someone had drawn it in the sky, like a cartoon.  I watched the news to see if anyone had reported it (actually I thought it was probably part of the Leonids, even tho it was earlier in the night than the Leonids were expected) but I didn&apos;t see anything on the news, so I thought I was the only one who saw it. I told my cousin about it - she lives in Cadillac MI, and she had seen it too! She told me about your web site, where I saw the request for people who had seen this to fill out a report. It was eerie because the event was totally silent.", "Northern angle of sight 30-45 degree angle from ground Bright light came down zig zaged then straight down and fizzeled out.

It went from horizon to horizon traveling from west to east - the exact opposite direction from which the anticipated Leonid Meteor Shower was to occur. I did not actually time it, but I believe that it was visible between a minute and a half and two minutes--long enough for me to study it as it traversed the sky. As the fireball crossed the sky, it gave off several very bright colors that appeared to be a metallic disintegration or burning. It was glowing predominantly white on the leading edge with blue just behind the white. In my mind, the blue indicated that a copper compound or copper substance was involved. There was some red and yellow as well, and as I observed it, I could clearly see chunks coming off it and burning up in the same manner as the main fireball. It left a smoke trail, but I did not hear a sonic boom as I expected that I might. My first thought was that I was witnessing the reentry of the MIR space station, or something similar in nature. It did NOT appear to be an intelligently controlled craft--unless it was a craft in great distress. It would be difficult to say exactly what I saw.  However, I do know that what I saw was NOT a meteor, and clearly NOT associated with the anticipated Leonid Meteor Shower. I have been watching meteor showers for over forty years now and I know exactly what a meteor looks like.  I am appalled that the news media was so quick to report that this event was part of the anticipated Leonid Meteor Shower.  That was clearly NOT what I witnessed. I have been a pilot since I was in my teens and spent four years as an air traffic controller for the FAA.  I am also an amateur astronomer and I feel very comfortable about recognizing and identifying anything that appears in the sky.", "I was flying home alone from a family ski-ing trip when the sighting occurred. It was a small plane and the seat next to me was empty. To begin with I thought it was a cloud but I was puzzled as to the appearance of a strange brownish cloud amid white ones. We got closer and then I noticed it had a shimmerring quality. It was very similar to the traditional shape of a UFO but it was as if the contours were shimmering along with the craft and the edges were shifting almost. There was no one sitting behind me either, the hostesses were at the back and I looked to see if any one else was looking. They were not so I closed the window shutter to test my own eyes. When I re-opened the shutter it was still there. Ithought it must be a UFO and I remembered that I had heard that they should spin. Even at that moment I could discern a very subtle spinning. At one point it reached out an angular arm and folded it gracefully back in. Eventually we flew past. I was amazed and somehow uplifted. It was beautiful and almost spiritual somehow. My mother does not believe me and attributes it to me being on anti-depressants and although I understand her concern I cannot believe that I imagined it just because I am depressed.Sorry, I have given most of the information above. Apart from the moving arm it did nothing but hover. Colour chance happened extremely subtly and moved from brown to silver to a purplish hue. It was sort of a saucer shape but the form too had a shifting quality that was not easily discernible.

It was early evening and I said to myself that perhaps its a ballon.  I looked just above the object, but there were several stars above the object. I left and went into the barracks. Several months later I took a course in communications.  The person teaching the course used the UFO as an example of an incident that percipitated the use of a &quot;Flash priority&quot; message to the Pentagon. He stated that flash priority is used only in cases of national emergency and that it was the first time that flash priority had been used at Ramey AFB since WWII.  It is my understanding that aircraft, in this case the B-36 had not been able to land and aircraft had been diverted to LA. The person giving the course did not explain.  He talked about it as if everyone in the class was familiar with the incident.  I take from that that the whole base was familiar with this UFO.

(I was talking to my boyfriend on my cell phone as well.) I saw 5 balls of light total, 2-3 much brighter than an average falling star. I&apos;d say that in comparison to the brightest star in the sky, the size was perhaps 4 to 5 times larger as well as brighter. They were moving VERY slow, almost hovering. All 5 were very close together and they never strayed from each other. I kept saying &quot;Wow! wow! wow!&quot; to my boyfriend the whole time, thinking that I was witnessing a meteor shower (I&apos;ve never seen one before). They didn&apos;t seem to fade away until about 25-30 later. They were yellow in color with no tail. I kept looking up in the sky after that, but I didn&apos;t see anything.

From underneath it appeared to be triangular with lights around the base with a vapor trail behind.I was getting ready to go to bed.

However, it did not appear to be moving. I didn&apos;t pay too much attention to it until I decided to get my telescope to look at it closer. But my telescope was too high to look at it through my front windows, so I took it off the tripod. It took a little while as the lights were off. When I looked back up the object was gone. I went to the doorway at the east side of the house and saw the object from underneath. I then realised that the object was triangular in shape with lights around the base and a trail, like that of a comet, at the rear. I could only see it from the door for a short time as there is a roof that obstructed the view. I moved to the back of the house to once again see it. I then went to wake my husband to have him see it. I thought that it may have been the space shuttle, but didn&apos;t think it would be flying that low.

During a period of approximately two hours we watched this &quot;cluster&quot; move around in the sky.A group of at least six lights caught our attention because of their spacing.  They were very close together but initially appeared to be a star constellation.  After close observation we noticed that the lights were moving.  They would move one direction than another direction.  Their movement was very erratic at certain times.  They appeared to be traveling in unison.  Occasionally other lights would shoot out from the area of the lights.  This light would streak across the sky very faintly similar to the meteors but much fainter.  It was hard to distinguish if the six lights were one object or six different objects.  Occasionally the six lights would move so fast it would leave a streak or tail.

From the passenger&apos;s point of view, it descended then accelerated parallel to the ground away from us fading from view. The light was huge, spherical, brilliant and white and would have measured 1/4 inch diameter at arm&apos;s length. I have watched the Leonid showers twice now, last year I counted 110 meterors in one hour, this year only 30 but with a spectacular finale. I can say for certain that this ball of white light did not resemble any of the 150+ meteors I have observed. It did not resemble the commet I saw several years ago, or any object I have ever seen. It traveled at the speed a blue angel would travel during an air show in a dive toward the ground. It&apos;s speed was not as fast as the meterors I have watched. It was also huge in comparison to the meterors I have seen. Unlike the meterors, there was no trail of debris behind it. The passenger described the light as having a metallic look after it dimmed and thought it was some sort of craft which accelerated away from us but I can&apos;t confirm that observation as I was also watching for cattle on the open range; having previously come upon a group of cattle standing in the middle of the road.

About 5 miles out of Clines Corners, NM is when we noticed the lights. At 3:00am, I noticed a bright blue thin-&quot;beam&quot; coming out of the southwest. I only saw one flash at first and dismissed it as a spotlight coming from Albuquerque. Shortly after that, the beams retured this time shooting rapidly several times. It seemed at first to be shooting from the ground to the sky. I was shocked and asked my cousin who was driving to look out my window. He was skeptical at first but was also shocked when he witnessed the lights. Around 3:10am, the &quot;beams&quot; stopped for about a minute. We thought it was over with, when all of a sudden the blue beams were back but this time almost directly in front of us to the southeast. They continued for about 5 minutes, shooting rapidly from the ground and sky. Then they stopped again for another minute and started up again in the southwest this time. This lasted approximately another 5 minutes, and stopped for good. It ended around 3:20am. I know for sure of two witnesses, those being myself and my cousin. As we were driving though, I noticed several of the truckdrivers looking out their windows and slowing down to observe the lights as well.

One thing, there was low cloud cover on both days so when ever there are low clouds I get scared.", "VERY HIGH IN THE SKY I SAW STRANGE LIGHTS HOVER FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES THEN HEAD TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST AT A GOOD SPEED, IFOLLOWED BUT LOST ITMY WIFE AND I WERE DRIVING WHEN WE NOTICE STRANGE LIGHTS I STOPPED AND GOT OUT OF THE CAR, IN A DARK PARKING LOT WERE THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO HOVER FOR ABOUT 10-15 MINUTES OR MORE..THEN PROCEEDED TO HEAD SOUTHWEST AT A GREAT SPEED. I DID HAVE A CAMERA IN THE CAR BUT I THINK THE OBJECT I PHOTOGRAPHED WAS TO FAR AWAY TO SEE ON FILM.( I WILL DEVELOP THE FILM SOON)", "At 10:15 PM a bright shining object was seen ,low in the sky,hovering,going back and forth,and then slowly flying away.It was shining in a twinkling fashion like an extremely bright star but very close.Same as above.The background was black sky.It was witnessed by my wife and myself.", "Light in N/NE sky headed S/SW-VERY HIGH UP in atmosphere...had appearance of a star, moving relatively slowly and straight (much like an airplane), but descended for a time then doubled speed and ascended upward until out of sight. No sound, no additional lights as angle changed.I never thought I would contact you twice in one week(I called about a 2nd-hand report of a blue light over Atlanta earlier in the week.) I am not what you would call a &quot;trained observer,&quot; but I am familiar with the basic characteristics of known conventional aircraft and flight, and I can tell when something is &quot;out-of-the-ordinary&quot;. I am a very poor judge of height/distances/size, etc., but I am good with spatial relationships and observe things from that perspective. I have the benefit of a college education and have a critical and questioning mind. If this was indeed a sighting of a non-human or non-manmade craft, then it was VERY SUBTLE. It was about 5:45 A.M., and I had just returned home from work (I work at night), and was out walking my dog, who often stops and sits down in the driveway if she feels we have not spent enough time outside, so I was standing there with her and star gazing. I turned and faced North looking at a group of stars in the Northern sky (I do not know which constellation) when I noticed one of them (what I first thought was a star) was moving. This star-like light was EXTREMELY high up, to the extent that it looked about the same size and brightness as the stars behind it. It was moving in a straight path at a fairly slow speed, much like what you would expect to see from a regular airplane(in other words, no abrupt movements or turns, etc.) At first, I began thinking about what it could be, perhaps an airliner VERY high up, a satellite (seemed too fast for that), or some other type of spacecraft (I am uninformed about what is up there in orbit right now). As I stared at it, however, it slightly veered off its straight course and began moving more in line with my line of sight/where I was standing, and was getting brighter. After a minute or so, I could tell that it was getting brighter because it was descending. It was a very cold and perfectly clear night, so I had a ski-cap and coat hood over my head, so I began taking everything off to listen for a sound, and there was none. As the light began approaching the point of being overhead, and since it had veered off course slightly, I figured that as it passed, I would be able to see additional or blinking lights if it was a standard airplane, and at the very least I would hear a sound as it passed overhead, neither of which happened. The light, though brighter, maintained its basic appearance of a white, star-like light. As it got closer it seemed to level-off, but was still very high, and I got the feeling that it was coming down to look at or look for something (monitoring/patrolling?). At this point, I thought it might be a morning traffic or news chopper, but that was highly inconsistent with its original altitude when I first saw it. After about 30 seconds of flying at this height/speed, it seemed to increase its speed to what was approximately double its original speed, veered back left to its original path, and began to ascend rapidly. This is where I began to feel funny about this object, as its ascension seemed to cover an extreme vertical distance in a relatively short amount of time, which seemed like highly unlikely behavior from any type of conventional aircraft. Again, this with NO SOUND and NO ADDITIONAL LIGHTS-by this time it had already passed overhead, and there should have been some defining features if it had been a conventional airplane. As the light continued to traverse the sky, it was obviously climbing faster than it was moving horizontally, because it got so high that I could not see it anymore looking straight on. I offset my eyes slightly and continued tracking the light in my periphery, but after a about 60 seconds of this, it was completely out of view (UPWARDS, NOT ON THE HORIZON). In other words, it went so high up that it was no longer visible, and never fully traversed the entire skyscape from horizon-to-horizon. At this point, I had a very odd feeling about what I had just seen. Although it was not very dramatic, just the basic behavior of this &quot;object&quot; did not, in my mind, conform to any behavior, attitude, or flight plan that would be expected from any type of aircraft in near-space or in orbit. It seemed that the ascension (and as I later concluded, the first descension) was just too extreme for a conventional aircraft. Adding to that the missing sounds/additional lights that accompany traditional craft, it added up to be a very unusual sighting. Plus, I just felt strange after seeing it.", "Boomerang with 6 lights passed directly over my head.I stepped out on my front lawn and looked up. At that moment, I saw a boomerang with 3 lights evenly spaced on each wing. It went quickly from exactly west to east. It was totally silent. The lights were white. I could see the outline of it against the sky. It had a bit of a rectangular look to it, very symmetrical. It was like nothing I ever saw, and I&apos;m certain it was not a man-made machine. It was about the size of an index finger held at arm&apos;s length. 10 seconds, and it was gone. I&apos;m still amazed at what I saw.", "I have been watching these contrails left by planes all year but I observed something strange.  The contrails left a haze over sky and a plane was leaving a trail from north to south.   The plane was almost out of sight and at this time a silver object flew through this trail flying west to east.   This object had nothing on it except its disk shape and silver in color.  I did not hear any noise.", "Sitting on backporch, looking at sky, smoking cigarette when an orange light in the sky caught my attention...I was sitting on the backporch, looking at the sky, smoking a cigarette when an orange light in the sky caught my attention. At first I thought it was a comet or meteor, even a plane crashing. I called to my roommate to come outside and look. She thought it might be a flock of geese. Then we got a good look at it, but we both saw it differently. I saw a boomerang shaped obect, the struture glowing orange with two round white lights at the tip of each end and no light at the front. She saw it as a series of orange lights defining the shape as a boomerang. She did not see the white lights. The first time we saw it, it was very high in the sky, it came from the south and flew east. When I first saw it, it was moving very slowly, then it darted behind trees to the east. We both lost sight of it. Then it reappeared maybe 1-3 minutes later.  We don&apos;t know for sure what direction it came from the second time, it was just there. It appeared to be closer and larger the second time. It also appeared to be going back in the same direction it came from. We dont remember what happened to it, where it went the second time, it seemed to dissappear, but it could have been obscured by the light haze in the distance.  After we lost sight of it, a flock of geese did fly by and we could compare the object and its movemnet to the geese. It was definately not geese! We did not hear any sound either time. We are both students at the University of Missouri, Columbia. (Uploaded by investigator)", "Saw a bright red pulsing light hovering in the distance.  Turned off on a dirt side road to see if we could get closer to it.It was 11:00 pm and we were going home from a class reunion. We were between Bridgeport and Grand Coulee Wa and had come over a hill and in the distance saw a pulsating bright red light. It was hovering about a hundred feet off of the ground. I saw it first and asked my wife what is was. She said it was an airplane. I replied that it was no airplane. It was just a light about the same color as a red strobe on an airplane but it was not blinking like a strobe light. It was more like a slow pulsating light that would go from dim to bright in a slow pulse. We turned off on an improved dirt road that led towards the object so we could get a closer look at it. It was hovering over a large set of power lines that transmits power from Grand Coulee Dam. It let us get within 200 yards of it, maybe less, and it took off. It stayed at that distance in front of us matching my speed exactly. I sped up as fast as I felt was safe on a dirt road and it would speed up accordingly. We chased it for about three miles trying to get closer to it. It crossed the road and went out over a wheat field away from the road so I stopped at the point that it crossed the road. As soon as I stopped it stopped. I rolled down my window to see if I could hear it making any noises. The only noise that I heard was the sound of crickets. I sat there wondering what to do next as it was just hovering there. My 13 year old daughter was very frightened at this point as we were out in the middle of nowhere with no lights or houses and she had seen movies about alien abductions. I had been out in this area many times before so I new the way the road went. It wound around the back side of where the object was hovering. I thought that if I took off quickly and got around the other side of it that maybe we could see the shape of it as it passed overhead. I started up the car and took off quickly. The object took off at the same time and ended up passing over the road way ahead of me. It evidently was tired of the cat and mouse game at this point and traveled faster than it had before. The last we saw of it it was streaking north at a great rate of speed.", "I saw a four foot wide, moving, circular patch of road which was devoid of rain in a driving storm.I&apos;m a college English Instructor now. At the time of this incident, I was working as a receptionist for a law firm, and I was thirty years old. I grew up in North Carolina, and I am very familiar with our weather and our roads. I&apos;ve always considered myself to be open-minded, but at the time that this occured, I was very skeptical of ufo sightings. It was about 8:30 p.m. on a Sunday. My former wife and I were leaving town after visiting my grandparents. It was raining especially hard as we reached the stop sign where we would turn onto highway #1, so I was watching the road intently (I was driving) while my wife was looking at me and telling me some family business. There was &quot;nothing coming&quot; so I turned left onto the highway, into the closer, left lane, and began to accelerate. I was responding to my wife&apos;s comments when I noticed what looked like something dark moving at the edge of the right lane about a hundred feet ahead. I thought it might be a dog, so I took my foot off the accelerator (we had only gotten up to about thirty miles per hour, and we immediately lost a good deal of that). When the dark spot moved into the middle of the road and was thoroughly illuminated, I was shocked to see that it was not a thing but the absence of something. Moving into my lane, was a circle about four feet wide of dark pavement, upon which the rain was not falling. I imagined an updraft or other weather anomaly was responsible, but a gust of wind rocked the car, and at the same time, the circle went slightly oval in shape--then back to circular as the wind eased off. I thought it would fall apart at any second, but it didn&apos;t, and as it grew closer, I leaned forward and peered at the edges of the circle. They were perfectly defined by the rain pummeling itself into mist outside the circle, giving the rest of the road a gray/white look. There appeared to be no transitional area-- absolutely no water was entering the circle. I remember my mouth falling open in shock as I saw this (about fifteen feet away). Before I could react, our paths were intersecting. I experienced time dilation at that point--the normal kind, caused by adrenalin, which seems to make every- thing go in slow motion. I watched the rain stop pounding on the hood, saw the circular edge move onto the windshield, and then heard the gap in the sound of rain hitting the roof--it was if we had gone under a bridge. Instinctively, I hit the brakes and stared into the rearview mirror. I saw only the area of road behind us lit up in the red glow of the tailights and that another car was cresting a hill about a mile back. Just as instinctively, when I saw the area lit up with my brakes, I took my foot off the brake pedal out of fear of alerting IT, and sped very quickly away from there. As I did this, I turned to my confused wife, and in a shaky, excited voice, said, &quot;Did you SEE that?&quot; And she responded, &quot;See what?&quot; I tried to convince myself it was some sort of weather anomaly and made a mental note to check into it. About a year later, I read some ufo literature and was shocked to find out how often craft of four feet or under are reported--up until that time, my chief point of scepticism was the small size of the unseen object. (i.e. Who would come across interstellar space in such a tiny craft?) This could have occured in October or November--I&apos;m just not certain, but I could probably pin it down if I compared my calendar from that year with meteorological data for the area. Three notes: The area the circle seemed to be coming from is a kudzu- covered swampy forest. There is a pond nearby and a line of high voltage towers.If the circle was caused by an object overhead, it appeared that this object was moving under its own power when I first saw it, but after entering the illuminated area, it appeared to be at the mercy of the wind. I think this shows intent--I think we surprised it, and it cut out power movement until we had passed under.", "Star-like bright light with fire colored, pointed tail. Moved, then became stationary.This location is just east of Sacramento, CA. Just about 2 or so miles south of Highway 50, on Latrobe Rd. It is in the foothills, and very rural. The stars show brightly. I would be happy to draw a picture for you if you are interested. Looking south, the moon was very round and bright. I looked up and saw a bright star-like object with a fire colored tail moving to the right of the moon. I called two other people out of the building and by the time they got there the fire had gone out. The light continued to move to the right and downward. It stopped at about &apos;3 or 4 inches&apos; from the moon and stayed there for at least 2 hours. I work graveyard, and I had just arrived at work, so I know the time is correct. I came out on my first break at 12:00am, and the light was still there. I know next to nothing about stars etc. but it seems there is usually one in that position. However, we did see this light move rapidly down to that position. I&apos;ve been noticing little things up there over the past few months, but I attributed them to my eyes playing tricks. This, however, was no trick of the eye. I thought it was just one of the meteors that I&apos;d read about and heard Art talking about, but it stopped dead still, so I just thought I&apos;d mention it!", "WHILE DRIVING EASTBOUND ON I-90; OBJECT MOVED IN AN ARCH ACROSS THE HORIZON, SOUTH TO NORTH DIRECTION, MOSTLY WHITE IN COLOR.

I has gotten out of my truck to place a customers paper in his tube when I noticed the area becoming very brightly illuminated and when I looked up to discover the source of the illumination I noticed a very bright &quot;fireball&quot; in the southern sky. The object resembled a ball like would be released from a roman candle as it emmited sparks as it traveled across the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Correct date of event is 05DE99.  Date is corrected here.  PD))", "Object was a cylinder shape with light formations on what appeared to be both sides of object.  Flying at low altitude but could not see object in great detail due to light formations. Object was in view for approx. 30-45 seconds, then simply disappeared from sight.Object was viewed by three adults and one 9 year old child on 11/16/99 approx. 5 miles south of Owenton,KY which is a small town approx. 70 miles south of Cincinnati, OH. Evidently, hundreds of people in the Cincinnati area saw the same object, and the incident was reported on the 11:00 news. Object was long with several bright lights which were in a peculiar formation.  Object was first seen through a window of my house.  Upon discovery of object, I hurried out the door and onto the deck which overlooks a lake.  Object seemed to &quot;float&quot; through the air at a relatively slow speed.  There was no audible sound from the object. Although, it was flying at a pretty low altitude, it was difficult to view object in great detail.  I think this was primarily due to the nature of the object itself.  Again, it was a rather long object and maybe can best be described as an abstract &quot;floating train&quot;.  Object was in view for approx. 30-50 seconds all the while traveling at a relatively slow, steady speed.  Then simply disappeared.", "I 1st saw it while heading no. on int. 17 in woodville and followed it all the way to weeksville...it was NOT a plane, OR a helicopter.I was headed NO. on U.S. 17, coming home from work at approx. 5:45 p.m., just past twilight, when I first noticed it in the sky. At 1st glance, I thought I was looking at a helicopter, because it was so low to the ground and moving at a low rate of speed; (at 60 m.p.h., I was able to keep up with it.) It maintained a position just ahead of me and to the right about a mile away, maybe 300&apos; in the air. as I continued to watch it. I noticed that it had an elongated diamond shape (&lt;&gt;) and lights that were not at all recognizable as navigation lights. The end points had continuously burning amber lights, while the top and bottom points were bright white and strobed in a fashion similar to those on an ambu- lance. As I got closer to my turn off, I noticed it was veering away from it&apos;s parallel course to me and taking a more southerly course, but still maintaining its slow pace. Approx. 9 miles after 1st spotting it, I turned so. on Halls Creek rd., and, as luck would have it, I was still hot on it&apos;s trail, following Halls Creek due south, as it moved east. I drove the length of the rd. (4.5 mi.) and came to a &quot;T&quot; intersection. I turned left onto Pitts Chapel Rd. with i t still in clear view, so I de- cided to pull off the rd. and get out to get a good  look at it. I was able to watch it un obstructed by trees for approx 30 sec. at 1st, it simply did what it had been doing all along...proceeding slowly, steadi- ly east, but just before it disappeared behind the woods, it did some- thing truly astounding that took away any doubt that it was a genuine ufo; although the craft never once wobbled, pitched or yawled, it did make some radical rising and dipping maneuveres. I KNEW then I was onto something extraordinary. MY pulse racing now, I pushed my car to its max trying to get as close to the object as I possibly could, turning on 4 different roads, over another 8-9 mile stretch, until I found a gravel rd. which turned off the paved rd. in the same direction of the craft. By this time (6:20-6:30pm), the sky was almost completely dark, and as I proceeded down the unfamiliar path, I noticed that the ufo had stopped about 1/2 mile away and hovering roughly 2-300 feet above the trees, I was awstruck by this monumental sight. Finally on solid, stationary ground, I watched it hover over the trees, occasionally darting side-to- side, and up and down in a floating kind of way. I found myself debating whether I could make it home to get my camcorder, but I was afraid that it would be gone for good, so I stayed there to take in the entire ex- perience. It stayed right there above the trees for several minutes, until finally, the four corners of the craft appeared to pull toward the center and consolidate, just before accelerating away from me to dis- appear beyond the tree line... I tried to resume chase, but lost all sight of it.  I don&apos;t know what it was, but I do know for a fact that it absolutely was NOT  a fixed-wing or rotary aircraft of ANY kind...and I can only hope that someone else saw it or video-taped it. I will never forget it as long as I live.", "4:30 AM Sunday morning December 5, 1999.  I witnessed a light that lit up my entire back yard and then an explosion sound followed. I also witnessed what I and 3 other people consider to be a UFO. It was visable for over an hour.At approximately 4:30 Sunday morning, December 5, 1999, I woke up from falling asleep on the couch.  I proceeded to bed and when I did I woke up my wife to ask her to move over, she then sat up and questioned me about the time.  Before I could climb into bed a bright light like I have never seen before lit up my back yard.  The light the proceeded to slowly climb up both of my windows at the same time climbing up them at a slow pace.  The light illlumated my entire house as if it were day.  Just as the light came it went, with the darkness came up the windows in the same fashion.  We estimate the light lasted around ten to fifteen seconds.  I then ran outside where I saw nothing at all.  I do have a clear view of each horizon.  I live on about a five hundred acre farm.  As I walked back inside an explosion sound rattle the house such as an earthquake might.  At this point I was completely in shock and had no idea what was going on.  I then ran back outside and this time I noticed an object in the sky in which I had never seen before.  This object appeared to be in a saucer/disk shape.  I estimate it was about one thousand feet away.  The object appeared to be hovering over the mountain behind my house.  It came across as slowly drifting around and sometimes with great burts of speed.  One thing that stands out is that the object appeared to be circular with spotlights all the way around it.It would shine just like a lighthouse.  Myself, my wife, her father and her grandmother all witnessed this event.  We believed that it might have been a planet but as we blocked it out with a tree we noticed that it moved on both sides of the tree.  It moved with great distance.  It was in the southeastern sky.  We watched this object for over an hour and half.  I have no explanation for this nor the light.  But most of Shelby County reported to 911 seeing the lights in the sky and hearing and feeling the &quot;sonic boom&quot; as some people call it.  Though it has been on the news, many reports are conflicting and many peopl! e and ra dio stations are calling this event a coverup.  The news is reporting that a meteor, a very large meteor came through and made the night time day.  I know what a meteor is.  I have seen several come through the Earth&apos;s atmosphere and burn up.  If this was a meteor then it was one that had to be as large as a car.  Though that still does not explain what the four of us witnessed for over and hour. I hope that you can help shed some light on this.  Maybe you can help me understand why there are so many meteor sightings lately all across the U.S. Is there something that we should know that the government is not telling?  Please call or email me back with any questions that you may have!

I saw a few bright ones and was about to go back in the house when I noticed movement out of the corner of my left eye (I was facing south).  I saw 7 or 8 luminous circles flying in a V or chevron formation.  They were moving very fast east to west and made no sound.  They covered an area about the size of my thumbnail held at arms length.  The circles were not bright and had they not been moving, I probably would not have seen them.  They were out of sight in about 20 seconds.  Afterwards I wondered if these circles were on the underside of a large delta shaped craft since the allignment was maintained. I am 65 years old and have been interested in astronomy since I was 13.  I have never seen a UFO before.  The local UFON group had no reports that day.  I guess I was just lucky.  Lat 29/40 Long 95/29", "Brief horizon to horizon motion by three inter-weaving craft.At 2:30 am on the night of April 23rd, 1998, I was lying on the ground outside of my college dorm building staring at the night sky. My body was lying feet to the west, head to the east. The cloud cover for the sky was patchy but at about 40-50%. That night there must have also been a bright moon because I clearly remember a particularly intense luster to the clouds. I was talking with a friend when I noticed out of the corner of my right eye (to the north) movement that really only registered consciously but not so that it drew my attention. I did realize that the motion was extremely fast and for some very puzzling reason, I felt compelled to look to the south in the night sky as if I knew that it was moving so fast that to attempt to turn my head and look at it would mean missing it and instead I looked south to allow it to travel through my field of vision where I could track it with my eyes as it entered. What I saw, albeit brief, to this day is the most profound event I have ever witnessed. I was able to see the objects for no more than three seconds in the sky. They entered my vision heading south at what I would estimate at between 800-1000 mph based on the change in degree of my field of view and the time in which the change occurred. The objects were as follows: there were three light blue or grey light triangles with only the borders illuminated. That is to say that the objects looked like isoscelene triangles made of flourescent light bulbs. The objects appeared to be dodging in and out of the clouds from my vantage point. I can not, however, state with any certainty how far away they may have been or if they were above or below the clouds. It was especially difficult to tell because the illumination of the objects was not unlike that of the clouds in intensity. But, not only did the objects appear to be moving in and out of the clouds but they moved as though they were completing repeated figure-eights with each other at a very constant rate. I remember being scared deeply by the exact nature in which the objects moved with each other. I guess it scared me because I had never seen anything as geometric, fast, or precise in motion any where in the natural world around me. These certainly were not birds or aircraft. Any aircraft moving this fast would have created at least a sonic boom not to mention either a contrail or engine noise. Almost as soon as the event was recorded in my sight, it was over. I jumped to my feet and started swearing quite loudly and asking anyone of about six people within about two feet of me if &quot;they saw that&quot;. I was struck dumb with disbelief having seen something that to this day has left me with no logical answers. Here is some important info about the area. Fargo is, apparently, no stranger to the sighting of aerial phenomena as I had found out after checking out some other reportings and found that North Dakota itself is a hotbed. The area of Fargo itself where I was when I saw this event occur is not more than one mile south of the 119th Strategic Bombing Wing and an Air National Guard base. Grand Forks, ND is just 80 miles north and is home to one of the largest air bases in the United States. Often in the area, one can see large aircraft landing, committing touch-and-go&apos;s, taking off and rolling flight patterns over the area. I am not, however, even going to begin to kid myself into believing that what I saw was military aircraft or any kind of commercial aircraft. The speed was simply astounding not to mention the risk of flying three aircraft in a weave-pattern in and out of each other at ANY speed. And finally, background on me. I graduated from that college (NDSU) in 1999 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Archaeology with a specialization in cartography and linguistics. My minor degree was Psychology. I am an accomplished Martial artist and guitar instructor and I have a very well paying job working as a systems analyst in Minneapolis. I am not any sort of cuckoo or permanent day-dreamer. I have nothing to gain by reporting this event. I apologize for waiting over a year and a half to report this event but the very mention of the phrase &quot;I saw something last night I can&apos;t explain...&quot; got me glances from the wierdest of my colleagues. I hope that this report helps your efforts. God Bless and take care... A Believer. PS Due to the nature of my report, I hope that you understand my reluctance to transmit my address and name.

Thank you...", "I went out this morning to get the newspaper and walk my dog around and I was looking at the stars and saw a bright red light.  It appeared to be moving in a circle or an oval.  It swayed back and forth a few times and then it shot across the sky and it was gone. Later, I called my neighbor and told her about it and she said she had seen a red streak in the sky when she looked out the window after waking up.((NUFORC Note:", "looked out window at an object the color of a setting sun  moving west to east at a slow speed.Object was in no hurry as it moved west to east.Bright orange with blinking lights.", "Black Triangular Craft moving north to south at time of lunar eclipse. Well camoflaged, it appeared as if a piece of the sky had moved.At approx 10.50pm while observing the Lunar Eclipse, I spotted something in the sky below the level of the moon and a few degrees to the north. The object at first looked as if a section of the sky had peeled away from the background, and moved from north to south almost like a chesspiece on a board. I immediately shouted out to my companions and said &quot; look! what the hell is that?&quot; What I saw was a &apos;triangular (equilateral) shaped black object moving rapidly from north to south. One of the points of the triangle being the leading edge. The two outside edges (behind the leading point) had several dim lights down the two sides. These lights were a little ways in from the edge. The object moved in a straight line (without deviation) and without sound. It was visible for only a few seconds (four or five) and then we lost it in the glare of the lights from the hotel.. One of my friends missed it all together as he was looking in the direction of Orion trying to see shooting stars, but my other friend and myself observed it. Without prompting, I asked him to describe to me what he had just seen. He describe it &apos;exactly&apos; the way I had seen it. We were located just south of Puntarenas Costa Rica. Date Jan 20/2000, Time 10.50pm local time. We did not talk about it much while we were on holiday, as it took a few days to sink in, but had a serious discussion when we got back. The other day at work I asked him to draw the object in question and I would do the same. The drawings were identical. I cannot explain what we saw that night, it was most unusual to say the least. I asked one of the local guys at the hotel in Costa Rica (Caribbean Village Fiesta Hotel) to check the local papers and the internet. He did not find anything. At the time of the sighting the weather was clear and visibility was good. My friends and I were on a pier, away from the lights of the hotel, so we had a pretty good view of the night sky. We observed the craft by looking east over the beach. It was only after the craft had move towards the south, that the lights of the hotel came into play.", "saw 4 or 5 little lights in the north sky. they reappeared and disappeared and they went along in a line, and one light got bigger, and seemed to move slowly and then fastly disappeared.Driving home from work one night, around 11:00 pm, in the north sky, I saw 4 or 5 orange-yellow lights, that were circle-shaped, appear in the sky. All of them disappeared and then reappeared and seemed to be moving in a straight line, almost seemed like a light show like you see on lights around a movie poster or something. Then one light got bigger, and then disappeared. It lasted for about 30 or 40 seconds.", "There were six light that changed formation then they disappeared.I was driving down the road when I looked up and saw six lights (two sets of three) in a &apos;V&apos; formation moving slowly two what was my right.  About a mile up the road I saw a bunch of cars pulled over looking up at the sky.  It was another mile before I reached my apartment I loked out the window and at his point they looked as if they were forming a circle (they were all in a circle except one).  I then went out my front door and was standing on my stairs but I couldn&apos;t see the lights do to my building.  Within a minute or two an upside down triangle formation came into my view as startd to pass my building.  They moved fairly slowly and the bottom light slwly dimmed to nothing.  Then the top left light dimmed to nothing then the fourth light came into my viewpassing my building.  That light then dimmed.  Finally the top right light dimmed to nthig.  I couldn&apos;t see what happened to the other two lights.  The lights were a yellowish color.  They were steady and slow moving.  I didn&apos;t hear any noise when I got out of my car.

Assoon as we ( my 14yr. son) arrived in Lexington KY. I wrote the date andlocation and time down we saw the triangle shape in the sky.(8:20pm)  Myson,  who normally tells me it is just another plane.. actually rolled downhis window and said. &quot; Mom, I think you are right.. that is no plane orhelicoptor, I don&apos;t know what it is.&quot;  There were at least two other aircrafts in the sky and we were watching those as they were fairly low as Iassumed there was a air port close by.  Since I was driving it was hard forme to watch the planes.  Then my  son noticed somthing unusual..  verybright white lights on each corner of the of a third air craft. We were notthat close to actually verify it was trianglar in shape.  But, from me justlooking out the window.  I would say yes... it had a triangle shape.  Itwas moving when we first saw it and then it just more or less just hungthere.. no sound.  I can&apos;t say for sure if it was a UFO.  But, it gave usgood converstation on the way to my parents house in Lexington.Sincerely,((name deleted))", "Flash in the southern sky, according to others this was similar to the night of the meteor just off the east coast, except of course this was to the South.This is a second hand observation by my parents.

On our left was a forest and a flea market and on the right was some house so we were caring on a conversation when i looked over in the feild when i seen a looked like a circle thing it was  well looked about as big as the moon from far away and it had white blue and red blury lights all around the sides the  bottom of it looked like 4 little  odd shaped triangles like a drawling on the bottom that they formed a circle but they were made from triangle things and it looked like a little very little amount of fog from it I was like oh my god and i said jessi look and we were just standint there and we didnt even talk it stood like  not even 1 block away from us  and it was over a bare tree befor the forest and flea market just in the middle of the feild so we just stood there and were like what is it so I stared at it and jessi looked to the right where the houses were and so I looked at the houses but 5 seconds later we looked right were it was and it was gone within 5 seconds whatever it was, it was gone like no tace of what way it went no light no sounds it was just like  it vanished so then we ran home and we got in trouble for staying out that long but we told my mom what we saw and she says a few months prier my sister and my mom seen a similar object outfront in a feild about a mile away so we never really talk about it but we know it was definatly not a airplain or a kite or anything and so thats my story and thats what happend on halloween 98 so now Jessi and i both beleive in aliens now. and when that happend me and ((name deleted)) were both 12 but we both know what we saw", "I seen an alien, not a UFO, but I didn&apos;t know where to go to report it.It was in 1993, I believe,and I was 13 yrs of age. I was at a creek in Joplin Missouri. (I moved to Kansas not too long afterwards.) It was on one knee looking at something on the ground and I thought it was a person at first, so I said &quot;Hey&quot;. (It was on an island in the middle of the creek) When it heard me it stood up and looked at me and this is what I saw: Black enormous eyes Skin was like dry looking, white with alittle tint to it No taller than a 10 or 11 year old kid Don&apos;t recall nose or mouth (I may be mistaken) Very skinny, like it was starving Bald headed, large head Long fingers I ran home afterwards and my parents didn&apos;t belive me.

Los objetos no hicieron ruido alguno y viajaban a una velocidad muy r&aacute;pida.", "A bright yellow object traveling from west to east, ending in a bright flashI was traveling south on a residential street, when out of the corner of my eye I saw a yellow &quot;ball&quot;.  The object was circular with a lime-green &quot;corona&quot;(I guess you&apos;d call it).  It sort of resembled a fire ball, yellow center with the lime-green surrounding it and a very short green tail. At first I thought I was just seeing a street light or some kind of reflection, so I did a double-take.  When I looked back, I could clearly see that it wasn&apos;t a street light, but rather something that was definately air-born.  It traveled directly from west to east, decending at approximately a 45 degree angle to the ground. I only saw the object for a few seconds, and then it just seemed to disappear with an extremely bright flash.  At the time it disappeared, I thought that it must have been a crash of some kind due to the flash.  It appeared to be about 5 miles south of my location and the diameter was about the same as the length of a Boeing 727 at 5 miles. Since it appeared to be so close, I drove to a nearby ridge which was about 3 mile SSE of my location.  From that vantage point, I had an unobstructed view of over 15 miles in all directions.  I saw nothing of a plane crash or and king of brush fire that I would expect from a meteorite of that size.(The color also ruled out a meteorite to me because every comet or meteorite I have ever seen is either white or a whitish-blue color. I didn&apos;t really give it much thought until later that morning when I was traveling with my father and happened to mention the experience to him.  We both had a good laugh and chalked it up to lack of sleep and went on discussing other matters.  About 15 minutes later, there was a newsbrief from an Atlanta radio station which said that several people, most notably a couple of Atlanta firemen, had reported seeing a strange light in the sky a little after 5 that morning.  They were just getting off work and heading home to Ellijay, which means they were traveling north when they saw it. If we all saw the same thing, it must have been larger, brighter, and further south than I had first thought. Later that night, the TV news said that the National Weather Service in Atlanta said that what the firemen saw was a meteor.  That was the last I heard of the incident. I am in my late twenties, have a college degree, and run my own business.  I have always had a real love for aviation, especially military aircraft.  I have family members that have made careers in the military, and through those connections have learned alot about the aircraft we are currently flying.  On several occasions I have tried to discuss those that don&apos;t officially exist, such as the projects profiled in periodicals such as Janes Defence, usually getting responses like, &quot;Now where did you read that?&quot;, or more often, &quot;Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.&quot; I have personally witnessed F15s, F16a, F4s, A10s, B1-Bs, F117s, B2s, and even F22s(which is being developed at Lockeed in Atlanta) in flight both during daylight and at night. All I can tell you is that whatever it was I saw that morning was nothing I have ever seen before.  That&apos;s not to say it wasn&apos;t ours -- but it it was ours it&apos;s nothing that has ever been publicly acknowledged or even speculated on in any military or aviation journal I&apos;ve ever read. It was truly a UFO -- an Unidentified Flying Object. I found your website after seeking information on this subject and debated whether or not to tell my seemingly insignificant story.  But here I am nearly two weeks later, and what I saw is still as vivid in my mind as it was that morning.  What bothers me is that I just haven&apos;t heard any more concerning the incident, and the Nt&apos;l Weather Service&apos;s explaination of a &quot;meteorite&quot; just doesn&apos;t wash. I ask that my name or personal information not be revealed, I seek no notariety, I just hope that I can make some small contribution toward solving this puzzle.", "A single small cloud moved from WNW to WSW over a 5 min. period in an otherwise clear sky. Faintly comet-shaped. Military rocket launch?I am a computer-graphics animator with interest in weather, astronomy, space travel, etc. I watch the sky a lot, and what I saw wouldn&apos;t have raised the average person&apos;s eyebrow but I found it hard to explain. I was driving westbound on the 101 freeway at about 4:45pm on Friday, December 10. There was a very strong wind (around 30 mph) blowing out of the north. The sun had set earlier but the western sky was still bright with upward-slanting sunlight. The sky was completely cloudless (except for 2-3 cumulus clouds very far to the north end of the San Fernando Valley which were no longer lit by direct sunlight). There were a number of contrails from overflying jets (there are many major airways over the SF Valley). These all appeared as salmon and orange-colored lines of about two inches at arm&apos;s length. They didn&apos;t persist but followed close behind the jets. As I drove West through Sherman Oaks, I saw a small cloud to the WNW, a little to the right of the freeway and just above treetop level. It appeared a bit smaller than my thumbnail at arm&apos;s length. The cloud appeared to be illuminated by sunlight, but it was very fuzzy and not as dense or as detailed as a cumulus cloud. Still, it had visible volume and the side facing the sun (now hidden by the horizon) was brighter than the other side. It was not a bright orange or yellow as the nearby contrails but rather had a slight pinkish quality. It rather looked like a vaporous ball that had been smudged horizontally. I judged it to be fairly high and far away, based on the fact that it was still receiving sunlight even though all the mountains in the valley were in total shadow. It struck me as odd, being the only visible cloud in the sky, and not dispersing from winds. As I watched over a period of 5 minutes it drifted to the left of the freeway, still around treetop level and still being hit by sunlight. When I looked at the cloud with my peripheral vision it appeared to take on a cometary appearance, being pointed on the leading edge and fanning out on the trailing side. This detail wasn&apos;t as obvious with my direct vision. As time passed the cloud did seem to shrink slightly, perhaps to 3/4ths its original size. Eventually it disappeared from view, but given its path it wasn&apos;t going to pass behind any visual obstructions. I got the impression it simply stopped existing. My guess is: this was an exhaust plume from a military space launch from some facility to the north or northwest of the LA region. We&apos;ve had a number beautiful upper-atmosphere tests here in recent years and I rather expected this to be another of those launches, but I didn&apos;t observe anything more than the one cloud. The quality of the cloud&apos;s density and shape was similar to the clips I&apos;ve seen of rocket exhausts in the upper atmosphere/low orbit realm where there isn&apos;t any turbulence to speak of. If it was a rocket, then it must have been travelling westward from the launch point. That&apos;s unusual (but not unheard of) because most rockets lauch to the east to take advantage of the earth&apos;s rotational speed. If it wasn&apos;t a rocket, then I&apos;m at a loss to explain it. Are there any records of a launch on that day?", "Object looked as if it could have been a star or an aircraft so high in the sky that it could have been mistaken for a star.  The light moved from the west to the east, completely across the sky in a matter of seconds.  If object was an aircraft, it was moving faster than anything I have ever seen.", "It was spring of 1967. I was in the army at that time, and assigned to an air defense center in Key West, Florida. I spent many of my nights in a radar control center watching the various screens.  My second cousin was also in the scope dope business. He was in the Air Force at the time and workedin a radar station in Homestead, Florida, just outside Miami.  We spent many an evening conversing on the air defense net, although our conversations rarely had anything to do with air defense. My cousin called me one night on the net and advised me that something unbelievable was happening in South Florida. He opened the net so I could monitor the traffic regarding the incident taking place. I pulled my headset to my ears as I listed to various NORAD stations tracking a UFO just of the coast of Miami. At the time, Homestead was a SAC base, and any such traffic was a great concern to the Air Force.Although I was about 100 miles from the target under discussion, I had the capability to observed activity in the area with my own radar. I had only to switch it off standby. As I was bringing up my antenna, the chatter continued, and referred to three more objects in the sky near Miami. It was also noted that civilian observers had now sighted the objects and the sighting was being reported on local commercial radio.As my scope came up the first thing I noticed was three Marine fighters departing Boca Chica Naval Air Station, heading North. The UFOs were clearly visible just Southeast of Miami.  They appeared to be moving just East of North, skirting the Florida Coast. It only took the Phantoms a few minutes to reach the area of the bogies. I have no idea if the pilots sighted the targets visually, or electronically.  The air channel was not part of the NORAD net. As the phantoms approached the targets they disappeared off the scope. Now there is only one way to disappear when being observed by a PAR (pulse acquisition radar). You must go straight up, or straight down.  This cat and mouse game went on all night. Much to much to type in this report. Visual observations inMiami reportedly included the observation of one large object and three small. This I can not verify,although I imagine the Miami Herald would have some record of it.  To me, they appeared to be flying a search pattern. The way the Coast Guard would search in grids. After about three hours one of the unknowns began moving South directly towards my location.  The target was really moving, probably twice the speed of anything I had ever tracked, around 1100 miles an hour.  This would provide me with an excellent opportunity to lock onto the target with a different type of radar. This other type of radar, which I probably should not identify, has the capability of bringing back actual sounds of the target .  Turbo prop, jet engines, or the thud of rotary aircraft could clearly be heard with this system.As the target approached I brought the unit into alignment with it and  brought the unit on line. For ashort moment, a very short moment, I could hear a high pitched whine, similar to a jet engine, butsmoother and much higher pitch.  At this point the target obviously detected my lock and hit my sight with some type of ECM.  It appeared to reverse the polarity of every piece of equipment on the sight. Needless to say this caused an instant shut down of the system and erased a great many taxpayer dollars. Shortly after rendering my sight useless one of the guys threw open the door to the control center andstated that they had seen the object pass over. It was moving so fast that one of the guys swore it was a meteorite.", "I was walking by myself just recollecting the events of my day, which to my knowledge was very long and tiring when all of a suden these 3 triangle shapes came down and this little voice, almost childlike said to me &quot;We have returned, now you and the rest of your planet earth will live in peace with ourkind&quot; the little voice then went on to tell me that they were planning to come for us in the millenium becuase that is when people were the most vulnerable, and everyone is expecting the world will end. Then I was &apos;beamed&apos; up into one of the air crafts, where they stripped me and probed me.... they then proceded to plant a sac into my uterus, and told me that I would be the one responsible to carry on their race..

I had decided that I was not going to swim and stayed on the beach and took photos.When we returned , we developed the photos , and we were amazed to find a vapour like disc shape just above the horizon in the foreground.

While waiting at the stop sign to make the turn, I saw two large airplanes traveling east over the NorthCity area, coming towards LakeCity. After I made the turn onto 30 AV NE I tried to keep an I on them as they where flying VERY low and very close together, one following the other. Both planes had numerous lights on. When they got over LakeCity they banked to their right, about 90deg. It was not a sharp bank but a slow bank over a few miles, where they then continued south out of my view. In this area we see a lot of planes flying low due to the numerous large airfields around. I have just never seen two large plane in this close a formation this low before. If I had to make a guess as to altitude I would say between 1500 and 3000 feet max. Distance between planes 1/8 of a mile.

The streak lasted some 1/2 second and by holding out hand it was about the size of my thumb nail.  I noticed it was above the thin layer of cirrus clouds. It was too big to be a shooting star.  The sky was still blue and the sun was still in the sky.  I was amazed by how bright the object was inthe daytime sky.  It was moving faster than anythng I had seen before including shooting stars.  The object came from behind me out of the southeast and traveled toward the northeast.  Without dissapating, the object just disapeared.  No jerking movment or obvious change of direction was observed.  I couldn&apos;t tell if it had a tail of if I was observing the visual stretch of the object due to the speed.

Object moved steadily, at moderate speed from approximately South to North.

At first I though they were airplane search lights or something like that but the more I watched the more puzzling they became. These lights would stay within the cloud, one circling the whole perimeter of the cloud and the other one back and forth and occasionaly crisscrossing.  Sometimes they appeared to be inside of the cloud and that is why I do not think they were airport lights.  I decided to vidio tape them but due to the city lights around I was not sure I was recording them.   I did get maybe a couple of minutes before I stopped recording and left for work.

It had multi colored rotating or changing lights around the circumference about six feet wide.The colors were orange/red/blues constantly changing.There was no noise ,sound,or wind.It was a perfectly clear night with stars but I do not remember the phase of the moon.I got out of my 56  chevy and looked up at it [WITH MY GLASSES ON] trying to see if i could see anyone or anything in the lighted area for about 10 or15 sec. but all it was were the multi colored lights. The object then started moving slowly overhead to the west then increase speed to be a dot and gone out of sight or sped off and just disappeared. It did move quite a way in any event before going away. It was thrilling to see it. I did not seem to lose any time while this occured or seem to be affected by it.But some years later on the show The Greatest American Hero on I think the second episode the y portrayed the same craft, lights, and the way it went out of sight. I would say exactly, so I always assumed that there must be many others who had seen this oject because it would be difficult to exactly imagine the object I saw, But then again who knows?

I watched it hover for a few minutes and went into my apartment.", "Rectangular object motionless in the sky over the Gulf of Mexico for 4 to 5 mintues which shot off straight up and was gone in less than a second.This information came from my ex-husband one night when we were sharing quirky things from our teenage years.  He said that one night about a week after Hurricane Frederick hit Mobile, Alabama, he saw a bizarre-looking object hanging motionless in the southern sky just before the sun went down.  He had gone outside to feed his dog and the object caught his eye because it was so bright, it seemed to be lit from within.  It had a row of lights horizontally across the center of every color which were alternately blinking (&quot;chasing&quot; was the word he used).  He said he stood stock still for 4 to 5 minutes watching it and it neither got larger nor smaller nor moved at all.  He said it suddenly turned, made a kind of funny loop in the air, and shot off straight up faster than any man-made object could possibly have moved and was gone in less than a second toward the zenith.  He said that just as he lost sight of it, he heard jet air crafts and saw two (what he thought must have been Air Force) jets flying toward the spot where the rectangular object had been hovering. Further observations:  my ex said the rectangular object really looked like a flying mobile home made of silver with a string of Christmas lights wrapped around it.  He said he was looking due South at it which he said would have situated it in the Gulf of Mexico. He estimated that it was about 10 miles away and he said he felt all weird and creepy when he realized how big it must have been for him to see it so clearly from so far away.  He said it was about the size of his entire thumb from tip to hand at arm&apos;s length (he has a big thumb--he&apos;s 6&apos;9&quot;!). My ex is a man of little imagination and less verbal ability and so his story struck me with it&apos;s clarity and I was stunned by his recitation of the facts.  His discomfiture was obvious and we had been married for 5 years without him ever mentioning it.  In September, 1979, when this occurred, he was seventeen years old.  He&apos;s a licensed electrician now. I found this site while researching Whitley Strieber whom I had seen on a Fox News hour-long special on UFO&apos;s and, after deliberation, decided to report my ex&apos;s experience.", "Passing meteor?

A line of 4 or 5 glowing objects in a &quot;train&quot; formation, white in color.Sitting in my livingroom, listening to VHF radio scanner, heard a fellow tell whoever he was talking to that he had just seen &quot;a huge comet or something&quot; moving across the sky.  I looked out the window, and from my seated position on my sofa could see a streak of fire/light contining four or five very large fireballs, moving across the sky towards the eastern horizon.  I rose from my chair and moved to the window to see just a faint view of them above the neighbors house, lost to the Eastern horizon.  I commented to my wife of what I had seen, but I don&apos;t think she had an opportunity to see them.  I was reminded of the &quot;string of pearls&quot; photos that I had seen of the asteroid that struck Jupiter a few years ago.  It reminded me very much of that.

It passed right over me and I couldn&apos;t hear it. And also there was a blinking light but I,m not sure where. I was trying to see the ship it self, between the lights, but the light were to bright, they were all I could see.

It had no distinctive shape.  It changed to a dot after about a minute and a half, then disappeared about 15 seconds later.

Object was motionless at an altitude of approximatiely One Thousand feet (1,000 ft.) and over the ordinance impact area north of the ground-wave listening antenna. A dark square, longer than it was wide, was centered in the diamond, and resembling a tinted-picture window.I was sitting by my second-story dormitory window with the window open.  The dormitory was near cherry hill on Elmendorf AFB.  The sky was clear.  It wasn&apos;t uncommon for me to observe sky conditions; because, I was a weather observer for the U.S.A.F.  I remember I was sitting very close to the window, and as I turned to my left I noticed a red speck in the sky.  My attention was drawn completely to the speck, and in order to satisfy my curiosity I grabbed my celestron (C-90) telescope and placed a 35X Barlow in the tube. Needless to say, there was a perfectly motionless red diamond floating in the sky, over the ordinance-impact area, north of the ground-wave-listening antenna, perfectly motionless, and at an altitude of about One Thousand feet (1,000 ft.). My initial reaction was to telephone the tower.  Instead though, I went next door to a rather merry gathering of my fellow workers and brought their attention to bear on the object.  Then we observed the object at a higher power - high enough to see it was a red diamond shaped object with a dark square longer than it was wide, and centered in the middle. Nothing accompanied the event such as sound or lights etc. emitted by the object. All of us looked at each other in amazement.  Our decision was that it might be a kite.  Since there was a party going on we decided not to notify anyone.  Also I think we were having trouble admitting to ourselves the reality of the situation. The sighting went unreported until now.", "I saw a large cigar shaped object fly across the sky very quickly and it gave off a larde red light.  Then I saw it again the same night.I was walking to my house after being dropped off from work when I heard a high pitch noise and I looked up at the sky and I saw the cigar shaped object fly across the sky and it had a extremely bright red light coming from it.  It was so bright that I had to look the other way and then when I looked back at it it started to stop and stay still in the sky.  Then all of a sudden it took off so fast that I didn&apos;t know what direction it went in.

Also, the objects had smooth movement throughout the event. Was hard to focus continuously due to work activities for the duration the objects appeared in the sky.

My wife and I sat in the car with our windows down and intently watched as these objects not only flew in intelligent formation but at times changed formation as follows:  First..  They were flying staggered vertically..  Then two of the lower ones flew directly along side each other.. almost touching each other.  Immediately after that, One of those objects flew below the other then in a counterclockwise rotation.. arced up and around the other object, then resumed position again along side it.. shortly after this four of the objects began flying in a straight line vertically one over the top of the other flying east to west.. almost seemed to be hovvering at a slow speed.. so it seemed.  The highest object which will call the fifth object appeared to always stay a little bit ahead of the rest of the objects below it.. almost as if It was the lead object, and always stayed to the left of the objects.  After the lower objects flew a couple of arial acrobatic moves , the next too above them also made a few arial moves then the lower objects appeared to one by one rapidly speed away till they disappeared..  From the bottom one by one..  While they&apos;re was still three of the objects visible the very top object none as the fifth object or the lead object either seperated into two objects or actually appeared to have dropped another object out the bottom of it.  We observed this for a few seconds.. and then systematically one by one the appeared to speed away until no! n visibl e.. At that time we could no longer see anymore objects.

It stood still twice, and at the end it danced. Then dissapearedI didn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s till the 24 of july in 1999. There were many strange things going on. A Fire-ball, a strange vehicle in the water, a sighting by a fisherman, strange activity of the navy and a weird light travelling through the Dutch sky. I know, my English language isn&apos;t very good, but I wanto to share this with all of you. The Beginning I was working on the isle Texel nearby the Dutch city Den Helder, a city with a marine-base. (The Dutch Navy) When we arrived on the isle there were strange things happening in Den Helder. A paper wrote about a Russian ice-breaker witch had a collision with a strange waterthing. The marineship was badly damaged, but the thing dissapeared from the rader. It wasn&apos;t a fish. The Dutch authorities wrote an official warning about a thing in the Dutch Waddenzee (Waddensea) Ball of fire We were looking on the dike of the isle of Texel in Holland. A girl had seen there a ball of fire above the water. The thing was hanging above the water and dissapeared very fast into heaven. We laughed, but she said it was true. Then whe went with eight persons tot the dike. Three marine-ships When we arrived there were suddenly tree Marine-ships lying in the water. A kilometer away from the dike. That was very strange because there hadn&apos;t a marine-ship for years. Strange light A ten minutes later one of my friends said: &quot;Look at that&quot; he pointed at the sky. There was a light little bit bigger en brighter as a star travelling at high speed from east to west through the sky. (two friends of mine with good eyes said the light excisted out of three little lights ) Two times the thing stood suddenly still and on his flight it shaked/danced through the sky, &quot;It just like the driver is drunk&quot; one of us said. The thing dissapeared with a little flash. After the light dissapeared the marine-ships also dissapeared. The day after our seeing the marine was flying with helicopters the whole day. A man from the island denied it was a military action because they have to announce that in the paper. Dutch papers Also in the Dutch papers there were people who had seen strang lights. A Dutch fisherman had seen also a strange light above the water. The Dutch-paper kwalified this light as a sea-ufo. Strange photographs Two friends of mine made some photographs the other day. On the pictures there were strange lights. When my friends took the photo&apos;s there was nothing to see.", "My girlfriend an I were outside of our apt. it was a nice night, no cloud, the object was as bright as a star from the big dipper, going very fast and stright.it look like a flying star, white, going towards norhteast direction.", "Witnessed the object travel south along Interstate 10 toward Casa GrandeOn the evening of March 13, 1997, my son and I were driving on I-10 where it flows due East through Phoenix AZ. The time was approximately 8:30 P. M.. I noticed what I initially thought was a long line of commercial aircraft approaching Sky Harbor International Air Port from the North preparing for a Westerly landing. I remember thinking it odd that they all appeared to be at the same elevation and none were changing position. As we continued on, I-10 turns South heading toward Casa Grande and Tucson. At that time I lost sight and interest  in the lights. We left I-10 at the Riggs Road exit and headed East towards my son&apos;s home. I again noticed that the lights were still in the same type of pattern and at the same altitude. They also appeared to be much closer. We arrived at my son&apos;s home some 5 minutes later and I went outside to check on the lights while the rest of the family ate dinner. By this time, it was clear that the lights were not separate lights but actually fixed in position relative to each other. They appeared to be part of a structure that was in the shape of a very large v and were moving South and appeared to be over, or very close to, I-10. The lights were on the leading edge of whatever this was. I remember that there were approximately 10 to 13 lights which would appear to extinguish and re-light in no particular sequence. (Could the lights be some form of propulsion?) To say that the object was large is an understatement. It was traveling South approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, moving very slowly and with absolutely no sound. If it was directly over I-10 1 mile to the West, it would be in the range of &frac12; mile wide. I followed the vehicle for nearly 15 to 20 minutes as it passed through my field of vision from what would be North by North West to South by South West. Using 15 minutes to traverse this roughly 210 degree arc, 1 mile away equates to a an approximate air speed of 15 to 20 mph. The vehicle was obviously solid in nature. As it passed by, the stars in the field of view were not visible behind the vehicle (or whatever it was). As it passed by, the number of lights still visible was reduced as the starboard leading edge was blocked from view. This only served to further substantiate my opinion that the phenomenon was solid. I was located in an area that had very little ambient light so the stars were clearly visible. It passed from view as it traveled toward Casa Grande, 25 miles to the south. It is important to note that the lights I witnessed had nothing to do with the widely reported Phoenix Lights that descended behind South Mountain, West of my position. I did not observe those lights which have been reported, from at least one source, that they were a diversion to draw attention from the vehicle that I saw.

The white field was in a cone shape and from the the &quot;inner-tip&quot; projected a long blue beam of light that was unlike anything I could easily describe.  The long beam got longer and the white cone light faded by time I got a good look.  What struck me that this was a &quot;U.F.O.&quot; was because after whatever was producing the cone had faded into the night sky the blue beam remained for another 20 minutes or so.

Noted lights to left and above.  Turned head approx. 110 degrees.  Noted classic saucer shaped object glowing a whitish green.  Object was clearly defined as to shape and not distorted by light intensity.  Ojbject appeared stationary.  Estimate evelation - 4-5 thousand ft.  Could not retain sight of object lor a longer period because of driving coniderations.UFO Center - I have followed Mr.Davenport on Art Bell&apos;s show for years, but never expected to be writing such a report. Notably, I only consulted the Center&apos;s website last evening because I thought what I had seen on 2-8-00 was some form of elaborate prank.  What was incredibly sobering for me, however, was 2-8 report from someone in North Hollywood California, of an object slowly moving east at 17:47. North Hollywood California is located approximately ten miles to the west of the location where my observation took place. Basically, it was dark and a storm was clearing.  There was a modest amount of broken cloud cover to the west.  I was heading north up the #2 freeway at approximately 65 mph.  This location placed me about seven or eight air miles north of downtown Los Angeles and almost directly to the east of North Hollywood. This time night traffic monitoring helicopters and other aircraft are not uncommon overhead, but I noted enough light from three or four sources (I think at least one or or two of the other sources were aircraft) to turn and look 90 degrees to my left.  Turning this far, I picked up a light source further to my left and then turned my head to near maximum.  Doing such, I was visually able to scan an object perhaps 35 degrees above the horizon and 110 degrees to the left and west of the direction I was driving. I only maintain this object in my vision for perhaps two seconds before safety required a return to the roadway.  I was unable to look again for another 30 seconds because of traffic considerations. However brief the observation time, the object observed was very clear. It was cleary disc or saucer-shaped.  The sharpness of its features were not diminished by clouds or weather. Dimensions are difficult to estimate, but my best estimate would be from 60 to 80 feet in diameter and perhaps 20 feet high in the middle.  The object glowed in a soft neon-type of manner and almost appeared transleuscent - - about the consistency of a jellyfish (!). Perhaps the best indicator of authenticity of my seeing this object was my immediate emotional reaction - laughter.  I could not believe this object to be any type of &quot;genuine&quot; UFO - - After all, it was so obviously a &quot;flying saucer&quot; and over a large urban area during commuter time, with sufficiently good enough visibility for it to be easily seen from both the ground and from the air.  I thought it to be a prank - an elaborate one, mind you - - cooked up by USC, UCLA or CAL TECH science students to measure societal reaction to such a blatantly obvious object.  The fact is there is a good part of me that still feels it to be a prank and that the joke&apos;s on me. Approximately 3/4 of a mile north of where I observed the object, the #2 FW begins a straight-graded climb into the San Rafael Hills.  When I reached this area I undid my safety belt and tried a couple of quick body turns in the seat.  I saw lights, but nothing distinct. In retrospect, that I didn&apos;t pull over as soon as possible after the initial sighting is pretty much explained by my laughter - that this object was clearly and distinctly there is a fact - - that this sighting was also defined as a joke or a prank by me at the time is also true. Concluding comment.  I am convinced that this object must have been seen by hundreds of people.  -Those driving south on the #2 FW and down the grade would have been afforded an exceptional view when this object was in the location it was when seen by me.  I made no special effort to monitor the local news for sighting or prank related information at the time.  I&apos;m inclined now to go back and do some checking.  I admire the person who reported what was probably the same object - seen fifteen minutes earlier - in North Hollywood.  Had that report not been earlier made and published by the Center, I would not be making this report at this time. I would certainly appreciate any additional information the comes to the Center on this matter.", "A small, cigar-shaped object entered my field of vision while I was standing on the back porch of second-story apartment building.Back in 1956-57, when I was approximately 10 or 11-years old, I observed a small, cigar or oblong shaped UFO.  It was during the summer and I had just stepped out onto our back porch which was on the second story of an apartment building.  While standing there, leaning up against the railing, something shiny caught my eye on my left.  I glanced to the left and observed a small, metallic looking, oblong object traveling east, about tree height, through the neighborhood backyards.  If the object had not caught the glint of the sun, I never would have seen it.  The color was kind of bronze and slightly shiny and blended well into the surrounding area.  I do not remember seeing anything that resembled windows.  There was absolutely no sound and no noticeable lights of any kind.  Guessing, I would say it was about 20-30 feet in the air.  At no time was it higher than any trees in the neighborhood.  It was approximately 10-15 feet long, using the trees and length of our back yard as a guide.  It was traveling very slow, maybe 1 to 2 miles an hour.  It never deviated from a straight line.  As soon as I caught sight of it, I followed it with my eyes, watching its progression as it slowly made its way through the neighborhood backyards and I lost sight of it due to distance.  I am a 54 year-old female, and looking back on this experience my impression today would be that there was nothing alive in it.  It reminds me now more of what a remote controlled probe might look like.  I had the feeling that everything in its path was being recorded.  The other unusual thing about this sighting is that I never discussed it with anyone.  I did not run into the house for more witnesses or mention it to my family.  Years later, my daughter and I were discussing strange and odd happenings and I mentioned this incident to her.  She was very surprised that I had never talked about it before and in hindsight does appear unusual that I had never discussed it before telling her. In all the years since then, I have never seen anyt! hing eve n remotely similar to this UFO.", "Green light ball in Diyarbak&amp;#305;r one of the city of TurkeyMy sister ((name deleted)) saw a green lightening ball over the football field,next to our home;t hung there for a while then moved and disspeared behind the appartment on the other side of fiel", "Silver Sphere Hovering above treeline on Interstate 65 N.Friday, July 1978 1:00 P.M. My father and I were driving a U-Haul truck.  We were returning an empty U-Haul truck to Tullahoma, TN.  We were moving from Tullahoma TN to Athens AL.  We had just Accessed Interstate 65 N from AL State Hwy 72.  We had just passed a roadside welcoming center on the left of the interstate going toward the Tennessee State line.  About 1:00 p.m., I looked up and above the tree line on the right side of the hwy was a huge silver ball.  It was a hot sunny clear day not a cloud in the sky.  I said to my father, &quot;Hey, look at that!&quot;  He said, &quot;It looks like a weather balloon.&quot;  I said, &quot;No it is not!&quot;  We argued about it.  We studied it for a little while and then stopped the truck.  We got out to look at it were we had a good view.  As we were debating, If it were a weather balloon or not, a door slid open in a downward motion near the bottom of the object.  We stood motionless watching!  We stood there in silence.  A smaller silver ball came out of the opening and went to our right.  Then as second came out and went to our left.   They both hovered there for about five minutes.  The small silver ball that came out second returned to the opening first.  Likewise the first went back in the opening.  The door shut slowly.  It sat motionless for a few more minutes.  Then began moving slowly toward the NE.  Suddenly with incredible speed it went upward and to the NE out of view.  My father and I in silence got back into the truck.  We said nothing to one another.  My father spoke first.  He said, There is no sense in telling anyone what we have seen.  No one would believe it anyway.&quot;  We continued on our journey in silence.", "White light with alternating green and red lightsFrom approximately 75th and state line in Kansas CIty Mo we saw to SW at about 20% angle a constant white light. I thought I also saw a blue and  red light. I got the binoculars and then saw a red light to the right of the white light pulsing. A bit lower and to left of the white light was the blue light, which also pulsed. My brother kept saying it was Sirius but thats ridiculous. The object slowly moved to our right which would be northerly not setting like a star.

I suddenly noticed a cluster of lights floating in the sky. I ran into the house and got my video camera to capture what was going on. I filmed the object for aproximately 5+ minutes(tapes should be in your possession at this time.) The object whipped in a jerking motion from one side to the other, coming in close and retreating back again. Then it went from a cluster of objects to appearing to be one spherical object. This happened several times. It then took off straight up into the sky and out of view, came back, hovered in the southwest at about a 9:00 position, turned into 2 spheres one on top of the other. At that point it had what appeared to be very tiny red spheres circling the top sphere and left a visible red trail around it. We watched it until it clusterd up again and took off.

I remember how clear and blue the sky was and noticed this little ball about the size of the point of a Bic Pen slowly drifting westard.  I thought it must be a weather balloon because I could still see that it was rounded.  Of course I didn&apos;t think much of it until it suddenly stopped and simply hung in midair for a little too long. I thought that that was very odd - especially when it began to jiggle and ping-pong up and down and side to side with such speed, grace and agility that nothing earth-made could compare.  It then quickly dropped downward while increasing in size to about a pencil&apos;s eraser, still reflecting the sun and began jiggling and ping ponging some more.  It then drifted slowly eastward and rose and dropped again where it jiggled some more until it hung in midair again.  Then it finally shot eastward from a dead stop across the horizon and out of sight like a bullet. I all, I&apos;d say this took about two minutes.  This sighting was reported to local police and reported in the local paper.  About 18 months ago is when the Richmond Times Dispatch recreated the sighting and called it &quot;The Great Central Virginia Sighting&quot; and noted that more than 25,000+ reports of this are on file from the Cental Virginia area.

I usually sleep late. My bed is about a meter above the ground.Suddenly I regarded a spinig light on the bed.I looked out the window.In my view there were two small houses with some trees around.

Due to train on track parallel to C St--drove about 10 more seconds until I was able to see the eastern sky again, but it was gone. There was a light on the end of each angle--one red and one green and unsure of 3rd--think it was another red or green, not white or other color. It was so fast--and the low altitude was what drew my attention.There was a lot of traffic, since the train was passing (notoriously long events in Auburn) so people were continuing North on C St instead of waiting at the intersections with train crossings. I had just crossed Main St and saw this plane flying very fast and very very low. I thought it was a plane due to red and green lights--but then I looked after it whizzed by and thought it looked like a triangle shape, with a light on the end of each angle. Because of the train, I couldn&apos;t see the eastern sky (the direction it was going) and pulled over just past Del&apos;s Farm Supply, at the next intersecion--by then there was nothing to see. I thought it might have been a stealth craft, but it didn&apos;t have that swept back look--it seemed more of a true triangle. I couldn&apos;t tell if there was any sound, due to a lot of traffic noise, but can usually hear airplanes even above the traffic--we are right on the flight path for Sea-Tac--as low as this seemed to be, I would have thought it would have made a huge noise, but there wasn&apos;t anything noticeable but traffic.", "Driving South on I-81 around 20 miles South of Avoca Airport. Saw large object hovering right off the side of highway.  Nighttime spotting so shape hard to make out.  3 very bright white lights on front, tiny rapidly blinking red light on side facing us.  I am only guessing the shape to be triangle since night sky and bright lights made it difficult to discernI am hoping to find someone else who has seen what my fiance and myself witnessed at around 8:30 pm on Interstate 81 in PA near Wilkes Barre. We were driving home one evening after spending the day at the Italian festival in Scranton PA. We were on Interstate 81 South near the Scranton/Wilkes Barre International airport in Avoca when we first saw this object. We took notice of this thing because it was extremely high in the sky with 3 huge very bright white lights but with no of the typical blinking lights which are common to known aircraft. We paid little attention to it seeing that we were so close to the airport and chances were that it was some kind of commercial aircraft. We wound our way past the airport on 81 south and continued for another 20 miles or so before we came around a bend in the highway and out of a small patch of trees which are common on this highway when we saw it again. It now was no more than 150 feet off the ground with its 3 bright white lights now hitting us in the face, nearly blinding us. other cars on the road around us began swerving as we did due to the sudden loss of visibility. My fiance began saying things like &quot;What is that? Is that a plane?&quot; I at first thought we were about to witness a horrible plane crash but the thing never crashed. It did not even move all that much! As we got closer to it, I wondered why this thing didn&apos;t shoot over us to the north toward the airport if it were indeed a jet coming in for a landing at the airport. As a matter of fact, the craft was not moving horozontally at all. It was making a slow vertical descent over what I could only describe as a small industrial park. I had a good vantage point to judge how high (or low) the craft was in the sky since it was near a radio tower. This huge craft was definitely lower than the top of this nearby radio tower. I quickly opened the sunroof on the car and stuck my head outside the top of the car. the only thing I could hear was the traffic of the other cars and trucks on the highway and the wind! rushing around my head. This craft made no noticeable sound. Later that night I thought that perhaps what we saw was a large helecopter or a harrier jet of some kind. these are the two craft that to my knowledge can hover without horozontal movement. If this thing were a helecopter, it would have had to have been one of those big old Chinooks who&apos;s rotors make enough noise to shake the very ground if it were to be at the low altitude that this monster was at. This thing was RIGHT off the side of the highway so a chinook would have been easily heard from our vantage point. I invesitgated the possibility of a harrier jet. I learned that harrier jets were not only way too small to be this craft, but also make a terrible noise when using its engines to hover as this craft was doing. As we passed along the craft&apos;s right side, I tried my best to discern a shape of some sort. I could not see any wings at all on this thing to speak of, but I was able to barely make out a very small red light on its right hand side blinking in a very rapid fashion. This red light was very small an was toward the rear of the craft. The shape I could not define to an absolute seeing that it was against the night sky but my eyes saw that the craft was very angular and rectangular from the profile view I had of it. I kick myself every day for not making my fiance turn the car around to get a second look at it. Again, this crat was BIG. The size of a large commercial jet at least. Yet, what kind of commercial jet has the ability to hover? It di not pass us on the highway...we passed IT! It did not move save in a slow smooth downward motion. Again, this was Early September 1998 along interstate 81 near Wilkes Barre, PA at approximately 8:30 pm. i never have reported this to any authority due mostly to the fact I did not know who to contact in this kind of a case. I am not the only one who saw this thing on that particular night as the highway was full of cars and trucks. A friend of mine who used to drive from our college in Columbia county i! n North Central PA to his home in upstate NY told me in confidence even before I saw this craft that he had seen something that matched my description to a tee pace his car and a tractor trailer while he drove home one night on 81 northbound. The craft in his description flew over very quickly and then suddenly slowed and flew over his car and the truck for around 1 mile before veering suddenly and disappearing to the West. The trucker and my friend honked at each other after the craft flew over almost to ask each other if the other saw what they saw. He described the craft as &quot;very large with 3 bright white lights.&quot; I hope someone someday will read this and respond either by follow-up post or direct email reply and tell me what the hell that thing was. A little info about myself. I am now a 23 year old white male. Computer Technician. While I held an interest in UFO&apos;s and the like, I never gave them much credit until this incident.

I muted the TV, and could still hear the sound.  I opened the sliding glass door, and the sound was definitely coming from outside.  It was a clear night, with a sky full of stars.  The house is in rural PA, so there was no light pollution to contend with.  Standing in the driveway, I scanned the viewable sky and didn&apos;t see anything, but could still hear and feel the hum.  It sounded like the hum was coming from beyond the tree line to the east.  About that time, I noticed the the sky from that direction was becoming &quot;blacked out&quot; (ie the stars were being blocked by an object passing between my line of sight and the sky). The object continued across the sky from east to west, at a slow rate of speed.  As it cleared the tree line, I could clearly see it was triangular in shape, and it continued to block out the stars as it moved directly overhead.  There was a dim glow at each point of the triangle.  I ran inside to get a camera, returned and took several pictures.  None of them developed.  It disappeared over the treeline to the west, and the hum diminished as the object moved further away.  It was a large object, but it was difficult to estimate it&apos;s actual size or distance from the ground.", "A flaming ball according to my dad and what I saw was a flash through the clouds.Through a gap in the clouds I saw a flash for an instant then it disappeared.

This is VERY close to John Wayne Airport, and anybody who lives in the area gets used to seeing planes all the time.  Nothing unusual. As I drove, I could still see the star in my perepheral vision easily, and I was startled when the start star started moving slowly. My first reaction was concern that the airplane was going in that same direction, so I looked back up and realized there is no way traffic control would allow two planes to fly so close together, heading toward eachother. At that point I had to concentrate on driving, because that road has a very sharp turn to the left--almost a 90 degree angle, which I had to make. After I turned, (going north)the only way to still see these was to take my eyes off of the road in front of me, and look left out of my window. Fortunately, I was the oonly car on the road at that time. After about the 2nd glance the bright star disappeared in front of my eyes. Unbelievable. I tried telling myself every logical explanation.

My wife and I ignored them at first, thinking they were seeing a contrail from a jet.  But taking a second look we began noticing unusual characteristics about the object that separated it from the hundreds of vapor trails we&apos;d seen from aircraft.  First, the object appeared to be moving very rapidly compared to conventional aircraft.  Second, the head of the object was indeed a distinct fireball shape with no clear separation between the object itself and the vapor trail as you expect in a jet.  Third the jet is rarely perceived at all or - if it is the object is smaller than the vapor trail itself especially in width - that is one usually perceives the contrail but no jet.  Fourth, the contrail was not in a straight vector as it trailed from the object, but was more whispy and appeared carried by the winds or the atmosphere.  Fifth, the contrail varied in size - both in length and width - as the object traveled. In fact, soon afterwards we observed a jet contrail and noted the distinct differences between it and what we just saw. For a brief moment we saw another object like the first.  The parties and myself are in a disagreement over whether this was the original object we saw at a greater distance, another object, or a jet. My personal opinion is that the object was either a very large piece of space debris, a crashing aircraft, a huge meteor, or an extraterrestrial craft.", "View a Chevron shaped objectWent into back yard and was looking for birds that I could hear flying overhead in the sky at the time and sighted a Chevron shaped craft with lights on both sides.  The sun was down and just before the stars really shine bright, the lights on the object were very dim (like the background stars) and were moving from the south to the north (pretty close to north to south).  There was no sound, you would really have to strain to see it as I was trying to see the birds and the lights were very dim.  Looking up at the object it looked like it was at a fairly high altitude but was fairly big.  If it was high in the sky then it was really huge and if it was low then it was small or like any other plan airline (747) and did not make any noise at all.  If memory serves me (40 minutes ago) there was about 3 lights on each side when I viewed it. I have seen planes in the sky before and have not found that there are that many lights on the wings and the wings were not set at the same angle that I viewed this time.  I only hope someone else has seen it too.", "A bright light was apparently chased by several military jets.In the fall of 1957, shortly before the Sputnik satellite went up, I was in front of our house in St. Paul when I heard the roar of F-89s. The F-89 was an all-weather, 2-seater, twin engine fighter interceptor based at the main airport. With its very loud J-35 jet engines, they never or rarely ever flew at low altitudes over the metro area. It wasn&apos;t unusual to hear them take off, but it sounded as if the noise was lasting longer than usual. It was about 7:00pm, and already dark (before the Daylight Savings Time era). (I couldn&apos;t positively identify the planes, but there was nothing else located there which made that much noise. The military areas of the airport also hosted F-80s, T-33s, C-47s, C-119s, Navy Phantoms, P2V Neptune sub hunters, helicopters, and miscellaneous others - none of which made such a horrendous racket. Commercial jets were not yet using the MSP airport except for 1 French twin engine jet which came and went, one day, as part of a sales mission.) After a while, I looked up and saw a row of red-hot exhaust pipes (or exhaust) and navigation lights all westbound, coming from the east at perhaps 5,000 feet. It looked like a string of firey brands. They were making one heck of a racket, and I took them for the F-89&apos;s. Then I noticed a bright light in the sky - brighter than Venus in the western sky, except this light was in the wrong place to be Venus: it was south-southwest from me at an angle of almost 45 degrees, and hanging nearly over the airport. At first I thought it must be some kind of expensive, well-done prank. Then I thought it might be a helicopter with intensely bright lights. Finally, I noticed that the planes appeared to be headed straight for the object. The object remained in place as if it had all day to make up its mind if it were going to move or not. Finally, it DID begin to move - slowly at first - towards the southwest. The jets adjusted course to the southwest. Then the object picked up more and more speed, and finally turned off its brilliant white light, and sped away. It was still barely visible for a few moments after it switched off its light, and had a dull, glowing orange appearance, and had some small white lights around the main body. The jets followed in that direction, and eventually disappeared. All the noise finally stopped. I ran into the house and checked all the TV channels expecting to see a report on the object chased by the F-89&apos;s, but there were no reports. Nothing. Just your typical Ozzie and Harriet, Gunsmoke, etc. Then I finally sat down to read the evening paper. On the front page was a small article which said: &quot;Mystery Object Sighted Over RAF Base. A mystery object was sighted today over one of Britain&apos;s RAF bases, but when pursued, it doused its light and sped away.&quot; I cut out the article and posted it on the bulletin board in our high school science class, explaining that I might have seen the same object.", "A saucer that was turned vertical that flashedWe were justt laying down on the trampoline in the backyard when we saw this light that looked like a star but it was moving It was too fast to be a plane and too slow to be a shooting star It flashed and then a nother one came on and then others, all going in different directions some that didnt make any sense for any type of airline like due south We decided to get binoculars so we did and we saw 2 of them and they look liker your classic saucer only turned vertical so it looked like a bubble When we looked through the binoculars we saw that the light was a dome on top and then there was a bigger dome then like a long thing like a cigar under that and we could see a spinning movement it was spinning vertically", "My husband and I were sitting out on our back porch, facing west, watching what seemed to be lightening. It was like strobeing lights coming out of the sky, but the lights stayed in the same spot for over an hour and stopped ever 112 seconds and started back up again.It was a cloudy night and my husband and I decided to sit out on our back porch to watch, what we thought, was lightening. After watching it for a while, we noticed that the strobeing lights never moved from the same small section of clouds and that there was no thunder or noise. Strobeing rays flashed downward out of the clouds erraticly, from the same spot for over an hour, stopping every minute and 12 seconds, just to start back up again. Every single time that we timed it, it was exactly the same spacing, between the pauses. Then all of a sudden, at around 23:??pm, they stopped. To tell you the truth, I have no idea what we were watching, except that it was very strange and that we have never seen it again, since that night. Note:  We live out in the country and there are no towns for miles in that specific, western direction. There is nothing out that way, other than other homes out in the country.", "At almost full daylight,I was going out my door towards the east to retreive my newspaper, and it was so beautiful to look at the sky with early colors on a few, sparce clouds.  Looking north through a ide space between two palm trees, I saw what I believed to be an airplane {what else would it have been?} and I was immediately intrigued because there was so much light coming from within.  It didn&apos;t have the shape of a plane, just oblong with huge lights.  I took four or five steps looking down to re-treive the newspaper and then immediately looked for what I had first believed to be an airliner approching for a landing at Palm Springs in the west.  The craft was no longer anywhere in the sky.  Nowhere!  Then was when I was just plain shocked...I had never believed in sightings ofunexplained objects...this I KNEW IMMEDIATELY was something very strange, unaccountable to me in any manner, for the object which was moving so slowly from my left toward the east was nowhere in the sky within a matter of perhaps six-seven seconds, the amount of time to move toward and pick up the paper.  Since I had been initially quite aware of so much light and had never before seen such a thing, I wanted to follow it&apos;s curve and appoach to the west.  It was my first thought that I had, indeed, seen something unexplainable.  Bear in mind that I have recently moved here from Bellevue, Wa. and saw approaching and departing aircraft for over 30 years and have NEVER seen anything flying so low, slow and so much light looking as though the windows were huge.  Since it was so low in the sky there was no sun up far enough to have been a long reflection, even as it moved slowly easternly.  I am 64 yrs old, female, very pragmatic, extremely well educated and read, recently retired from being a stock broker and certified financial planner.  I raised four children to be open-minded and ducated.", "For some reason I glanced up into a break in clouds, before opening the door of my house causing me to stare intently at a object,that was a strong luminecent orange circle(no fluxuation in intensity of luminecents),with high difinition edges around the circle. As if I were seen,it took off in a straight line about 3in, toward the West, before I lost sight of it because of clouds or surroundings, I don&apos;t know which.  I estimate the size to be that of a large airliner at 25,000 ft.,or the size of a dime,from the distance of 8 ft.  The objects luminecents got darker in the center of the object. The sighting only lasted a half second. There was no sound at all during the sighting that I could remember.", "One fireball orange.red, in slow motion.

Direction est-west.", "Flashing lighted object observed by an E-3A AWACS crew over the Mid-AtlanticMidway between Canada and Iceland at 31000 feet altitude we observed an object that was continually flashing from red to green to white.  I would have estimated the initial contact to be about 75 miles off the nose of our aircraft and at approximately the same altitude.  We were unable to pick up this object on our inflight radar...which had a range of over 500 miles.  The object stayed at off our nose for about 20 minutes before rising to what I would have guessed to be over 70000 feet in altitude.  It then came to a position almost directly over our aircraft.  It stayed in this position for about ten minutes before it took off in an easterly direction at what I would have estimated to be over 70000 feet in altitude.  I was the pilot on that particular flight.  At the time, I had over 3000 hours of flight-time, mostly in jet aircraft.  There were 17 other people on the aircraft who witnessed the same object.  I did not learn of your reporting facility until I started listening to Art Bell.  I&apos;m sorry my report could not have been more timely.NUFORC NOTE : Subsequent email to witness :Dear &lt;&lt;Name Deleted&gt;&gt;,Thank you very much for the fascinating report!  The olde reports I find to be every bit as interesting as the more recent ones.  The reports from professional pilots are particularly interesting, and useful.Thanks again for sharing the information with our Center!  Please pass our contact information along to other pilots, so that they will be able to preserve the information surrounding any sightings they may have had.NUFORC NOTE : Subsequent reponse from witnessThe type of aircraft I was flying was an E-3A AWACS aircraft.  This was a military aircraft with airborne radar and surveillance capabilities.  It has a crew of 17, all of whom witnessed the same object.  We should have been able to pick the object up on our in-flight radar which was fully functional at the time we saw the object. In reference to your second question, we tried to make a report when we landed in Iceland, but noone in our debriefing knew how or whom to report such an incident. I hope this info helps.  I find your reports on the Art Bell show very fascinating.  I wish I knew about his show 15 years ago.  Take care now.", "Seen from I-69 between Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Object had strobing lights that seemed to circle around it.The object moved from east to west in the sky.  It seemed odd because it was a cloudy night and I hadn&apos;t seen any planes because the clouds were low.  I could make it out as a circular object because the white strobing lights on it seemed to go around the object continuously.  About 5 or so of the lights in a row seemed to go from left to right on the object, then dissapear and reappear on the left, seeming as if the lights went around the perimeter of the object.  Besides the 5 or so white strobing lights, there were also a few stationary lights in the colors of red, green, and blue that also flashed but not nearly as fast as the white strobes.", "AT NIGHT ,WIND 20-25 FROM WEST MED TO HIGH CLOUDS SCATTERED OBERSEVED FUZZY LITE  OBJECT MOVING TO S/W 5-10 MPH NO SHAPE WAS NOTED CLOUDS IN BACKCROUND LIT AREA 50-75FT ACROSS COMPARED WITH HOUSES IN AREA ALT-150-250 ABOVE TREE LINE BLOCKED BY TREES OBJECT DISSAPERED OVER THEE LINE TO GOLF COURSE", "Object looked like a star, blue white very high altitude moving from South West to North East at a steady rate of speed and on a steady course. There was no sound as it was much higher than that of aircraft traffic even at cruise altitude. It may have been a satalite in orbit.

About two minutes after that object passed over a craft that was clearly a small jet passed over at about 5000 feet on the same heading as the unitentified object.", "Flying grey disk over Corvallis,Or10:30 pm at night April 30,2000 a friend and I were walking accross the street in front of the Corvalla Apts. off of 5th street. We saw a grey disk come from the right at remarkable speed. It was moving up and down in a wave like motion. Then it stopped in mid air! It was under the lower part of the clouds because we could see it was grey and saucer shaped. It stopped, shot downward...hovered and wobbled.... (no noise) shot up...stopped... and continued on out of site. I have NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS! My friend was in the Airforce and agreed that he never saw anything like it. This was too big for a bird and way too fast.This could not be a plane because it stopped in mid air, and there were no lights on it. This was definately a UFO. I feel so fortunate I was able to witness this.", "Very bright high flying Orange Triangle over San Francisco during Leonid Meteor showerI was watching the Leonid Meteor shower and had been observing it comfortably and consistantly for several hours.  The shower had not been very strong until approximately 02:00 in our area,  the cloud cover was minimal, and I was able to identify many constellations, paying particular attention to the East where the news reports said to look for the shower to develope.  Very clearly on the East horizon there appeared a very high and extremely bright orange light surrounded by a hazy triangular or slightly arrowhead shape that crossed slowly across the sky directly overhead.  I&apos;ve seen the shuttle re-entry overhead at night when told to look for it and it was similar in approximate altitude/size/shape but not in color.  The shuttle appeared pinkish.  The object simply SLOWLY crossed overhead horizon to horizon EAST TO WEST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.  It took approximately 30 seconds. THE REST OF THE EVENTS THAT NIGHT WERE IN NO WAY SIMILAR.  I observed scores if not hundreds of extemely fast moving white and yellowish/white streaks moving almost entirely in the opposite direction, West to East.  These seemed to be the typical meteroites that I have observed for years.", "large near black object triangle in shapeIwas standing out side in the carpark of were i work as a night time security gaurd when i saw this object moving slowly north west for about 7 seconds before it accelerated very quickly out of my sight It had no lights that a could see and because of the low cloud cover it really stood out. Iwould say about 300 ft up maybe. It really was amazing.No sounds that i coud hear.", "2 star lights rotate  around each other, one remained constant, other moved...I was walking looking at the aircraft lights in the sky. I have seen two stars rotating around each other. I have seen 2-3 exact circular rotations, it was slow rotations. One remained unmoving. It was impossible to distinguish them from stars. Their light was exactly a star light. Another one was moving , it was either moving or lowering, it can&apos;t be said. I have observed the moving light for 30 seconds until the view is cut by the trees. The motion was slow, i have though it&apos;s a meteorit, but it was too slow and the light remained, not dimmed. This event is observed in the center of istanbul having heavy air-traffic. at the same time 2-3 aircarfts were flying around. but the lights i have seen are not like any of them. and no plane can make such perfect rotations..", "saw first light, then second light, parked car to better observe, and saw third light light seemed very high alt. light intensity fluctuated many magnitudesWhile driving north on San Mateo blvd I noticed a very bright light in the sky north of my position at about 75 degrees up from horizon. It was so bright I first thought it was a reflection of the sun from a banking airplane. the light continued to long to be an airplane so I looked closer. The light was continuing and varied in intensness over several magnitudes of brightness I noticed a smaller light blinking at about 7:00 o&apos;clock to the left of the main light, and another small light blinking at about 5:00 o&apos;clock to the right. I still thought it might be a conventional air craft until I noticed that both of the secondary lights were blinking at random rates independent of each other. I then noticed a second main light at about 35-40 degrees east of the first light and at similar apparent height. It displayed similar properties of fluctuating light intensity as the first. The second main light appeared to have a single smaller light directly below it slowly blinking on and of. I saw a parking lot just before the intersection of San Mateo and Montgomery and pulled into it to better observe the lights. When I got out of my car I noticed that the two lights seemed to have increased the space between them but were moving almost imperceptably slow. Then I saw a third bright light about 25-35 degrees south of the first light. It appeared to be closer than the first two and was extremely bright. I could make out no shapes but all of the light fluctuated in light intensity. At the brightest they looked as bright as the sun (perhaps as a star the size of our sun were to look if it were in a binary orbit less than a light year away) the lights were many thims brighter than venus or jupiter would be under the best nighttime viewing conditions. As I watched, all three light moved very slowly, The first light moving toward the south east, the second moving due east, and the third moving towards the south. At one point I noticed that the second light seemed to take on an elongated shape but it could have been glare on the windsheild of my car. As I watched, I heard the sound of a commercial jet comong from the south (were the airport is) and as it came into view, all three light started to fade out. By the time the jet came into view, all lights had disapeared. I waited for a couple of more minutes but they did not reappear. I saw no other motorists stop to look at the lights. The duration of the observation was +/- 4 minutes The lights were pure white in color. I study the UFO issue and have observed all sorts of aircraft both day and night in the skys of albuquerque including commercial and military aircraft. I have also seen brightly illuminated weather balloon in the upper atmosphere. These light were like nothing I have seen before.", "Two bright lites hovering approximately 30,000 feet,they almost collided then flew off in opposite directions.It was about 9pm on a clear summer evening,no stars were visible at this time. I was standing in an open parking lot talking with some friends. I just happened to look up towards  the sky and suddenly two very bright lites appeared in the sky. Slowly they came towards eachother and seemed to stop momentarily,then the two objects zig zagged in opposite directions as if they were communicating. This lasted only seconds. Suddenly they sped off in opposite directions at a speed that was very fast,faster than anything I ever observed. I cannot estimate the hieght that these objects appeared,but I would say maybe between 25,000 and 40,000 feet. My freinds did not witness this it happened so fast. As I explained myself,they just laughed and made the remark that I was seeing things. But I know different,what I saw could not have from this world,it was most definitely a very strange occurence.", "Enormous silvery disk hovered for 3 minutes above Dallas Love Field airport (~10,000 ft).

Director of global support sitting in seat in front of me.  I said, &quot;((name deleted)), look at the military helicopters&quot;.  He was on the cell phone.  Most others were asleep around.  At this point I noticed a huge silver disk shaped object, metallic in nature, brilliantly reflecting sunlight, hovering at about 9-10,000 ft. above Dallas Love Field airport.   The copters were flying directly toward it.  ((name deleted)) then looked at the copters.   I said, &quot;what is that above them&quot;.  He said, &quot;something is flying above&quot;. I said, &quot;I think it is a UFO&quot;.  At this point, we both stared out the bus window transfixed.  I was determined not to take my eyes off it.  I should have yelled &quot;UFO&quot;, because there were at least 5 video cameras and 20 cameras on the bus, but I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off it. I know the object was extremely large, because eventually the helicopters were directly under it, in the same formation, and the diameter of the disk was larger than from  the back of the trailing helicopter to the front of the leading one.  This was actual, not apparent.  and the copters were about 8500-9500 feet below.   I haven&apos;t done the math on this yet, but if the length of that type of copter can be found, a reasonable estimate of the actual size of the craft can be derived. It was magnificent and beautiful. About 30 seconds after the copters were directly under it, it disappeared.  I wasn&apos;t even blinking, let alone looking away, and it simpy disappeared. The copters were out-of-sight in a few seconds after. Note:  altitude estimate derived from knowledge of meteorology and the apparent shrinkage of the copters as they approached it, time of day, and relative sizes of airplanes coming in and out of Love Field.

I live on the extreme west side of Las Vegas, central area.  The object was also seen by my wife, who I called to view it.  She brought two pair of binoculars and we watched the object as it continued toward us in an east bound direction. The object was orbiting in a tight circle as it was moving east.  So it was actually going in circles, but still keeping a straight eastbound course. At one point, a Plane that hat taken off from McCarran airport crossed the objects path and the object appeared to have stopped completely.  When the plane was well away from the object after passing in front of it, the object again started moving east until it was lost from our sight due to entering the brightly lit sky of the las vegas strip area.", "bright orange not to high up but move way to fast to not make any sounds,sharp turns at high speeds in and out of formation,dropped and went forward as if gravity diddn&apos;t exist.My mother came to visit me in maine and i took a friend with us out for the weekend with her.

But, the question that I am curious to have answered is:  Has anyone witnessed an object that makes no sound, is about a large as a hot air balloon&apos;s balloon - and round, and had a colour in almost exactly the same colour as the orange coloured street lights?  It had an aura about it but didn&apos;t cast any light on the ground!  Is this one of your usual type of sightings - it followed me at a distance and when I rounded the road and went up and over a hill it slowly came over the rise and down into the valley.  There were no reports of any aircraft in the area that night and it has bothered me for many years now.

Object was clearly seen but appeared and disappeared quickly.Traveling north on Highway 99 north of Lodi, CA and while traveling adjacent to the local airport which is alongside and perpendicular to the west side of the highway I briefly saw a rod shaped object. It hung directly over the freeway above the treeline. Although there was nothing in the sky to compare it to, my sense was that the object was about 30 feet long and about one quarter of a mile away at an altitude of maybe 100 to 150 feet. What first attracted my attention was a series of 4 to 6 sequentially flashing bright white lights, with possibly one or two smaller non-flashing lights inbetween the flashing lights. The object seemed to be in fairly sharp focus and I could see a thin gray or black rod that the lights seemed to be mounted to. The rod was at an angle of about 60 degrees, like a clock arm pointing at the number 11. It did not appear to be moving. My first thought was that it was a plane approaching the airport, although if it was approaching from the north it would be perpendicular to the runway. This was quickly followed by the thought that it might be a radio tower with flashers on it, although as I said, it hung directly over the freeway. Then it just simply disappeared as though someone threw a switch. I couldn&apos;t believe it and kept staring at the spot in the sky where I saw it. It made me wonder if any of the other motorists saw it. The whole sighting lasted about 2 seconds. The sighting occurred just as the sun was setting and the sky was still light colored.

About 12 feet or better from lower lights to the single upper light. Single light appeared to be about 3 to 4 times as large as the lower lights. The upper light was a white light where as the lower lights had a slight yellow or amber tint, not dark, however. The lower lights traveled from left to right. They cycled in a line or revolved and seemed to go faster as the craft increased in speed. When I observed it as it moved away it took about 8 - 10 seconds for the lights to make a revolution. It came from north to south traveling about 40 mph. It went south towards the south hill area towards the radio towers. Then I observed it going west when it became lost from view. I first observed it with the naked eye then with 7-21x35 power binoculars. I first saw it as it came into my line of sight above my head. It was about 100 yards away. This distance was easy to verify as I had an office building and telephone poles of known size to compare the craft to. The cycling lights were most impressive, giving me the errie feeling in that I have never seen anything like it before, this close, having seen unexplainable lights while living in Alaska many years ago. The next thing that was more impressive was how slow it was moving and still being able to remain airborne. But most impressiive was the total lack of noise usually associated with aircraft. Prior to the momennt I first noticed the aircraft, I was watching a fire truck on Freya St. They had about a dozen lights flashing. Red and white strobes. They were quite bright. There were no sirens or anything like that. They were just checking fire plugs. While watcing the truck the aforementioned craft appeared in my line of sight above me. It appeared to slow some as it to abserve the firetruck and its lights. At this time I noticed that the cycling of the lights was almost negligable, but seemed to increase as it moved away.

It was as bright as Saturn, which was also clearly visible as the night was very clear.Looking due West, the star (?) was almost half way between the Pleiades and the constellation Auriga. Then, as I was looking directly at it, it disappeared. It took about two seconds as it faded from view, dimming in brightness and then disappearing.

The evening was rather dark, the moon, if it was &quot;up,&quot; provided no illumination. The sky was clear and starry with good definition to the horizon except for a hint of ground fog settling in the lowest pockets of the valley floor. Suddenly our attention was drawn by an intensely bright, white light that rose abruptly into the low western sky ahead of us just slightly left of center. Both the nature of its sudden and jerky rise, and the intensity of this light source, caused us to watch the object closely, and it appeared to be either stationary or slowly heading towards us at a constant elevation. As we continued driving, we noticed that it was indeed getting closer and that there were in fact two, not one, bright lights. We also noticed that the lights were not white as first thought, but a very strange amber white that projected from the object like piercing &quot;pencil beams&quot; of light. It also soon became clear to us that out paths would soon cross and this object was no airplane or helicopter. We were about one mile west of the Napa Rd. turnoff when we got our first good look at the object and realized that if its course remained the same, it was going to pass directly over us in a matter of moments. Realizing this, I pulled off the road onto the shoulder and looking up out of my open window, watched it do just that. My best guess on its altitude is about 2000 ft and at it was at least 300 ft across (wide) and approximately 250 ft long. It may well have been even larger if I underestimated its altitude. Its shape was very similar to that of a manta ray (which I realize makes this account seem less credible) with its underside dark and muted browns. The underside was also highly detailed, not spherical and aerodynamic, with what may have been low-profile compartments or holds. The aforementioned 2 lights were on the front of the craft, and between them appeared to be a dimly lit area of some possibly transparent material. The 2 lights were still on as it passed overhead and they were quite unlike anything we had everr seen&mdash;intensely bright and focused. It also seemed to have some sort of revolving light arrays at the end of each wing that had briefly emanated a flashing red and white pattern (ike a commercial jet) only moments before. There was no visible means of propulsion as the craft passed silently overhead, but both of us could swear that we could &quot;feel&quot; it, like a low resonant vibration. After it passed overhead, I spun the car around in the shoulder area to pursue the craft, but as I did, the craft bolted southeast, displaying &quot;instantaneous&quot; acceleration, and was some 5 miles away before I had reached the paved road surface. As I reached the roadway, it bolted again and was now only faintly visible some 10-15 miles away, and then it was gone.", "Driving home from work, I saw aircraft descending for ohara airport landing...four blocks from worksite, I looked back to watch descent..and saw one very large, aircraft...much larger than 747.It was only a couple of blocks up in sky. It wasnt moving but hoovering..motionless. It could have been even slowly rotating. It was thin..but.huge.I went to my car in the company parking lot..after work, and saw airplanes descending in flight patterns toward Ohare Airport. I entered my car and drove eventually in a westerly direction which would have been perpendicular to where one of the planes would have been as it descended very low toward runway paths.  From my car as I drove, I turned to view this extremely huge aircraft. It was very low to ground..only a couple of blocks up.  It was much, much larger than a 747...It looked man-made..but what caught my attention even more..was that it wasnt moving...It seemed to be fixed in one position...almost as if it was some kind of &apos;platform&apos;.  It was well lit...It even seemed to be slowly rotating...It was shaped similar to a very thin fusalage with very long wings. I cant remember if it had any engines..I dont remember seeing any.  I slowed my driving, but for some reason, I didnt stop..and finally the aircraft went out of view.  I definitely felt I had seen something futuristic..but it didnt seem to be a spacecraft.  It looked as if it was some kind of a huge bomber or observation vehicle.  And, again....it didnt move..and it made no sounds.  I think it even cast a shadow on the homes below from its own colored and white lights....Thats all I remember.", "A light came toward us and stopped directly overhead.  It stayed there a couple seconds then shot off very fast.  No noise.Object was a single white light that came slowly toward us about 200 yards above our heads and stopped. It was a circular shape and made no noise at all.  After a couple seconds it shot off.  We had been sitting outside the old radio station at Buckner Childrens Home sneaking a cigarette.

A red and blue light was seen as it flew away. We could see it somewhere over NJ as we drove on the West Shore Expressway in Staten Island. We watched it as it appeared to hover or fly slowly over NJ. Its red and blue lights visible, it began to accelerate as its bright light re-appeared. We watched for a few minutes as it finally seemed to hover over Staten Island again. We slowed down to about 15 MPH as we watched its lights began to dim and the craft began to tilt upwards towards a 90 degree angle. Its shape appeared to be maybe triangular but once the lights dimmed we could not tell for sure. We estimated its distance from us at about 1000 yards and an altitude of 1000-2000 feet. We did not hear any sounds from this craft at all.We did not stick around to watch what happened next as traffic beared down on us from behind, we exited the expressway.

He said it appeared to be moving in a downward direction from West to East...and he said it wasn&apos;t real fast but seemed slower than a meteorite might have been and way bigger. We speculated later as to whether it might be the satellite which was supposed to enter earth on the 19th or so.....but decided that it was probably wrong trajectory and direction.

I was at the corner of Ramuda and the block behind my home when I somehow became aware of many lights coming toward me very slowly and deliberately.  They were red in color and not too bright but low, very low to the ground coming right towards me.  At first I thought,oh it&apos;s helicopters from the airforce base or something.  The lights were in a v shape but a very wide or fat v.  I saw 4 lights that seemed to be evenly apart and one lagged behind, uneven compared to the rest.  As they got closer still, I was acutley aware that this wasn&apos;t just helicopters                     because they were close, low and no sound could be heard from them at   all.  I just stood there in total awe.  Even the dog seemed to be aware  of this object or objects.  The object changed altitude right in front  of me, I tried to see stars throught he middle of the lights but saw  none.  As the object moved away it turned toward the west from coming  south and west. As the object changed direction,I could only see 3 lights,still red in color. It also changed speed.  I live in North  Phoenix in a subdivsion called Tatem Highlands closest crossroads being      Tatem and Jomax.  Many of my neighbors walk dogs late at night, however I seemed to have been out alone this particular night.  There were three folks I yelled at immediatly after the object moved away from me, but they didn&apos;t seem to understand what I was saying.

Flashing lights and intenesity with flashes.  Blue, white, red, yellow..and green by a few of the observers.  Disappeared in a flash then reappeared in same spot more than once.  Went to new location out of town...and then spotted to more craft.  Using binoculars, you could see that when the first obj. flashed...the 2nd and 3rd seem to mimick the flashes.  We observed for over one hour...when the first once just seemed to head slowly over the hills and disappear.  the other two remained and we did not stay long to see when they were gone.  The objects did not appear as a star twinkling or as a planet. They flashed multiple colored lights...and in sychronicity.  They stayed in once place, and the first and brightest one appeared to spin as the lights had a neon...tracer effect when the light sourse is moving.  The second one actually had a second lite off to its side, but really couldn&apos;t see it without the binoculars.  it had a black space with no stars behind the two lights.  Interesting fact: there was a Delta II launch from VAFB that afternoon.i entered most information in the above statement.  The observers were four adults and one 11 year old girl.  Two men and two women and one daughter.  The two women had had a few glasses of wine but the men were completely alcohol free.  The first man who saw the first object timed the event on his watch.  He alerted first his fiance to come see, then me, the wife and co-home owner of the yard where we were visiting and sky watching.  My husband also observed as did my daughter.  We used our own vision and 1 pair of binoculars.  This enabled to see the flashes as flashes of colored lights...and the slight movement of perhaps spinning...but not going anywhere.  3 of us...the other couple and myself are avid readers on the subject of UFOs and such topics.  I have never seen anything like this...or anything similar even though i wonder whats out there, and always look to the skys.  The first man, has said that he has had a few (2 or 3) unusual sightings...in his life.  His fiance is very intuitive and open to unusual possibities.

He said the width covered the span of five to seven houses, which might not make sense, but this is what he said. My son stopped to look at it, and did a doubletake, because he could not believe what he was looking at. Afterwards, he ran home to tell me.  I walked to where the sighting took place(perhaps I should have taken my car)and unfortunately it was gone.  We just wanted to let you know. Thank You...The object was bright and yellow similar to the sun,with an oval shape.  It was described as having clouds all around it, but I assume this is due to probably actual clouds in the sky;however,I must admit it is a clear night out.

A strange sensation was report by female then I felt it too.This started the abduction scenario. I remember very much of it and has thought of it almost everyday since then. It startedf with two of them, then at the ship another was there whose form I saw outlined by a goldish light and he communicated with me by beaming a very bright ultraviolet light. I do not know how we float aboard the ship but I remember come off it with my female friend and it was like walking on something solid that was also transparent. We all spoke of many things some which I remember and other things I cannot fully recollect. They took us some place and showed me some things. One thing they said that really has stayed in my mind. I asked where are you from? The reply was, &quot;How can I tell you where we are from if you do not know where you are at&quot;. They mentioned something about coming from north over Canada and they said something about south. They told me that one of their crafts could take on the entire world, and at that time, I did not know it to be true, but they said that Russia had more milatary might then the U.S. I told them that I was going to tell my people about the incident, and after they made me &amp; my female friend understand, believe, and know to be true, what the ones who I called my people would do to us, after we left them and went to the police station to get help for my car which would not start up, we only laughed when they asked us where we were. Then they asked us where are the two kids who took us into the woods, and we said that we did not know anything about taking two kids into the woods. Later, many years afterwards, I understood that the person who called the police witnessed the abduction. When we repilied to the question, &quot;where have you been?&quot; and we said, in the car. The patrolman replied,&quot;Lt. , I search the car, they could not have been in the car.! We call ed someone from our college, a friend of mines who I transfered to that particular college with, and he came to pick us up. He arrived at the station somewhere near 3:30 a.m.; this person is currently a prosecutor in Newark, NJ,Essex Co. During 1979 or 1980 I underwent hypnosis and began remembering bits and parts of the abduction. On this day I remember so much of it and seem to be even getting more pieces to the puzzle. Here is something that I remember and looked forward to see. I asked would we all be dead by the year 2000; to that question the answer was, &quot;I cannot say&quot;.I have written a lot above this section. Here is another part that I remember. The older individual ( about 2500 yrs. old our time) asked me to look into his eyes, and I called him a big eyed ((deleted)) in my mind. As soon as I thought that something hit me in the head very hard. I asked him how did you do that ((deleted)),  because it seems like he never got up from his seat. After that I was his friend. Now here comes another part, I told him that he was not real because I can see the spirit in a person and I saw nothing in him. At that point I saw or felt or sensed the being of a very good person who was very old like 2500 years old. Then I asked them or at least some point in the contact I asked what the universe is like. And a younger one said, it is like your sea. It seemed like he was saying or said that there is life in the universe like there is life in your sea. They told me that the universe has many kinds of spirits, and that there are very high spirits around. That next day or the night of the next day I have come to Jersey City to have my car repaired because it had a warranty (30) days and this was something like the 28th day of having been purchased. A VW and a regulator went or something like that.

I replied, oh yes I will.(editorial: I know this seems hard to believe and I&apos;ve confided in some people close to me like my family members, some cousins and close friends but this is what happened).

As it got closer it was a large  blue/green colored spaceship with four large lights or windows.  The blue rays came down through the trees and lit up the back yard and bedroom as well as myself.  I got away from the window because I was&apos;t sure if it was coming down. I would say it might have been approximately 25 ft. in diameter.  It is hard to judge size when in the air.  It came from north and curved around to the east very quietly.  It only appeared for about 15 seconds and then went out of sight due to other trees and roofs of homes..

We received many other dramatic reports about this incident, which was seen over Ontario, Canada, as well, where it generated several news reports.  One news camera crew caught the object on video, and it clearly was not a typical fireball or meteor.  In addition, the video, a copy of which NUFORC received from Amy Hebert, a UFO investigator from The Colony, TX, clearly shows a small, bright object rising from apparently ground level, passing behind clouds in the distance, and perhaps merging with the &quot;fireball&quot; as it passed overhead Canada.

My wife thought there might have been two lights close together at the center of the object. We could not discern an outline. Our best guess as to size and distance is something about the size of a passenger jet at 500 to 1000 feet altitude, but traveling at least two or three times as fast as we would expect to see a plane move. We were driving north, and the object crossed our path moving from east-southeast to west-northwest. We saw it traverse about two-thirds of the sky, in a straight line. Then it suddenly disappeared well before it reached the western horizon. My wife saw it change color to bright red for an instant before it winked out. Since I was driving, I missed the color change. There were patches of light haze, but stars were clearly visible throughout the sky. I immediately stopped the car and scanned the sky to be sure there were no clouds it could have flown into.

We saw 5 bright orange kite-shaped lights arranged in a &quot;question mark&quot; formation.  The sky was cloudy  but we could tell they were much larger and closer than stars.  They were up very high, like planes, but we knew they weren&apos;t moving like planes. We saw them in formation for about 15 minutes, and then they started fading in color. They looked almost like flames painted in the sky. Their shape, from where WE were watching, was a cross between  a kite or teardrop, and a flame, but they didn&apos;t &quot;flicker&quot; like flames. Their size seemed to remain the same as they paled to light cream, and then suddenly, one by one, they were only a white dot higher in the western sky. My husband(engineer) thinks they disappeared like an extinguished flame. He thinks it&apos;s all a hoax. To me, it looked like their speed changed rapidly when they changed from pale lights to white dots(WARP SPEED!) As the first 5 were fading one by one, 3 more started rising slowly from the north. They seemed to come over the horizon from approximately E. State St., possibly over St. Anthony&apos;s Hospital, which has a HUGE steel helicopter port with  lots of blinking  red and white lights on it.( BEST BUY is directly across the street.) As these final 3 lights moved towards us, 2 of them seemed to be directly side by side, and at one point it looked as though their side &quot;arms&quot; actually touched.  Then they separated and moved higher in the sky.  Those 3 did not make any particular formation, and 2 faded out fairly quickly, but the last one stayed alone in the same spot for close to 10 minutes, as though it was &quot;observing &quot; all the people watching it ! There were many people out observing, from our house all the mile and a half to E. State St. On our block alone we know of 10, plus 2 others on nearby streets. In addition , someone in the area of Alpine and Newberg Roads,(1 mi.west and north)got it on Video and reported this sighting to the local T.V.news.(The video wasn&apos;t shown on T.V.) Also, while WE saw lights that did not seem to be round, our neighbors further north saw what they called &quot;balls of light,&quot; but they saw the same formation and number of light, and at the same time, so it may have been the angle at which we were viewing this phenomena. I first heard about these mysterious light several weeks ago, when a fellow teacher confided inme that he had seen them on a Friday night at 9 PM, just as he was leaving the store next to BEST BUY. He lives close by, so he had time to get home and videotape the lights he saw.  I asked to see his tape and hee is making me a copy, so that the original does not get lost. If it looks useable, we will send you a copy.  Today one of my students told me her neighbor also made a video of one of the sightings, so I&apos;ll check into that as well.The one thing I want to stress is that some people here in Rockford have tried to dismiss these incidences as shooting stars or &quot;Northern Lights,&quot; meteor showers, flares, etc. Flares are the closest possible explanation to what WE saw, but I don&apos;t know if flares could remain stationary for 15 minutes. (My son wondered if they could have been flares on balloons?) The other suggestions all fall DOWNWARD, and these lights started low and moved upward. In addition, another reliable person said he saw the lights some weeks ago, and he saw them move into several different formations: Diamond, square, circle, etc. Finally, the girl that first called us to go out and look said she saw what looked like ashes falling from one of the several lights she saw.", "At about 10:30PM, I was on westbound I-275 and Highway 128 when a Huge EGG or Top shape object was right above my vechile moving north.04/23/00 10:30PM ----   I was traveling westbound with a friend on Interstate 275 when me and my friend saw a HUGE egg or a top shape object slowly moving north.

Also saw faint red flashes interminent at different distances, still in close proximity, but didn&apos;t see them when not looking thru binnoculars. I know the stars can &quot;twinkle&quot; and play games with your head but this didn&apos;t seem to be a star/planet/nebula as the binnoculars are not that powerful(10X50). I live under a flight path for incoming traffic to Boston/Logan Airport and like to watch the different planes come and go but this was not anything like I have seen before. I focused on the object with the binnoculars and when I looked at the stars I had to refocus to see them clearly and vise versa. The weather was crystal clear/full moon. I really do not think this was a plane. I&apos;ve watched them for many years, I know when a plane at high altitude is coming straight towards you it seems not to be moving for a long time but this was definatly different.

Also, the object is in that part of the sky where both Jupiter and Saturn are located at the time indicated, although they do not &quot;twinkle&quot; the way some stars do.  We will contact the witness again to see if the object is still visible on a later date.))", "witnesses watched 3 large sphere move slowly to the West, hover and then each disappear.This event took place in Jan. or Feb., 1968. I was picking up my cousin and her son to attend a drive-in movie and as I drove out Casitas Pass Rd., I observed a huge orange (more the color of fire than sodium lights) moving thru Casitas Pass into Carpinteria valley.  It was traveling low as I could see the outline of the hills behind it. I honked &amp; yelled for them (including her husband) to come out and see it.  Her husband got a quick glimpse before the view was blocked by the avacado orchard across the street. We quickly drove to the frontage road that runs along beside Hwy 101 (going South) where we would have an unobstructed view. This rd is very close to the ocean as well as the S. end of the valley. There were 3 of these &apos;glowing&apos; craft...at arm&apos;s length, the size of a dinner plate. We were with 1/2 - 3/4 mile from these objects as they flew below and to the N. of Rincon mts. As we stepped from the car to watch we noticed several cars in the S. bound lanes of Hwy 101 pull over &amp; people getting out to look at these things! They slowly moved out over the ocean...hovering not far from shore for several minutes &amp; then, one by one, went &apos;out&apos;.. like a switched light. Nothing was in the newspaper (Santa Barbara Newspress) or on the news. The next evening a neighbor (technican/aero-space co.) also observed them but at a much later hour.

We have an airport further to the west, but my father&apos;s a pilot and my husband works for Northwest and I KNOW these were not planes.  They stayed there unmoving.

I watched it, and it was moving very slowly, much slower than approaching aircraft, and this craft itself was about 2-3000 ft. higher than approaching aircraft.  It seemed to be further away than the approaching aircraft in distance and at about 40&deg; from the horizon.  It moved very slowly for about five minutes, then turned and went the other way in the same speed.

Latitude, on the Island of Hawaii, my friend had been telling me for some years that he had spotted a metallic sphere that hovered at a fairly high altitude over his house, I hoped that I too may be lucky enough to see this object, On Feb. 28 2000 we where looking up at the stars at about 9.45 p.m. that evening when I spotted what looked like a flash bulb going off, we continued to watch , after a few minutes there was another flash in the same basic location, this continued with several more flashes until we saw no more, the next day on Feb.29 at  1:35 p.m.  HST my friend had awaken from a nap and walked outside, he said a little voice in his head said &quot;look up&quot; and there it was, he yelled for me and I ran outside and it was straight up in the sky, the object was a round sphere shape which was very bright and reflective,emitting no sound, and hovering at a altitude of roughly 30 t0 35,000 feet, it&apos;s size was comparable to a jet liner, easy to spot with the naked eye, so we quickly grabbed two pairs of binoculars and laid flat on our backs and focused in on it, we watched the craft for close to 40 minutes, with the field glasses we could see the object very clearly as it moved ever so slightly from side to side, the suns reflection would move from left to right on its metallic surface as it hovered side to side, at this point we had my friends wife and mother in law watching with us, they to confirmed it was not a balloon, aircraft, or a satellite, this thing hovered, then while we were watching this thing with the field glasses it looked like! it expl oded for an instance, a fairly large vapor like cloud engulfed the craft, a perfectly round cloud, and you could see two smaller round spheres emerging from its center, two craft where now visible, they too where metallic and round and exactly one half the size of the original object, as the two craft split apart they to hovered and separated more, we continued to watch them for 5 to 10 minutes longer until they made there slow ascent into the sky, we watched them move indepentitally upward until they were out of sight, what a buzz!!!!!. The next day we rounded up a telescope and watched for the next few days, with no sightings in the day, but observed the Flashes in the night sky most every night and in different locations, some flashes where very bright, in random locations, we spotted satellites and these were totally different. Then on March 5 Th. at about 8:30 p.m. HST I was looking at the moon through the telescope and had my friends son was with me, he is 7 yrs Old, I had him standing on a tree stump so he could look into the telescope, I was holding him while he looked, as he was looking I looked up and saw a very bright light in the sky above the house, I thought what star is this, then it moved slightly, I quickly moved the boy from the telescope and asked him if he saw the light, he responded, &quot; YES UNCLE &quot; we quickly moved to a better position to view it, the light was like a headlight shinning down, then it started to move away, flying a squirrelly type flight path away, again not a sound coming from it. Then on Feb. 14 Th. At about 11:30 p.m. my Hawaiian mom came up and got me, I was packing my suitcase, we went outside only to view another bright object move across the sky, with more flashes, in the 5 weeks I was on the Island we viewed  flashes in the night sky, from random locations, there is no airports close to where we  where, or any flights at night at all, no air bases or anything of that nature, this brings me to one last sighting we had in July or Aug of 96 on the Big Island with my wife, my same friend and his wife and the same little boy, only 3 yrs old then, we were returning to H.V.N.P. from Kona after a day of fishing and it was dark about 8:00 p.m. HST, we were just before the turn off for Southpoint on the main HWY. When my friend says &quot; LOOK &quot; out the right side of the car coming in over the ocean we see a flat disk shape object with a small half round dome in the center top of it with rounded edges front and back of the disk part, it was coming in over the ocean at a very low rate of speed, what you would expect to see if it was a jet coming in on a landing lets say, and its angle of decent was nearly parallel to the land, it was trailing a beautiful day glow green color, a meteorite would be very fast and most likely a steep decent, this was not, as it passed by us it flew into the side of Mauna Loa,  just behind the town of Na&apos;alehu, upon impact it  emitted a large bright flash of white light, and  no sound, we continued home and ! slept th e night. The next day we made some calls to the local police, they heard of nothing, the newspaper, nothing, we call the observatory at Mauna Kea, nothing, we drove back to the town of Na&apos;alehu and asked the locals, they heard and saw nothing, there was a fire burning up in the hills that had started that night and a fairly large fresh burned grass fire next to the road, we looked around the area for awhile for wreckage but found none, had the men in black already been there!!!! .

After scanning the skies briefly and seeing no plane, my eyes fell upon a long, white or light silver colored object gliding quickly, steadily from northwest to south east. I probably watched it for 10, maybe even 15 seconds. It seemed to fade in and out of visibility, but would always be where it should have been on a regular path. It did not reappear where it had disappeared. Then a small plane did fly over, and the object disappeared for good, but it was clear that the object was lower than the plane. It was a light sunny day, few clouds. It was clear that the object had been traveling faster than the airplane (some sort of small plane) was.

The star was the largest light and it was white.  The red light began above both the others, then descended in a fairly straight line to be below the others, then moved north to be directly under the one white light, which was to the left of the star in my view.  Then the red light disappeared; just winked out.  Then the white light above it winked out as well.  I checked for haze or clouds, but there were none and I continued to see a clear view of the star.  On our way driving out, we saw a white flash of light from the left of the road (south), but were unsure what it was.I had what I believe may qualify as a UFO sighting just 45 minutes ago. My friend, ((deleted)), and I were driving, trying to get away from town and out and about. Went down Eagle River Road. Eagle River is a town about 10 miles outside Anchorage. We took this road ... it&apos;s pretty long. I need to gauge it. I remember hitting the odometer on our way out and noting the time. Anyhow ... it dead-ends in the midst of mountains, part of Chugach State Park. We stopped and ((deleted)) said she had to go, so I took the time to step out and gaze at the stars, hoping that maybe I&apos;d see some planets as I know they&apos;re about to align. Didn&apos;t really expect to, since we&apos;re so far north ... spotted a satellite in the southern sky. Turned my gaze to the east and saw 2 white lights and a red one. At first, I assumed they were stars or planets. The red one began to move. It was above the other two, then went downward and below, then crossed under the white light on the left. Then it disappeared. The white light above where the red one disappeared also disappeared. I thought that perhaps they were planes that went behind a haze or clouds or something, but the one star that was in the same vicinity had never disappeared. As the red light was descending, I remember waving my arm at Trista, who had jumped in the van, and saying, &quot;((deleted)), come here and look at this! ((deleted)), come here and look at this!&quot; She absolutely refused to get out of the van. I stayed and watched the sky a few moments after the two lights winked out, but saw nothing more, so returned to the van and asked why she hadn&apos;t come out. She said she&apos;d had a terrifying feeling and didn&apos;t want to get out. She&apos;d jumped in the van and locked the door just before I&apos;d noticed the strange movement of the lights. When I got back in the van, the time was 11:45. I can&apos;t recall, bummer that it is, what time it was when we arrived. We were last at a funeral reception and the last time I&apos;d checked the time, it was 10:38. We might not have left until 11 PM, and it could well have taken 45 minutes to get way back where we were, so I don&apos;t think there was any missing time. However, after I got back in the van and we waited a few minutes to see if anything else would show, we started to drive out and saw a flash of white light. There were no other vehicles around; perhaps it was a ranger with a flashlight? I don&apos;t know. We just left! &lt;G&gt;", "As a young man, I would lay out in the yard at night and look at the sky--I often saw an object moving at night speed, very high, no noise, moving from north to south, right along the coast.

I lived on the Alamitos Bay Penninsula, just south of Long Beach, California.  The objects were always by themselves and always moved from the north to the south--you see a shooting star for a second or two and then it disappears--these went from horizon to horizon--never at any set time, but I could always count on seeing them late at night--my binoculars 7X50 didn&apos;t do anything to enhance what I was seeing--I could see only the light, which was whitish in color.

I could see it above the trees (which line both sides of street) from far down the road. I could have stopped right in front of it, but I decided to turn left (east) on Columbus Street, go down a ways, then turn around, and observe it from farther away. When I got turned around, it was much farther off, and almost straight ahead (west) on Columbus. I then went to my nearby house, and observed it out my back window (west) for at least 45 minutes. It moved very slowly, but stayed roughly in the same spot-no sudden movements. I did observe another craft in the area that went past it-had flashing white light I believe-not sure if it was another, or an airplane.

Definitely greenish, not blue-white like lightning or sheet lightning.  No thunderclap or any aircraft sounds.  The light source moved from south to north along a line paralleling Interstate 5, east of Corvallis.  Thick, broken clouds prevented any direct view, but the multiple green flashes were distinctly brighter than the moon which was south and east at the time of the sighting.

This sighting was similar to the February fireball in terms of the definite greenish cast and the fact that it suddenly flashed into view, i.e. the immediate, lightning-bright flash above the cloud layer, and that tonight&apos;s whatever it was traveled what seems to have been the same south-to-north trajectory.  At least three or four distinct, bright green flashes against a bright green glow that covered at least 25 percent of the sky for about 10 seconds.", "WELL THEY ARE BACK AGAIN!!! while at a church youth group meeting we were let out for a break as we left the building we observed two fireballs in the sky to the east of us low in the sky they did not move and made no noise they disappeared in the same fashion as before the craft were about half the size of the moon and appeared to be about 100 to 150 ft above the ground .this makes the third year in a roll that these craft have appeared i have sent video clips to you from the last two years and hope to take more this year as well as soon as we get some more footage we will send it your way i plan to pick up a new digital camera with a greater zoom and looking for a filter so we can cut the bright light that is emitted from them as we hope to be as close as possible", "I was in my deer stand when i seen a light it came down wright over top of me.A beam of light came out when it left it was allmost day lihgt.I got in my deer stand around 3:30 am after sitting there for about 5 to 10 minutes.I looked up in the black sky and seen soom lights there were three white lights and a row of colored lights in the back,red,green,blue,yellow and think there was ornge.As it came closer i could tell it was a triangle shape.It came down tree top leavel about 25 yards away from me on the other side of the creak.When it started across the creak the row of colored lights went out.Then a beam of light came out of the middle.When it got wright over me i could not see the ship just the out line and the ligts it blended with the night sky.It made no sound what so every.It was only about 15 feet from me.I never seen any thing fly so slow.It seamed to last only for about 5 minutes.About two years latter i relized when it was leaving it was starting to get day light.So now im wondering what happend because it hade to last alot longer than what i could remember.So what happend to me i guess ill never know.The worst part is not knowing.I only told a couple of pepole of course they all laughed at me and told me i was crazy.I know what i saw and its the truth.", "Observed curious point light source about 20 degrees above horizon.

Slowing our vehicle down, I realized the object was not stationary but rather traveling at a snail&apos;s pace in the sky west of 72nd at a consistent altitude and did not appear to have any wings, lights nor was any sign of propulsion (contrails) evident.  Although I can cannot accurately estimate the distance that the object was from me with nothing to use for a reference, it did not appear to be more than a couple thousand feet up in the sky as it traveled west/southwest.  The object appeared to be roughly about an inch long and a 1/8 of an inch thick if I could pinch it between my fingers at an arms length.  The sky was clear with very few cumulus clouds high above and nothing obstructed my veiw of the object.  As I turned west on State street and pulled over to get a better look, the slow moving object totally disappeared from view.

Bright as the sun, very unusual sighting.  See full descriptionAt 1132 PDT on 3/18/00 while flying a cessna C206 at 5,500&apos; on a heading of 155 magnetic, approximately between Bremerton and Tacoma, WA airport, we sighted an extremely bight light with an intensity approaching that of the sun at about our 12:30 to 1:00 position. The haze layer top was about 4,000&apos; and this light appeared to be below the haze layer top.  It was judged to be south of Fort Lewis Army base but north of the hills south of Fort Lewis.  Sky conditons were clear and unlimited visibility above the haze layer.  We initially thought it to be light reflected from a metal roof but the light stayed in the same relative position making that unlikely.  I held my thumb to the light and was able to block it out but the size of the light must have been very large as I judged it to be many miles away.  After a couple of minutes another light appeared over and separated from the large round light.  This was a more flat or crescent shape, roughly the same diameter as the round light.  I attempted to call Tacoma Tower to ask if they had it in sight but they did not answer.  Due to airspace restrictions I had to descend to pass over the southern tip of Vashon Island.  In the descent, at about 4,500&apos; the light suddenly disappeared. I have been a pilot for 47 years, military and civilian with over 20,000 flying hours.  I have not seen a similar event during that time and judge this to be out of the limits of anything I have noted during those flying hours. I did not have a camera with me so have no photos. The intensity would be similar to White Phosphorus burning but in this sighting, no sign of drifting or descending as a white Phosphorus shell or flare  would exhibit so I ruled that out.  The intensity was near that of the sun.((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date to 18AP00.  We have made correction here.  PD))", "Circular jet black object remained motionless in the sky for 10 minutes then smoothly moved away out of sight.I began looking at the sky due to a great deal of plane exhaust trails,  there were a few that were very dark, nearly black, many of these trails also ran parallel to eachother. As I came into a clearer view of the sky I saw a round black object remaining motionless. Initially I thought this was simply a child&apos;s balloon that had been lost. This was near a supermarket so this does happen sometimes. However, this thing (judging by its distance and height) was far too large to be a balloon, also its stillness was strange enough to capture my attention. After about ten minutes planes began to appear, one with the black exhaust trail. Within a  minute of the planes&apos; appearance the object began moving away in an arc, and was gone within a minute or so. I thought I may have seen some movement on the sides of the thing, not unlike the movements of a bird&apos;s wings (this is perhaps the strangest part of the whole affair). My initial thought was weather balloon, yet this was in a very populated area and no where near the airport or weather stations. Also, the absence of lights on the object, to me, disqualified it as a plane. I had been pulled over in the parking lot of a supermarket, when I came out there were planes all over the sky, six all at about the relatively same altitude and running parallel. Does this sound like a military excercise?", "It was floating right above the tree tops over the houses about 75 feet from the tops os the houses.I was driving in the area of the Mountain neighborhood when I saw it in the diatance.  It came slowly along the path of the street and I pulled over to stop.  I got out of my car and watched it.  It was a triangle shape and dark silver in color about the size of the houses there.  There was no noise at all.  How can something that size stay in the air when it&apos;s going so slow?  I was going about 25 mph on those winding roads and it was going slower than me.

Then it began to move at speeds and G&apos;s thats humans can&apos;t handle.I am an airforce depended.  We were stationed at Holloman AFB New Mexico (Just out side of Alomgordo and White Sands). One night Me and my brother was out side talking. I looked over and saw a orange star.  It was just above the moutains.  Now I like to look at stars and New Mexico has some beautiful sky most of the time.  This night the sky clear.  I turned to my brother and said, &quot;look at that star.&quot;  then the star started to move to the left.  It was moving about the speed of a fighter jet in afterburner.  Then I thought to myself that is was most like and aircraft and it was most likly experimental.  Holloman is a very big base.  There is a road on it that allows you to drive 45mph and you probably drive for over an half an hour and still be on the base.  So I Know there is alot of experimental aircraft there.  The object move left for about 5 seconds.  Then without hesitation it began to move to the right.  Now I&apos;ve been around aircraft all my life and I had never seen a aircraft of any sourt make a manuver like that, It was a 180 degree turn.  It move right for about 5 more seconds after that it made 90 degree turn up.  it danced in the sky for about three minutes.  And it was moving at speeds imposible for fighter jets to move at.  The reason I Know this is because of the distance the craft was from us.  As it was dancing in the sky the craft made it&apos;s way above us.  And at one point the craft came staight down and I got a good look at it. Now there was no sound at all Coming from the craft.  But there was jets flying around and the reason i know this is because they have flashing lights of red and white.  This jets seem to ingore the object.  Also If there was and UFO flying over a base that at the time had Top Secert stuff on it, The UFO would have been pursued or shot down. It wasn&apos;t.  The object got so close that we ran inside the house.  There are about 5 more times that we saw objects like that in the sky in a two year period, but this one is the best one.

I thought it must be a flash of lightning and turned my head to see if there storms in that direction. I turned my head just in time to see a fireball breaking up into red-orange colored embers. The fireball was moving from a westerly to easterly direction, and the angle of travel was slightly toward the southeast. The original bright flash which caught my attention was bright enough to light up the southern night sky. The night sky was fairly clear, except for some smoky haze due to numerous forest fires in the area at the time. The duration of the sighting was extremely short, a few seconds at most.

I stood gazing up as it flew at low altitude, directly over me and down the path that I was walking.  It seemed to be a bit smaller than a 747, yet it sounded more like a small plane.  It was going slow enough, so that I was able to study it and remember what it looked like. It was dull silver metal, like an ordinary plane.  There were no markings whatsoever.  It was perfectly smooth with no projections such as a tail, or point or anything at all.  There were no propellers.  There was a single white flashing light at the end of each wing span.  There were two small yellow objects more toward the center.  Maybe they were additional lights, but they were not on. In the past week, I have scoured the Internet and books, and have not been able to locate this craft.  It is not a Stealth.  It almost looked like a Northrop YB-49, but no propellers and very smooth.

This however was no aircraft I have ever seen before. The 3 lights were steady, not blinking in any way, and not red or green like typical aircraft lights. They were not traveling very fast, maybe between 300 and 600 km/h. At first it looked like one triangular object with 3 lights at each corner, but then one of the lights began to shift position rapidly, changing the appearance/angle of the triangular craft. This led me to believe that I was seeing three separate objects with one steady light each, flying in a very precise geometric formation, until they began to shift. The sighting lasted only 15-20 seconds because we lost sight of it as it moved further away. It was a clear night with considerable air traffic. There were several commercial airliners in the sky in various altitudes around the time of the sighting. This was definitely not one of them though. I would say that I know more about civilian and military aviation than the average person, having visited many airshow, having read dozens of books on these subjects, including aircraft recognition guides, and having actively searched the skies in Germany, Maryland, and even &quot;Area 51&quot; on countless occasions.

Looking in the ESE sky at about 30-40 degrees I noticed what appeared to be a stationary group of 3 stars or planets, arranged in a triangular formation. They were white to yellowish in color and about the same size as Saturn or Jupiter, and spaced about 2 finger-widths apart (if held at arm&apos;s length). I didn&apos;t see any other structure around them.  The sky still was light (pale blue). I looked at them for approx. 5 seconds, and then saw that they began to move as a group to the north.  The kept the same distance from each other and maintained the same formation. Their speed was not incredibly fast, probably similar to an airplane.  They did not blink or change color or size.  They continued to move along the horizon to the north and then they gradually faded. What puzzled me was that these lights were standing still and looked like stars when I first saw them and then they began to move.  I don&apos;t think they were planes.

I will try anyway!Initially we saw a V shaped formation of extremely bright lights travelling at an incredible speed towardsnorth-east. This lights mantained an incredibly perfect and fixed relationship to each other for a while, to the point that my mom said: &quot;they are like snow gheese&quot; (Lit by what?). After a few seconds some of the lights- which seemed to have an aura or glow about them- made some strange right to left and left to right movement, like a shuffling a very quick and perfect shuffle, to them form a perfectly straight line before reassuimg the V shape. We kept looking up till we could no longer see them/it and the whole event must have lasted at least 3 minutes. I have worked in the film industry for years and edited with video special effects...

I have seen satellites, planes, birds, Northern Lights, fireworks, falling stars (and so have my parents) but this time we all agree, we have seen something that we cannot explain!If you wish to contact me please do:  ((deleted))PS: On Thursday Night I saw a show on the Discovery Channel titled: &quot;Into the unknown&quot;, The lights shown seen and witnessed by hundreds of people over Phoenix, Arizona and the V formation reported were exactly like the ones we saw over San Felipe, Baja de California on April 27/2000 the only difference was the speed of travel and the shuffling.  The brightness and spacing looked identical!!", "A bright blinding light followed me for Several milesI live in a suburb of Fort Worth, Texas and at the time I was living on a fairly rural road by Lake Worth lake and I was driving a &apos;74 Chevy Blazer with limo tinted windows in the rear, anyway I was dating a young lady who lived off a road called 9 mile bridge road which was out in the less developed rural area, I had taken her home for the night and was on my way back to my house at the time (it was about 1:30 a.m.) when I noticed a light in the upper right hand corner of my mirror. Now, 9 mile bridge is a very curvy road with no street lights and all houses set back at least 50 yards, not to mention that the street is lined with woods and trees all the way down. Anyhow, I saw the light in the mirror and at first thought it was a street light so I looked back and noticed there was not a street light or a house light anywhere on the road. I was going 45 down the road and I kept a watch on the light which didn&apos;t seem to move until I got to an &quot;S&quot; turn on the road. As I made the turn I looked in the mirror, the light was gone. Then all of a sudden, it came back in the same area, well I had one more turn so I watched and it did the same thing. Then I came to a major highway (Hwy.199) and proceeded to get on it to get home and when I got on 199 I looked in the mirror and it was gone. So I traveled about 4 miles to the road I lived on and as soon as I was on that road the object was back and it followed me all the way back to my house (about 3/4 mile).I turned in my driveway and pulled up to my garage (my house is set about 100 yards off the road with nothing but woods all around it)and I always back my Blazer up so I wouldn&apos;t have to turn around the next morning, and just as I got finished parking, there was a bright light that came over. It was so bright that it blinded me to the point that I couldn&apos;t see anything around me, but there was not a sound, and the light was gone as it lit up the area. Now trust me, I was working security at the time and always carried a Glock 10mm with 170 grain jacketed hollo! w points with me, so I was well protected. After the light, it was all I could do to get in the house. I was so scared and when I came in I was running from window to window looking out with my gun in hand. My roommate said he had never seen me so scared in all the years he knew me. I couldn&apos;t sleep at all that night and can remember every little detail to this day as of 3/29/2000. That was over 10 years ago. Now I&apos;m not saying that anyone has to believe in UFO&apos;s but I know my experience and that&apos;s enough for me,", "Sphere was moving extremely fast around the neighborhood as if surveying us.  we were unable to constantly track it because of it flight pattern and it rate of speed.  Most of our viewing was out of our peripheral vision.Description: Round circular/sphere like object approx. the size of a small grapefruit with a dull orangish color.  It seemed to move in an arch like manner very fast yet fluid in motion. It flew around the neighborhood houses and tree line for several minutes.  Then right before it disapeared it flew through my legs. As it flew between my legs I got a glimpse of of an intense light inside it.

From the height (mile or so from Earth), they had to be traveling at super super speeds. They stayed in that spot for about an hour.  Then just scooted off in the directions they had come from.  There may have been others there, unseen. But it was definately something not of these earth.  During that time, we really were speechless, and the time is really uncertain. I now live in Auburn, the other 2 still live in the Yakima area.I have never talked about this with anyone else.  I do not think this was a figment of my imagination.", "An glowing, orange colored disk moving from south to north traveled directly over my house...It was mid-April 1966, and the buds were just coming out on the trees.  I was laying on my bed, looking out my window at the sky, about 10:30 PM. I notice an orangish light moving in the distance - heading in my direction.  It was unusual, so I ran and got my parents (I was 14 at the time).  They both came to my room, and we all looked out my window. By now, the thing was nearly overhead.  It looked low - maybe only a couple hundred feet high.  No sound.  My folks opened the window, and pushed me away from it.  I went to a northern exposure window, and watched this glowing disk continue northward.  It dropped three small whitish or glowing lights out, then continued northward and disappeared in the distance.  The whole event happened in a minute or less. Years later, I saw that same orange color while paging through a magazine about Auroras.  Ionized diatomic oxygen gives off that orange glow.  Whatever this thing was, it must have been electrically ionizing the air around it! One other thing.  This occurred about the same time as the Catalina Island sighting.  I have a feeling that one was a real sighting (too)!", "Triangle shaped with lights moving slowly, no soundI was watching what I thought was a helicopter hovering over an electrical substation above one mile or less from my front yard. I watched and watched and it didn&apos;t move but stayed where it was for approximately 20 minutes, then moved very slowly to the northwest. It was triangle shaped with lights all around, white, red and green lights, it was not a helicopter nor was it an airplane. It went straight over the top of me standing in my front yard, thee was zero sound. It moved slowly until it disappeared over the hills. I had heard before of aircraft-like visitors hovering above the substations but that was first one I had seen.((NUFORC Note:  Date is uncertain.))", "Observed a pulsating light traveling at a high rate of speed.While driving on North St. in Newton, I observed a pulsating white that that had a look similar to a strobe light traveling south to north at a high rate of speed. The sighting lasted approx. 3 min before the light disappeared behind some trees..", "white/silvery elliptical craft seen 45 degrees above horizon, due west, circling in the air rapidly before speeding off northwest.About 9:05 am i saw what looked like a single white/silver object circling in the air due west and about 45 degrees off the horizon. This aircraft I presume to be circular or egg shaped since it appeared ovallike at that angle of viewing. It appeared to be at a high altitude since it was small and so I don&apos;t really know how big it might really be. This object moved in a tight circular pattern, presumably observing something. It moved incredibly rapidly from my vantage point, over 600 miles per hour or so. It turned too tightly and too fast to be any known type of jet of aircraft and did not leave any trails, which a jet would have, at that height. The craft did not make any perceivable type of noise and did not emit any other things. There were no other aircraft in the area. It repeated the same manuever for about a minute before very rapidly zooming off towards the northwest at an even higher rate of speed. Again it made no visible or audible marks and this puzzled me as to how an aircraft could travel(presumably)several times the speed of sound and not produce a sonic boom After disappearing no other objects like it were visible and i could see no other evidence of its presence. The weather in the sky was cloudless and still nor were there any smoke trails left by airlines anywhere in the sky on that morning. I saw the object for only a sort time and I have no idea how long it was in the sky or if any others were present earlier or later.", "looking south from my backyard,high in the sky. noticed three stars forming a triangle moving east at a steady, slow, speed. it blocked out stars it passed in front of untill it faded one lite at a time", "initially seen while I was &quot;indisposed&quot; of.I was pre-occupied in my bathroom when I seen out of the corner of my eye through an opened bathroom window an dull oranged colored circular ball of light slowly moving.  It took me about 5 seconds to realize what I was seeing.  When I was finished, I grabbed my camera and went outside for a better look.  Since I live in an apartment building on the second floor this took me about 3 minutes to get outside and down to the corner of the building.  When I got to the corner of the building I seen the object still traveling slowly in its original flight path in a south/easternly direction.  Only this time it had changed color to a dull white and in both colors, it was slightly &quot;fuzy.&quot;  It moved at the same speed to a part of the sky and then stopped.  It stayed there for a moment or two and then moved north to another portion of the sky.  It was just above the cloud line.  While it was moving I was making attempts at taking pictures of this craft.  It got to another portion of the sky and then stopped again.  It stayed there for a moment or two as if waiting for the clouds to conceal it.  It then disappeared in a flash.  I personally think I seen the craft shoot off to the east. it.

I didn&apos;t pay much attention until I noticed several minutes later that the object had not moved. It was too high for a helicopter to hover and we live in a rural mountainous area with no reason for a helicopter to hover at night.  I got my binoculars to check it out and it seemed so strange I called my wife to come look. She also got binoculars and we watched it for several minutes.  She also said it looked very strange. Then we noticed another object much farther away and above the stationary object, that was travelling very fast and leaving a trail similar to a comets trail. It also was a white light but so far away that that was all we could see. The stationary object had a bright pulsating light that flashed about once a second. Between flashes you could see two red lights both on the right side of the white light. While we continued to watch it a plane came into view flying toward us and the lights on the object immediately went out.", "Light over submarine base, Groton, CT.This sighting is submitted by the UFO LAB in Richmond, RI. On the night of Monday Feb. 28, 2000 at approximately 9:30 pm we were called by two of our members.  They had spotted a strange light hovering over some turf fields next to the Chario High School.  We called a friend and the three of us headed for the area of the sighting.  Upon arriving, we spotted the light hovering above the submarine base at Groton,CT. The light was very bright and unchanging.  The light then moved up and down.  It then bounced to the left and bounced back to the right.  The base at Groton, CT is a nuclear submarine base.  We watched it for approximately 5 minutes then it faded and disappeared.", "Formation of multiple saucer craftTruly cannot remember exact date but &apos;64-&apos;66. During a period of about 1-2 weeks then many strange things where happening on the island. I was a teenager (14) then. Black outs, reported sightings etc. We lived in a beachfront condo on Taft Street, Santurce P.R. Because of all the strange things happening around the island, a friend of mine and I slept on the roof top of the condos 12th floor and at around midnight experienced humming sound. We jumped up and had a view of entire city (San Juan). We observed pie shaped slices of city going dark. We noticed a formation of (estimate) 4-6 clusters comprised of about 6 each saucer like craft in a semi V formation going from east to west roughly @ a 45 degree angle up in the sky. Would estimate distance out in the ocean around 2-5 miles and formation at about 2-3000 feet. Very visible, clear, breezy evening. Lots of stars but formation was very evident. Looking down the condo balcony, just about everyone in the building witnessed the event with people shouting to each other &quot;are you seeing this or that...?&quot; Formation flew &quot;seemed slowly&quot; with luminiscent, undulating or pulsating shimmer to each craft. Humming sound also was low &amp; undulating. This was witnessed and then formation seemed to gain speed with sound undulation becomming more compressed and all craft increased angle of attack (like 75 degrees) into heavens and sped off at tremendous speed. Seemed to vanish in seconds into space. I&apos;ll never forget the experience! Numerous reports in the &quot;San Juan Star&quot; newspaper during this time period. No hoax! Always left wondering why not more media attention paid to this formidable event.", "This was something we all have NEVER seen before.  There has been no investigation that we know of, except it was reported on the news.  Why don&apos;t we have answers?Friday, March 10th..my family and friends were downstairs at the Arlington of Rockford on East State St.  At about 9:10 pm, a security officer rushed through the door from outside to grab anyones attention to come out and see what was outside.  He seemed rather disturbed, so we all ran from our table to see what he was talking about.  There was about 12 of us witnesses to his discovery.  He pointed south and up in the overcast sky.  There was a formation of 5 orange/amber, bright lights.  He said, earlier they came right over the building in a single file, and at that time I thought I heard him say he saw 9 all together and 4 of them left. They made no sound and I don&apos;t remember even seeing any stars because it was so overcast...but these lights sure stood out though. When we got there, they were in sort of a circular formation.  One by one would either vanish or fade off with time.  One in particular sort of floated to the top of the rest and stayed there the longest as the others faded.  While we were out there, this process took at least 10 minutes itself with the one standing alone.  This particular one let off like a &quot;fire-spray&quot; underneath it or something.  It was still out there when I walked back in the building to tell the rest of our party.  Small world as it now seems, coincidently, my daughter saw what she discribed as the same thing on New Years Eve near her house.  I was on the phone with her as she saw an amber-like light glow and move unusually with no sound over her area. I knew by the sound of her voice that she was concerned enough to know it was not normal or like anything she&apos;s ever seen. This seems to happen quite often around here.

PD))Glowing object in Nassau County, NY on 5/27/00While driving on the Southern State parkway, a large, glowing object with flashing lights along the bottom appeared in th sky.  We first thought it was an arplane or water tower, but as it got larger and closer, it appeared to have a hub or dome on the top of it.  It was dificult to view b/c we were moving on the parkway and trees were obscuring our view.  We tried to get off the parkway to retrace our steps to see it again, but it was gone.  At one point, it turned and had an ovoid shape.  The dome on the top was more visible and appeared like a circle.  The main thing about it was that it was glowing and the details viewed were a result of varying amounts of &quot;glow.&quot;  There were no definite lines that defined it.  Actually, at the exact point that we viewed this object, there was  car that had veered off the parkwa minutes before our arrival and struck a tree.  We wondered if that person had seen it too.", "On September 17, 1999 in White Rock, SC a bright circular object was spotted in the northern sky. As a airliner aproached it moved to the east.The object was videotaped.Dear Mr. Davenport. Per our phone conversation this morning I am submitting this report of my encounter with a UFO. This report was submitted to the FAA on September 22, 1999. They have already forwarded the video tape of this encounter to you. The following is an account of what happened: I awake each morning at 5:30 am. After a shower I take my dogs for a one mile walk. The area in and around White Rock, South Carolina is rural. On our walk back twords the house my attention was drawn to a rather brilliant light just above the trees in the northern sky. At first I thought it was an aircraft landing light because aircraft on approach to Columbia Metropolitan Airport generally come from that direction. But as I approached the light it was perfectly still in the sky at approximately 2,000 feet altitude. The closer I got to the light it became obscured behind the tall trees, but is was so brilliant that streams of light came down through the trees. Then I heard the distant sound of jet engines and saw an aircraft approaching from that same direction at an altitude of about 7000 feet. As the plane approached this object moved around to the eastern sky and rose in altitude to approximately 4,000 feet. If the pilot in that approaching plane would have seen this object it would have appeared to the pilot to be below and to the east. If the pilot had observed this it might have looked like a bright street light. The object made no sound. I went into my house and got my video camera. (Hitachi model VM-3700A, with a 24 to 1 zoom) As I came out of my house and observed the object, it was in the eastern sky and again just above the trees. In the video the silhouette of the trees is visible twords the end of the video. The silhouette of the trees gives scale and distance to the object. Could you please evaluate this video and keep me informed as to your findings? Thank You.((Personal and contact data deleted.))", "Three witnesses reported seeing a unusually bright white light cross the sky moving east to west...they watched the light for a minute or less.

SE to NW. No sound. Subdued lighting.I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of my job. The night was clear and I had binoculars in my car, so I was observing the Sirius star, the Orion constellation and the Pleiades. While focused on the belt of Orion a sudden blur moved across my field of vision. I quickly turned with the object and was able to discern two objects. The object which would be closest to me was the larger of the two. On this I made out to be several light sources, reddish in appearance. Simultaneously I could see the other object was smaller with what appeared to be only two light sources. No other lights, or colors were visible that I could see. What was immediately apparent was that these were at a rather low flight level and they did not emit any distinguishable sound. They were traveling at what I would state to be a speed greater then that of a commercial aircraft. I state this because my locale is home to three(3)major airports, 2(two) of them are international. JFK and NEWARK. LAGUARDIA is nearby, as are several smaller commercially used airports. So aircraft are a very common sight. You get used to seeing so many overhead. These two were not at all common. They were traveling from a south east position to a north west position. The lights were quite subdued in intensity. I compare these lights to those of any commercial and/or private aircraft that I have observed. And the lights on these two objects were dim in comparison. And I must emphasize here, there was NO SOUND. Unfortunately I can not guess at the shape(s). As I followed them it became necessary to exit my car to continue viewing them. In the moments it took the leave my car I lost them. Let me state here, that from my position on the ground I had clear sky and a rather broad scope of sky to see. But I couldn&apos;t locate them at this point. I immediately marked the time. It was 8:27pm. Living on Long Island you get used to aircraft overhead. You even get familiar with being able to see aircraft at night from a great distance. You can distinguish a jet by its speed, its apparent altitude and from the lights blinking. And of course from the sound. On very clear nights I have seen satellites in orbit with no optical assistance. I have seen shooting stars. And I have seen the occasional flare from a meteorite.  These two objects were none of the above. They were to fast. To dimly lit. And low in the sky. I am a 43yr old man. Married for 13 yrs. Have 2 children and 3 step children. I have worked in the same building for 12 years doing computer processing for banks. My hobby is photography and my vegetable garden. Prior to tonight I cannot ever recall seeing anything which would compel me to make a report. I am very familiar with the UFO issues. They have been an interest of mine for over 20yrs. Yet I have not before seen anything to call a UFO. My only reason for doing so tonight is to assist in evaluation should other reports arise from the New York area which might be similiar. I wish I could offer more detail, however I at least can offer some tracing ability if you can use it. The only other detail I can offer is that there were other aircraft in the sky at the time. End.", "I saw , as what looked like fireworks of purple and blue in the Western sky. The sparkling fragments traveled Eastward towards me as a whole group. Once the items passed almost overhead and slightly North they took on a greenish-yellow color and appeared to be several fireballs traveling in a train-like fashion. I could not hear any sound from them. They continued to move quickly across the sky and disappeared into the Eastern horizon, slightly North.I was waiting in the drive thru line at the Dairy Queen in Medina Ohio and the passenger with me said &quot;what do we have coming here&quot;? I looked across the vehicle and out the passenger window and noticed what looked to me as fireworks. It was a cold November day and I remember thinking to myself that this was an odd time of the year to see fireworks. The colors were flickering blue and purple and began traveling toward us in a cluster. The two of us were astonished! We both got out of the vehicle and looked toward the colored fragments. As the fragments began to pass overhead they took on a greenish yellow color and appeared to be fireballs with tails traveling in a row. Smaller fire balls could be seen in the tails of the larger fireballs that were in front. They moved swiftly accross the sky and seemed to disappear into the Eastern horizon. Neither of us could believe what we had just seen. There were other customers in line behind us that sort of looked quickly to the sky almost as if they wondered what we were looking at but I don&apos;t believe they acctually saw the fireballs. I was on my lunch break and was angry that I had left my digital camera at work. The image is etched in my mind forever. I saw a brief article on the evening news that someone was calling it space junk and another an asteroid. I heard on the radio that people were calling in reports of a sighting and they were telling us that it was part of the Leonid meteor shower that was due to be seen the following night. This did not occur in the constilation of Leo. I have yet to get any kind of explanation of it. One of my fellow workers told me that his daughter had seen the same event and seemed very puzzled about what she had seen. My work friend told her that it could have been part of the meteor shower but after what I had told him I witnessed, he realy didn&apos;t know what it was. I realy wish I new for sure!", "Three redish lights moving across the sky in absolute synchronicity. Lights were far too much apart to have been an airplane. Visible for about six minutes. The lights disappeared one by one.On 3/11/00 at 7:04pm PST, our 16 year-old son invited my wife and I to step outside and view some lights in the sky. We all saw three redish-tinted lights moving across the sky at about 45 degrees elevation in the northeast. The lights were traveling from north to south at about the speed of an airliner at a long distance. The thing that really drew our attention was the way the lights moved in synch with each other--as if they were a single object. However, the lights were so far apart that to have been eminating from an airplane, the plane would have had to have been extrememly close and visible, which it was not. The lights had a slight flicker, but they definately did not blink or flash. At 7:06, the middle light disappeared completely and never reappeared. The other two lights continued to move across the sky at the same speed and at their original distance from each other. My wife and son say they saw the middle light fall downward very rapidly before disappearing. I was focusing on the left light and did not observe the fall. Though there were some areas of patchy clouds visable, there were none in that area of the sky. We then moved from the back yard to the front in order to continue watching the prossession. The two remaining lights moved across 80% of the sky over the next four minutes. At about 7:10pm the rightmost light disappeared. Initially, I thought it might have gone behind a bank of clouds to the south. A minute later the leftmost light also vanished suddenly. The lights had disappeared instantaneously--not gradually as they would have had they gone behind a cloud. When the clouds cleared a few minutes later, we confirmed the lights were totally gone. This phenomenon was clearly enough visible that it should have been witnessed from anywhere in the Sacramento area.", "Low flying,fast moving object, making abrupt turns and dissapeared at a steep ange below a small rise.At about 8:45 pm on Saturday. May 20 I was outside on my porch when I noticed an object coming from the SW and going to the NE. When first seen it was about 12 to 15 miles away and travelling at a high rate of speed at an altitude of between 500 and 1000 ft. I could not make out the shape but observed 6 or 7 bright white,randomly strobing lights in a horizontal line. The object continued on to a point beyond Saddleback Butte where it mad an abrupt 45 degree tun and headed to the north, still at a high rate of speed. It was at such a low altitude that it went behind two small rises in the butte. It continued noth for about a half a mile and made an abrupt 90 degree turn and came towards me. It then changed into one extremely bright white light and went down at a 60 degree angle, not reducing speed, dissapearing below a rise in the terrain that is about 200 to 300 feet higher in elevation than I am.My wife only observed the last 10 seconds as the object descended to the ground. This area is about 3 miles south of the boundary of Edward&apos;s AFB.", "WAS SITTING ON THE BEACH AND STARGAZING WHEN I SEEN A SHOOTONG STAR OR THOUGHT IT WAS I DIDN&apos;T NOTICE ANY LIGHTS JUST THAT IT WAS MOVING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND BACKWARDS AND THEN FORWARD AGAIN THEN IT STOPPED OVER US THEN MOVED BACKWARDS AND THEN TOOK OFF OUT OF SIGHT.BUT IT DID HAVE A HAZY LOOK ABOUT IT AND LEFT A TRAIL", "((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with a &quot;twinkling&quot; star.  Please see addendum below. PD))I was the first to see the unidentified object at approximately 22:00 hours PM.  The &quot;object&quot; flickered brightly in four distinct colors.  Red, blue, green and white. It moved at what had to be a high rate of speed left and right, stopping quickly at times and changing directions.  When I observed a jet liner heading for it I noticed it faded in brightness and remained still then resumed its right and left movement as soon as the aircraft cleared.  It finally lowered so that we lost sight of the &quot;object&quot;at approximately 23:00 PMObject, at first appeared to be an overly bright star.  The abrupt right and left movements said differently.  It was located in the lower northwest sky of my home, in the direction of Lake Pleasant, but further out.  The object had flickering lights of red, blue, green and white and looked as if it was rotating to show the different colors as they would be bright then fade and the other color would take its place. When I saw it head one direction then stop and head back as if in a straight line to it&apos;s starting point and repeat the movement in the other direction  &lt;----x----&gt; I was very sceptable, but curious. Sometimes it would move in one direction in short bursts then reversed and do the long movement. From my perspective it was moving approximately three inches in one direction then reversing to go back to it&apos;s original spot.  The short burst were about one inch in length and it was either three burst or two at a time.  I am not sure how that would calculate in miles.  The distance is too great to even estimate for me. I called my daughter out to confirm.  She said she was seeing the same thing.  She called her boyfriend out and he also saw what we were seeing.  We watched this strange occurance for about 45 minutes, using other stars and hand held object to determine if it was a star or something else.  The hand held object were stationary and the &quot;object&quot; was mobile.  It kept the same distance from the reference star until it slowly lowered and disappeared from our sight, the reference star(Cappella) remained where it was. This is my third sighting in 53 years.  At age 9 I witnessed a group of 5 lights dancing (moving up and down and sideways and going brighter and fading) on the horizon while I lived in Tucson, AZ. Tucson has no street lights in 1956. There were about 100 people, police and military included, who witnessed the event. My Dad a military man was told not to say anything.  That was in the days of &quot;Project Bluebook&quot;. In 1976 I saw a strange object in the sky near Redlands, CA.  My date and I watched it &quot;hover&quot; for about 15 minutes then shoot off at a 45 degree angle and disappear.  The newspaper report that several people in that area witnessed the same thing. When I checked the sky on the night of May 4, 2000 It did not see anything unusual as I had the night before. Our reference star was, however, present.ADDENDUM TO REPORT (Submitted 05MY00):I would like to change my report given to you last night.  Details belowAfter summiting my report I again found myself in my backyard, but at a later time.  When I looked where I had seen the &quot;object&quot; the night before I again witnessed the &quot;light&quot; doing the same movements with the same color changes. (Red, blue, green and white) I now feel that it is a star and as the earth rotates changing the placment of the stars this particular one is in an area that distorts it due to something in our atmosphere. (i.e. smog or heat waves)  I can find no other explanation for it being the only &quot;star&quot; in the sky to have such abrupt and unusual movements. I am sorry to have wasted your time.", "A white light outside my south window was so bright it turned my blue curtains white.Hello Peter, I don&apos;t know if this story is of interest to you because it happened in Olympia WA Jan. 18th 1999 at 12:30 am.A bright light outside my south window was so bright that it turned my blue curtains white.  Within 8 second a very strange hissy kind of hum enveloped the house from the south. It sort of sounded like a huge electrical transformer station approaching very close.  Three other adults in different rooms of the house saw the light and heard the sound.  It penetrated like a wave passing inside the house. The whole thing lasted about 15 seconds. It was late and I was in bed at the time. I do wish I had looked out of a north window to see what the heck it was. I don&apos;t know if this has anything to do with it, but my house sits on the 5 mile FAA marker for the Tumwater airport. Did you get any other reports around that night.  It definitely was strange and I had a very interesting dream that night. I have had many experiences with UFO&apos;s, but this was the most recent possibility. Thanks for the response. ((name deleted))", "UFO moving rapidly across the sky.  Large sudden movement up,down and then up again.  Possible twirling.  Loss sight of ufo due to obstruction.  The object was definitely in our atmosphere.UFO had slow blinking lights.  It appeared to be close like seeing an airplane with its shape just barely visible.  Then the UFO&apos;s shape started to fade where only the light was visible.  Once it got further away, it started to run parallel across the mountains.  It continued to run parallel to the mountains until we could no longer see it.", "Bright white elongated light in western sky over Decatur Texas.As observers were heading north out of Decatur on 287, object was noted 15 degrees above horizon, 15 degrees port. Object was white, bright, and would be covered by an aspirin tablet held at arms length. At first object appeared only slightly fuzzy, and shaped like an accent mark. It would become larger and fuzzier, as if moving in and out of focus. When fuzzier, appeared move oval and less long and slender. Length appeared to remain constant. If fat end was front, object was heading north. If fat end was arrow on clock hand, object was first observed to be pointing between 4 and 5, but attitude would vary between this attitude and pointing to just past 3:00. Object appeared to progress approximately 15 degrees toward north. Object appeared far away, like a jet or the space shuttle, but moving much more slowly relative to observers. Object&apos;s altitude varried within about 5 degrees. Motion was apparently sproadic. There was no reference object available near UFO; no clouds at all in Western or Northern sky. No high buildings, radio towers, etc. Observers lost sight of object behind a hill while on their journey.", "A bright light was seen in the sky that remained stationary.  We lost track of it and then noticed a similar light in the northern sky.  The light then faded away.It was an overcast day with no sky visible, just clouds.  My friend and I were driving north on 2nd Ave S in Waite Park, MN when I noticed bright white light in the western sky to my friend.  I commented on it and asked my friend &apos;what in the hell that was&apos;.  He thought it might have been an airplane, but I thought it was too bright.  I took my eye off the object when we neared an intersection.  I lost track of the light and dismissed it as mildly unusual.  As we cleared the intersection, still headed north bound we both noticed an identical light in the northern sky.  It was easy to follow, because we were driving in that direction.  We watched the light for approximately 5 seconds when it seemingly lost its illumination slowly.  It seemed to take a couple of seconds for the light to disappear.  When it did there was no visual evidence of anything else in the sky, no aircraft, no nothing.  By the way the light dissapated I thought it might be some sort of flare, but there was no ascent or descent of the light, rather it seemed to just disappear.  It seemed possible that it may have been an aircraft, but the light was too bright and didn&apos;t seem to move and with the cloud cover being so great or distance of vision would have noticed a movement in an aircraft.  The light never blinked, but seemed to be greatly illuminated.  There were no towers or tall buildings in that area. In both cases the object appeared to be around 30 degrees ascension. I would have dismissed one strange light, but two in totally different areas of the sky in such short a length of time didn&apos;t make any sense to me or my friend.  The bright white light was not huge in diameter. It seemed bigger than an airplane light.  It was hard to gauge the distance, but like I mentioned earlier, it was overcast so it couldn&apos;t of been really far away. My witness and myself are in or mid 20&apos;s, don&apos;t do drugs, are sane individuals who witnessed something unusual.  Any feedback on other simmilar sightings, or some sort of explanation would be great!", "Blue Light Ball Thing followed by fire  or spark streaks, west of Highlands Ranch, Colorado.I&apos;m a 25 year old Male.  I&apos;m a professional computer geek; doing I.T. and website design. I was outside walking to the house from my car and noticed the sky light up.  It was a bright blueish light followed by a trail of orange sparks or fire.  It lasted just for a few seconds, and I paused and listened expecting an explosion as whatever it was hit the ground.  I&apos;m near C-470 and Lucent Blvd and this was to the West of me, possibly over the mountains. At 10 pm, our local news had a story about the Space shuttle so I went to nasa&apos;s site and saw that the landing wasn&apos;t until the 29th; so that ruled that out.  I went to Art Bell&apos;s site to find your number/website and saw the Iridium satellite flare page, looked up the flares for the day and ruled that out as well. Whatever it was, it sure looked like it could have been low in altitude.

As I looked to the east, I could see the lights of landing aircraft all in a row for O&apos;Hare Airport in Chicago. Slightly to the right of the landing pattern was an orange colored light just hovering. I stopped to watch it because it was a different color from the landing planes. It seemed to be fixed in the air, no movement. As I watched for about a minute, the orange light shot up, stopped for about a half second and then shot to the right and out of sight in less than 2 seconds time.", "Disk-shaped craft spotted hovering in the skyI was sleeping on top of my VW Bus in the woods near Canyonville, OR, when I woke up suddenly for no apparent reason. I looked up at the sky and became aware of a grey or silver craft hovering off to my left, approximately a half mile away. The craft was saucer shaped and had light panels on the bottom half of the saucer. The craft was spinning back and forth, and the only way I knew this was because I could see the light panels moving slowly back and forth. There was an inaudible hum or vibration in the air, like a subtle electric crackle. At first I thought in my mind, &apos;Oh wow, a UFO! So it&apos;s true...&apos; but then I became very frightened. I jumped down off of the top of the bus and hurried inside to tell my friends, who were sleeping inside. I urged them to go outside and look, but they were too frightened to. I attempted to start the bus, but it wouldn&apos;t start, so I just kept trying over and over and let the starter attempt to pull us up a short hill. Finally, I just gave up and let the bus roll back down the hill, where we logded against a gate. I climbed into my sleeping bag and tried to calm myself (I was frantic throuhout the entire encounter!) In the morning, the bus started with no problems.", "I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK WHEN I WITNESSED AN ORANGE/RED FIREBALL WITH A REAL BRIGHT WHITE SILVERY LIGHT PERTRUDING OUT THE FRONT/TOP THAT ILLUMINATED THE SKY ALL AROUND IT. NO DOUBT MOST PUREST, BRIGHTEST, WHITE LIGHT I EVER SAW. THE OBJECT SLOWED CONSIDERABLY, WHILE GOING IN AN UPWARD ANGLE. AS SLOWING THE WHITE LIGHT GOT DIM, NOT OUT.

WHILE OBSERVING I SAW A BIG ORANGE/RED FIREBALL WITH A TAIL TRAVELING JUST UNDER THE MOON GOING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH IN AN UPWARD DIRECTION, NOT DOWNWARD AS YOU WOULD COMMONLY SEE A NORMAL METEORITE (ME BEING AN OVER THE ROAD TRUCK DRIVER, I HAVE WITNESSED MANY METEORS FALLING TO EARTH). WHAT MADE THIS SIGHTING VERY DIFFERENT THAN SEEING A METEORITE FALL TO EARTH WAS THE PURE, BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT THAT WAS ON THE FRONT OF THE FIREBALL.

I HAVE SEEN HUNDREDS OF METEORS IN MY 20 YEARS OF DRIVING A BIG TRUCK.", "Bright daylight sightinh of disk shaped opject moving westward, taking a turn northward and climbing out of sight.Saturday, April 15th, at 3:35 PM, my girlfriend and her son were driving east on Lomita Blvd. in Torrance California near the intersection of Lomita and Hawthorne Blvd. when they witnesses a silvery object at about 30 degrees off the horizon slightly north of due east. They were on their way to my office and were only a couple of minutes from my front door when they spotted it. The object was about 1/8&quot; diameter at arms length and was clearly visible. The sky was absolutely clear with no smog or clouds. It was described to me by her son, who is 12 and a half years old as a saucer shaped object with a line at its girth separating the top half from the bottom. Interestingly, the top half was described as rotating on its axis while the bottom was stationary to the top. My girlfriend&apos;s son also described some purple and blue flashes that were being emitted from the surface of the object. He described these as flashes that would have the perspective as if you were looking into a tunnel. After viewing the video, these are clearly visible. Also, from his vantage point where he saw the object lower on the horizon, these would have been more in direct line with his line of sight and would have given him this tunnel perspective view. In contrast to this view, my video shows the object directly from its bottom. The object was hovering motionless for several seconds when two airplanes crossed ahead of it. These two airplanes were seen by both the mother who was driving and the son. Immediately after the planes crossed each other&apos;s paths, the object disappeared from view until the two planes were a fair distance away. It then re-appeared and began moving westward into the wind direction. Upon arriving at my office, they both frantically called out to me to get my video camera out, that there was a UFO. I immediately grabbed my camera and went out to take a look and hopefully get a shot. When I first viewed it, it was about 65 degrees off the horizon looking due east. I was in the parking lot of my office complex situated directly at the corner of Lomita Blvd. and Madison. I took my 5X telephoto lens with me to make sure that I got a good close up shot of it. It was climbing steeply and getting smaller very quickly as it moved westward. It was very hard to get a fix on it with my long lens. I simply couldn&apos;t find it fast enough, so I laid down on the pavement to steady the camera pressing my elbows against my ribcage. I found it and got about 4 seconds of video and quickly lost it again. In my video, it appears that the UFO is jumping around, but it was in fact moving very steadily. It continued west for about ten seconds, then took a fairly sharp turn to the north, crossways to the wind. It continued north with apparent slowing as it was climbing very fast until it was out of sight. I immediately took the video into my office where I have several computers and image processing programs. Upon looking at it, I not only got a very good shot of the object even though it was nothing more than a speck in the sky, but was able to get a few good frames of these purple and blue flashes that my girlfriend&apos;s son had described. When I looked at with my naked eye, I did not notice these probably because the object was so small. I took some of the frames and began doing some computer enhancements using only the hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, histogram, midtone enhancements and so on to bring out what detail that might be obtainable from the unchanged original video frame. I own an engineering company and have won several photography awards with the Kodak International Snapshot competition and PSA the Photographic Society of America.", "UFO chased meI saw a Triangular shaped UFO in Mars Hill at 2am. It was hovering at treetop level over a stopsign. I stopped my car when I realized what I was looking at. The UFO seemed to be moving away from me and it stopped also. At this point I panicked, I threw my car into reverse and started backwards flooring it. The UFO starts backwards. Accelerating faster then my car. I flipped off my headlights hoping they wouldnt see me. The car engine then dies when the UFO gets within maybe 20-30 feet in front of me still coming at me. I put my car in park and realized I was the only person out on the road and I was about to get abducted. So I knew I had to wake people up not so much to witness the UFO but to stop the aliens from abducting me. I jumped out of my car and started running down the road away from the UFO screaming the entire time. Luckily] some people in a nearby house heard my screams and ran outside. The UFO had drifted over behind a tree so they couldnt see it, but they did see its lights. Then the lights blinked out and it was gone. I got back in my car and it started right up and I drove home.", "UFO was sighted to side of lane . I stopped car and got out to communicate with craft - which flew off at very high speed .My girlfriend and I were out for a drive near Stonehenge . We had passes the henge some miles back , and as we turned off of the main road we both noticed the UFO hovering approx. 6&apos; from the ground and scanning the ground with an intensely bright white beam . The craft was about 10 metres in diameter ,saucer shaped and black in colour . It didn&apos;t reflect any light. I stopped the car and got out to try to talk to the aliens I assumed were inside. About 30 seconds later the ship vanished at incredible speed in an ESE direction. We were both amazed and reported the incident to the police when we got home . We are both disabled people and no longer together .", "As I was looking up at the night sky in a North to North east direction, at approx.9:30 pm, I noticed what appeared to be a satellite moving through space/orbit.The single light was pinpointed,such as a distant star and white, and travelling from the North/North East toward the South/Southwest at a slow but steady unaltered speed.The sky was completely clear with no overcast. After viewing it for about 10 or 11 seconds, it abruptly reversed its&apos; direction but on an angle approx. 30 degrees from where I first noticed it. It did not stop or appear to slow down in any way upon changing direction.  Recently, I have viewed this same phenomenon documented on television, (shown 3/24/00 on FOX network). This was exactly, without any deviation, the same type UFO that I witnessed that night.  The one that was documented was filmed from a satellite in 1991.  I am convinced this was not from ice,debris or any man made product and in fact it was a visitation from an alien spacecraft. I have viewed satellites before at night and have never seen them change direction.", "Rectangular, checkmark shaped craft in NM near Albu. in Dec. 1981.on a christmas trip to grandparents in NM, we (mother, friend, brother, daughter of friend, myself)approached east side of Sandias near Alb. on I-40...lots of other cars driving along side...large rectangular (traincar shaped and in size)dropped down right in front of my mom&apos;s car...this craft was rectangular with an &quot;added&quot; storey at the left end of the craft...giving it a &quot;checkmark&quot; shape...it was very bright...actually looked like it had windows...blocky, like house windows, but not quite...it seemed to hover, &quot;floating&quot; just in front of us...we were all screaming &quot;what is it???&quot;  &quot;don&apos;t get under it!!&quot; and my mom&apos;s friend was taking pictures of it with an old camera...one with a disposable square flash bulb...only one picture turned out...The folks in other cars seemed to not notice this ...craft...this I remember...I looked out my window (back right)and folks didn&apos;t have a reaction to it...then it was gone...once in Alb. we stopped at a restaraunt and just sat...it wasn&apos;t a helicopter, airplane, weather balloon, etc...it was as I described.

A few days later, at approximately 06:00 hours on February 22, 2000, My husband was leaving for work.   All of the sudden, he darted back into the house and told me I had to come look. I saw two cylinder shaped objects, rotating in a circular motion at the top only, with orange X-shaped lights on the base of each one.  They were traveling about 20 m.p.h. northeast across Prescott Valley, towards Mingus Mountain. We could only see the X-shapes with binoculars and I also grabbed the camera to take pictures, but they only captured a single &quot;orange light&quot; for each object. One at a time,the objects eventually dissappeared out of sight as they neared a mountain full of low lying clouds. My husband 35,is a machinist, and I, 35, am a secretary.

I don&apos;t think it was a light aircraft or chopper. I worked around F-4&apos;s and other military aircraft and have seen combat. I don&apos;t ever recall any rocket, shell or any weapon that moved across the sky at that speed.", "My instructor pilot and I were coming back from Bentonville AR I had just taken my instrument check ride. We had somehow lost all of the fuel out of our left tank so we landed at Ft Smith to get some more fuel.When we left we were talking to Razorback approach control. We saw five lights lined up at about our one o&apos;clock position and they appeared to be headed right at us. I though that they were military hellicopters because the lights were very bright and we could not see any Nav lights. So I inquired about the traffic with razorback approach and they told me that the only aircraft within 20 miles was a B727 at FL200. I told him that I didn&apos;t know what it was but there were 5 aircraft that were in formation headed right at us. Immediately after I had said this the aircraft either made a sharp turn or turned off their lights because the lights just faded out and were gone. Well me and my instructor just looked at each other hummed a verse of the Twilight Zone and kind of laughed it off. I didn&apos;t think anything of it untill the tape of the Art Bell show was passed around our specialty at work. You see I am an Air Traffic Controller on the same specialty with Joe and Mike, the ones who were on the show and the controller working the position when the airline pilot reported 3 lights that he thought were at FL500 or higher. The difference was that I was in a PA28-181 at about 6000 ft when I saw five of these objects. I thought that my report might help to substantiate their report and I was amazed at how similiar the details were even though the altitudes are very different.I was able to fit it all in the summary.

I was on the sidewalk in front of my home at Approx 10:00pm when I heard this sound discribed above coming my way but hidden by trees - when the sound was directly over head I saw nothing until the sound was past me - I saw a circular glow accompany the heavy hum before it went behind trees again.  Maybe 10 secs later I saw it again when bright balls appeared to float off of the UFO and down behind trees in a densely populated area of the city. It was moving too slow to be an airplane and WAS NOT A HEPICOPTER.  I am curious if you had similar reports from that time and city. I have told noone", "Saw a multi-colored, rectangular object flying through the sky from the NE to the SW...September 4, 1980, approx. 17:30: The sun was still up, but setting in the west. While talking to a neighbor in the front yard, I had a strange urge to look at the sky. From the NE, a odd, multi-colored, box-rectangular object was silently zipping through the sky to the SW. If on the ground,its dimensions seemed to be about 30&apos; by 30&apos;. It appeared to be constructed like a box-kite, with glowing, colored spars, as if they were fluorescent tubes seen on a carnival ride. Green, red, amber, violet, were the colors. The object rotated end-over-end as it flew. It was at a height around 5,000 ft., and was moving at very high speed. I would guess the speed was around Mach 2 or 3, since it travelled from horizon to horizon at that altitude in less than 15 seconds, and disappeared behind a stand of Southern Oaks, from my perspective. There was a peculiarity about the event that I won&apos;t forget: I sensed intuitively that the &quot;craft&quot; was under highly intelligent control, and was a &quot;probe&quot; sent for reconnaisance purposes by someone or something not of this Earth. (Weird, huh?)", "silent like wind in the trees @ 150 yards in length 75 - 80 yards in width, multi color lights, within a transluecent outer shell, Moving @ 15 to 20 mph.

It appeared to land about 1/2 mile away.  With out saying any thing my friend and I took off running towards it and both of us ran into something at the same time (like a force field) and deceided to go home and tell our parents.  No body believed us.  Every body seemed to be more interested in the CHiPs episode on tv that night.", "Grandmother saw a cigar shaped craft which she said was as long as the valley is wide.My Grandmother has been dead for a year, and I thought I would report a sighting that she had in the early sixties. Her house sits on a hill overlooking the Puyallup Valley and the valley between Sumner and Auburn.  I was just a small child at the time (6 or 7).  I was asleep and she did not wake me. The craft that she saw was sunset pink with portholes all around the centerline of the craft.  She said that there was some type of fire at one end (ship was in and out of the clouds). The valley is about 1 1/2 mile wide at that point, and she seemed to feel that it was the length of the width of the valley.  That seemed pretty big to me, maybe it was close than she thought it was.  She seemed to think that it was over the city of Auburn itself. She said she watched it for about five minutes and then it shot away to the northeast.  If this is the case, it flew in close proximity to the ATC northwest control center in Auburn.  Maybe there is a record of it. My mother and she had also seen ufo&apos;s in the daylight in the same general area.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD", "Observed an approaching light traveling from the east.  The light was below the clouds, and contiunued to approach until at a 75 degree angle off the horizon.  Made no sound, looked like a small flame in the sky. Movements appeared slow, then it stopped for a short time.  It then changed direction, and traveled back to the northeast.  A ball of light followed by short streamers was then emitted from the bottom of the light.  It then proceeded to disapear.The sighting occured in eastern Eugene, almost above the city of Springfield.  I was returning home from eating dinner at a restraunt with a date when we observed a light about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was initially at too far a distance to see clearly, but as it approached I realized it didn&apos;t have the usual aircraft lighting.  I proceeded to pull the car into a parking lot and stopped to look at the light, now almost above us, at a 75 degree off the horizon. The light&apos;s intensity seemed to flux as it faded in and out.  Note: This effect was clearly NOT due to haze difracting the light.  The light made no sound at all.  The sky was cloudy that night, and the craft was definately below these clouds.  The moon was behind us, allowing the craft to shine clearly against the cloudy sky.  The light is best described as a small flame, similar to a lit candle.  No clear shape was observed.  I was in the parking lot for about 30-45 seconds.  Another car had pulled in and seemed to observing the same light.  It then began to travel in the Northeast direction and I got back into the car and attempted to get a different view of the light.  My passenger kept an eye on the light when she could for the breif drive to a stop light in which we again had a clear view of the light.  There were at least 3 students in the street yelling and pointing at the same light.  Suddenly, the light emmitted a glowing fireball that shot down towards earth.  The glowing ball emitted had short red fire like streamers.  However, the ball emitted seemed to disapear before it came in contact with the ground.  Trees and structures blocked my view of the ground in relation to the now seemingly distant object.  Everyone starting yelling as others witnessed the event.  I immediatly tried to drive a short distance into a parking lot very close nearby.  As we were driving, the light seemed to disapear.  I had not been drinking at dinner that night, and others were present that witnessed the same strange light. I am a student at the University of Oregon.  I consider myself a scientist, with a fairly good knowledge of physics, astronomy and general science.  I grew up here and know the area well.  This craft was definately not any type of convential aircraft and defies any reasonable explanation that I can give it. I would like to know if radar reports from the airport can be obtained.  Are these public records?  Any direction you can point me in as to which steps I should take next?  I contacted a newstation but I don&apos;t think they took my reports seriously, and dismissed it as a helicpoter in the clouds.  It was NOT a helicopter, unless the military has perfect sound-dampening technology.  Again, it defies any explanation I can give it. Did anyone else report anything that night?", "Slow falling glowing ball over Gulf of MexicoWitnessed a glowing object.... thought it was a pane in a ball of flame, but according to local authorities, nothing of that nature occurred....

It never moved, however.I am a retired RN, and my son, who also saw the object, is a Respiratory Therapist. He was getting ready to go to work, and usually leaves 22:30 hrs. I called him out to see the object, and he became very excited when he saw it was pulsating lights, but not moving. We went outside with binoculars, but the binoculars did not help, only confirmed it was not moving.It appeared to be very high up, at the level a commercial airplane flies. I called my sister, who lives about 1/4 miles from me. She verified the same sight. She is a teachers assistant at a local school. None of us has ever seen a UFO, and we were trying to be objective, like it might be a star, or whatever, but it was too bright and pulsating to be a star, and it wasn&apos;t moving.

It was approximately 1:00 AM when we witnessed a circular shaped craft hovering over the Seaboard railroad tracks.  This was to our left, and the craft was approximately 100 feet from us hovering at around 60 feet. The craft was approximately 40 in diameter and had colored lights around the edges.  We pulled over into the driveway of a gas station (closed at the time) and we all got out of the car.  The craft made no noise as it proceeded to pass over us to our right. It then hovered over a local residents front yard, and at this time was approximately 100 + feet from us. A cylinder of light came from the bottom of the craft as if taking samples from the yard.  This light defied the laws of physics, as you could see the bottom of the cylinder(of light) decend 1/2 way, 3/4 way down, etc. before reaching the earth. The light then ascended in the same manner, and then the craft vanished in thin air.  Again, making no noise whatsoever.  We then jumped back in the car and sped to our homes in a state of terror.  I have never officially reported this in 33 years but have told this to many friends and relatives.  Some believe, and of course many laugh, but this really happened to me and my 3 friends.", "Bright, bi-colored, stationary lights above clouds.  Hundreds of witnesses.Bright lights ABOVE CLOUDS in sky above the House of Blues on Sunset Blvd after concert.  Hundreds of other witnesses.

Stationary lights in approximately the following formation:  .. :  . .  Spanning roughly five degrees in sky (I measured one fist width at arms length), almost directly overhead, outer lights white, center two lights orange, roughly parallel w/Sunset Blvd.  People were coming out and staring up overhead.  Some even called friends on cellular phones asking them to go outside to look.  Absolutely no movement, and we walked approximately a block to our car and the lights remained directly overhead, (so they must have been at very high altitude).  Clouds gradually obscured until invisible.  We drove quickly home, as it was my intent to photograph them from my home, (though they were invisible by then). I am an amateur astronomer and I can assure all that this was NOT any standard celestial phenomenon, (not stars, planets, etc.).  These lights were several orders of magnitude brighter than any night sky objects, (except the moon).  I have never seen or reported anything like this before.  We were surprised to see nothing on the news in the following days.", "Me, my brother and a friend were going out to meet two friends when i noticed a blinding light in the sky. It stayed bright for two minutes then faded in about 30 seconds. It then changed to red and green flashing lights. A plane came into view and got closer to the object. The object then rapidly accended. It then started moving diagonally upwards south east. It then stopped and began travelling vertically south east. As it reached the middle of the sky we noticed the object was saucer shapped and the lights were flashing alternately circular around the rim off the object. Shortly after the sighting of the shape it disappeared from sight.My brother, a friend and I were arranging to meet two other friends in our village and so left our house at 8pm to meet them. We were walking down our round when i noticed a blinding bright yellow light in the sky, and it was much larger than any stars by a long way. So we stayed and watched it wondering what it could be. As it was not moving we assumed it may be a satellite reflecting the suns rays from space. After two minues the light faded completely and was now a set of green and red lights flahing alternately. We then noticed a plane coming towards the object. When the plane became closer to the object, the object rapidly accended upwards at an incredible speed. By now our two other friends had joined us and they too saw the object at this point. The object then accended diagonally upwards in the direction of south east. After 20 seconds of this diagonal accention the object began travelling horizontally at the height it had now reached. As it rapidly crossed the sky we had a clearer view of the object and it was saucer shaped and of dark grey colouring. We also noticed that the green and red flashing lights were totating in circular fashion around the rim of the object.The object was also enourmous compared to any other aircraft i had seen. Shortly after we noticed this about the object it disappeared from our view. This was now 8.11pm.", "I spotted an amber colored diamond in the sky that seemed to shrink and fade until I could see it no more. I was looking to the west-northwest.I saw a single, bright, amber-colored diamond shaped object in the sky to the west-northwest of Evansville. The object, when it caught my eye, was about the size of my thumbnail at arm&apos;s length. The object immediately seemed to shrink in size until it could not be seen at all. Time to shrink was about 10 seconds. There was no horizontal or vertical movement to the object. It was appx. 30 degrees above the horizon. I have a habit of looking into the night sky as I walk to my front door to see what celestial objects are visible that night. I first thought it to be a planet or very bright star... until it disappeared. It was then I realized that the sky was completely overcast. The object was in the normal flight path for departing aircraft from EVV, but I saw no other lights or beacons or lateral movement that would indicate an aircraft. I have no approximation at all for distance to the object. I watched for a few minutes afterward with no other activity in that area of the sky. It may be nothing, but I thought I should report in case I wasn&apos;t the only one to have seen this object.", "Bright fireball low in the southeast sky.  Primarily white, although with a greenish tint.I was driving south on interstate 5 about 5 or 10 miles south of Oceanside, CA.  This is in north San Diego county.  The highway heads generally south by southeast, not counting the curves, of course.  I noticed a bright light source in the upper left corner of the windshield.  I had emerged from a point along my line of sight where it was blocked by the roof of the car.  In less than a second, it disappeared behind some high ground that was fairly near the highway. The light source had the appearance of a fireball; mostly white but with a greenish tint.  It was about the size of the cross-section of a pencil held at arm&apos;s length, or about half the diameter of my smallest fingernail.  It had a divided tail, more distinct along the top and bottom of the tail, and less distinct in the center.  It was bright but not uncomfortable to look at, akin to looking at a bright streetlight.  I can&apos;t give a very good account of my position, or its direction from me, or the angle above the horizontal when it disappeared; I was busy driving.  I thought for a moment about what I had seen, then remembered to look at the clock.  The clock read 1:11.  I guessed that I had actually seen the fireball at 1:10. Here are some impressions (as opposed to observations).  The fireball seemed to come roughly out of the northwest and to be heading roughly southeast.  I had that impression that it was heading away from be at about a 45 degree aspect (as if I were going south and it was going southeast).  I guessed that it was coming down at about a 45 degree angle, although the down angle looked more like 60 degrees because of the aspect angle (my impression of it).  It did not look simply like a round light source; I could see irregularities.  I could also see irregularities in the tail.  From this, I think that it was close (whatever that means, in a relative sense, for fireballs).  It looked so low to the ground and was moving so fast (about 10-15 degrees line of sight in less than a second) and coming down at such a steep angle that I was sure that it would hit the ground.  I saw no evidence of any such hit (such as a brighter flash, for example).  (note: using a fist at arm&apos;s length as 12 degrees) In thinking about the tail, it doesn&apos;t seem likely that the split appearance was due to any asymmetry in the object.  That is certainly possible, of course.  It seems more likely, though, for the tail to be eminating from the &quot;limb&quot; area that was closest to the undisturbed air.  That is, for the tail to be coming off in a ring, forming a hollow cylinder behind the fireball.  In looking roughly tangent to the cylinder (at the edge), the observer would be looking through more of the tail material than when looking at the middle.  This would (I think) result in the effect that I saw.", "As with three other postings to this sighting.  It was around 1:10AM in the south south east sky.  But from my location the fireball appear to be heading straight down toward the ocean.  It green in color, with a longish tail.

Quickly realized this was not the case because the &quot;light&quot; was visible in clear, cloudless, sky then disappeared behind faint whispy clouds.On 03/07/00 a friend and I were outside enjoying the unseasonably warm weather just after sundown around 7pm.  The visibility was great so I was looking at the stars more than usual.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw a large light in the sky approaching from the NE.  At first it reminded me of a spotlight.  I watched it briefly(3 or 4 seconds at most) before it seemed to disappear behind some very faint and thin clouds low in the southern sky, which was my first indication that it was not a light originating from the ground since it was visible in clear skies but not visible when it entered the lightly clouded area. The light was sort of a semi-circle, boomerang, like shape that kinda reminded me of a bird.  I concluded that it was not a bird, however, because birds are not luminescent and the sun was completely set.  Also the bird would have had to have been ENORMOUS to take up as much sky as it did at an altitude that was obviously higher than the thin clouds(which were very high).  The color was sort of pinkish-brown if that makes sense.  Not all that bright but clearly visible because it was first caught in my perifreals. No lights or blinkers. No sound.

There were three of them very close together in the shape of a triangle. But there wasn&apos;t any other stars out because it was still daylight. We both pointed them out at the same time and thought it was pretty strange to see stars out that early especially in that formation. Shortly after we spotted them they flew off in opposite directions. I have an open mind when it comes to U.F.O. sightings, but I&apos;m not saying that they were U.F.O.s because to me I didn&apos;t see a flying saucer all I saw were three star like objects in the sky but it makes me wonder exactly what it was we saw that evening.", "oval black with white or silver underside going very fastit was very fast and went it a south east direction.and past thru two  set of cloud formations in a strait line did not go up or down lost sight of it behind a building.((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates a time of &quot;17205&quot; in his report.

It had so many lights, different colored ones.  They were blinking a pattern:Red, green, blue, then a blinding flash.  It was chasing, or following another round object that was made of light.

After the 747 passed by I was looking at the clouds formation. Since it was a very bright and glaring day I wore my red tinted sunglasses that reduced the glare alot so I was able to make out shapes of the clouds. As I watched I noticed this formation in the clouds that very dim (The clouds were about 10,000-11,000 ft up) They were very dim and white I thought they might be stars, but they changed shapes. And were in a perfect formation. The first formation was of a diamond formation with two objects away in the formation. Second there were about 8-9 objects in the formation. And they seemed to go in and out of the clouds. I thought It was balloons there were loose but they were too high. They seemed to change into different formations and fade or go higher. After watching these I noticed a &quot;Silver&quot; egg shaped object go from west to east over downtown and it was at least 2500-3000 feet up There was no sound or shape they I would see as a airplane because I study and watch aircraft all the time and play the &quot;Microsoft Flight Sim 2000&quot; This object that was silver just flew over the city and the other formations seemed to fade away.

The SEG cannot be detected by radar because it absorbs radiation and when inside the generator, the g force does not exist.  Searl also noticed that the SEG gave off some form of radiation that TOTALLY healed his burns from a spill a couple of weeks beforehand that docters said would never completely heal.  The lack of g&apos;s in the center can possibly explain the darty movement noticed in UFO&apos;s and the pink halo can possibly explain &quot;the light&quot; seen in many UFO sightings.

But the object was travelling upwards. I got my video camera to tape the object. The object changed from a bright white to a very red color. I zoomed in and out to get some reference as to the relative location of the object. It travelled upward and then seemed to hoover. I taped it moving around in a small area bounded by some stars or planets. There was no noise or any other phenomena associted with the event. I was certain that the object was some type of UFO.

It was late, before 7 pm.  It was warm and did not get dark until around 8:30.  We were watching TV and it went out. I tried to get it back on but could not. I tried to call neighbor that had worked on it, but phone was dead. I could hear the dogs barking at something and I picked up my son and went out to see. It was daylight.  When I went out, the dogs had quit barking and were standing perfectly still. I thought that was strange but before I could dwell on it, I turned to my left and saw an object, round, no markings, no openings, in the corner of the field under tree branches. It was a warm, not hot, yellow and orange, several feet above the ground and about 15 to 20 feet tall. I could see under it and tree limbs above it. This is mountain area and we were in a valley, the area behind the UFO was a mountain. I walked to the fence and I felt so happy to see it.  I ask it to come closer that I was not afraid and it did.  The next thing I knew, I could hear a car or truck coming up the road, my thought was that I hoped it could see what I was and when the lights hit me, I looked back and the object was gone.  Now, I know it was then dark, something I only remembered in the 80&apos;s.  It was Mother and I wondered why they had come back early, I ask her and she said they weren&apos;t back early.  I told them about it and they thought I was crazy.  We went back in the house and the TV was working and the phone was working.  It was then that a report came on TV and said a UFO had been seen over Jacksonville, Ark., about 70 miles away and it was described like the one I saw in the field. I pushed it back in my memory because I felt no one would believe me.  In the 80&apos;s, TV was full of investgations on UFO&apos;s, still I did not talk about it. My friend and I were going into town and she ask if I had watched TV and saw the UFO thing, and I told her I had not.  It was then she told me that one evening she had gone outside and saw a round object behind my house a few months earlier. She said she lost an hour. I said nothing of what I had seen, she did not know about it. It was then that a mental picture came to mind about that night in 65, of the clock at mothers, when I returned to the house it said 8:15, I had gone out at 6:30, apx. That time period is still blank for me. The time I saw it was at mothers and the time my friend saw it, it was 100 miles away. I moved back to Scotland last year. One day I walked to the spot and put my hand on the ground and said that I was back and I wanted to know why. A blinding headache hit me, I left the area quickly and have not done that again.  I never liked this area, where I now live, but last year, I changed my mind and insisted that we move away from the Benton area to Scotland. I was very surprised, but I had such a strong need to get back here. In the months after I saw the object in the field, I had such bad headaches, that I was put in the hospital, they found nothing wrong, and they went away in October of 65. My son that was with me that night says he remembers nothing, he was 3. But all his life he has fought to live here and he lives on the place. In order to work, one has to drive at the least, 50 miles for a job.  I drive to Little Rock to work, 70 miles one way. By the end of the day, I begin to get anxious about getting back, I am almost sick with the need! I am ok once I get here. In 1962, I was pg with my son.  Several times I would wake up in the mornings with the bottom of my feet black. I have a slight memory of talking to someone in the alley at our house. I had never sleep walked before and no memory of doing so, again. What concerns me now is the need to be here, as if I am waiting. I would like to know if anyone has seen the object I recreated. Last night I found a picture of the same thing on David Fowler, Unknown UFO, picture #2.", "Small Cylinder seen in absolutely clear sky in morning. Heading north on Hwy 35w. No other objects in sky whatsoever.I and a friend were car pooling to our job from Edina to Roseville, Mn. Heading north  on Hwy 35w. I noticed it first and was unsure of what I was seeing. I wached it for about 3-4 minutes w/o saying anything so that I could be sure. The sky was completely clear. The weather was crisp and slightly cold. It was low in the sky (say about the size of a pen point at first sighting and as we drew closer by about 10 miles about the size of a pencil eraser at arms length). It was a very dark color...Gray bordering on black. At first it had definite edges. It reflected light at the edges. It stayed in one spot, seemingly motionless. I mentioned to my friend after a few minutes who is a skeptic and asked him, &quot;What the h*ll is that?&quot;.  He didn&apos;t know either.  By the time we were as close to it as we were going to get it had dissipated into a cylinder shaped &quot;cloud&quot; or &quot;mist&quot; and was losing shape slowly. My father being a pilot I grew up around airports, airplanes and airshows and have always kept an eye to the sky. I have never seen anything like it. If it was a &quot;cloud&quot;, why would one tiny, dark cloud form in a sky barren of any other weather formations? My friend was a little bothered by it and chalked it up to weather. I&apos;m not so sure.", "On the date of 3-12-00, A friend and I was outside in front of DENY&apos;S in Simi Valley.

At that moment, we both seen a white/orange fire ball with a tail approx. 20 times longer the the Dim. of the object in the South-west sky heading toward us. To me, it looked like a meteor going through the lower atmosphere,or an airplane with it&apos;s wing on fire. This lasted approx. 2 minutes. then the odject turn into a white dot with a blue haze around it and slowed down very fast.

It never got larger or smalled and stayed in the exact spot until it was just gone.  This was just prior to sunset.  At first glance I thought it was an early star then noticed the U-shape when I used the binoculars.We were on the causeway between Sanibel Island Florida and the mainland, facing the Gulf of Mexico, looking for shells and waiting for the sun to set.  The sun was about 1degree above the horizon when I noticed something to the right of the sun.  At first I thought it was an early star, but my husband said that it looked like a jet because there were two jet trails.  We both got our binoculars to get a closer look.  It did look like jet trails...but in the shape of a U and at the curved part of the U was a darkened area.  We could see it with the naked eye, but after the sun set we could only see it using binoculars.  We both watched until about 8:15 pm eastern time.  At that time...we just couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  Neither of us took our eyes off of this thing for even one second.  At arm&apos;s length, the U was about the size of going around the nail of a little finger fingernail.  The &quot;legs&quot; of the U were pointed slightly west...towards the sun.  An airplane passed in our field of view, at one point, and the brightness of the U-thing was much brighter than the trail left by the plane.  The plane was much closer to us.  Neither of us could make out any details of the darkened area inside the U.  It was just too far away.  From the horizon, the U-thing was about 30degrees up and only a few degrees North of due West.

I looked up and to the north I saw an amber orange glowing object that was no more then 3 miles high slowly flying in our direction (South). As it flew slowly, amber light was always glowing, but would increase and decrease its intensity. It would hold its glow for 5 seconds then it would brighten and hold for 5 seconds then decrease again for 5 seconds. This continued for 2 minutes until the object itself made an 80 degree left turn towards the east over Santee.

During this time I fought off a very numbing feeling (I almsot felt drowsy) that I believe was caused by the flying object. It was not bigger than a car and it traveled with the cars.  As if bored with what it was doing it rose and went up 2 or 3 cars which traveled in front of me. Finally, it rose and sped at an incredible speed over the small town.  I&apos;m sure that no one besides me can remember it. I fought to stay on top of the incredible spectacle I witnessed.

Two Weeks previous to my sighting I was listening to a local Talk show (The Allen Prell Show [WBAL AM 1090]) A Caller discribed a simular craft sighted around twilight, said to be standing still. The host listened, then quickly moved on with no comment (seeming to Poo Poo the caller). To go on with my discription the craft that I saw was huge. Very low, only one to two hundred feet (a normal plane going this slow would fall from the sky). The craft was SILENT, it made a U-turn in a jerky or phasing manner in little more then its own length. A normal craft would have to make a wide banking turn. The sighting did not last much longer due to the low hight it soon flew out sight. I looked around the parking lot to see if anyone had shared my sighting and found that I  was alone (very suprising due to the time of day and the normally busy area where this ocurred). I then entered a shop and told the clerk what happened, he quickly changed the subject (case closed).((NUFORC Note:  A revision was sent by witness:  &quot; I am sorry but an error was made in my report.

No sound was noted the wind direction was from the east which should have carried the sound towards us.  The craft moved forward for about 30 seconds ( very slowly) then turned completly on its side and changed direction from NW to SE. The craft flew on its side with wingtip down wingtip up and nose to SE. As it turned I was able to make out the shape of the triangle. The craft was very large.  A couple of cessnas flew at the same altitude that night in the same area, and 5 of them would have fit into the wingspan of this craft. Also we had no problem hearing the other aircraft in the area. The craft flew on its side the legnth of the school building then turned on its back and flew away I have been waiting to see if any further reports would turn up.  A number of people who saw the object said it had to be an aircraft ( reason being is that they didn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s)  However, because of the size and the manuevering capability demonstrated I feel that it was definetly something unusual.  The actual object was only visible when it turned on its side.   There was no sound from the aircraft during the entire sighting. The craft was in back of the main crowd, there were only about 11 people in a position to see it.  we were unable to get any photos of it.  It would have been difficult because of the stadium lights. The craft did not appear threatening at any point in time. We didn&apos;t feel afraid but were excited and elated to see it. No unusual smells were noted and no missing time was experienced. ( When I first noted the object I kept an eye on hte stadium clock just in case) There were aircraft in the area, however none were there at the same time as the object. Mostly single engine type craft were out that night. This sighting was reported to Major Filer and MUFON since I&apos;m one of their investigators.  However, If your investigator is interested in this I would be happy to talk with him/her.  I appologize for being so late in getting this report out.  Circumstances in my life have made it difficult to keep up on my UFO stuff. You may release my name but its important to keep my address and telephone confidential.((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by MUFON investigator.))", "30 LIGHT OVAL SHAPE CIRCLEI WAS STANDING ON BOARD A CRUISE SHIP WATHING THE SUN SET  WHEN THERE SEEM TO BE A CIRKLE OF LIGHTS , NOT MOVING, JUST STANDING STILL IN THE SKY, I TOOK A PHOTO AND THE IMAGE IS CLEARLY SHOWN ON FILM , THE IMAGE IS OVAL AND IT CLEARLY SHOWS ABOUT 30 LIGHTS IN A OVAL SHAPE WITH ONE OF TO THE SIDE , I HAD THE PHOTO LAB EXANINE IT TO SEE IF THERE DUST SPECKS OR SOME OTHER FORM OF INTERFERENCE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A UFO((NUFORC Note:  We have received a photographic print from the witness, and we share his interest in this event.

Feb.16,2000 I had just come out of the logli&apos;s grocery store on State st. in Rockford, IL. I placed my groceries in the van and turned to return my cart, that is when I saw four amber orbs in the night sky. Three of the orbs formed a triangle, while one was positioned down below.The orbs were a very bright amber color, a bit larger then the north star at it&apos;s largest. The orb  that formed the left point of the triangle was a floater. It floated between the top orb and the bottom orb. The moon was 3/4 full and it was a cold,clear well lite night.I called to a gentleman getting out of his vehicle and he stood for a couple of minutes and watched them with me.... he had also never seen anything like them.I was not sure of there altitude so I got in the car to drive closer. After only a short distance they began to leave, so I pulled into a quiet paking lot behind Khols on State st.and watched. They would blink briefly then zoom into the southern sky. I watched until all you could see was a pin point and then the orb would be gone. Each one left individually.I am the wife of a pilot/airplane mechanic and I have speant much of my adult life with my eyes pointed toward the sky, but never have I seen such a sight as I saw on Feb 16,2000. As I said before it was a very clear well lite night. The stars were beautiful and the moon was approximately 3/4 full.... but nothing compaired to the four amber colored orbs that floated in the night sky over Rockford,IL. When I first saw the orbs it was 9:30 pm, I had just looked at my watch upon leaving the store that I was coming out of. After placing my groceries in the van I saw the orbs glowing in the night sky. I quickly scanned the surrounding sky and discovered several aircraft flying in other parts of the sky, but none around the orbs. The orbs did not have any other colored lights on them that would indicate that they were an FAA approved aircraft.After observing them for several minutes, I also ruled out hot air balloons due to the fact that I could see stars all around the orbs. They also did not make the tell tale sound that a hot air balloon would make.I am confident that this was not one solid craft due to the fact that stars shone through the center of the triagle shape that they were forming.The orbs were very bright, but not too bright to comfotably look at with the naked eye.The orb that formed the left corner of the triagle was a floater... It first blinked a couple of times and appeared to float toward that top orb... paused...blinked... then floated to its original location. Then the whole process started again only this time it floated toward the bottom  right orb. At this point I was unable to determine what altitude all of this was taking place at, so I thought to get a better look. I got in my van and started to drive closer to them. Unfortunately as I did this one by one they would blink and disappear into the southern sky.So I opted to pull over into a parking lot behind Khols on State St. and watch.As I sat there I decided that if they were the size of a jet liner I would guess them to be at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Now I do not claim that this was their size or altitude. I am only stating that it is my best guess at an approximate altitude if they were the size of an airliner.It actually looked liked the orbs were suspended in air... I watched the last orb rapidly blink and then zoom out of sight into the southern sky. I looked down and the time was 9:40pm. I sat for a few more minutes wa! tching t he sky for any other signs of the orbs, there were none... so I headed for home.((NUFORC Note:  Witness did indicate a time in the Event Time box.  We have entered a time of &quot;21:30 hrs.,&quot; the time indicated by most other witnesses.))", "going so. on the 57-fwy appox at brea cyn. rd. in the city of brea.

We would like other reports from the area before we conclude that there was anything unusual about the sighting.))At around 10.45 p.m when I just looked at the sky, i found 5 lighted objects.  The size of these lights were double the diameter of the moon size.  These lights were light blue in colour.  Four of these lighted objects were moving in a particular rhythmn, whereas one was solitary.  These four lights would converge at one point and then they would move out and again come and converge.  This sequence was repeating itself many times.  Whereas the other solitary lighted object was just moving from left to right.  This happened for about 6-7 minutes and then they all started moving left to right.  The sky was cloudy.  This light was not very sharp but a kind of dispersed type.

They seemed to be following each other. They appeared to be about the size of a dime from where I was. The dogs that I was walking were unusally quiet for beagles during this incident.

As I was looking at the moon low on the horizon, I saw a green light shoot up from the bushes ahead of me to the right. It arced  up to about 100 ft. and leveled off then casually moved horizontally towards the freeway above me. The last view I had of it was leaning over my stearing wheel looking straight up at it. I was so deep in thought as to what the hell it was that I missed my exit four miles down the road. There was no structure surounding the light and it&apos;s movement was slightly erratic. Although I was traveling 70mph, I got a good look at it. It was about the size of a soccer ball and green like a traffic light.

We turned on to Winding hill road the object was still there in the western sky. We then pulled over to get a better look at the object.  We killed the engine, then I got out of the car.  My wife stayed in the car she could see it from her window. There was a river to the right of us. To the left a corn field and a sand pit.  Above the sand pit the object was hovering about 700to1000 feet.  At arms legnth the object was approxamatly the size of a dime.  The light was as bright as a flood light, luminating rays of light, much like a planet. At times some rays seemed bluish.  To my left I heard machinery running (farm equipment)behind me I could hear the sound of tracktortrailer trucks on route 201A, no sound was coming from the object.  At about 2:27am the object rose very slow, then it started heading in our direction.  My wife started to become very nervous.  The white light then surrounded the object.  As it came closer my wife stepped out of the car.  On the bottom of the object there were three large orangish-yellow lights.  At this time the object was directly above us.  I could see a large rectangle structure with the orangish-yellow lights in the center, arround it a whitish light.  My wife saw the same form but was not sure how many lights there were.

Anyway, I went back to looking up at the sky, and at approximately 2-o-clock my position (NorthWest), out over the Ocean I saw what appeared to be a slow moving star or satellite...Cool. No big deal I thought. You see satellites all the time in the night sky. But what made this sighting take on a whole new dimension was that there was another one slightly cocked at an angle trailing it, but at a &quot;fixed&quot; position. So I thought, &quot;2 satellites travelling together? Do they do that?&quot; Then, I noticed yet ANOTHER satellite, this one trailing both the first two, but at the SAME moving, fixed position.

At first I thought it was a star or planet (was brighter then Jupiter) as it was starting to get dark and stars were starting to appear in the twilight.  Then I noticed it was moving slowly south, and my impression was it must be an airplane landing light. (To the east and southeast is the landing pattern for flights coming into Burbank Airport.)  But as I watched the light suddenly went out.  I noticed a very faint star like appearance in the same vicinity moving in the same direction for a few seconds as I searched for the object, and then it was gone. I thought that was odd.  I then noted a couple of planes coming into Burbank further away than what I had seen and a light plane flying in the northeast, none of which looked like what I had seen.  Thinking about this now, it was as if something had jumped from near to far instantly.

I could see a shadow of a structure above the orange glow, it must have been pretty large.  Suddenly it dripped a large tear on fire (similar to orange molten lava dripping) down to earth.  Next it folded over and we could now see two florescent orange glowing circles.  The tear burn&apos;t out before it made it to the ground.  It started to climb rapidly and all the sudden it darted off into space in a straight line at lightning speed (or maybe even faster).  My friend later described the way it darted off as being plucked out from space (imagine a catpult slinging something).  During our entire sighting it made no sound and left no trail.

My desk was next to a large window that overlooked a large parking lot down below.  It was clear and sunny outside.  I was about to go to lunch, and, while standing to stretch, instinctively looked out the window.  My attention was immediately drawn to what looked like a silver balloon-type object &quot;maneuvering&quot; over the parking lot.  In fact, I would have dismissed it as a balloon had its movements not struck me as rather peculiar after watching it for a couple of minutes.  Rather than be whipped around as a balloon typically would be in a breeze or wind, it moved slowly around the cars and would occasionally seem to &quot;hover&quot; in a spot for a minute or so before slowly moving on. By now most of my co-workers had left for lunch, but I managed to get the attention of a man who was walking by my area and asked him to take a look and tell me if he saw the same thing I was looking at!  He also saw it and agreed that its movements were unusual for a balloon.  I made it a point to see if anybody else was in the parking lot who might be observing the balloon up close and personal, but there was no one.  While I considered the incident strange even as I experienced it, it obviously was not enough to make me go tearing to the elevator and out into the parking lot to get a better look (the other witness, as far as I know, didn&apos;t check it out further either).  I went to lunch at a place in the building and when I returned to my desk and looked out the window, the object was gone.  I never quite forgot over the years, however, what I have come to label my &quot;intelligent balloon&quot; and wonder if anybody else has had a similar experience, especially in the middle of the big city.", "it was late, and i saw these things in the sky about 300ft over my head and there was no noise at all and no other cars or plains around ethierI was at my friends house with my other friends too, we where outside playing b-ball, and then I saw thes lights in the sky right over my head about 300 to 500 ft above.

Just these circle things in the sky. And we also get it on tape. we watched ot over and over again. We have about 4 mins of it. They just where flyinh around in the sky.

I saw a large white ball of light slowly descending southeast of my position. My first thought was that it was some sort of a meteorite, because it seemed to be streaking slowly down toward the horizon.  Then it seemed to travel in a southeast direction and the &quot;tail&quot; got smaller and smaller.   Some trees momentarily blocked my view, and when I could again see the patch of sky where it had been, it was gone. It wasn&apos;t a vapor trail from an airplane, and it was moving so slowly that I assumed it was something in the upper atmosphere.   My second thought was space junk burning up in the atmosphere, but I did see the space junk that burned up in the atmosphere a year or two ago, and it looked very different (space junk looked &quot;sparkly&quot;, versus just a solid patch of light like my sighting).   My next thought was that it was a meteorite, and I really expected to see it continue falling to the ground followed by a big explosion (actually picked up my cell phone to let my husband know my location should it touchdown). Two nights later there was a segment on Q13 news about some UFO sightings in China.  They showed some of the Chinese newscast images of their UFOs, which looked very much like what I saw, only their were moving horizontally, while mine appeared to be moving vertically.  Sent an email to the news to ask them if anyone else had reported a sighting after seeing their report, but got no response.", "Saw, sitting in the garden, 4 star like dots, similar to satellite but moving much faster,heading in V formation (no leader) East-West (Westwood-Santa Monica) no sound .

The mag at it&apos;s brightest was about the same as the trapezium&apos;s mag in Orion but no two flashes had the same intensity.  This flashing lasted from 3 - 5 minutes, then the area was quiet.Last night, I was looking at M42, Orion&apos;s nebula with a pair of 10x50 mounted binoculars.  At 2221 I was waiting to see a pass of an iriduim satellite that was due at 2236.  For this is my hobby, looking for Iridium satellites, and keeping track of Mir and the ISS.  While I waited, I turned to Orion and observed through the binoculars a flash of light just like an Iridium satellite makes when It&apos;s main array catches the sun.  The weird thing was that the flashing didn&apos;t move.  It stayed about 13 arc minutes to the east of M42.  Flashing about once every 8 seconds.  The intensity of flashes was not the same, and the interval was not the same between the flashes.  But the big flashes seemed to be around 6 - 10 seconds apart.  The biggest flashes were about the same magnitude as the Trapezium stars at about 5.  This went on for about 2 minutes, then the flashing seemed to move to the north west of M42 keeping within a 13 arc minute circle from the center of M42.  This went on for about a minute or two.  Then all was quiet.  This may sound funny, but it looked like I was witnessing a battle or explosions that were localized in that area. My quardinates are 49.2330 degrees N, 7.3170 degrees E.

I live in Smyrna, Tennessee--about 30 miles southeast of Nashville. On March 9, around 9:00pm CST, in the western sky, I saw a large, spherical object slowly descend in a diagonal until it disappeared behind the tree line. It was BRIGHT--a fluorescent green so bright it almost appeared white. It was LARGE--much larger than anything I have ever seen traverse the sky.  Most unusual, though, it descended the sky relatively slowly--much slower than any shooting star that I have seen.  I saw the object for 3 or 4 seconds.  When it descended below the tree line, I expected to hear a &quot;boom&quot; or something--I thought that it might have been an burning airplane.

Just as I crested the hill of the on ramp a &quot;white&quot; ball flew over my car from back to front.  I could see burning chunks of material trailing behind it.  It was traveling very fast and appeared to be very low.  I recall thinking to myself that it was either very low or very large.  I felt that it was too low to completely burn up. I expected it to hit the ground but realized it was traveling horizontal.  It appeared white hot to me.  There was no accompanying sound that I can recall. However, I did have my radio on. P.S. I reported this sighting to Peter on the Ernie Brown Show, KOMO Radio.", "While bringing my children into school we all witness a white object in a cone shape moving across the horizon. My daughter saw it first and brought to our attention. It was moving on a southwesternly path at a pace slower than a Jet yet relatively fast. The form was solid white except for the tail end which was somewhat transparent. The shape was similiar to a cone with a rounded front but the tail did not come to a complete point.I pretty well explained what we saw in the summary but it did not strike us as being a jet plume more like a meteor. It seems to move around the horizon and then we lost site of it as it entered some clouds. It was quite interesting.

I looked out and i saw three very bright white lights arranged in a triangle shape.  It flew over my house silently and then 30 secs later another three lights flew over again being completely silent.When i first saw them i thought they looked like the light arrangement on a 737 that had just lifted off.  this most certainly could not be because i lived in a small residential area with no roads long enough for a huge aircraft to take off from.  Also if a 737 flew over my house i am pretty sure i would hear some kind of engine noise which i did not.", "We were fishing off the pier at montauk point, and i see a blazing light flash in the sky.

We were near the intersection of Bell Rd. and Mufreesboro Rd. travelling south, when we noticed a very large object that looked like a giant dumbbell in the sky.  I saw on the dash radio when we got out it was 9:42pm as immediately prior to the beginning of the incident I was changing the radio station.  The object came in very slow from the NE, and then turned paralell to the road we were on.  It came to a stop.  As it came to a stop another vehicle, a station wagon, stopped with us.  Out of it got a man, a woman, a boy, and a oyung girl. We estimated it to be about a half of a mile to a mile away.  It appeared to hover.  There was no sound of any type eminating from it.  About five minutes or so after it stopped in the air, three triangular ships approached it from the NE also at a high rate of speed, and took up positions rotating about it.  This relationship was maintained by all the ships with the three triangular ships were rotating horizontally, with their apparent noses pointing towards the dumbbell shaped craft in a counter clockwise manner.   We maintained this observation for some ten minutes, until the dumbell craft moved SSE about three ship lengths of itself, abruptly turned to a 60 degree upward pitch, and literally went up instantly.  The starfield around the ship seemed to bend towards it.  Almost as quickly, the three triangular ships turned upward, as if in pursuit of it.  They seemed to be reacting to the dumbbell ships actions, and were visibly slower in their acceleration towards it. When we got in the car it was 10:24pm, and we seemed disturbed by the incident because the amount of time we spent outside the vehicle seemed to be no more than 15 to 20 minutes.

It changed in color and was followed by a low boom noise minutes later.My friend and I were on a logging road approxiamatly 1.25 miles east of Cedar pond which is about 5 miles SE of Sultan, Washington. It was about 19:20, bright and sunny day, when we both noticed a very, very bright meteor like object traveling at a very high rate of speed towards the SE. We had a compass with us and took a bearing. We first saw the object  at around 155 and last saw it at 135.  I believe the object was 40-50 degrees above the horizon when we first saw it and about 20 when it disappeared behind a ridge. It may have actually sort of went, &quot;poof&quot;, right before it went behind the ridge. It changed color also as it traveled, I saw white, white-blue, green, orange. The event lasted about 2.5 seconds. It was extremely bright and comparable to the light created by a welder. It was actually very beautiful. About 3 to five minutes after witnessing the object, we heard a very low boom-like crack coming from the SE. It was definitly not gunfire or blasting. It upset many birds in the area. We witnessed about 25-30 ravens flying SE afterwards which seemed out of character, because the usually stay in pairs at lower elevations (from my experience).((NUFORC Note:  Other reports submitted to the Snohomish County, Washington, 9-1-1 facility, and the Everett, WA, newspaper.

The kids flew their kites and many adults also flew kites and we had a nice picnic.  They were giving prizes for the best kite, the highest flying one, etc.  They even had a hot air baloon for the kids.  Anyway, about 5 pm, the announcer told the crowd that one of the kites was caught in a &quot;thermal&quot;, a hot air convection and was about 800 ft and going up.  So, everyone is looking up and I was eating.  I stopped, looked up and saw some white bugs in front of my eyes, or so I thought!  I refocused and suddenly realized that I was focusing on some silver dots flying about 30,000 ft up.  They were going from east to west directly into the soon to be setting sunlight. I think the sun set at about 6 or so.  Anyway, 2 of the disks suddenly moved quite a bit ahead of the others, which seemed to be swarming.  They then were lost in the sun.  My friend came from the other side of the park, about a mile away and asked, &quot;did you see those things flying up there?&quot;  He said all the people were really excited about seeing something, but it happened so fast that you didn&apos;t realize what you were seeing until you actually thought about it a bit.  They looked EXACTLY like the old movie of the UFOS in Montana in the late forties.

In and out of line of sight in less than 2 seconds.I awoke a few minutes before 9:45 pm, looked out the bedroom window (facing East) through a 3-foot open area where our drapes were open. I was watching the sky, fully awake, when IT appeared, swooping down in a &quot;lazy J&quot; pattern, ie from 12 o&rsquo;clock to 3 o&rsquo;clock, then continuing straight across my line of sight (East to West). (Only 1 object.) I believe IT was at 1500-2000 feet, below the usual approach altitude of commercial jets to SFO. IT was backlit by the moon, which was at that particular time hidden by the clouds producing a diffused background glow. IT appeared to be gunmetal dark gray/black, and I had the impression of IT having a muted red glow on the lower half. I also had the impression of panels or planes on both upper and lower halves, and in the center at the equator, a row of windows. I also had the impression that the bottom half had an internal ring which was rotating. Nothing on this craft was bright, there were no blinding lights. Size is indeterminate, however holding a 25-cent piece at my arm&rsquo;s length gave me an estimate. Notable was the flat top and bottom, exactly like two inverted china tea cups. Going from right to left in my &quot;3 foot window-of-view&quot; it took less than 2 seconds. The movement was smooth, without any sound. I did have the &quot;impression&quot; of subliminal sound, kind of like the Jetson&rsquo;s car, but it may have been purely overactive imagining. It was at that time I looked at my bedside clock: 9:45 pm. I was shocked. I didn&rsquo;t move for a minute or so, but then I ran to the window to see if IT was hovering anywhere around. As I checked out the sky (lit up by the moon), a commercial jet flew by at the usual approach altitude to SFO (maybe 3000 feet?), making the usual noise. Quite a contrast to the silent passage of IT.", "Observed a bright orange glowing light in controlled flight which abruptly disappeared, replaced by spark like lights which continued on and slightly downwardI am a middle aged college educated male familiar with astronomy and modern technology.At around 10:40 in the evening on the 29th of February,I got up to turn off the table lamp in my front room.I observed through the window a bright orangish light coming from the north, over the Islands, on the other side of the San Joiquin river,across from the town I live in.Lights from this direction are not abnormal as transport jets from nearby Travis Airforce Base often use this approach in their training.The color and shape of the light was unusual.As it turned to the East at the northern edge of the town, I noticed the lights on the object did not lessen in intensity as it turned away from me.It moved approximatly 1 mile more to the east before abruptly disappearing.As soon it did, spark like lights dropped from the same spot in the sky and continued onward and slightly downward.", "I WAS BORN IN 1951,SO I WAS 16 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.

It made no sound, and left no trail. The entire sequence lasted about 3 seconds.", "Blue glowing cloud shape.I went camping/biking at Arroy Seco last week with three other friends. the plan was to bike the Indians Road to the top of the mountain and turn back before it began it&apos;s descent to Big Sur. My friends were pretty much too out of shape to make the 14 mile ride so I went alone while they stayed at the gorge, roughly three miles from the camp site. I began the ride well before noon to avoid direct sunlight since the trail is on the west side of mountain. Initially, I was at this same mountain last summer, when i only completed about 7 miles of the trail. I was determined to make it to the top since then. About 9 miles up the mountain, I paused for a short break at the 9 mile marker. There is a sign there outlining the trails you can access from there and thier distances. While I was resting and eating, I noticed a small &apos;rainbow&apos; in the sky near a cluster of common clouds. The &apos;rainbow&apos; had an unusual shape. More like that of the Aurora Borealis (did I spell that right?) then a conventional rainbow. It appeared to be eminating from the cluster of clouds in a sheet-like pattern. I really didn&apos;t pay a great deal of attention to it since the colors were familiar to that of a regular rainbow. Other then the fact that it was extremely pretty, it really didn&apos;t strike me as odd. However, when I got back on my bike and rode for maybe another mile or two, I came around a blind curve all the while glancing up at the rainbow. When I came around though, I noticed an additional cloud that was out of view before. This cloud had a strange shape in the sense that it was not like the other clouds around. It was more like a heavy mist below the rest of the clouds. The strangest thing about this cloud though was it&apos;s color: the top half of the cloud was normal white/grey, but the bottom half was a neon blue! No kiddin! I have never seen such a color that was not man made, i.e., it had the color of a those glow sticks you would see at a dance or perhaps on Halloween. It seemed to just hang above the mountain I was riding. Being so high in the mountains has a somewhat breathtaking feeling by itself, add a sight that you have never before seen, and you can become downright freaked-out. I stopped riding and just watched the cloud and it&apos;s unusual color. I thought I would continue my ride and hope to &apos;get a closer look&apos; at the &apos;object&apos;. I began riding again for another mile or so when the trail began a descent for about a quarter mile in a very curvey fashion. The road ended at this point due to a landslide that had occured, perhaps this last winter. I climbed the slide and realized that it was surely unstable. Should I fall, I would have been screwed. I looked up to see if I could still see the &apos;cloud&apos; but could not. I assumed that because of my position, my vision was impaired. Note: when i first saw the cloud, it was in the S/SE sky. At the current postion I was in, I was facing SW and because I still had a ways to go to reach the top of the mountain, it is possible that the cloud was much lower to the mountain top then I had once though. At this point, rather then hiking my bike over the land slide, I decided to turn around head back to camp. The rest of the trail would all be down hill. I stopped at the same point in the trail that I first saw the cloud to see if it was still there...of course, it wasn&apos;t. Witness note: I have always been fascinated with space/science, etc and have never been one to accept things without a logical explaination. Yet, there is certainly a part of me that wants to believe in such things as intelligent beings from other worlds, spirits, ghosts, god, etc. But until now, I usually have an explaination for things that most people would rather just excuse as &apos;miracles&apos; &apos;un-explained phenomona&apos; &apos;UFO sightings&apos;, etc. I have begun a search for such Meteorological anomolies(?) but have turned up empty handed. A friend told me that there is a talk show host that believes that the government is conducting experiments to control the weather patterns. I surely cannot give that much credit to our government. I think that there is a logical explanation for what I saw, I just have yet to find it. If anyone has any info on such &apos;lights in the clouds&apos; please post them on this site or contact me via e-mail. Thanks for &apos;listening&apos;.", "I saw the flying cigar! It was flying low, toward the north. It flew right over me.

It was so cool. A friend saw it too. It was NOT an jet, it made no noise, it was very large like a football field or two. Wow. No wing lights, I could draw a picture of it.Lights at each end, white lights and little red ones flashing on and off. Long cigar shape, flying very low! Did other folks see this thing? It looked like it was headed for San Jose like the other aircraft that fly over, but then I could not see any wings so I don&apos;t think it landed at San Jose airport! It was flying much lower than the other aircraft. A jet that low would make a deafening sound but this did not. I am so excited!

I knew that even during an FCF ( Functional Check Flight ) post maintenance flight a jet with no external tanks or pylons, in afterburner could not perform such absolute verticle accelerated maneuvers. Afterburners are visible as yellow light until over 33 thousand feet. This objects velocity to height ratio proved it to be near the ground in an atitudinal sense so there should have been at least turbulence related sound accompanied by vapor or if hot,residual particulate smoke. It was most clearly defined as a mirror reflection being shot against the sky. I had explored the possibilities of it having been a meteor with just the right entry angle to deflect it back out into space. This didn&apos;t hold water due to the physical anomolies associated with the sightng. If it were a meteor there would have been sound and vapor if not a sonic boom. Although gradual the upwrd arc to verticle was, in the grand scale of the atmosphere, quite short and erratic. At this velocity an aircraft would have surely have been destroyed due to overgee. Clearly this wa! s a uniq ue sighting that challenges the physical world as we know it. Since then I have had a newfound respect for those who believe. I look up much more often.", "In commercial Jet from LA to Phoenix. Looking out north window below our jet, a light with no strobes was tracking our jet, after 10 minuted its light went out...no strobes..moon light reflected off object only. flew at same speed as jet, directly over I-10.I was in a flight from LA to phoenix, at around 8:45pm after reaching 33,000 feet I noticed a light &quot;following&quot; our jet. I was seated at the rear of the plane wing. wondering if this was an optical illusion I moved forward, and the light was blocked out by the rear-edge of our jet&apos;s wing. Therfore I could safely know this object was beneath us flying. Not just a reflection off my window. We were flying almost directly over I-10, and near Palm-Springs. This object almosy matched our planes speed, but after watching for nearly 10 minutes, I noticed it was actually a little slower, it was further from the edge of the wing fro my perspective. Then our jet made a slight path change, and went turned a little south. When our plane turned, the light kept going straight, so this further confirmed it was not a reflection. Then after about 30 seconds it corrected its course floowing our plane exactly, then it started speeding up, and was actually going faster, at which point the light went out on it. It had NO strobes, no lights whatsoever. I thought it had just dissappeared, but as I looked I could actually see a very faint blue light where it had been, I could track this light over the surrounding lights from I-10/city, it was more like reflected moon-light possibly, it then sped up and I lost visual of the object when our planes wing was in the way. There were many other planes in the sky that night, I was in a Boeing 737, which means I was traveling around 500-600 MPH, this was NOT a small plane. All other planes in the sky that night both above, and below our altitude had strobes. Our plane had strobes. This object was bright, one light, travelling far beneath our altitude, and between 500-600 mph over I-10 eastbound. I would really like to know what in the world it was. Do military aircraft fly low, and &quot;black&quot;/no strobes? -((name deleted))", "I saw an oval shaped metallic disk hovering in the sky in broad daylight.I was sitting at the corner of M-21 and M-66 facing west at the traffic light getting ready to turn north on M-66.  Looking straight ahead and to the left towards the Michigan Training Unit and Supermax prisons I saw an oval shaped disk hovering in the sky above the trees about 100-125 ft.  I could tell it was metallic because of the sun shining off it. It never moved and with all the traffic I couldn&apos;t tell if it made any noise.  I quickly turned onto M-66 going north and went around the corner taking Branch St. and King St. back to M-21.  In just that short of time, it was gone, disappeared.  I kept driving on M-21 past the prisons, past Bertha Brock park, trying to see where it went.  Finally, I gave up and went back home.  I was so shook up and excited it took me awhile to calm down enough to tell my family about it.  They didn&apos;t doubt me for a minute.  This isn&apos;t the first time I&apos;ve seen a UFO.  Back in the &apos;80s when my husband and I were dating we saw one on Tuttle Road, looking towards Townsend Rd.  That one was a line of 6 lights hanging suspended in the sky.  Two of the middle lights gradually moved towards each other and then all 6 lights disappeared in a snap.  We weren&apos;t the only ones to see that one.  It was in the Ionia Sentinel Standard, a local newspaper the next day.  And when I went to get groceries the next day at Fred&apos;s Food Centre, everyone around me was talking about it.", "Driving west bound until I saw a glowing sphere staying stationary over the west than fading out.There was actually 2 objects, the lighted sphere to the west then a disc craft past underneath it. The disc craft flew from south to north at a fast velocity, and disappereaerd behind some trees, but the sphere stayed glowing off to the west until it disappeared ten seconds after the disc. The disc was a silver color, the sphere was glowing like a star, or a bright rocket engine.", "I observed a triangular object hovering without sound for approximately 15 minutes during the night.I was walking the rim of the rock quarry at approximatly 2:00a.m.  I observed a triangular shaped object moving towards my location from the northern sky.  It stopped above the rock quarry and began to hover.  It was approximately 300 feet away from me and 600 feet up in the sky.  It made absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Nothing could be heard from it.  There were different colored lights on bottom side of the object, white lights on each end or wing of the triangle and lights in towards the center of the craft.  This craft was hugh.  It was capable of moving in any direction, vertically, horizontally, and angularly.  Every movement was precise, controlled, and smooth.  It would hover between moves as if it were observing something.  Needless to say I was in shock and ended up on the ground.  I was hysterical with fear and overcome with curiosity.  I had never seen anything like this before, nor have I ever since.  I tried to remain as quiet as possible so I would not be detected by the craft, but I somehow suspected it knew I was there.  I was really scared to death, and strangely struck in amazement at the same time.  It&apos;s very difficult to put into words.  I just laid there on the ground and watched it.  Finally, from a stand still in the sky, it suddenly took off at a very high rate of speed in the same direction it came from and in about 3-4 seconds it was completely gone.  That&apos;s all I remember.  It was over with the blink of an eye.  I have not spoken but to only a few people about this incident for fear of being ridiculed.  I know what I saw and to read it on paper somehow leaves it lacking in realism.  But nothing can ever change what I experienced, what I felt, what I saw.   For me it was a life changing experience.  My fiance observed that when I speak of this, I get visably shaken and nervous, he feels &quot;there&apos;s more to this than I am aware&quot;.  I am willing to be regressed, to see if I am repressing memories of that encounter.

Each group took approx. 3 sec. flying at 80 to 90 degrees across the sky.Watching from a parking lot, we observed small lights in a semi-circle which we first thought were geese.  Of course, it was too dark for geese and this formation moved across the sky in about 3 seconds.  We continued on to my car and another group of 7 appeared in the sky about 15 sec. later. We stopped this time wondering if it was the same group having returned but another appeared after the same 15 second interval with 3 which invalidated that premise.  My friend commented that the skies were alive tonite as we turned back to the South and awaited another group.  Much to our surprise, a group of 14 flew over.  These were not in a perfect semi-circle formation and were more scattered. By this time we had ruled out a search light and airplanes which were flying slowly by comparison in the area.  After another group of seven which flew directly overhead, the show was over. There were not sounds whatsoever, and it was smooth sailing from one end of the sky to the next.  Very spectacular -- incredible!!!((NUFORC Note:  We received a telephoned report from both parties who witnessed this event.

The object(s) moved slowly (25 MPH?) at a distance of 1500(?) feet from my vantage point. There was no associated sound, although the hiway drone was moderate. The formation stopped momentarily, made 2 full clockwise rotations (parrallel to the ground) and proceeded on its previous northwest heading, apparently following Hiway 17 toward the direction of Los Gatos. The first impression of the light was similar to a highlight following the contour of a chrome bar (of each independent Rod) as they reflected sunlight, while manuvuering the rotations. Then doubt followed, as the yellow and blue light was irratic and became very bright not characteristic of reflective light at all, but perhaps emitted.

The craft was flying low in front of me, only a couple of hundred feet up, and passed out of sight behind some low hills to the west.  Its flight path was a straight line with no sudden accelerations.  There were two oddities:  it was going very slowly for such a narrow, wingless hull, and it wobbled quite noticeably.Traveling north on I-5 on clear, moonless night, with desert mountains on the right, low hills on left, and no trees anywhere, my attention was drawn to my right, where, over the crest of the mountains, I saw what appeared to be a plane with multiple white lights, such as are turned on when a large plane is about to land.  The lights were numerous and extremely bright and the object was flying low over the mountain on a bearing from northeast to southwest, a diagonal to the oncoming north-south traffic.  I looked at it for awhile, remarking to myself how bright it was (&quot;never seen that many lights on a plane before,&quot; I thought), then I looked back to the road to keep my eye on oncoming traffic.  The object crossed the road and I realized it was traveling quite slowly, about on a par with the automobiles (45 to 65 mph).  As it passed from the right side of the road to the left at a distance of at most a half a mile, I could see that it was illuminated from stem to stern by brilliant white lights of varied shape.  The lights were confined to the perimeter of the craft, which became apparent because the &quot;plane&quot; (I was still under the impression that it was an ordinary jetliner about to land at an unknown airfield over the hills to my left), was wobbling about its central axis.  As it wobbled I could see that the lights clearly outlined an elongated triangle.  The triangle was shaped like a spearhead, much longer on its sides than its base was wide, with quite a sharp point.  There were no wings, and no stabilizer that I could make out, except perhaps a low fin-like ridge (also triangle shaped) toward the rear, but I wouldn&apos;t swear to it).  It occurred to me at this point that I might be seeing one of the famous flying triangles from the Netherlands flap, or such as had been reported in Lancester (which it so happens was east of my location, though I did not know it at the time), or in upstate New York.  I was incredulous at the triangular shape of the craft, so I did my best to confirm it by focusing my a! ttention between the lights on the shadowy contours.  I recall remarking to myself several times that, yes, it WAS a triangle, because the ENTIRE perimeter of bright white lights was filled in by the dark shadow of the hull, occluding stars or terrain that passed behind the craft.  More about the lights:  All were bright white, similar to the new halogen lamps on automobile headlights.  However, they were not of uniform shape.  Some were roundish, others were blobby, or egg shaped.  It was an impressive array in sheer number and in variety, but all were confined to the edges of the craft, except ONE.  On the underbelly of the craft, about where you would find the center of gravity, there was a slowly blinking RED light.  It was this red light that made me think it was definitely a terrestrial or military craft.  As the craft neared the hills to my left, now at about an 8 o&apos;clock position, taking I-5 North as my 12 o&apos;clock pointer, I saw the tail section of the craft outlined.  It was diamond-shaped, similar to the tail section of, for want of a better comparison, the Imperial Star Destroyer in the STAR WARS movies.  In other words, it was like two long isosceles triangles joined at the base.  The craft passed out of sight over the low hills to the left, much lower now than the mountains to the right where it had first appeared.  As I drove up I-5 about a mile farther, I looked to the left to see the &quot;airfield.&quot;  Instead I saw that there were city lights there in the distance, though I&apos;m not sure which city it was or how far away (see the map I will send in the mail for my best guess).  As the craft passed out of sight I was struck by how much the craft wobbled, but I remarked to myself, &quot;Well, that&apos;s what you&apos;d expect from a plane with a wing-shape like that.&quot;  But I was tired: it occurred to me later that this craft didn&apos;t have enough wing surface to keep it up AT ALL when flying at that slow speed, unless my sense of distance and time was badly off.  I would expect that only a supersonic jet flying at several hundred miles per hour would be able to stay aloft with a wing pattern such as I saw.  My final verdict is &quot;undecided, need more information.&quot;  Whatever I saw, it was quite unusual, and it kept me thinking for the rest of the night.", "Rolling oval, tumbling through the sky.

Thursday night, March 9,2000, at approximately 7pm I was on the front porch with my husband.  It was dark.  We were listening to music and I was just looking out towards our horse field when I saw a glowing green object swoop down onto the pasture and proceed to move horizontally but in a circular fashion to the north going up the field.  It irradiated a green color and lasted about 5-8 seconds and just disappeared.  Mu husband was not looking that way and saw nothing.  It seemed about almost as high as our 2-story house so it was fairly low to the ground.  I ruled out a child&apos;s toy or anything else and for lack of a better word, call it a ufo.

We thought they were satellites until they made course changes, one first, then the other following.  We had the impression one was trying to evade the other ?? Suddenly, the light on the right sent a tremdously bright beam of light toward the other, an instant later it was returned.

The &quot;lights&quot; weren&apos;t as sharp, or distiguishable as other airplanes in the sky at that time.  They were definately round and clearly visible, but not bright, it seemed.  They were clearly unlike any of the other aircraft or stars in the sky.  They flew in formation: if you were to number them 1-5, top to bottom, you would see 1, 2, 3, and 5 in a diagonal line, spaced evenly apart, and 4 just offset, inbetween 3 and 5 and off to the left.  They retained this formation as they flew from the south west to the north east at incredible speeds.  I witnessed the objects for about 3 seconds, while they sped out of sight.

Saturday, July 17th, 1999 I think I may have seen one. It was about 10:00 at night, and was a clear night. I was throwing something into the trashcan out at the curb, and when I turned around and walked towards the house I looked up at the sky. That is when I saw something that looked like an airplane, but the lights were formatted backwards. Flying west to east, there were three white lights, two in the front, leading it, and one in the back. There was also a steady red light in the center, which was not blinking, but glowing faintly. There was no sound like a normal plane would make, but a low humming sound. There were also no other planes in the area. I watched it until it passed; I did not have any cameras, so I could not get a picture of it. I always look up at night and look for things, but I did not expect to really find anything around here. I think I saw the common triangle UFO. It was passing over my house, at a distance of about 300 feet up, and 100 away. it was moving west to east. I have always been watching the skies, and I know what one is supposed to do if something is spotted. I made sure I remembered where I saw it, day, time, weather conditions, anyone else around, anything else strange, etc. all I noticed which was strange was there were no other sounds at all. It was a fairly nice night, and usually people have their dogs out side. There are usually bugs out making noise as well. I heard nothing, absolutely nothing. It was strange, the only thing I heard was the low humming. When it left, I can not remember anything like normal sounds starting up again, but I would not be surprised if they did. This is almost exactly what I saw.", "They were moving very fast across the sky and making quick turns.  Also the spent alot of time hovering.They were green with flashing yellow lights. It was atleast as big as a house.  It moved very fast and would sometimes dissapear from the sky.", "While driving south on I-75 I spotted a bright metallic object reflecting the early morning sun.While driving south on I-75 in SW Florida, I spotted a bright pea sized oval object in the early morning sky. It was just after sunrise and it apeared directly ahead of me at 45 degrees, roughly 10,000 feet altitude and stationary. I watched it for 10 seconds then it faded out. Within 1 second it or another object reapeared about 20 degrees to the right at the same altitude, but this time it was moving slowly to the left for about 30 seconds. Then, with an extremely bright flash it vanished. Seconds before the flash, the object looked like two ovals connected side to side. Initially I had considered the objects to be satillites reflecting the sunrise, until the object changed it&apos;s course.", "Hazy &quot;white light&quot; oval shaped craft emitted blue beam of light downward in proximity of Piscataqua River and US Naval Yard and Nuclear Submarine Facility.I have hesitated up until this day to report this event.  Although I understand it has been almost 1 year since the event, I now believe it&apos;s important to report the event even though I want to believe it was nothing more than a trick of my eyes.  As the months go by I am still drawn to what I saw and hope that reporting it will at the least get this off my mind. I was driving to my last home (apartment) on a warm summer night approximately in Mid June of 1999.  It was just after dark and perhaps a bit of &quot;dusk light&quot; left in the sky.  I can&apos;t exactly recall, but it was mostly dark at the least.  Beyond the treeline of where I live is the Piscataqua River, which is home to the US Navy Yard at Portsmouth, NH.  Among other things that are developed at the Navy Yard, the base supports the building of Nuclear Submarines.  Perhaps there is no connection, but I would think that if there was a motive for a UFO to be in the area, that would be it.  The treeline is approximately 500 ft away from the area that I spotted the craft.  Furthermore, if you extended your arm as far as you could away from your body and measured 2.5 inches with your index finger and thumb, that would be the vertical distance between the treetops and the craft.  Based on that, I believe the craft was no more than 80-100 ft in the air.  The trees are approx. 50-60ft in height.  It is not an exact science, but I&apos;d said it&apos;s a fair estimation.  If the trees were 500ft away from where I was, then the craft was 550-600ft away (since from where I was it appeared that the craft would have been hovering directly over the river or just beyond the tree line where the trees meet the river). The craft itself would appear to be 40ft in length (width) and 20ft in height.  The blue beam was about 1/2 the width of the craft or 20ft wide and appeared from the bottom and center of the craft. The craft was moving slowly east or towards the mouth of the river, rather than further inland. As it moved a blue beam extended from the craft below the tree tops and out of my view.  I believe the craft hovered just along the bank of the river at times since the blue beam did appear to light up some of the trees.  The craft moved at an approximate speed of 10MPH.  I did not hear any sounds.  The craft was a glowing white light, but the light was isolated to the craft and didn&apos;t seem to extend beyond the craft.  It&apos;s as if the craft itself was the color of milky white light. As I continued on the road I lost the craft below the trees.  I do not know what happened after that.  I also, to this day, don&apos;t know why I didn&apos;t stop to get a better look.  Again, I just simply didn&apos;t want to believe what I saw. I only hope this serves to rustle up some other witnesses to this event.  Mr. Davenport et al, I hope you can make a call for NH Seacoast residents to recall their memories to last summer to see if anyone else saw this event.", "My sister and I were awakened by a flashing bright light. We looked out of the window and saw a hovering cigar shaped object. It stayed in one place for a short time and then took off at a high rate of speed.My sister and I had gone to sleep for the night, when we were awakened by our room filling with light, as if a giant flash bulb had gone off in our window. Our heads were at the window. We looked over towards each other curiously, and then wordlessly, we rolled over, slid up the wall and peeked out of the window. I saw a cigar shaped, hovering, metal looking thing with evenly spaced lights running along the side. I think they were red, or redish. It stayed for a second or two and then left quickly at a rate of speed that I&apos;d never seen before. It was out of sight in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds. We went downstairs and told our Mom.

We could see perfect detail on the jet like the wings, rear tail, etc. We then noticed after looking 20-30 seconds at the jet a circular object that at first I thought was an escort jet. I realized that it was completely circular, metallic in color, appeared larger than the jet, and left a very short tail maybe 2 object lengths long. The trail was not smoke. The object was alongside the object at 3:00 and stayed there for the duration of the sighting.

Just above trees in our backyard (100 feet) there was a single object similar in shape to the famous radio tower in Seattle.

Just before the craft left, the lights turned red and then shut off completely. I do not remember hearing any sound. But the craft was there one minute, and then was gone the next second. The craft took off towards the south.The date is an approximation, but I remember seeing the object close to my birthday, November 9. I was 10 years old at the time.

It had three distinct layers a small flat cylinder (more like a doughnut shape) on either end, with a larger more cylindrical shape in the middle. The lights were located on the lower part of the craft. The lights were arranged in a circle on the lower part of the craft with no lights in the center. They were oval-shaped with pointed ends. I remember seeing mostly white lights that came on in a circular pattern. Like a wave in a football game the lights would come on and off. Just before the craft left, the lights turned red all at once rather than in the circular pattern described before and then turned off completely before the craft suddenly took off.

One object appeared to accelerate to the South while the other remained stationary. During this sighting, I shook my head, rubbed my eyes, pinched myself (it hurt!), but I was not asleep.

At approx. 9:15pm, my sister asked to come outside to look at something in the sky - she was looking at it with naked eye and binoculars. I went outside and there it was -- approx. 20 - 30,000 feet up (about the highest a commercial jet is that you can see). The object was lit up with green, red, and white light. We couldn&apos;t make out the shape of it, being so high and far away, and object was about size of the north star on a clear night. We could tell it wasn&apos;t a jet or helicopter, as it didn&apos;t have lights that blinked like commercial aviation craft, instead the lights on it just seemed to be moving (too far away to tell if they were blinking in sequence, etc.). Through the binoculars, we could definitely see the red, green, and white lights on it, the red and green lights being brighter than the white. The craft was slowly moving north from south slowly, which we knew, because it was slowly getting dimmer as it went. We couldn&apos;t tell how many miles object was from us because of the height, but could tell it wasn&apos;t too far away -- either it wasn&apos;t that far, or it was probably very bright, which made it easier to see. We live right next to Montgomery County line, so actually, the object was over Montgomery County, approx. over The Woodlands area, when we first saw it. As we were watching this thing, something else much closer, and lower, suddenly came from the east to the west flying about the cruising speed of a helicopter, was all white (or possibly light green), and was only about 1000 ft. up, and didn&apos;t have lights of helicopter blinking, but rather just the whole thing was blinking on and off... this second craft we watched for only 10 seconds, and it just simply dissapeared...din&apos;t go behind anything obscuring our view -- we actually saw it just vanish...

It was a whitish light just like a star and was pretty far away. I would imagine that when I started watching it, it was over the ocean off the Marin coast.

Rather than going straight into the house when I got home, I decided to get on my bike and amble somewhere. I started traveling down the alley at a slow pace - going nowhere in particular - and I saw the glow from the lights of the college football field, and decided to head over there and check the score of the game. I gazed upward and noticed that the night was filled with stars; it was absolutely clear and pristine. What a knock-your-socks-off beautiful night! I looked forward again, down the pitch black alley, and I suddenly saw a strange, dull-orange craft streak across the sky, over the football field, heading southbound, parallel to Snelling Avenue. It appeared like 2 bat-wings cut out of an orange paper plate, with 3 sides in total (front, back of left wing, back of right wing), and all sides smooth and rounded, except the tips which had normal points. Its altitude was perhaps 300 feet. Viewing time was perhaps 2 seconds. I could easily tell: It wasn&apos;t from &quot;around here&quot;. I slammed on the brakes of my bike, and just stood there in the dark stillness of the night, realizing that I had just seen my second UFO, and that I couldn&apos;t prove it to a single soul... There had been no other witnesses that I know of. The stars kept shining, and the crowd watching the game would occasionally cheer, and the traffic kept moving up and down Snelling as the people went about their business, scurrying to and fro... Years later, around 1978 or so, I was watching a documentary movie on TV called &quot;Flying Saucers Are Real&quot; or something like that, when I saw an account of a UFO encounter by an Army helicopter. This happened in Ohio, when a Lt. Col. Coyne and his crew were effortlessly pulled up several thousand feet by a large ship. An artist had made colored drawings, based on Coyne&apos;s testimony (he went public with it). It was an enormous, gray, metallic hulk of hi-tech engineering, and it had a dark red design on the nose which I recognized. The design was a kind of 4-pronged &quot;splat&quot;, or jelly-fish, or thick cross-hairs, which if viewed from the side, appeared to be a kind of bat wing, or unusual flying wing (not like the Northrup flying wings). I suddenly realized that what I&apos;d seen back in October of 1958 was POSSIBLY the nose art of a much larger craft. What appeared to me like a large, orange craft, had possibly just been the tip of the iceberg of a MUCH larger, huge, gray, silent piece of engineered metal... Either way, it was big, fast and silent.", "On the night of June 17th me and a few of my family members decided to take a walk to this park.to go to this park you had to walk through this pitch black feild.All of a sudden something hit are minds and it made us sit down.In a matter of 10 seconds we saw these 3 teardrop shapes started to move around us as fast as light.In a matter of 30 seconds the lights moved away and went off in the distance.After the lights left ar e minds came back together and we ran home as fast as we could and called 911.We found out that this happend to everyone.The authorities said they would look into this incident for us.On the night of June 17th me and a few of my family members decided to take a walk to this park.to go to this park you had to walk through this pitch black feild.All of a sudden something hit are minds and it made us sit down.In a matter of 10 seconds we saw these 3 teardrop shapes started to move around us as fast as light.In a matter of 30 seconds the lights moved away and went off in the distance.After the lights left ar e minds came back together and we ran home as fast as we could and called 911.We found out that this happend to everyone.The authorities said they would look into this incident for us.", "((NUFORC Note:  If UFO&apos;s, or their occupants, are capable of communicating via mental telepathy, we do not understand why they would resort to the relatively primitive means of Morse Code.))During a period of several nights, points of light moved over and under the ocean water in various formations, which were later revealed to be lights attached to solid black elliptical flying objects.One night, I traveled with two other friends to Jax Beach to see what we would see.&nbsp; As we stood on the beach, we noticed what appeared to be airport runway lights extending from the shoreline approximately 1 mile north of us to the east horizon.&nbsp; My friends and I wondered how and why runway lights would be positioned over water to the horizon, as it really seemed nonsense.&nbsp; Our attention was then drawn to the lights of what appeared to be an oil tanker moving south across the ocean many miles out to sea.&nbsp; As the lights moved in unison along the horizon, suddenly these lights, which seemed to form the outline of a ship separated into two equal numbers and moved away from each other. With that occurrence my friends and I felt very uneasy and decided to depart.&nbsp; I returned on other occasions to witness other equally unexplainable lights, which moved in and out of the water.&nbsp; Following those sightings, I began to send Morris Code messages from the shoreline using my car headlights.&nbsp; Messages such as: God is Love.&nbsp; I sent the simple messages over the water for several nights; when a response was sent in Morris Code by way of a red light, which moved between two white lights moving in unison near the horizon.&nbsp; The response message was:&nbsp; God is.&nbsp; Within several nights of that response,&nbsp; I was given the opportunity to see the UFO aircraft that generated the &quot;lights&quot; on two occasions.&nbsp; One following night, I parked my car on a beach access ramp facing the ocean and using my headlights, I sent my God is love message out over the water.&nbsp; Shortly, thereafter, four lights arranged in a blue-green-blue-green pattern appeared on the horizon. I stepped out of the car to get a better look and the lights began to move very quickly toward the beach where I was standing.  The lights reached the waters edge at the beach and stopped.&nbsp; The UFOs traveled from the horizon to the shore in less than 30 seconds!  At that point I observed that the aircraft were about the size of 737&apos;s and their shapes were elliptical and solid bl! ack with a one blue and one green light positioned on the outer edge.&nbsp; Their appearance was difficult to see except when heat lightening flashed in the sky behind them.&nbsp; The UFOs did not remain for long but this time more slowly returned to their position on the horizon.&nbsp; The second sighting occurred several nights later and further north of Jax Beach in an area of the beach where houses or apartments were not constructed at the time.&nbsp; Again, I used my headlights to send the Morris Code message &quot;God Is&quot; over the water.&nbsp; Again lights appeared on the horizon and moved more slowly over the water until they were about 150 feet from the shore.&nbsp; That time I counted six UFOs that appeared as before.&nbsp; I walked down to the shore and waited for something to happen; however, I do not remember anything else occurring, except that they seemed to loose interest in me and slowly drifted out of sight over the horizon.&nbsp;", "Looking to the NNE towards Prescott Az, saw two amber lights. Twice as large as previous sightings beneath the big Dipper at it&apos;s 9 position in the sky.  The two amber lights were the same distance apart as the two top stars of the Big Dipper. Highest light on right hand side..looking NNE.  Second light was down at 45 degree angle on Left hand side.I was pluging in a light on an outbuilding when I looked in the Prescott Az direction NNE from my position and saw two amber lights. Each light was twice the size of the largest star in the Big Dipper.  Duration of time was 10 seconds approx.", "Two, bright Green Lights, orbs or UFO&apos;s, traveling at a High rate of speed with one orange companion object dancing around the lead objectI would definately like to state that what you are about to read is true as stated. This is the first time I have ever seen such a sighting. I had gone outside to observe the stars for a while before going to bed, I was standing facing south and looking at the Orion Nebula, when something caught my eye coming over our house. Looking almost directly straight up and just slightly south, I observed a bright green light, the green was the same color as the green of a traffic light and about the same brightness. The size was about the same size as Venus looks in the night sky. The green object was traveling at a very high rate of speed. What looked like about four times the speed of aircraft passing over the same area. This object took about 12 seconds to go from almost straight up and about 10 degrees south to completely out of sight over some trees down the street looking north. When I first saw the green light I noticed that there was another object just like the first one also green in color, same brightness and also traveling the same direction and speed. This object was just to the right of the first object, and slightly behind it. I remember thinking, &quot;is this a low-flying aircraft?&quot; &quot;It sure is moving fast for an aircraft&quot;. Then I grabbed my binoculars to try to get a better look at the objects, When I viewed the leading object through the binoculars, I noticed that I could see the clouds behind the object and that there was no body or wings visible. The clouds were illuminated by the city lights, which made it a rather brightly lit evening, especially for 9:35PM. I could clearly see the clouds contrasted against the object as it moved under them. The clouds were patchy and scattered, and spread out evenly across the sky except for further north, where they were denser. You could also see many stars between the clouds. These objects did not look anything like stars, since they were moving at a high rate of speed. I also noticed that there was no solid object attached to these lights; they seemed to be traveling by them selves. There was one aspect to this sighting that I thought was a bit strange, the objects seemed to be gaining speed rapidly, just prior to dropping down and disappearing behind the trees, which were about a quarter of a mile away. Early in my observation, when I first spotted the leading object looking through my binoculars, I noticed an orange much smaller light or object that seemed to be dancing very rapidly back and forth going past the green object in either direction, not a tight zigzag but a much more exaggerated movement, and quite rapid, more so than what would be expected for eye movement or movement of the binoculars. I could see the green object at the same time as the orange one and could tell that it was moving past the green one in a rapid movement. I was also able to pan the green object fairly easily allowing me to view the orange object as it danced around or back and forth by the green object. The orange object otherwise kept pace with the leading green object as it traversed the sky. There were no sparks, or tails visible and there were no flashing or strobe lights visible at any time on any of these objects. This whole episode caught me totally by surprise, as I had gone out to do some star gazing, not UFO gazing. I had not planned on looking for anything strange tonight. This has left me totally spooked and quite excited, definitely High Strangeness. This is the first time I have ever seen anything quite like this; it truly made my night. What I have described above was not the planet Venus or Jupiter, or a star. I was able to see both planets during this sighting. It also was not an aircraft, balloon or a helicopter as there was no sound at all, emanating from this object., and it moved much too fast and smoothly.

It was still visable for about twenty seconds then again shot off to the north and disappeared.  It was more than likely outside the atmosphere and looked no different than the North Star.  I witnessed this object zig-zag and manuevor.  Something was controlling this object.  No sattilite can manuevor at that rate of speed.  This object would move quicker than my own eyes.  I watch the skies periodically and never have I seen something in this nature.  I live by Dulles Airport so I know what should and shouldn&apos;t be flying around my house.It was about 10:00pm on Wycombe St. in Centreville Va.  My french friend and I were observing the traffic of airplanes above when something caught both our attention at the same time.  An object very far away moving at first very slowly.  This object had the appearance no different from what a star would look like.  At first I thought it was just a sattilite until the object moved very quickly to the left and to the right and then to the left again.  Then the object remained stationary for about two or three seconds.  My friend and I woke up the neighborhood with obsenities.  About that time the object zipped to a more northern area in the sky very very fast.  Right after that it shot off out of our site within the blink of an eye.  I will never forget that experience.", "An UFO landed inside a fireworks factory, and he took off. 3 minutes later a huge fire caused the factory to explode, destroying a neighbourhood.This accident has caused a lot of questions in holland, everybody likes to know what caused such a terrible accident, I believe thatb the phenomenon I saw caused a chainreaction, following the destruction of the factory.

PD))((COMMENT FROM A READER IN THE NETHERLANDS))As I was browsing your archives with UFO reports, I found a report wich said that a diamond shaped UFO landed in a Fireworks factory in the Netherlands and the factory exploded. There are a few reasons that make me believe the report is a prank. First of all, the neighborhoud in wich the factory was located in a dense urban area. If a UFO or any other flying craft would have landed in this area, someone else should have noticed too. Secondly, there was a full-scale investigation to determine what the cause of the accident and the results concluded that the containers containing the pyrotechnics, weren&apos;t safe and the person who lit the fire has confessed to the fact that he had lit the fire. I am a resident of the town of Krommenie, wich is locared about an hour driving from Enschede. I read the full accident report, and I visited the site.  I think its a shame that an organisation such as NUFORC is fooled by a prank report and this could have been prevented if your screeners just did a little more background checking of the accident.

A formation of about 10 crafts. formations within formations diferent colors in each formation.I had just gone out to play with my friends when I noticed some lights in the sky. I told my friends to look and we saw 10 lights. The first 4 were in a diamond formation and gold in color with the lead object traveling North eastward. The next 4 were in a square formation and were redish in color.  The last 2 were bluish and were in a straight line traveling the same direction as the rest North eastward. For a couple of seconds they all stopped moving, then after a second or two more each group split off in a different direction and were gone.  The whole event lasted only for a about a minute, but I looked down at my watch and nearly 20 minutes had passed. After I asked the rest what time they had we relised that all of us had lost about 20 minutes. I&apos;m 30 now, 20 years later, and I can still see it in my mind like it was that warm sumer night.

Moving in formation of a triangle with remaining crafts in a vertical semicicle to the rightIt was around 9:30 pm on 2-16-2000. Earlier in the day another person and I were joking about seeing UFOs all day there were white lights that moved stranged but we concluded they were helicopters. Well as I walked out of a building on E.State Street near Rockford College. I saw the real thing. When I saw the lights I knew they were something different. They looked like the lights I had seen on TV from an earlier sighting in Arizona in May of 1997. I froze. Another person was walking out with me and I said &quot;look at that, what is that?&quot; We told two other people who were talking by their car to look at the sky.  The objects appeared as bright orange fireballs hoovering just above the east southeastern horizon in an upside down shaped L. They were in the process of moving into a triangle formation.They crafts moved horizontaly into this traingle formation with a craft above it. The reamaining objects fromed a loosely curved line to the lower right of the fromation ( see figure at bottom).I was so scared I got in my car. Then I got out to take other look. They were in the triangle formation by now. I looked long enough to see if the fireballs were crafts. I noticed that they were traingle shaped crafts with a brighter light on each point of the triangle and in the center. I got in my car and went home.

Last summer,  I observed a similar phenomena in full daylight. I was cycling with a friend and we had stopped to  rest in a local park area. The sky was generally clear - with the exception of a small hazy patch of cloud that  had somehow developed in one quarter. From where we stood we had an excellent view of the horizon - or as good as it gets on the outskirts of a big city. Eventually, my friend spied an unusual craft moving very slowly across the sky. It was light coloured (silvery white - very difficult to read in the mid afternoon sunlight) and somewhat angular appearing. At first I thought it was perhaps an ultralight of some variety - except it made no sound and moved too slowly - ie. should not have been airborne at that rate of speed.  Both of us were moved to &quot;high alert&quot; as we observed it very carefully for some minutes as it approached the cloudy area - which seemed to thicken. I began to suspect at this point that this anomalous cloud might have something to do with what we were seeing and I didn&apos;t so much as blink an eye as I watched the craft slowly merge with its outer edges. As the craft was just about to disappear behind the haze,  a bolt of light, like a lens flare or flashbulb discharge, erupted from its exact location. From my point of view, the object disappeared instantaneously and in a matter of moments thereafter, the  &quot;cloud&quot; dissolved completely. Although I scanned the skies for this object and traced its logical trajectory, after the flare, it was nowhere to be found. I stood there quite devastated, wondering what it was I had seen - even as the skies to the north and south of us were strewn with a checkerboard of contrails. A look at one of the planes that laid a large trail almost directly over our heads reveled that it was not a commercial plane - but a very large military craft - a two engine job resembling  a high altitude bomber of some description.  The sudden appearance of planes laying out contrails seemed deliberate. Were they mapping a location? Interestingly, my friend did not view the situation exactly as I did. Whether for fear of being implicated in a sighting or not, he insisted that he had seen the craft emerge from the other side of the cloud  and made repeated attempts to point it out to me. I have excellent eyesight and although I stood trying to get a focus on whatever it was he was attempting to call my attention towards, I saw nothing. It was both a puzzling and highly emotional experience and we actually got into an argument over the whole deal. I stand by my story - he by his. What he does conceede is that the event was &quot;suspicious&quot;. I would go much further than that. It does not take a genius to understand that this could be one of two things: a) ariel military test manouvres of  a new generation of air ship - the possible application of Bohm&apos;s non-locality and post quantum physics in faster than light transportation b) an incursion into North American airspace by some unknown entity One thing that", "It looked like a star at first...I am a Youth Counselor at the Youth Shelter here in town.  I was leaving for work and it was a clear night for a change.  I always look up to the night sky.  I saw a plane off to my right.  Before I continue I would just like to state for the record that I&apos;ve never had any mental problems nor do I have any now. As I was saying, I was walking to my car.  I live in an apartment complex and each building has four two bedroom apartments in it.  I live alone.  I was the only person outside at the time.  I looked up and I saw this &quot;star&quot;.  I kept thinking that it sure was pretty.  An off orange or red color.  Well it looked kind of strange, like it was moving which did not make sense.  I told myself I was just seeing things and continued walking.  Once more I thought I saw it move. So I stopped to make sure I wasn&apos;t seeing things.  Sure enough it was moving, straight towards my area.  I won&apos;t lie.  I got real scared. I wanted to run to my car, which is a Neon Sport-Black.  I knew it was not a plane because just off to the right was a plane and this light was too bright to be a plane.  But I did not run to the car.  I did however walk very fast because it was getting closer and since I was the only one outside I panicked.  My hands were shaking really bad as I tried to unlock my vehicle while I kept my eyes on the thing.  Finally I got the door open and I threw my purse and notebook inside then jumped in.  It took me a moment because I was really shaken up to get the doors all locked and my car started.  I then sat there while my vehicle was warming up and continued to watch the thing.  It changed course going left once I got inside the vehicle.  The light did not change at all in intensity as it went on the new course which further convinced me that this was not the &quot;headlights&quot; of a plane or helicopter.  It was going at average speed.  I looked away while I put in a CD to calm me down and when I looked back it was gone. I went to work and told my co-worker.  She said that I looked like I had seen a ghost.  And to be honest the experience still shakes me up because in all my life of watching the stars at night I&apos;ve never seen a thing like this.  And I grew up in Texas where the stars are very bright and un-polluted by light from the city. I&apos;m a 23 year old woman, single, no children with a good job and a nice place to live.  I hope you can make sense out of this because I can&apos;t.

It was still pretty dark since the sun was just starting to rise. I saw something reflecting the sunlight to the southwest, and at first I thought it was an airplane since it was in the sky and the sun hadn&apos;t risen high enough to touch the tops of buildings or treetops. The window in which I looked from was open and it was very quiet out side, and I didn&apos;t hear a sound coming from it. As I looked I realised it could&apos;nt be a plane because it was too small; or a hellicopter because it made no noise. It was like a big silver egg the size of a small house, and it was wobbling back and forth and up and down slowly above some houses about one quarter of the way around the lake to the left of my view. it then calmed down and slowly started to desend. It seemed to drop in front of the houses but behind the trees before going out of sight. Then, there were more flying to the same area above the trees. First one, then another, then two at once. All were moveing in the same odd way, then slowly dropping down behind the trees and out of sight one at a time. I tried to wake up my friend who was in the bedroom and I brought him out to look, but he was mad that I woke him up and wouldn&apos;t listen. He just went back to bed. I didn&apos;t want to miss this experience though, so I went back to the window to see. In all, I probably saw 5-6 craft that night. I don&apos;t tell many people about what happend, since I recieved alot of flack about it in the past, although I wish I had written down the date and time. That was the last thing on my mind. If there is anyone else in that area of Minneapolis who has seen these craft, plese contact me. I am a sky-watcher now.", "A huge, silver, saucer-shaped object appeared in the sky.  It suddenly zipped right over our backyard where it stopped &amp; hovered about tree-top height.  There was absolutely no sound or engine noise.

A few moments later, it zipped away at unbelievable speed and hovered again a short distance away.  At last, it zipped completely away.

I immediately returned to the house and called the Warren County Sheriff&apos;s office and reported what I&apos;d seen.  The dispatcher laughed at me.  The next day, I called Kings Island to ask if they had any advertising objects in the sky the night before, making every attempt to find an explanation for what I&apos;d seen.  The telephone operator was very quiet for a moment, and then replied, &quot;Oh, my God -- you saw it too?&quot;  She then said the Kings Island had not participated in any type of advertising, and that she had witnessed the same object from a different location the night before.

Large, silent, triangle shaped vehicle hovered about 100-200 ft over the house for about 3-4 minutes.My neighbor&apos;s three children came running and pointing to the sky.  I looked up and saw lights in a a triangle shape not more than 200 feet overhead.  It moved VERY slowly and made NO noise.  My boyfriend was also with me at the time.  He is an amateur pilot but could not explain what the object was.  My first thought was that it was small planes flying in formation, but there was no deviation between lights and no movement...it seemed to be one huge object...about the size of 3 football fields.  Later, they said it was ultra-lights, (from Stormville) but nobody who saw this and other similar sightings agreed.  There were several sightings over the course of the year in  the Hudson River Valley.", "My family and I saw 4 bright steaks of light in the same exact area of the sky all which traveled in opposite directions..Last night my Father (a retired Lockheed employee and WW2 Army/Airforce Vet)was setting in a lawn chair in my backyard when he said to me,&quot;Do you have Fireflys around here?&quot; I told him &quot;no&quot; And saw he was looking into the southern part of the sky. I then walked over to him and looked into the sky and asked him what he saw. He said he saw a streak of light in the sky that looked like a Firefly. I then looked in the direction he was looking and suddenly I saw a quick, Bright streak of light that was very thin moving from West to East. I said that looks like a meteor. about 30 seconds later, another streak of light was in the exact area but this time it went from east to west. I was then kind of freaked out to see the same thing, in the exact area but going the opposite direction. At that time my Mother, my Brother and his Girlfriend walked over to see what we were looking at when the same streak of light appeared again, This time going from North to south in the same exact area. We were all wondering what we were seeing. I attempted to explain it as a meteor shower but we all agreed it would not be in the exact same area in the sky. About 1 minute passed when we then saw a bright strobe type flash in the sky Just south and lower in the horizon from where we saw the steaks of light. about 5 seconds later, another flash of light appeared futher south and even lower in the horizon. We continued to look into the sky for several more minutes when we once again saw the bright flash of light, This time is was towards the east of the other light flashes. It was now we all realized that this was no meteor shower so I ran in to get the Video Camera. Unfotunately we never saw the objects again. I can only describe the steaks of light as &quot;Pencil thin&quot;,White Streaks with no contrails. They only went a distance of your hand streached out in the sky. All 4 steaks of light (3 which I saw)were within an area of the sky where as if you were to hold out both hands and make a circle with your thumbs and pinky fingers. The l! ight str eaks appeared to be &quot;way up&quot; in the atmosphere and traveled at least 5 times faster than any meteor or falling star that I have ever seen. The 3 bright flashes we saw resembled an Aircraft Stobe light but about 3 times brighter. At about 2030hrs I telephoned the nearest Air Force Base (Edwards AFB)which is about 70 miles away. I spoke to a person at their command post who said he had no idea what I saw and that no information about any flight testing or Military operations could be given out. He then gave me the phone number to the UFO reporting center. I then called the reporting center and spoke with Mr. Davenport and told him about the incident. He said that what I saw was very unusual and was not from &quot;This earth&quot;. What my family and I saw last night was definately the most unusual thing we have ever saw. We believe the &quot;Sightings&quot; were of alien nature but we are not really sure. My wife was in the house during the time of the incident and now she thinks im crazy.

His description of the event was very precise, and he had made a note of the exact time of the event.

Triangle had another object in the middle.In the middle of the day I noticed an object which at 1st glance could&apos;ve been mistaken for a balloon in the sky. The difference being the object NEVER moved. It remained motionless while birds and planes went past it at a much lower altitude. After about 20 minutes the object still remained. I didn&apos;t mention anything to my friends because I knew they would think I was joking. After asking one of the other guys in my golf foursome to look he and I both observed the object spliting into 3 additional globes. They were white like the original one. They were smaller in size by comparison. I freaked. But what startled me the most is when they then formed a triangle. Tingles shot up my spine and my friend and I started to call the to others to look. It was witnessed by 5 more people including the next group of golfers behind us. The objects zoomed away and I continued to see the original shpere. It too eventually disappeared or I lost it in the bright sun.

About 10 minutes before the actual siting I was driving along &amp; I approached an overpass, which I thought was strange being out in the middle of a wildlife conservation area but I passed under it, I saw the sides of the bridge, the sound of going under a bridge was there as well as the shadow that bridges cause, all these things were there, but after I passed under it I looked in my rearview window &amp; there was no bridge at all, there was nothing there. I slowed my car &amp; looked behind me to get a better look, but strangely enough, the bridge wasn&apos;t there, but I SWEAR it was there!  Well, I continued driving yet now more alert, out of the edge of the trees (Beach trees mind you, these were not as tall as normal trees) I saw a strange formation with bluish white lights just above the trees. I past it &amp; slammed on my brakes &amp; got out of my car to see what it was. I had to get out in the middle of the street to see it over the trees &amp; there it was, nothing was holding it up, it just hovered there. It was just over the trees, it was very big &amp; low to the ground, if I had been on the highest tree I think (assuming) that I would be able to touch it. The craft was a diamond shape, I drew it when I returned home. There was a big bluish light on the bottom of the craft that covered most of the underneath &amp; along the sides/edges of thecraft were the same bluish white lights yet smaller. The light was very bright but it didn&apos;t hurt my eyes to look at it, it just illuminated the craft. I just stood there looking at it &amp; b/t the lights was this scaffolding of metal, but the brightest most beautifully colored chrome silver I&apos;d ever seen. It was really beautiful. There was no sound emitting from it, the night was silent. I just stood there watching it, hypnotized it seemed by it &amp; then all of a sudden I was overcome with a fear/ terror that I had never before experienced in my entire life. I ran to my car, my heart was racing &amp; I sped away. I kept feeling as if I should turn around &amp; go back but that strange fear kept me from doing so.   About 5 miles down from that a van came racing up behind me, VERY fast &amp; passed me continuing to speed away- my hunch is that they saw the same thing I did &amp; got the heck away from there! *I do not take drugs of any kind &amp; I was completely sober during this whole experience.

After leaving our garbage route for morning break,I noticed a bright lightin the sky to the east. First thought that it was a jet on approach to Pierson International A.P. Closer observation as we sat at the stop lights left us with no earthly explanation as to the object.On the morning of January 14 2000,my partner and I witnessed a sighting over Toronto. At roughly 9:20 A.M. ,My partner and I decided to go for break . Northbound on Bayview Av.,we turned east on York Mills. Just after passing over the crest of the hill nearing Versaille cr.,I decided to have a little fun at my partner&apos;s expense.

Second though was it could have been a planet ,but no ,any visible planet would have been behind and to my right and not visible this late in the morning due to light pollution from the sun. Third thought was the most likely ...helicopter...but no rotor was seen . Lastly and possibly a Harrier jet on manuevers,...the afternoon before, I saw a military chopper hover over roughly  the same area.

Three puffs each larger than the other took a shape simmilar to that of a torche flame when ajusted to form the cone in a cone.

Air traffic control did not answer return calls and nothing in local papers after incident. I am recalling the incident from memory but do have documentation on file. I am ex-Navy with all sea duty so in my opinion, the sighting I have described here appears authentic since I have no other reson to believe otherwise. Good hunting!", "I saw what seemed to be 5 separate lights in the eastern sky. One bright light and 4 smaller and less bright lights. The lights were in a &quot;V&quot; shape equadistant from each other with the bright light at the point of the &quot;V&quot;. The lights were moving together at the same speed. As I watched the lights moved north at a slow rate of speed and the &quot;V&quot; seemed to stand on one &quot;wing&quot; as the lights turned east from the former northern heading. As I watched all lights moved together and kept the same relative spacing. The lights were fairly low in the sky and if connected would have outlined a fairly large craft. I would estimate several hundred feet per side.5 lights in a &quot;V&quot; formation (appx 90degrees), one bright light at the point of the &quot;V&quot; and 2 smaller less bright lights on either side. The lights were low on the horizon and were moving slowly in a northerly direction, then turned and began to move in an easterly direction. In executing the turn it was as if the lights were connected as the lights seemed to execute a steep bank to the right with the &quot;V&quot; seeming to stand on one leg as an airplane would to make a sharp turn. The lights did not change speed as they turned. The lights were white and round. The distance to the lights I would estimate at a maximum of one mile The size of the &quot;V&quot; I would estimate to be several hundred feet per leg. I could not see any connection between the lights. There was no sound associated with the sighting", "In the parking lot of Excalibur, We saw a pyramid of six lights flying above the hotel.Let me start by saying all three of us were completely sober and of sound mind on the night of 4/22/00. Our friend was parked in the Excalibur Parking lot across from the Luxor. We were standing and talking when I noticed a pyramid like shape of six lights above the hotel. I first believed it to be some sort of Jet, But there was no sound and also no FDA regulated strobbing lights. Then the lights changed its configuration from a large pyramid of six lights into two small pyramids of three lights each. I gasped and called attention to the lights. All of us looking then watched it go back into a large pyramid. It changed again into a almost figure 8 symbol, then back into a large pyramid before disappearing quickly into the horizon.(Towards the directiion of the Tropicana) Like I said there was no strobbing lights, and they seemed to be small individual lights. The configurations happened so quickly I didn&apos;t see them move. It was as if It went from one to the other faster than the eye. The lights were a yellowish-gold to green color and they were dim. Not bright. Im curious to know if anyone else saw anything on this night. If so please contact me.", "I went out to get the mail.  When I looked up I saw a very bright light in the sky.  My first thought was that it was a really bright star.  The I realized it was moving and it couldn&apos;t be a star.  The light got mor intense and then it dimed to a faint light and disappeared upward.  I heard now sound even though the object was almost overhead.((NUFORC Note:  The report is reminiscent of the flash caused by an Iridium satellite.  One of our contributors may investigate whether this may have been an Iridium.))", "Just to clear up the witnesses thing... I was taking pictures across a bay at night, i did&apos;nt see anything before or after the picture was taken when i reviewed the pitures later i noticed.I was taking photo&apos;s across the bay and i did&apos;nt notice anything strange at all I was using my Digital camera so i was reviewing the picture on the camera&apos;s VDU when i noticed just one of the pictures had a circle in it, so i took a closer look across the bay and saw nothing, then dismissed it for the time. When i got home i had a closer look on my PC and was puzzled. I thought it may have been a smudge but it was the only picture with anything + it was a close to perfect circle + the bottom decends below the cliff on the opposite headland. As usual the weather in Sinai was dry, warm and without strong wind. I will send an encompanying Email with the subject Egypt. I am very interested in the answer to this puzzle so even if u take it as a false alarm i would like a reason for this picture, and i am open to any Questions.", "I saw something flying over the tree tops.  The wings were all lite up and it was shining on the tree tops.  Over the wing there was a red light.  It was disoriented...it would move from left to right and up and down but maintained its forward direction.  It was going very slow and came within 150 ft.  It made a right turn and the wing lights went out, but the red light shot forward and either went out or went down.I was looking up at the moon and the stars. I saw this flying object flying over the tree tops.  It was acting as though it was having problems staying in the air.  The shape of the object was about the size of an automobile with 2 wings front and black all lite up and flickering.  The lights were shining on the tree tops.  Somewhere between the wings there was a red light.  It kept a forward motion at about 5 mph, it moved to the right and left and up and down in the blink of a eye.  It crossed the road, turned right and the lite wings went out. The red light shot forward and down very quickly.  At this point, I think the light went out.  There was no sound.", "Craft approached as a star in the night sky - zig zaged extemely fast side to side.  Hovered over ocean,motionless suspended for approx.1 min. Low humming - like a transformer then propulsion sound like a jet - moved slowly north towards Wrightsville Beach - I was close and saw details - definetly not of this world; reported to Air Natl Guard - they laughed at me. (I would have laughed too, but I&apos;m not laughing now)My business had been hurt by hurricane Fran so I was forced to take a second job at night watching condos on the beach.  The island was basically deserted and I would spend all night just sitting watching the stars and listening to the radio.  I was listening to the Peach Bowl and looked up and noticed a star that looked weird - different.  All of the sudden it began to move violently from side to side and the next thing I know it was about 1/4 mile from the shoreline and about 300 feet in the air.  It looked like a boomerang but it also had hight - somewhat like a cone but not symetrical both ways.  I got out of the truck and went down to the water ( I honestly thought that I had to be hallucinating ).  It hovered there and there was an electical sound; like when you turn on the toy train but not enough to make the train move.  I swear this thing didn&apos;t move in any direction for about 1 minute.  Then there was a sound like a jet - but not a roar like a jet - more like when the blower goes on from the heater in the house.  It moved slowly northward maintaining its distance from the coast.  It wasn&apos;t in a hurry and obviously didn&apos;t seem to mind if anyone saw it.  The island was mostly evacuated due to the hurricanes aftermath.  All I can think of is that it was surveying hurricane damage??  There is an Air Natl Guard base directly accross the street from where this happened.  I was so shook up by this that I drove there the next day and reported the incident to the commanding officer.  He told me he believed me, but I think he was just humoring me.  Anyway - I saw what I saw and I will never doubt again other accounts of sightings.  What I saw is absolutely not possible with our technology - either we have some unbelievable technology that we don&apos;t know about or I saw something from another world.  By the way .... it was concave on the back.", "Low flying, Silent, triangular with four lights, One steady light on each rounded corner and one swirling light in the center.I was laying out on the hood of my friends truck looking up at the night sky like I usually do when out of the corner of my eye I saw what I thought was a low flying plane from the base. As it got closer I realized that it was not a plane. I didn&apos;t know what it was but I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off of it. It flew about two to three hundred yards off the ground and it didn&apos;t make any noise at all. It was kind of a triangle shape with rounded corners and on each corner it had a yellowish white light. In the center there was a slightly bigger light that seemed to swirl, the reason I say it swirled is because it had a curved line that went from the center point out to the rim and it kept going around the rim. I stood up on my friends hood and watched it as it flew west over the lake and behind Antelope Island. I only told a few people what I saw because I wasn&apos;t sure who would believe me but one of the people I did tell was my wife who I met and married 1998. In about Late May to early June of 1999 her and I were in my grandmas back yard laying down and talking about the stars and which one was ours when out of nowhere the same exact odbject appeared above us flying in a southward direction. It made no sound and flew about the same height. It scared the heck out of my wife cause she used to be in the Air Force and had never seen anything like it. Niether one of us is sure what it was or where it came from but we do know that it was something extraordinary. To this day we still sit out at night hoping that we will get to see it again.", "very bright light moved across the night skylooked up into the sky 2 stars seamed very close together then one started to move i called my daughter to come outside she and i watched the light moved very quickly toward the south in a very high speed then vanished", "At first I thought it was a satelite in a North-South orbit.  It grew brighter and seemed to change course slightly.One clear Sunday evening I was in our backyard looking at the stars.  I noticed a light moving through the sky just above constellation Orion.  I thought it was a satelite in orbit moving North and slightly West.  While I watched it suddenly grew brighter and it&apos;s trajectory seemed to swing slightly more to the West.  I lost sight of it when it went behind some trees.  I moved about 200 feet North to the other side of the copse of trees but could not find it again.", "at first sight, a very bright light aimed horizontially in our direction as we travel south on HWY 16 south of Graham, TX. The light then rose and approached our vehicle as we traveled at 65mph. We saw a rounded shape with intense white light and alternate bands of bright red light. The red lights pulsated. It stayed over our vehicle for approx 30 seconds matching our speed and then moved off to the Southwest.We had just filled our vehicle with gasoline and headed south back to our cabin we were staying in that night.  The weather was light rain with a brisk north wind (approximately 15mph)As we left Graham on HWY 16 we followed another vehicle which turned to the right on Hwy 1287 South. We stayed on State 16. Suddenly an extremely bright light was shinning on our car off to our left. The light was behind some trees but was blinding me; suddenly, it rose in the air and headed straight for our car as we traveled (at approximately 90degrees).  As all of this was occurring, we were talking about something else and were only partially aware of the event. As it got closer we ( approximately 300 yards ) focused upon it with both of us saying &quot;what is that?&quot;.  Out the driver&apos;s window, I could see that there was a cockpit or something under this huge black shape.  I was screaming &quot;what the Hell is that?&quot; The cockpit was shinning this incredibly bright light with some bands of red lights.  The red lights were pulsating. The object kept approaching us until it was directly over the car. It then matched our speed (still 65mph)and my friend looked up and sort of gasped. She said that the lights are alternating. All of this time we were both asking &quot;what is this?&quot;.  As it traveled Southwest off to some low hills it disappeared.  Neither one of us said anything for a while.  Then she asked what I saw and I asked her what she saw.  We both saw the same.  When we got back to the cabin, which was about 30 minutes later we took some sheets of paper and sat across the room from each other and drew what we saw.  The drawings matched! We then called the Sheriff&apos;s office in Graham and asked about aircraft or helicopters. He called the local small airport and they had nothing up. On Monday I called Carswell AFB and they had nothing out that way at that time.  I called the DFW control center and they reported no aircraft flying that low on Saturday near Graham. ( Graham is 96 miles from the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. Neither of us can forget what we saw and are anxious for someone to solve this mystery.  If you have any answers, we would definitely love to hear from you.  Apart from nearly blinding us with that bright light and scaring us no harm was done.", "A large light the color of a freeway light (orange huge).  observe with feild glasses. No noise as it continued South and  blinked out.", "Our car was stopped in traffic, TN, so-bound I-75, approx 00:30.

Traffic came to a halt. We assumed that it was due to an accident or possibly a construction bottle-neck. While waiting for traffic to move, we saw a tour-bus size triangle (or possibly cone-shaped...it was difficult to determine if it was a cone in profile or a flat triangle) object pass over the x-way, heading in a north west trajectory. The object was completely covered by several royal-blue lights, aligned in rows and all touching one another in a 4-3-2-1 formation, arranged with the row of four at the &quot;head&quot; (or flat side) of the triangle and the single light at the point. The lights came on and went off in sync, lighting the night sky around the object each time they came on. The effect was like a moving, triangle-shaped cluster of large connected strobe lights, as the object appeared and dissappeared rapidly along its trajectory. Several people in the other stopped vehicles rolled down their windows or opened their car doors to better see the object. We were very frightened.

I saw a strobing light (It strobed only twice) then it went out. Then a very bright light came on then faded out, there was a distance between the strobing light and the bright light. No other lights were present. Then it was gone. (No blue or red lights like on a airplane).  I went inside my house and told my wife and our friend, I saw something really strange, and they followed me outside immediately, we were looking to the west.  I was telling them what I had just saw. Then I said look at that, and pointed my finger up and we saw a V shaped craft (7 lights in a V shape) it headed west to east. It seemed to be just one object.  All the lights were the same brightness and size. We watched the object for about 7 to 10 seconds as it traveled to the east very quickly and silently and then if just disappeared. There was no sound at all.  My wife and our friend stayed outside looking for the object as I went inside and looked at the time (It was 10:32 pm) and I called Peter Davenport immediately.  We all stayed outside for some time after the sighting and observed several aircraft in the area. This object was definitely not an airplane or like anything any of us had ever seen before.

I ran into the house and woke up my 13 year old son to make sure that he witnessed it. It was completely stationary, yet the lights were glistening at a terrific pace. It made no noise. I went inside to get my cell phone to call the police, and when I came back outside, it was gone.

I had put them down and was looking up at the Big Dipper and just then I notice a faint object moving just below Dubhe(alpha Ursa Majoris). This is not a jet or an airplane, it is much higher, no blinking lights, like a satellite would look crossing the sky, and I am a fairly seasoned sky watcher and I know what satellites look like and this appears to be one. And I see that it is moving from NW to SE across the face of the Big Dipeer and so I pick up the binoculars and find it and all of a sudden I see 3 of them in my binocular(10 x 50) field! At this time they are almost straight overhead. The original one was the brightest and the others were a little fainter, you would not of been able to see them naked eye, only with the binoculars.  The fainter 2 were traveling at the same speed as the brighter one and they appeared to be ahead of the brighter one. They all traveled together from NW to SE and of course they disappeared as they reached approximately 45 degrees above the horizon due to the city lights. This was for real folks!  I was alone and so there are no other witnesses but I am a perfectly normal sane guy that was just out stargazing. I don&apos;t think satellites travel in 3&apos;s like this but maybe they do.

I noticed that the plane had on what seemed to be landing lights.  I also noticed that it seemed to be comming in pretty darn fast.  It did not slow down when it should have nor did it desend as it got closer.  The object was not following the normal routeen.  It Passed almost directly overhead so I was able to get a very good look at it.  As it approached I could see it was not shaped like the 737 that normally came in at 10:30 p.m.  The wingletts at the located at the tip of eash wing looked to be about 20 feet tall and had 4 virtical lights or windows on each side of the winglett.

I witnessed the object for a duration of about 3 seconds before it disappeared, the lights appearing on it were lime green in color and I estimate it flew at about 30,000 feet.It was about 8:38pm CST, on Thursday April 27 when I witnessed the object. I met a girlfriend of mine in the parking lot of my apartment complex, and while she was talking with my best friends fiance(they also live in my complex) I witnessed a triangular object moving at incredible speed from the north to south. The object was lit on its underside in the shape of a rod, but I could make out a black triangular shape outside of the lit area. I could see the object moving for about 3 seconds, then it seemed to just disappear. There was no clouds in the area to hide in, so where it went is beyond me. The speed was incredible, in the couple of seconds I witnessed it it covered a good portion of the sky. To compare in speed, I witnessed the space shuttle coming back in orbit a couple of months ago, it took about 30-35 seconds to cross the horizon. If this object would have stayed visible it would have cleared the horizon in less than 10 seconds. I was fully expecting to hear a sonic boom. My best guess of the size of the object is about 3 times of the size of a 727(in comparison to a 727 flying at 30,000 feet, like this object appeared to be flying at). It definitely dodn&apos;t appear to be a meteor, becuase of the color, size, direction of movement(it moved in a staight line).

I was hiking and camping by myself in a generally unhabitated area about 10 miles east of the city of Glamis near the Imperial Sand Dunes/Pichacio State Park (CA).  There is no doubt in my mind that these were unconventional aircraft.  I am reporting this because there must have been alot of people that saw this for there were many snowbirds and others camping out in the area or riding offroad vehicles at the Sand Dunes.On Sunday, February 13, 2000 I was camping out alone about 10 miles east of Glamis, CA.  There were many people in the area however and somebody else must have seen what I saw.  At approximately 6:55 p.m. I observed some kind of craft which at first was simply going in what appeared to be circles.  I thought it might be a Border Patrol airplane or helicopter but then it started to go straight up and then straight down, not very quickly, but very noticeably.  I couldn&apos;t figure out what kind of craft it was because of the up and down and circular manuevers it was making. The exact location of where I saw this craft initially was about 20-25 miles West of Yuma, AZ (or Winterhaven, CA right next to it on the CA side) and appeared to be hovering right over Interstate 8 near the Mexican Border.  I was probably about 8 to 10 miles away North of the object (looking directly South).  The longitude it was initially hovering at would be 115 degrees and the latitude about 32.75 degrees (Mexican Border). I could not really tell the shape of it even though I had binoculars. It was not very large though. I could clearly see it emitting a steady white and green light and a flashing red light. The colors seemed to be very similar to airplane lights but it definitely was not a plane. It was probably no bigger than a small airplane. Initially it was circling a specific area.  After about 5 minutes of watching it it started to go up and then go down, not very quickly, but it was noticable.  Sometimes it did seem to accelerate quickly and it was then that knew that this was no Border Patrol or other conventional aircraft.  Sometimes it would go up or down diagonally too.  It seemed to be intent on hovering over a specific area however which had to be viewable for people driving on Interstate 8. About 25 minutes later, at 7:20 p.m., I saw a second craft about a mile Southwest of the first object.  It&apos;s light simply seemed to turn on and it became viewable but for only about 10-15 seconds.  It started moving towards the first craft.  The first craft started to move away from it until the second craft&apos;s light faded away. There were airplanes flying in the vicinity while this was happening. Whenever an airplane seemed to get to close to this object the object would move away from the airplane and then eventually would go back to the spot it seemed it wanted to hover over.  At one point an airplane seemed to fly right at it at a normal speed.  The craft then started to fly right by it at a lower altitude at about the same speed of the airplane.  With it&apos;s flashing red light it probably looked like another airplane to the airplane, but after the airplane passed it, it doubled back and went back to hovering over the &apos;spot&apos;. At about 7:45 p.m. the lights from the craft dimmed to about half of it&apos;s original brightness.  It continued the up and down and around and diagonal movements for about 5 more minutes and then disappeared at approximately 7:55 p.m. I kept looking at the sky waiting to see if one or both of them would return.  At about 8:15 I saw one them (they both had the same colors and size) about 5 miles West of the original sighting location.  It seemed to be hovering in the same manner as described earlier over a specific &apos;spot&apos;.  I believe that there is a hydroelectric plant over the spot that seemed to be hovering over.  It hovered over this spot for about 15 minutes and then disappeared. About 8:45 one of them reappeared again about another 5 miles west of the previous spot (10 miles from the original spot).  A couple of minutes later the other one reappeared and I could clearly see both of them continuing their up and down manuevers about a mile or two away from each other.  At about 9:00 p.m. one of them slowly disappeared and then about 5 minutes later the other one slowly disappeared. The location of this would be about 5 miles South of Glamis and maybe 10 miles East of Holtville.  The people near Glamis must have seen this if they were looking in the sky.   There is a train that goes right though Glamis from Brawley to Yuma and the craft may have been noticeable to anyone on the train. At about 9:30 p.m. I saw what looked like one of the craft hovering over the Colorado River about 10 miles North of Yuma.  It seemed to be doing the up and down and around and diagonal manuevers over another &apos;spot&apos; for about 5 minutes and then slowly disappeared at about 9:35 p.m. At about 9:45pm I saw the craft back at the original sighting location but it&apos;s light was only about half of it&apos;s original amount.  It would alternately dim and disappear only to reappear again.  It seemed to be doing the same manueavers over the original &apos;spot&apos;.  This stopped altogether at about 10:05pm and I didn&apos;t see anything else for the rest of the evening (I went to sleep at about 11:00p.m.). I only other thing I could add would be that at times the flashing red light seemed to change to a flashing white light.  This was the only change of colors that I observed.  I had the feeling that the objects were trying to make themselves noticeable to any onlookers on the ground but they did not want to be noticed by the people in the airplanes. There is a Marine Air Corps Station in Yuma and there is a large AWACS observing station about 15 miles Northeast of Glamis.  This object should have appeared on radar at both locations.  I saw no fighters dispatched from Yuma. That&apos;s it. Mark Levy P.S. - I am a computer programmer and longtime resident of California. This was my second sighting.  I did not report the first sighting I had because I wanted to see if history would repeat itself so I could be absolutely sure about what I saw.  Now I am.  I could only provide sketchy details of my first sighting at this time but if you want me to describe it please call me or send me an email and I will do my best.

There was aircraft noise at 10:02pm I saw the lights at 9:45pmIt looked like two oval headlights, side by side, up in the sky.  Very large spheres about 35 degrees above the western horizon.  I looked up at them from my parked car and in a few moments they both disapeared like lights shutting off.  I drove forward, I don&apos;t know, I wanted to follow them, the one on the left appeared again like someone turned the light back on.  This one lasted just for a couple of seconds then disapeared.  It was a very clear night, and was nearly a full moon.  As soon as I saw the second light go out I looked at the clock in my car and it read 9:54pm  I backed up back to my driveway and ran into the house to tell my husband what I saw.  The lights were sphere shaped and almost had a halo of light going through the center of them.  They were very bright and very large.  They had no noise.  At 10:02 we heard what sounded like jet noises.  Like airforce jets make.  We looked and looked and did not see any jets.  I received a phone call from my sister in-law and was telling her what had just happed.  The telephone started making noise like she had hit a bunch of numbers or re-dial.  I got mad at her because I thought she was making fun of me.  I then gave the phone to my husband because I did not want to talk to her if she was going to make fun of me and later she and he both said the same thing happened on the phone with them too.  The phone conversation was fairly short.  I then spoke to my brother &amp; other sister in-law about it ( on the phone) and shortly thereafter decided to call the local radio station.  A man answered and I asked him if anyone had reported any strange lights around the bay that evening.  He said no in a funny tone so I said thanks and no more.  My husband and I decided to surf the net to see if we could find anything (this was about 15 min after the last conversation with my brother) and the computer was acting funny.  Things were not transmitting properly.  We were having a hard time getting the mouse cursor to stay where we put it.  I kept moving back down o! n it&apos;s o wn if we moved it up.  We gave up on trying to search anymore on the net.  I live less than half a block to the end of the bay.  The lights were high up and standing still.  I have never seen anything like this in my life and was awe struck. I was so glad to see our local newspaper report four other women and a man saw them too.  I was starting to think my family was going to think I was crazy!", "Two small objects float over the runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.My friend and I were waiting to board a plane at Phoenix Airport, noon, looking out at South Mountain, two small objects floated over the runway. At first they appeared to be like sheets of paper rolling in the wind or a foil birthday balloon.  They were above the backdrop of South Mountain so it was hard to judge the size or distance.  They seemed to float like small white baloons.  I followed their path looking out the window while walking to the end of the terminal.  As they floated away to tiny white spots in the sky, one drifted away, but one stayed. I could judge position by seeing the roof of the terminal looking almost straight up. It held that position for 10 min. I went to get my camera and came back (30 sec.) to find it was gone. (I thought ok maybe just balloons.) I went to the next set of windows to keep searching looked up and there were 2 objects again, this time closer and lower in the horizon. They held that position for another 5 min with out moving.  (I thought cool a pair of ufos).  I watched for a while and looked away for maybe 30 seconds. I looked again and one was gone!  The other just floated off in the distance after another 5 minutes..

Witness moved to get a better look. The witness saw a oval-shaped object with a square notch in the front or back. There were three lights on the &quot;craft&quot; one red one green and one a purple-blue. All were blinking. Craft rose up from the woods in the east. IT headed towards the northwest.

The fireballs hovered for what could have been only seconds, then they just disappeared, or fizzled out.My mother and I were on a return trip from Mobile, Alabama one afternoon after having visited my grandmother and done some shopping.  I was about 12 or 13 years old, and my mother, a medical technologist, was in her early 40&apos;s.  It was between 4:00 and 5:00 PM, and the sun was still above the horizon.  As we were nearing Jackson, Alabama, our home town, we were on the north side of Wagarville, Alabama when I looked to my right and noticed a single bright yellow/orange sphere hovering above the treeline. I turned to my mom to get her to look at the strange object when I noticed that she was already staring at the fiery globe.  Then I turned to observe the object again, and after a couple of seconds, one - by - one 5 or 6 objects of the same nature shot out, or ejected, from the first in a right - to - left motion, until they were all in a straight line.  The objects hovered there for only a moment, then they disintegrated, or vanished. Mom and I both looked at each other, and neither of us said anything. Finally I said, &quot;Mom! What was all that about!?&quot;.  It looked something like a fireworks display, only I knew it wasn&apos;t.  The objects didn&apos;t flicker like fireworks, and fireworks don&apos;t hover.

I saw a brilliant flash of white light and i got up and opened the window to see what it was. Then the white light faded out and I saw the traffic light outside was changing colors erradically...it would go from yellow to green then to red, and so on.  Then i looked up and to the left of it, and saw there was another light in the sky, changing colors exactly the same way.  The traffic light was about 50 feet away, and from my vantage point it looked like the UFO was about twice it&apos;s distance, hovering at maybe 150 feet. After i observed this for about 45 seconds, an even brighter white light shined onto me, and i had for some reason an intense feeling of joy, followed by an intense feeling of dread or fear.

They were moving quite slow, much slower than a small airplane and in a strange synchroniced formation. I would guess them to be between 5 and 10,000 ft. elevation. I continued to watch them for about four minutes while my wife went into the restaurant. They appeared to be flickering as if they were burning. I watched them till they were directly over head.

I was observing the stars when a bright white light(eastern/north eastern sky) caught my attention.

August 1, 1978.", "Twenty nights of stalking, apparent abduction attempts by Grey &quot;alien&quot; creatures, 1959.I&apos;ve never seen a UFO, but may have one better than that.  In 1959 I was visiting my grandfather at his house on the mountainous outskirts of Superior, Montana (this was the old railroad signal maintainer&apos;s house).  I made this visit every summer for 2 weeks - in this case I stayed three weeks, but for the last time.  The 1st or 2nd morning I awoke early and noticed that the bedroom door was ajar an inch.  But this was impossible as my grandfather was religious about closing and locking doors, especially at night.  Nor was there any possible way anyone could have gotten into the house. So I kept myself awake all the next night, and, oddly, the door did pop open roughly after midnight.  It also appeared that the hall light was on, because I could easily see the light from the opened door.  But the door did not open much more than an inch, unless, that is, I was extremely still and relaxed over several minutes, then it would gently open to 4-6 inches.  If I allowed myself to approach sleep, but not quite, 6 inches could be pretty well assured.  During all this, my grandfather slept in the same bed between myself and the door.  He had a bad case of apnea and made thunderous snoring noises and had violent nightmares all night. After about six nights, I asked him if we could swap - this would put my head only about 3 feet from the door and facing just a little into the hall.  Still, I could see very little all night and the door never opened over about 4 inches.  Finally, I coaxed myself into a half-sleep, a drifting sort of awareness and readiness to prod myself into a quick alert if disturbed.  Remember, it seemed as if I was safe enough as long as I was awake, but it was also fairly obvious that whatever was watching was not human and could be a serious threat.  &quot;It&quot; had something in mind, obviously, and it planned to come closer at the first opportunity. I first entered that half awake state on about the sixth day and was in it perhaps only 30-40 seconds.  The thought that my privacy might already have ! been inv aded or I might be in danger came suddenly, and I abruptly opened my eyes.  Yes, the door was open a good 9-12 inches.  There were five creatures peeking in the opening.  They looked exactly like the classic Grey, except that I could only see their heads as they leaned over each other.  I thought they looked like little circus men, but had never heard of Greys or space aliens in 1959, and I was only 11. Now, after they&apos;d been caught in this way, the door was kept much tighter.  I thought perhaps they&apos;d been frightened completely away, but no, they came again each night, but the door never again opened more than an inch.  Their boldness had been diminished.  But I was still very curious myself, so I stayed.  In fact, I decided to stay longer than my two week plan.  I was not frightened too much, but quite frightened at the thought of going to sleep, because I didn&apos;t know what they might then do.  But staying awake all night every night for 20+ days can be difficult, so I ended up drifting off again.  Again, I abruptly opened my eyes.  This time the door remained nearly shut as usual, but something else was happening.  There was a column, or zone, of vibrating light, highly energetic, but without sound.  It appeared that the creatures were &quot;transporting&quot; into the room with some sort of energy field.  I&apos;ve heard of abductees reporting a bluish light.  I don&apos;t remember any actual color, but I do remember the strong, twitching movements and concentrated light about a foot wide and roughly four foot high. This is my big story.  It is quite true, not exaggerated one iota, and I am therefore fully convinced of the Greys&apos; reality.  I got very bored with the game after that, was a bit frightened, and so I went home.

So I went back down stairs and on my way back I looked out the window were I saw an object just hovering above a tree line. it sat there for a minute and turned off the 3 white lights then I could only see 1 red light which looked to be about the center of the object. I asked my brother to get out of bed to come take a look at it which was 10:00pm EST. We both looked at it then it moved to the right and turned on the 3 white lights again.

While we were out there, we heard a low rumbling sound which we took to be an air conditioner.  My sister went out of the moving van and said that there was something up in the sky.  We(my dad and I) came out to look and we saw and cigar-shaped object fly overhead.  It had come from the northeast and went southwest.  At the time it passed overhead, the rumbling we had heard changed into a high-pitched whine.  The object had 3 strobe lights on the bottom that blinked on and off; one was red, one was white, and one was blue.  It flew rapidly to the southwest until it was out of sight.

When I first saw it I was thinking someone&apos;s roof blew off their house but it wasn&apos;t windy and the object was perfectly still. I was coming to a stop sign so I was barely moving in the car. I stopped and just watched it for about 20 seconds.  The object looked like a rectangular box standing upright which was black. Out of each corner it looked like a giant post or antenna sticking out diagnally maybe about 10 feet long. Those were harder to make out.  So after being stopped in the car watching it, not even moving, it spun 90 degrees and got thin. The size would be about 30 foot tall, 20 foot wide and 8 foot thick.

As we drove closer It moved above the trees on the left side of the road.  It was a dark ball with a beam of light coming from left side of craft.  Light seemed to cut off rather than dissipate.  When we were right next to the craft (approx 200 ft. max) A diamond pattern of lights, yellow, red blue, and green, flashed rapidly.

Long row of lights too bright for me to see shape of craft.I was traveling South on 408 Spur at approx. 2:00 A.M. in late December 1999.  I was approaching a large hill which sits just off the Spur on the West side.  I noticed very bright lights moving in the trees along the top of the hill and moving in Easterly Direction.  My immediate thought was, &quot;Hey, there is someone driving through those trees up there. I&apos;ve never seen anyone driving around up there.  Must be someone doing off road stuff.  Wow the lights are bright, could be more than one driving around up there.&quot;  As the lights got to the East edge of the hill where I wondered if I would be up to the hill in time to see them drive down toward the highway, suddenly the lights just came out from behind the hill in the air!  I did not expect that!  A string of very bright lights emerged slowly and stopped directly over the highway up ahead. I would estimate the length of the object to be about as long as Texas Stadium!  I could not see the shape of it or the sillouette of it for the brightness of the lights.  I continued driving but was stupified at what I was looking at!  After it stopped, it reversed direction and proceeded to go back the direction it came from. (West) It disappeared behind the hill and very quickly I arrived at the spot where it had stopped over the highway.  I looked to my right expecting to get a good look at whatever it was and all I saw was the lights of Grand Prairie, Arlington, and Fort Worth spread out in all their spleandor!  There were no bright lights. There was no object.  If it had been there and had just turned its lights off, I would have seen a sillouette with all of the city lights .  It just vanished!  I have been driving home from night shift for 13 years and this is the one and only strange thing I have seen in the air!

We both said &quot;Wow look at those geese.&quot; then we both knew that it wasn&apos;t geese because the sky was black and these were lit up.  They wandered in formation from south east to north west across the sky in an arch.  We said &quot;Those were not geese.... that was a UFO.&quot;  We stood and looked at each other amazed and a little in shock.  Then about 45 seconds to a minute later another group flew over. The first group had 7 in it and so did the second group.  We both yelled there goes another group.  We couldn&apos;t believe it.  It took about 5 seconds for them to go from horizon to horizon.  There were airplanes flying around at the time to compare with and these were deffinatly not air planes.  My friend thought maybe a search light but there was no way that these tinkerbell lights could be a search light because of their shape and brightness and they were traveling in a straight line.  We thought maybe they were circling around and around but then while we were talking a group of 3 flew overhead. This group was not as organized as the others were.  They looked as if they were trying to catch up and were bouncing around more than the others were.  By now we were looking in the direction they were comming from waiting for the next group to come.  Our mouths hanging open.  Soon a group of 14 flew over in chevron pattern 7 on one side and 7 on the other side.  I could tell they were not attached lights because they floated around in the formation.  All groups were traveling at about the same speed.  The group of 3 going the slowest.  We were yelling and bouncing up and down as we turned and watched them  until they were out of sight.  We were both covered in goose bumps and starting to shake.  Then the next group of 7 flew directly over us. That was the closest group.  There was not a sound from any of them. We waited for several minutes but no more appeared.

From my 3rd story patio I had a terrific view of the Cahuenga Canyon - out across Hollywood and off toward the high rise buildings far off in Downtown Los Angeles. My 10 year old son was staying with me for the holiday and was asleep on the floor in a sleeping bag.  This night was one of those warm winter evenings, and the doors &amp; windows were wide open. It was about 4:00 AM when I got up to use the bathroom; then decided to step outside onto the patio to view the city light.  I was looking East &amp; South. I stood on the patio for a few moments and looked downward from my hilltop location - Then, I was amazed to see the lights in the Cahuenga Pass slowly began to vanish?  It appeared that these lights below me were being &quot;eclipsed&quot; by some large oval black shape which passed over them, as it moved Southward &amp; West around the mountain. &quot;Helicopter,&quot; I thought... or maybe &quot;The Goodyear Blimp?&quot;  But there wasn&apos;t any sound!  I listened for the &apos;copter&apos;s clatter, or the low-drone of the blimp...  but nothing. The shape kept moving around and below, across my path of vision.  It was probably 300 - 400 feet away.  I was very intrigued, as this made no sense, and no sound?  I could then see the general oval shape as the object passed and the canyon lights were again revealed behind it. Then, the object was directly before &amp; below me (maybe 100 feet below my eyelevel), when I suddenly thought... &quot;Zeus!  It&apos;s a flying saucer!!!&quot; -  and then, THE SHIP&apos;S LIGHTS POPPED ON!!! revealing a row of yellowish / pink WINDOWS?  which passed all around the thing! I tried to make some sense of it all ~ and I thought, &quot;It couldn&apos;t be the Good Year Blimp at 4:00 AM in the Morning!!!...&quot; &quot;It&apos;s a bloody Saucer!!!&quot; Then, 2 rows of Colored Lights (Red &amp; Blue, I think) popped-on, and started to &quot;marquee&quot; - first in one direction, then the other.  All the while, the Saucer continued to pass before my line of sight... I could see (sort-of) inside the Ship - but by now, I was positive this was all a strange hallucination.  So, I ran back inside the apartment and wakened my 10 year old son...  (Trying not to frighten him from sleep) &quot;Jaes!  Wake-up!  Quick!&quot; &quot;What is it, Dad?&quot; &quot;Quick!&quot; - I took his hand and we hurried back outside on the patio... but by now the saucer / object had passed out of view, and around the side of the Hollywood Hills to across West Hollywood and ??? I sat up with my son for a while &amp; we talked about what I&apos;d seen.  He believed me, but it was / is still hard for me to believe what I&apos;d seen.

I live in central Arizona and just minutes ago at approximately 7:00P.M. Arizona time, I was outside looking west, watching an airplane flying west when I noticed a bright flash about 30 degrees above the horizon almost due west. The object had an elongated shape like a rocket and was pointing and moving upwards. It looked to be about one third the length of a straight pin held at arms length. I followed the object upwards for about 10 to 15 seconds to an angle of about 45 degrees. The object started to emit a vapor trail for about one second and then the whole thing disappeared from sight.

As one stream of twinkling lights fell to the ground, another stream of lights rose from the ground to the craftBecause the incident happened so long ago, and I was at such a young, I don&apos;t remember exactly where the event took place or on what date.  However, as I remember it, I was traveling on a 2-lane highway with my grandpa and older cousin.  While driving towards Elizabethtown KY my grandpa pulled off into a roadside gas station to pick up some snacks.  As he exited the van, I was sitting in the back seat reading a book.  Seconds after he entered the store my cousin who was sitting in the front seat (he was around 13 at the time?) began to yell and point frantically.  I climbed to the front seat to see what he was doing.  He was screaming &quot;Look, Look!&quot;  As I looked to the horizon across a corn field I saw a rather large object in the sky.  (As soon as I can draw a decent diagram, I will send it in.)  As I looked to the (East?) I saw a round, circular object in the sky that looked white in contrast with the sky.  Around the center of the object was an oblong oval shaped disc.  It looked like a big belt all the way around it.  Within the belt there were approximately four circles of light.  These circles were glowing red, green, and purple, and seemed to be alternating color schemes.  I would estimate that the object was around 200-250 yards away, and was located in the horizon where the corn field, and woods seemed to meet in the distance.  While watching the object, I remember being almost hypnotized by it; I had never seen anyting like it.  In fact at that time, I a positive that I did not know what an alien or a UFO was.  The craft just hovered the where the woods and corn met.  As it hovered it was emitting small twinkling lights down to the ground.  As one line of lights went to the ground, there was a second line of lights that traveled upwards into the craft. The whole time this was happening, my cousin was screaming and yelling.  After about a minute of observation, I snapped out of my fixation and asked him what it was.  He replied &quot;That&apos;s a UFO!  It has some aliens onboard who are probably going to kill off everyone and destroy the earth!&quot;  &quot;They are going to blow everyhting up!&quot;  Being 7-8 years old, I was pretty impressionable so naturally I believed him. As my grandfather came back to the van with food and drinks, I went to the back seat and cried, all the way to Elizabethtown where we were to visit my great-grandma.  My grandpa asked what was wrong with me but I didn&apos;t answer him.  Actually, I did not stop crying until the next morning when I realized that we were not all dead.  As I recall, my cousin and I did not talk to anyone until the next day.  I only bring this up because it really illustrates how absolutely terrified I was with the experience.  I thought for a while that my cousin was just trying to scare me, but he was genuiley terrified also. I am now 22 years old, and about to graduate from college with a degree in Law Enforcement.  To this day I have never seen any object even remotely close to this.  I haven&apos;t seen or talked to my cousin, who was present since I was around 10-11.  We had never talked about at all outside of the gas station parking lot.  Actually, I believe he is in prison now.  My grandpa does not remember my strange behaviors that day; but there are a lot of things that my grandpa does not remember. I am hoping that someone out there can validate this story, or have seen something similar.  I am very eager to talk to anyone about this, including investigators, or even go under hypnosis to possibly recount the incident in more detail.", "while going home from work, traveling north on 101 from Santa Rosa I saw a large light in the sky.  I stopped to look at it. It was about 25 to 40 feet long &amp; had lot&apos;s of white lights, at least three big white lights &amp; many fainter white lights &amp; one faint flashing red light.  At least three of the white lights where flashing. It made no noise.  It was traveling about 40- 50 mph, &amp; traveling from the northwest to the southwest.  It took about 5 min. for it to cross the sky.  I looked at it through my bynoculars &amp; took hi-8 camcorder film of it.  it was about 150 to 250 feet off the ground &amp; 1/4 to 1/2 mile awy from me.  I took about one min. or so of footage. The footage is in three segments, due to an object getting in the way, &amp; may shaking &amp; needing to move in order to prop my arms on the side rail of my truck to steady the camcorder.  No contact or missing time.I was traveling home from work on highway 101 out off Ranta Rosa, when I saw a bright light on the horizon to the northwest.  I desided to pill off the road tpo get a better look at it, as it seemed to be coming towards my position.  I Exeited the freeway at Central Healsburg Ave. &amp; drove out of town &amp; found a dark clear or open place to stop.  I at first stayed in my truck &amp; uust rolled down my window &amp; looked at the lights through my bynoculars, I at that time determined that it was light no other air craft I&apos;ve ever seen so I grabed my hi-8 camcorder &amp; begain filming.  it too a bit for the camcorder to focus on it.( it was swt on auto focus) after getting in focus I zoomed in on it useing the lens zoom only.  it&apos;s been my experience that when I use the digital zoom the quality goes down grately, so I don&apos;t usually use it.  Then I lost it behind a object so I got out of the truck with the film still running &amp; got it in sight once again, but I was shaking to badly to get a steady shot so I again move to the side of my truck to prop my arms on the side rail.  I got a few more seconds of footage before I was distracted by the other lights that where in the sky.  I think that most if not all of the other lights where commercail aircraft.  I tried taking footage of them but didn&apos;t do to well, they where further away.  This area is really close to where I saw another light in the sky back in Sept. or Oct. 99, in Windser.  It&apos;s as the crow flies about 1 to 1 1/2 miles away.  The triangle was traveling with the point in the front or pointed in the direction it was going.  it never turned up or down, left or right, yaw &amp; roll, or speed.  I could only see the faint/small lights when it was at it&apos;s closest.  I could not make out a body or outline off the craft.", "Saucer shaped object with red, green, and blue lights observed approx. 1/4 - 1/2 mile away. Object hovered then appeared to land in woods.My brother, newphew, 2 of his friends, and I were over at my brother&apos;s house which is near the Cedar Ridge area in Dallas. We were watching TV when I noticed that a dark object was hovering outside up in the sky approximately 1/4 - 1/2 mile up to the south of his house through an opened balcony door (I was sitting on the floor). There appeared to be blue, green, and red lights turning on and off on the underside of the craft (or whatever it was). My brother had just gotten a new digital video camera so I asked him if I could see it. I obtained approximately 2 or 3 minutes footage of it hovering with the lights turning on and off before it moved to my left (east) and out of my sight behind some trees. The object appeared to descending as it moved out of my line of sight. I saw no other lighting and the object appeared to be hovering when I first saw it. No detetectable sounds or other lighting appeared to emanate from the object.", "I first noticed one object moving from NE to SE. The object was visible at about 45 degrees in the NE sky. It moved silently at a uniform speed with no change in intensity.  As it reached the 90 degree point I noticed there were actually 3 objects or one large object forming an isosceles triangle.  The object(s)slowly faded out in the SE sky at about 45 degrees above the horizon.Myself and my friend went outside at 10:50 pm to walk the dogs.  I always look at the stars, I am an amateur astronomer and have had a keen interest in that subject for some time. As I looked to the Norheast, I saw what I believed to be a satellite moving to the Southeast.  I pointed this out to my companion.  As the object past over head at 90 degrees I saw there were actually three objects flying in formation, or one large object.  The person with me was able to see two of the three points of light before they faded in the Southeast. The space between the triangle points was very large.  I estimate you could place 3 full moons within that area.  Movement of the object(s) was very fluid, no sound, the points of light making up the triangle remained fixed, not increasing or decreasing in distance.  I observed no stars being blacked out as the object(s)passed over.  Distance above the earth was very difficuly to determine other than to say they appeared to be in low earth orbit.", "A large hot dog shape object, glowing red orange, just like the color of an electric stovetop.  Object was seen floating above the Crescent City. The local news reported strange glowing light.((name deleted)) came rushing in to tell me that there was a UFO in the sky.  At first, taken back, but went out to check just in case it was a real UFO. There it was, in plain daylight, and it was longer than any building in New Orleans. It floated there above the Crescent City, and we watch it make skipping movements northward towards the Lake Pontchartrain, which is the largest man made lake in the world, about fifteen feet deep. This happened around the time that three small gray creatures adducted Charlie Hickson. We are just about 100 miles east of Pascagoula, Mississippi.  Local newsman even chased a UFO with a helicopter and shows footage. There was a wave of sightings going on around the area. I was seventeen at the time and my brother ((deleted)) was eight. Just a few years earlier when I attended ((deleted)) Military Academy in Gainesville Georgia, I felt compel to go off to the parade field at night.  Looking up at the stars and I pour out my heart, and asked God to let me communicate with the aliens.  I asked the aliens to please come and make a landing near my hometown, within a 100 miles.  I told others at school that a UFO was going to land near my hometown, and they would then know that I could communicate with space beings. To my surprise, sky people landed in Pascagoula, Mississippi, but I was disappointed to know that they did not look like us.

Neither of the objects were moving, we neared the lights as we travelled eastbound.  We first saw them at apx. the 95 mile post marker.  As we approached these lights and were almost beneath them, the light on the north side turned off and strobe-like lights were seen being emitted from the bottom.  Within less than a minute that it took for us to exit the interstate and stop to observe, these lights disappeared in a flash in what appeared a southwest direction towards the Palo Verde Nuclear Plant.  We returned westbound to mile post 103, exited the freeway and attempted to locate these lights again, but to no avail.  My husband drives a truck professionally at night and has for almost 40 years.  He&apos;s never seen anything  like that before.  The sky was mostly clear with only vapor trails visible.

It changed color a few times. It then went behind the far mountains and reappeared from behind them again a few seconds later before it suddenly shot away and out of sight. There was no way this could have been an airplane, no plane can move that quickly or in such a manner.I watched the sunrise for several minutes before I noticed a strange oval shaped object move across the clouds. At first I thought it was an airplane so I paid it no mind. then as I watched it suddenly began to move quite erratically, it shot up and then down and went all the way across the horizon and back to the other side in a matter of seconds. It continuously did this for an estimated time of 20 minutes. When it first started doing this I realized that this could not possibly be an airplane of any sort. There was no way any airplane could move that quickly unless it was travelling very near the sound barrier, it was moving so fast across the skyline. It was at that moment that I began to feel rather nervous and a bit afraid. The craft never came towards me, but just the sight of it frightened me, and very few things frighten me or even make me nervous. I am a very calm, rational person, however this craft had that effect on me for some reason. I continued to watch it and it appeared to change color several times. I do not believe that the color change was due to the reflected light from the sunrise however, because it changed to dark green and red and then to pure white and finally to black, all colors that did not appear anywhere in the sunrise. I am also a rather observant person and I took out my binoculars to try to see if there was any way that this could be a plane, just to put out of my mind the last few doubts I had or to prove that the doubts were for good reason. I looked at it and I saw only the perfectly smooth oval craft still, with some sunlight reflecting off of it&apos;s now dark green surface. when I took the binoculars away from my face I watched as the craft dissapeared behind the far mountains. This craft must have been quite large to be so far away and still be quite visible. My neighbor also witnessed this event, however my neighbor and I rarely speak to eachother due to a personal dissagreement. As far as I am aware my neighbor was the only other witness. Also the craft emitted a! strange sonic pulsing sound that I could hear as could my dog and several of my neighbors dogs as well as all the other animals around my area and as far as I could hear. I do not believe that my neighbor heard this sound. I have a strange ability to hear ultra high pitched sounds such as a dog whistle, that many people cannot hear. I do not believe that my neighbor heard the sound emitted by the craft, even though the animals could. Even the wild coyotes seemed to react to it. After about 20 minutes the craft shot away out of sight. It must have broken the sound barrier at this point.", "I was outside at night, and sitting on my deck to my pool looking at the stars.

Which was odd because it was so bright and it was goldish colored.  I watched it for a while.  It started to move slowly towards the left and i thought it was just me.  But I realized it was moving because it was getting closer.  It wasn&apos;t so bright anymore and it kept moving inch by inch, and eventually moving pretty fast.  As it flew over me I knew it was a UFO because it looked like triangle with straight sides and it was 3-dimensional.  I was amazed that i couldn&apos;t move.  It felt like it was moving in slow motion.  I could hear my heart beating and as the object kept moving I seen three lights one at each corner.  I still couldn&apos;t move I was so moved by this object.

We would like to hear from anyone else who may have witnessed this event.))", "Saw a cluster of red lights moving through the sky at high speed with no soundI was feeding my dog at about 8:00 pm est when I saw what looked like a cluster of red lights moving through the sky at high speed. They vanished behind a tree and when I had run down to the road to get a better view of the sky it was gone. It made no sound what so ever and there were no aircraft that I could see in the sky.", "Middle of day, an object was in the sky, no loud noise that would be like a plane of that size.  It wasn&apos;t small.  It was in the country.I was driving and saw an object in the sky which could not have been a plane because it had no wings, windows, etc. and it was hovering.  I watched it for a minute and then it began to take off...slowly at first and I followed it but then it was instantly gone out of sight. This is on the Camas Prairie, very low population, many fields and farms. It was so very quite...almost a hum.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))Shape correction of greencreek UFOI just looked at what I had put years earlier and need to have that corrected.  It was not a cigar shaped object. it was a disc, approximately 200 - 250 feet long.  I wasn&apos;t &quot;versed&quot; in shapes and how to describe the object I saw, at that time.  It hovered about the same distance as it was long 200 - 250 feet above the ground.  When I first saw it I immediately thought it was a jumbo jet that was way off course and was going to crash into the ground... that lasted for a few seconds until I got a grip on what I was seeing.((END))", "I was closing the kitchen curtains when I glanced upward and saw a bright, yellow cylinder, very sparkly moving slowly--I thought it was an airplane, but no--it turned slowly, then I looked higher and another one was right up above it--1300 ft. approximately is where they were--one on top of the other, then the changed position and were side by side.  I wanted to go outside and see clearer, but I was frightened to do so.  Then one of the cylinders sped away and only one remained for approximately 2-3 hours---I didn&apos;t stay at the window watching constantly but I kept going back and forth to my window to see if it, or they were still there moving around the sky--and yes, one of them was.  I finally went to bed at 22:00PM.  There was much motion of lights inside my home, so I figured they were still out there.  This is not my first sighting.  I have had several.  Last night was a full moon and the sky was very blue and clear.  Once, last July, there was a silver cylinder that stayed motionless for about one hour, it was only 17:00PM and broad daylight; it finally made a l80 degree turn and left very fast to become a small dot then totally disappeared.  There were 6 witnesses.  That nite the news said it was a weather baloon, but it was not--no weather baloon could possibly take off at speeds of light!", "Bright white object traveled approx due east leaving a neon green, blue tail with red within it. Tail changed between green &amp; blue and remained visible throughout flight. Approx 30-35 dgs above east horizon disappeared in cluster of short-lived red sparks.Single object, circular or oblong, falling due east appeared to fall straight down probably due to moving from directly overhead away to the east.  Object did nothing unusual other than be very bright and leave a luminescent tail that remained vivible throughout the flight.  As the object approached the eastern horizon it disappeared in a shower of sparks, appearing to vaporize.  Object appeared to move slowly compared with most meteorites which come and go in a flash.  I was able to to shout to the other people with me who had time to turn and look out the window and see the object as well. The four observers were three adults and a high school junior.  another person in the house didn&apos;t get to the window in time to see the object.  The three adults are high school teachers from central Washington.", "On the above date and time I was patroling the perimeter of the Prision I work when I observed a triangle shape object hovering behind the prisonI`m 55 years old and worked in the garment ind. in middle and upper management for 32 years,I now work in a prison as a correctional officer and patrol the perimeter of the prison from 2200 hrs to 0600 hrs. On 02/23/00 at 2255 hrs I noticed that the two lights I had been watching had got much closer and bigger,i was on the south west side of the perimeter looking over the prison to the north east,I drove to the parking lot and turned around now going in a clock wise direction as i turned the corner now heading north I was looking straight into the lights i drove on to the next corner and before turning east I stoped the truck because the object was directly in front of me and hovering about a hundred yards above the trees and about 1000 yds. behind the prison.as I got out of the truck it started moving toward me very slow i watched as it passed over top of me.it looked like a very very large triangle with lights outlining its shape and one seemed to be in the middle blinking I did not hear any noise at all, the night was clear, cool and still from the time I first saw the lights untill it passed over me was about 30 min.(Something else when i took post at 2150 hrs the Air Force Jets were flying over the prison I didn`t give that much thought because they do that every now and then.) I waited a while before I radioed main control and reported what I had seen because I knew they would think I was crazy,she laughted and wanted to know if I needed to be relieved even tho I had only been on duty one hour.I have no idea what this thing was, but it could hover, it made no noise,moved off very slow and was the biggest thing I have ever saw.You may contact me if you wish to do so.", "about 3 crafts took formation and hovered about 200 meters above ground. The odd glowing object would zip through the sky near the 3 crafts and there were a number of dimly lit glowing objects around the 3 stationary craft. every hour a black triangle would fly by pretty close to the ground until it took a stationare position in the sky.My dad and i were outside driving and we saw 3 bright lights in the sky just zipping all over. We stopped and got out and the objects just stopped and hovered. Then there were at least 3 dimly lit sperical crafts flying and hovering all over each one of the crafts. Every so often 1 or 2 other craft would come out of no where and fly right up to the stationary craft.  Then they would fly off and up into the sky till you couldnt see them anymore. About once an hour a huge black triangle with lights on it would fly pretty close to the ground just like it was patroling and up through the atmosphere.  Then another black triangle took up a hovering formation with the other craft.  We got bored looking at these things just sit there for about a half hour so we got back in the truck and drove home. I am 16 and my dad is 48.  My dad had a couple minor strokes prior to this and i have had constant nosebleeds as well as hearing voices in my head that were not mine on one occasion.", "A large, very bright, light of the approximate color of a mercury vapor lamp, seen streaking north to south above southern Seattle Metroplex.I am a paratransit bus driver for a Metro Contractor.  I had just pulled over to the curb in the 22000 block of 6th Ave. in order to receive another assignment by radio from our dispatcher, when the whole top of the dash and everything around me outside flashed a brilliant electric bluish color--about the color of a mercury vapor lamp. I looked out the windshield and saw a large oval shaped light streak from approximately directly overhead, and a little to the east, as I was parked facing directly South. The light appeared to be oval in shape, and either very close or very large, which would be dictated by the objects actual location from my vantage point. As this object decended, at an estimated 30 degree angle, it appeared to slow down somewhat and disappeared at approximately 5 degrees above the horizon, which could be discerned by the naked eye.  The width of the object was approximate 1/8th of an inch at arms length! This object was observed for approximately 4 seconds. There were no observed aircraft in the area at this particular time, which was somewhat unusual, as at about this time in the morning, Sea-Tac airport starts to come alive for the day.  This is the second sighting of this type that I have witnessed in this same local, and was an almost identical repeat!  The other sighting occurred at almost exactly one month ago, and was sighted going through and between the clouds.  This morning, 04-07-00, was almost crystal clear, with some low clouds far to the East.  I didn&apos;t report the first sighting because of time constraints-job wise- and due to the fact that I thought it was a really neat thing to witness, as I have seen many objects of this type when we lived in southen Arizona, and just outside the perimeter fence of Sandia Labs, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, many of which I have documented.  The information supplied herein is the best that can be provided short of making a video.", "The same night a fireball landed in England Arkansas, I saw a (meteorite) GREEN in color with an ORANGE tail of about 2 ft. in diameter about .25 miles away 1000 ft. above ground and dissapear over a ridge in Conway Arkansas. I saw it for about 3 secs, but can specify exactly where, and at what rate it was travelling. It is my beleif that it either burned up before it landed, (about 200ft. above ground) or I couldnt see it land due to a ridge nearby.I wish to be contacted about this information preceeding the report I will submit to the offices of emergency management. I wouldnt have sought to release this information, as I thought it was insignifigant, but I heard on the radio that there was an anomolous occurance that night with a fireball sighting. I was urged to divulge what I knew as I thought that I would possibly have been one of the few to see this land. I am knowledegable in the field of physics, and somewhat in astronomy. I can give a scientific account concerning where it was in the celestial sphere. I know it was very close.", "A cigar-shaped UFO glided down towards the earth at a 45 degree angle, but was lost in the ground clutter.It was February, 1960 when my friend LB and I had stopped at a local dairy store on Grand Avenue, bought our candy and chatted with the owner, and left when it closed at 10:00pm. We walked over to the vocational school next to our old grade school, and stood talking about aviation and rockets and anything interesting. There had been an F-84 parked in front of the vocational school for a few years. The school had removed the jet engine and taken it inside to be used in training jet engine mechanics. The plane remained out front as an advertisement for the school. Eventually, someone must have gotten nervous about the possibility that a kid might hurt himself on it, so it was towed away. So that&apos;s where LB and I liked to stand and talk: it was near the F-84 - or at least, where it now USED to be... It was now around 10:15pm. LB and I had been talking and trying to keep warm for about 15 minutes. The conversation felt like it was winding down, which was fine with me: it must have been around 20 degrees outside. Suddenly, while LB was saying something, I saw an unbelievable sight. It&apos;s fantastic - but I swear I saw it. A huge, cigar-shaped, wingless, engineless, noiseless lighted craft appeared from behind something - I think it was an apartment house - and quietly and swiftly glided down an imaginary slope as if it were on invisible railroad tracks. Each end was tapered and blunted - like the lit end of a fresh cigar. It was silvery in color, and had 8 to 10 round portholes with white light coming out of them. I did not see anyone or anything inside the ship. It was roughly in front of me and to my left - behind LB - and seemed very close: perhaps less than a block away. I was absolutely stunned. It was huge, it was bright, it was close, and it was moving closer. I thought it was going to land or crash. I was nearly speechless and momentarily afraid to move. My left arm shot out past LB&apos;s shoulder and I yelled, &quot;LOOK!!!&quot;. LB has always been noted for his quick reactions, but for some unknown reason he reacted slowly on this occasion. He started to turn to his left (the wrong way), then changed his mind and turned slowly to his right (towards where I was pointing). By the time he was fully turned, the ship had disappeared behind ground clutter - houses, trees, bushes, etc. I yelled, &quot;It should reappear over there!&quot;, pointing and running towards where I thought it might reappear. But it never emerged. It was apparently gone forever. While I was trembling and out of breath, LB was calm, collected, and slightly puzzled and bemused. Did LB - the world&apos;s greatest skeptic - believe me? Certainly not. He didn&apos;t think I was lying - he knew I wouldn&apos;t lie to him, but he thought that perhaps I&apos;d seen an optical illusion caused by the newly installed mercury street light, a hundred or more feet away. But, as to practicality, I&apos;ve seen billions and billions of mercury street lights, yard lights and playground lights, and not once have I thought I saw a silvery, cigar-shaped UFO come gliding out of the night in their vicinity - EXCEPT for that one time. Science, to be science, must be repeatable. LB&apos;s theory is not repeatable, nor can it be science. I saw what I saw - so far, once and only once in my lifetime.", "We saw a red light at high altitude zig zag across sky from horizon to horizon, then again hovering slowly over Mo. river area, then close up.My girlfriend and I saw a bright red light pass over us at high altitude zig-zagging from horizon to horizon.Shortly, we saw a light reddish cloud overhead slightly to the north. Then we saw a craft moving slowly, almost hovering, low, above the MO.river area, tipping on it&apos;s side and forward while still moving in the same path. We lost it behind the trees until it flew almost overhead at treetop level still about a block away. We were becoming very exited and agitated, and the animals were acting strangely. Dogs running down the middle of the street, crickets became silent, and a K-9 Police unit roared down our 30 m.p.h. street at over 100 m.p.h. towards police headquarters. We decided to go to Lewis and Clark Monument Park up in the hills north of town which took us through Lakeview Park north of Co. Bluffs,in order to get a better view of the area skies.My girlfriend was driving as I was watching the skies. As we were driving through the park I spotted the craft coming towards us very low and slow. We became very scared as it seemed to see us and know that we were seeing it. It caught up with us as we approached the tennis court parking area and I told my girlfriend of this. For some reason she pulled the car over and stopped. When she saw it we both got out and ran barefoot about 50 yards to a train tressle which we momentarily hid under. I don&apos;t know what possessed us to come out from underneath it to look, but we did. There it was, hovering over the large cottonwood tree that is still there today. It was shaped like a hockey puck and about 100 ft. in diameter. Its edges were covered with large rectangular lights flashing in a clockwise direction as viewed from the ground. They were taller than wide and as a light would flash then dim the next light would flash and then dim, etc.,yet by the time it would dim the lights would go full circle around the craft. It was almost as if the light was streaking around the machine, yet you could see the delineations between the lights. We were frozen with awe and fear when the craft dipped and one of its red lights went out and it shined some sort of beam at us. I just recall that I think our hair was standing on end. The next thing either of us can recall was that it was daylight and we werein the car driving towards Lewis and Clark Monument, our original destination. I make no claims of abduction or anything extraordinary, other than we were obviously missing time and my girlfriend who had never taken birth control in 4 years became pregnant the next time we were together and went on to have 4 children altogether.", "While doing some astronomy an object zoomed across my vision (while looking through the eyepiece) it was small and bright, but it wasn&apos;t all light, I could discern somehow that it wasn&apos;t all light. It reversed course which proved it wasn&apos;t a satellite or airplane. Also, it was going to slow to be a meteorite, but still pretty fast.I was looking around the constellation Canis Major(particulary around the star Sirius) through my telescope. My telescope is an 8 inch newtonian reflector, I was using the 25mm lense, if that helps at all. The background was a few stars seen only through the telescope and of course, space. The object zoomed across my line of vision, I could tell it was going very fast, but it was far away. It didn&apos;t flash across so it definitly wasn&apos;t a meteorite, which would have been disproved anyway by the fact that it reversed course. I was by myself. This was in the south and slightly to the east, and like a said around the constellation Canis Major which would put it about 50 degrees above the horizon. At first it was heading down at an angle, but when it reversed it&apos;s course it was heading up at the same angle. It was a very short sighting. I happen to be an aviation enthusiast and know for a fact there is no way it was any KNOWN aircraft. The fact that it reversed course rules out it being in orbit as well. I know I&apos;m stumped.", "High altitude, high speed object traveled across the sky before dissapearing behind a cloud.I in the parking lot of the local laundry mat looking up at the sky because it was a nice day and I was waiting for my wash.  I noticed an object that I thought at first was a seagul. I watched it further and realized that it was probably at a very high altitude, but it was moving pretty fast for that height.  For instance an airliner moves fairly slowly across the arc of the sky, this was on the order of three to four times as fast.  I also thought it might have been a baloon, but the shape wasn&apos;t quite right.  It was traveling in a south to southwestern direction coming in from over Lake Superior. The object eventually passed behind a cloud, and I lost sight of it.  It did appear to change direction but not significantly. Pretty unclonclusive but still I thought I would send in data in case someone else got another look at it, and it turned out to be more significant.", "A star-like object moved slowly but clearly until disappeared behind trees.I saw a bright star-like object quite low in the skies above Helsinki. It moved very slowly but clearly, taking maybe 20 minutes to disappear behind trees. It lost luminosity while it moved, at first looking like a very bright star and finally quite dim. I also saw a very similar moving star-like object near Kauhava around 12/22/99 6 am (date and time uncertain) for maybe five minutes before it disappeared behind trees. It was by far brighter than the brightest planet or star I have ever seen. Neither of the objects was certainly not an airplane, satellite or meteorite.", "Black Metallic Boomerang-Shaped Craft Hovering MotionlesslyI was driving with my girlfriend in Pine Hill, NJ in a semi-built-up suburban area.  When we were driving down the road we spotted two blinking lights (one yellow, one white) alternately blinking in the sky.  My girlfriend asked me what it was and I told her it was a tower and not a plane because it was completely motionless in the sky.  Then I remembered that there was no tower there, so we both took a second look as we drove closer.  This became more frightening because there was only space between the two lights and the ground, and a boomerang-shaped craft came into focus.  We were driving approximateley 35 miles per hour.  &quot;What the #!@! is that?,&quot; we both repeated.  I began to slow down but the driver behind me didn&apos;t even notice and was beeping at me to keep driving. Finally we got closer and I saw a black metallic ship between the two lights in an extremely aerodynamic shape (almost like a bug, almost a V shaped pattern).  I do not know what was scarier, the fact that the color of the metal was a glossy black and grey (unlike any kind of metal I&apos;ve seen) or the fact that it hovered motionlessly as I drove under it.  When I drove past it I turned back while I was driving and saw the shape of the ship along with it&apos;s meneacing metallic parts.  It couldn&apos;t have been even more than 3 blocks above us.  It was the most unbelievably amazing technology and I still can&apos;t believe the way it looked.  What the hell was that thing? I rendered this image for you using Photoshop.  I am a comercial artist and I believe this is as close to realistic as what I saw, minus some detail.  I&apos;ll do a 3d rendering later.", "A formation of bouncing lights was flying over the IJsselmeer.We all live in anna poulowna, iots a small duth town near den helder. We had a meeting to go out and do our paperround. As we usually do,we drove on our bikes towards the distribution office, as one of us yelled, kijk naar het water, we did that and we saw a Formation of strange bouncing lights above the IJsselmeer. They moved around in a bouncing pattern, not emmitting any sounds. We stopped and we looked upon them with incredible awe. Then they broke their pattern and made around circle with the opening towards us. Maybe they seen us or something. Than they made an awfull sound. Like a piece of chalk over the schoolbord, and they shot up into the air and they dissapeard. We stood by the water, the surface, normally very calm in no-wind conditions, was very wild and wavy. We quikly drove towards the office.", "One large triangular craft with one dim light on each end and a smaller craft which looked like a helicopter.  Both of which made no noise.I was traveling North on Highway 65 when I noticed a very large triangular shaped craft and a smaller craft which crossed over the interstate traveling around 50 mph.  The larger craft had 3 small dim lights at each end of the triangular shape and a larger red light on one side.  The smaller craft had many lights and looked more like a helicopter.  By the time I had reached the part of the interstate where they had crossed, they were over the trees heading southeast.  I stopped my car on the side of the road, got out, and continued to watch these two craft continue to travel very slowly.  I heard no noise at all from these two craft.  I got back in my car and continued to travel North.  About 5 minutes later I saw about 6 military helicopters cross the interstate in the opposite direction.  I knew they were helicopters by the very loud sound their blades made.  This all happened about 20 or 30 miles south of Montgomery, AL at 9:15 pm.", "one craft Flew over head toward east, Seperated into 3 craftI was jumping on trampoline, laid down, looked at sky. First craft apeared as if comming out from behind a cloud- though it had rained earlier, it was a clear sky. Craft had faint triangular outline, but visible metalic &apos;veins&apos; that looked like catwalks in small sections. Metalic or crome tip to the caft-Cotpit? Water-drop shaped bulbs that glowed- strange orbic light. Matched the color of sky, except for slight outline and parts mentioned. Craft flew to the the east for a few seconds, then seperated into 3 craft, all matching same discription, only about 15/18 size. Object made NO SOUND. Disipearded as if behind cloud, but no clouds where in sky. Ran inside and experienced uncotrolable emotions, at one point breaking a pencil in normal grip. I have seen a strange light in the sky seven years ago, along with two other members of my family. Christian family, father is a Baptist paster.", "Conjoined formation of shape changing spheres crosses skyI was poolside at the Super 8 Motel in Fresno smoking a cigar before going up to my room to turn in for the evening. I was attending the annual Country Western and Swing Dance Festival held at the Radisson Hotel a block away. There was a gentle breeze blowing from the North and the temperature was around 75 degrees.  I had been sitting in a lounge chair for nearly an hour when I decided it was time to finish up. As I rose I noticed an oblong sausage shaped dull orange light quickly pop up from behind a large bank building North of me in the downtown Fresno area. It looked like a large lumpy sausage  shaped balloon. That made no sense at all so I continued to watch it with suspicion. It rose to about 30 degrees in the night sky and no longer appeared to have the dusky illumination that caught my eye. It now appeared to be light gray and very shadowy as it approached and came even with me as I viewed it due West. This is where the description gets really weird. I have had sightings of structured craft before but nothing, never even like this, nor have I heard of anything like this. As it was due West at this time I asked myself, &quot;What the hell am I looking at?&quot;. It appeared to be a string of conjoined spheres each one pushing the next one along in an undulating formation where the one on the end would circle around and pop in at the front.  In disbelief I looked more closely and saw the spheres form into an angular formation with soft white vertices. It crossed the western sky in a smooth straight glide while continuing all this strange activity and was lost from sight at about a 45 degree inclination. The objects path spanned roughly 90 degrees of arc across the sky.  This all took place in about 30 secs. The object was as big as my thumb from tip to first knuckle at arm&apos;s distance (1.5&quot;). There was absolute silence and there was no air craft seen during the time I was out there.", "((NUFORC Note:  We have had several reports of this technique for observing UFO&apos;s, but it does not make an ounce of sense to us.

Video taped some amazing footage of objects making crazy turns and 90 degree turns. Was traveling to Anchorage and stopped at a pull off to look. Looked up at sun, shielded it with my hand and immediately saw a circular object at very high altitude traveling very fast. It was dark in the center and brilliant around the edge. I watched it about 20 seconds before it &quot;disappeared&quot; from view. Just disappeared. It was heading due north.", "I looked out my window to see a disc shaped object hovering about less than 100 ft. over my house.This happened when I was only 7 but I can picture it like it was yesterday.  On hot nights when I couldn&apos;t sleep I would put my face up against the window that was right next to my top bunk because the window was always cooler.  One night I did this and opened my eyes to see a disc shaped object hovering less than 100 ft. over my house.  It was all lit up in different colors and the lights kept flashing in a pattern.  My parents were sitting on the couch in the next room talking and I called out to them asking them what that thing in the sky with all the lights was. My mom didn&apos;t even look out but called back that it was an advertisement and that someone was having a sale or grand opening.  At the time, being only 7 this made perfect sense to me, but later I realized that from my discription she thought that I was talking about a strobe light.  It was at this time that I realized that that thing that I had seen was not anything the average citizen was familiar with. As I watched this object it slowly and silently started to &quot;drift&quot; in a slightly NW direction towards the Ridge Road viaduct just East of Wicker Park, until it was out of sight from my window.  Years later I was talking with a friend who had lived a few doors away at the time and she described for me the exact same thing even though we had never discussed it before.  She had seen it too.", "i saw a gold orb in the south sky about 30 degrees up the horizon.  It was 1/2 the size the full moon.  it seem to slightly pulsate.  after looking at it through binoculars i went back to bed, it was 2 am.i woke up and saw this bright gold orb through the trees about half the size of a full moon.  It puzzled me because i knew there should not be any thing that bright or that size in the sky at this, time about 2am.  there should not have been any thing even remotely that size there. Jupiter had set and the moon was well west, venus was not up yet.  I looked at my charts the next morning.  I am an authorized investigator for VA MUFON.  as i was looking at it through my binoculars i saw a jet fly behind it!!!  i then figured it must be a light from the nearby power plant and went to bed.  the next day i was some what unsettlted about it, i still knew i saw something that should not have been there but was sure it was something explainable.  after dark i went to the other side of the trees i saw the orb through and expected to see some light that would explain what i saw, but nothing. i have not seen it since.  a couple of days later my wife mentioned having strange vivid dreams that night (she sleeps in another room), i also had some strange vivid dreams that night, and a neighbor mentioned the same thing.  this still bothered me but i decided to forget about it until i saw this page and the mention about all of the orbs sighted during february at various locations. so you can make of it what you will, but let me know if anyone else saw this in my area, i would like to talk to them.", "OBSERVED THREE VERY BRITE LITES FLYING ACCROSS THE NIGHT SKY.I WAS DRIVING ALONG BRUCKNER BLVD.

FAR BEHIND THE AIRCRAFT I SAW THREE VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS  FLYING TOWARDS THE AIRCRAFT AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED EVENTUALLY CATCHING UP TO THE AIRCRAFT AND PASSING IT.  THE THREE LIGHTS WERE STEADY AND DIDN&apos;T BLINK, BUT I OBSERVED THEM SWITCH POSITIONS TWICE. THEY CONTINUED TO FLY ACCROSS THE SKY VERY FAST.

The sky was completely overcast so it was clear the the object was not a star or anything in space. We were watching some fireworks in the distance so many of our eyes were turned skyward.  I don&apos;t have any directions to give you at all but the light in the sky was there for about 10 minutes before it registered with me.  I just thought that it was a super bright star but then after the fireworks stopped it hit me that the sky was completely clouded over and at that time I called it to the attention of my five friends.  Nobody had any idea of what it could be and after about 10 more minutes the object started to slowly move over the city.  Two of us had cameras but my friend with the digital camera had (wouldn&apos;t you believe it, just at this moment, just like in the movies!) technical problems and he was not able to get a shot. I was able to get off a few shots.  I made sure that I got a building in the picture to aid in determining the distance and with luck a low flying airplane flew near the object so I was able to get the object, an airplane, and a building in one shot.  The camera was just a little point and shoot model so the negatives are extremely underexposed.  I don&apos;t know how much use they would be. It really just looks like a light with a dark background. The object moved out of my view after about twenty minutes.  We heard no sounds coming from the object. I was wondering if anybody else reported this.  It must have been seen by a lot of people because it was up there for so long and it was moving so slow. I would love to hear something from you. I can get images to you if you would like them. DC ((e-mail address deleted))", "My wife and I were on the last night of a Western Caribbean cruise aboard the msRyndam. I had put our luggage out in the hall of the ship to be collected as we would be ending our trip the next morning. We departed Key West at 5:00pm and were sailing south going around the end of Florida heading for Fort Lauderdale. I was out on the deck listening to the waves and gazing at the stars when I thought I saw a metorite. Yet, it I thought it was strange that the light appeared on the horizon looking west at the Gulf of Mexico and moved upward into the sky in a 45 degree arc. I payed closer attention thinking it might be a satellite or who knows maybe the space shuttle was up in a mission ( I didn&apos;t really know...but I have seen the shuttle coming in before in the evening sky in my home state of Texas)...anyway this is where is gets strange...as the pinpoint of white light arched across the sky it got larger...it was spherical in shape (about the size of a fingernail at arms length)  and I noticed a color shift to orange. It seemed to emit a hazy glow maybe from heat...then, as it continued to arch across the sky I noticed that it was not flying a straight course but was oscillating rapidly up and down as it continued moving forward...seemed unstable...then it dropped down approx 500 to 1000 feet, hovered for an instant and then did a reverse arch back and above its original course and finally proceeded to the SouthEast at 5 times the speed it was moving before...It just dissapeared.

The DJ said he had recieved calls about a ufo over the town. We could see the light as we got closer to Anacortes. The DJ said he went out to look at it and traffic was stopped to look. We observed it until we had to turn at an intersection. While we were stopped the ufo,right above us, from a dead stop streaked of at ultra high speed.I was stationed at Whidbey Is. Naval Air Station 66-69. I was in a Squadron there in electronics. My friend and I had gone to Bellingham that evening to see our girlfriends. On the way back to base we were listening to an Anacortes radio station and about 20 miles from Anacortes the DJ started having phone calls to the station about a ufo over the town. He joked about it for awhile and then he went out to look for himself. He said everyone was looking at it even the traffic was stopped. So,we bgan to look ourselves. Sure enough we could see a stationary light above Anacortes, since we were heading straight for it. We observed this light for a good 10 minutes. It was the size of a car headlight at 100 yds. Altitude approx. 1000 feet. The night,10 pm, was a rare clear sky for that area. When we were abut 5 miles from Anacortes the road made a T and we came to a stop to turn back to Whidbey. The object was almost directly overhead slightly to the west. We were intently watching it as it seemed to hover there. After only a minute while still stopped the ufo shot straight west out of sight over the horizon. Tremendously fast, it only seemed like a second-literally. It was no jet no helicopter or any other manmade craft that I had ever seen. Never saw another one since.

When they arrived home the father said that he saw a triagle with two orange/red lights and one blue one over the pond, which was just 80 yards away from the house.

In Feb. of 1997, I was in my backyard having a cigarette at approx. 8 p.m. when I glanced toward my neighbors yard, I clearly observed what appeared to be a slightly out of round, yellowish/gold orb &quot;floating&quot; (best way to describe it) below the treetop level of the tree in their yard. I was quite excited about having the experience and refused to yell out to my wife (at the time) for fear of causing anything to disrupt the event.  I would estimate the object to be about15 ft. tall and nearly the same wide but not quite.  It was completely silent, appeared to be smooth in texture with no appendages or apparent windows or doors.  It was not brightly lit but rather more glowed than anything else.  It remained clearly in my sight without motion for 15-20 minutes.  I swear I could hit it with a stone for it was only about 50 ft. from me.  I think it was between 30-50 ft off the ground.  When it did move it was extremely slow and silent.  I observed it for approximately 30 minutes as it sort of drifted southward toward Phoenix, until I could no longer see it. I immediately went inside and told my wife who was more than a little irritated at me for not calling her out. I am an avid believer in the existance of ufo&apos;s.  I am not a flake.

This was seen the previous night in much the same way. This night a very large aircraft was seen circling  the whole valley (25 mile diameter), also above cloud cover which was about 25 % of the sky. This aircraft passed directly over us twice. Several times bright pulsing red lights separated from this aircraft, dropping down and flying away at very high rate of speed, some to the south and to the east. The bright flares continued brighter than Venus, lighting clouds nearby.We have seen these same events over a year ago with more witnesses and closer observation.

On May 26 at 9:28 p.m. I was in my back patio. As I was walking to go back inside, I looked up and saw a boomerang-shaped craft slowing gliding directly overhead. Its shape was that of a 90-degree angle, with very sharply defined, angular features, like 2 long rectangles joined to a point in the front. It had 3 large, white lights on each wing. It was the size of an index finger held arm&apos;s length, slightly smaller. My guess is that it was approximately the elevation small planes fly, traveling about 200-300 mph, and I would say it was somewhat larger than a commercial airliner, maybe twice as large. The lights were very soft looking, not bright or glaring at all. I could just make out the boomerage outline of it against the sky. If it didn&apos;t have lights, I&apos;d never have noticed it. It traveled almost directly overhead going NNW. Then 4 minutes later, to my utter amazement, ANOTHER one flew directly overhead, this one going NW. The second one was identical in every respect except that as it approached, I noticed that it looked asymetrical, with 3 lights on one side and 4 on the other, the last light on the left wing being considerably brighter. As it passed overhead, I saw that that 4th light was actually a separate object flying a short distance off the wingtip at exactly the same speed. As it flew off in the distance, that extra object kept perfect pace and distance with the boomerang. These craft were completely silent. Then, at 9:55, I saw a very bright, silvery white streak of light go across the sky in that same NW direction. I&apos;ve witnessed many meteor showers, and this wasn&apos;t one. The tail looked like light as opposed to a debris tail left by a meteor, and it dissapeared to a single point of light in the distance. On January 2 of this year, I reported another boomerang that flew overhead at this same location, which looked exactly the same except it was traveling much faster and the entire craft was much easier to see because it had a sort of florescent glow outli! ning it.", "a triangular shaped ufo with lights on each side,and a giant white light in the middleSitting on back porch of my house, when I saw this little light in the sky that was moving around in circles.

This light would move irratically and quickly, sometimes in a small circular pattern and sometimes in giggly movements and at other times either upward or to the right or left in graceful sweeping motions. After about 20 minutes I woke up my wife to see if she could see what I saw.  By this time the light moved toward the north west.  As she looked at it she spotted three more of these light to the left of the one I first saw.  These other three formed a triangle.  Within the triangle we could see specks of intense red light moving about. As we continued to watch the first light, we saw off shoots of light that came from it, some shooting upward and others dropping to the surface of the ocean. These off shoots would eventually disappear.  One such off shoot appeared to hover above the surface of the ocean for a couple of seconds, then moved northerly. We watched this for about an hour and a half until our eyes got strained and tired.  We are both college educated professionals.

I am from Secunderabad, India, though I am currently working in Singapore. I went to india on a vacation when my sighting took place. It happend on 19th april, 10:20 pm when me and a friend of mine were hanging out on his terrace. we were just gazing at the stars when suddenly we noticed two objects (disc shaped) with amazing tails fly from south-westernly direction to north-eastern direction. The tails were really really beautiful, unlike any I saw, on comets and stuff. the tail was glowing, light bluish in colour and atlest 8-9 times the size of the object (quite big..in comparision to the objects). they moved pretty fast and in a very parallel route when the second object broke into 3 more (so there were 5 objects now. the original two plus 3 tailing the second object). We were completly mesmerized to do anything...my camera was in my bike below but I just couldn&apos;t take my eyes of those objects. after some time the four objects joined back and now there were only two moving along parallely. they moved in the north-eastern direction for about couple of minutes when they...just vanished. The local daily contacted the local observatory who gave a bull-shit report that it could have been weather balloon. No way man, weather ballons don&apos;t have tails. Neither can they move at such speed. and too parallel. It couldn&apos;t have been comets cos comets dont break up and join back. it would have been in the news if comets were approaching anyway.

We noticed a bright light in the distance - I don&apos;t remember the color - moving oddly in some fashion.  I am not sure what actually caught our attention.  Perhaps the object was moving too slowly or in an unusual flight path.  In any case we wondered what it was and pulled over to watch for a minute.  The second we got out of the truck, the thing changed direction and came directly for us.  It moved slowly, silently and steadily until it passed directly over our heads.  Since we had no perspective for distance against the night sky, I cannot estimate the size or altitude.  It appeared to be as large as 747 and flying at say 1000 feet.  I clearly remember that it looked to be the shape of an eye with a hole in the middle where the iris would be.  I can remember seeing stars right through the middle of the object.  I clearly remember the thing looking to be diamond or eye shaped, however, with so many reports of wishbone or chevron shaped objects, I must admit that my own eye/brain may have filled in detail where no structure existed.  No sound could be heard and it continued to move slowly into the SW until disappering.  It appeared to be black and I think some lights could be seen...but not ordinary aircraft lights. I guess that it had a very bright light shining forward but I am not sure which lights had actually caught our attention.  I am quite convinced that I saw an experimental [stealth] blimp or otherwise operating out of nearby Beale AFB.  Maybe it was a stealth blimp piloted by aliens (-:", "2 boomarangs high and fast over houston on night of lunar full eclipsea few minutes after the moon had finally fully eclipsed, two fast and high moving boomerang or wedged shaped craft made some small turning maneuvers overhead. this was following a deep roaring noise a few seconds ahead of appearing in my view which was sadly slightly limited by a building and garage. after a few minutes a meteorite streaked across the sky and that should have been observed by most moon watchers that night in houston.  my thought at the time was, this was not like the other planes in the sky and if this is a test of ram jet craft, what a dumb night to make a classified flyover, everyone and their dog must be out watching tonight. a local radio station joked about the many sightings and i thought maybe there was something to my sighting after all.  this is not my first sighting and i have also been swooped by scrambled jets from ellington making an illegal night jump in dickinson to fulfill my &apos;d&apos; license, expert license, in skydiving. flares and radar returns tripped the tower.  i was the ufo.  well there goes my credibility, huh.", "A cylinder object was seemingly to hang from the sky until airforce jets started to close in on it. The object turned and left.I was sitting on my backporch with my daughter when I was pointing to an airliner flying over.  My eyes caught unto a cylnder object hanging in the air like a piece of string.  The object was a long cylinder shape, mettallic, and the sun was reflecting off of it which is how it caught my eye.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but when I focused on it closely it was nothing resembling any airplane I ever saw. I watched the object as it slowly rotated to its side and started to move across the sky. Thats when I noticed the airforce jets coming in.  I called my wife and tried to show her the object but she couldnt find the right postition in the sky.  As I was watching the object and showing her the object bent into a boomerang shape and whent in a new direction. The object picked up speed and seemed to compress and was gone. I dont know if it accelerated or just vanished.  About 3 minutes after that my wife and I was discussing it when in that exact same spot smoke started to form and shape into a ring. the ring moved across the sky for a good ways before dissolving. My wife saw that.  From the distance in the sky where the jets and the objects were the smoke ring had to be huge. As I look back on it I would say those jets were chasing the object or at least trying to get to it. And I cant say for sure but for some reason I think if the sun had not been reflecting off of the object it would have been invisible. I say that because it did not look the way it should look when sun is reflecting off of metal it was almost to bright, like if I had a pair of binoculars and could see the cylinder in detail I would have saw myself perfectly in the reflection.", "A large very fast moving craft. It had four bright white lights in a row angled downward. At first the lights looked like there were straight across, but then they looked like they were angled downward. The craft appeared to be spinning.Last night as I was driving up Malvern Ave, entering Hot Springs, I saw appear from my left a very bright object. It was on the Horizon line that is defined by the sky and mountian. There is a radio tower  on the horizon to the left and the Hot Springs Tower to the right up on the Mountain. This is the flight path for planes going to the airport, and I always see planes going up and down between the tower and the radio tower. Also on the mountian above there are cars that drive along the mountian, and sometimes for a few seconds you can see the headlights or tail-lights, and it looks weird if you you don&apos;t know what it is. But this was not a plane or a car. It was twice the size of a plane, and I was a few miles away. If I held up my thumb at arms lenth, my thumbnail was about the same size as what I saw. As the object flew from the radio tower toward Hot Springs tower it flew very fast. It made it in about five seconds. And when it was by the Hot Springs tower, which glows with a few orange window lights, and looks like a UFO at night. It hovered a few seconds and was about the same size as the lights in the windows of the tower. It was a little bit away from the tower, and I could see the four bright window lights twinkling. The craft appeared to be spinning. I have seen simular objects appearing just over the mountians. Once I saw the object and the four lights kind of angled downward. As I looked at it a few seconds, long enough for me to think &quot;I know that&apos;s no plane!&quot; it blinked out.", "OK, I saw a flashing at very high altitude with a faint red light moving with it.I was in my back yard doing weights to keep healthy, and a flashing caught my eye. The moon was not present, neither were than any clouds in the sky. I immediately fixated on the flashing and it continued to flash about every 3 seconds while moving, then a second object caught my eye but was extremely hard to see but it was a red light. The red light was moving with the flashing white light but then did a 180 degrees turn and proceeded back the same way when i first saw it. The flashing stopped and disappeared from my sight, even though it was only visible while flashing, and the red light faded from my eyesight, it was actually hurting my eyes trying to focus but that was it and it lasted about 15 seconds. My opinion is that there was some kind of conflict because it looked as though they were aggressive menouvres by the objects. About 8 minutes after, a sattelite orbited exactly near to where this conflict took place as i kept looking near the area for any more activity. Quite incredible and i felt kind of scared and nervous after seeing such a thing happen, quite scary.", "lights circling around central light!in a cloud, one largish light below and about 10 - 15 lights circling it, the lights were not bright spotlight type lights, but ghostish light - how you imagine a ghost to look! they spun clockwise around the central base light but up into a bowl shape.  the lights were not brilliantly bright, but were like transparent type light circlin! It was pretty scary as there was no explanation of what the lights were, it wasnt a particularly cloudy night, there were clouds in the sky, but this was in a cloud, and there were aeroplanes flying alot higher than this, i couldnt say how high off the ground, but it was definitly in the sky at some height! Im not a crackpot or a ufo freak, but did see something that was definitly unexpaneable! The light was white/greyish type of light!((NUFORC Note:  We have received other, similar reports of this kind of formation of lights, and we do not know what they are.  If they are advertising lights, we are not familiar with this type of formation.  Usually, advertising light in the U. S. are four lights, which rotate around a center point.  Other types we have encountered are either red or green lasers, projected as single, double, or quadruple beams.  Our experience suggests that UFO&apos;s are generally are not visible for the length of time indicated in this report.

No sound apparent.At approximately 10:40 PM on March 22, ((NUFORC NOTE:  Should read March 28)) I observed two bright lights (estimated twice as bright as any of the visible stars.  The lights were travelling almost due west and directly overhead when first observed.  they were elongated in the direction of travel (estimated 3:1 ratio) and were situated one behind the other.  I estimate they were separated by about 4-5 degrees of arc.  They appeared to be flickering rapidly (several times per second).  There also appeared to be a very thin line of smaller or dimmer lights connecting the pair.  This, however, could have been an ionization trail or optical afterimage.  The lights maintained the same relative distance as they moved from overhead to about 45 degrees above the western horizon in approximately 10 or 12 seconds.  The lights then swung in a wide arc to the south and vanished behind a cluster of tall pine trees.  During this &quot;swing&quot;, they appeared to move into a side-by-side orientation, rather than the fore-and-aft arrangement when they were travelling west.  At the point where I lost sight of them, they appeared to be about 30 to 35 degrees above the southwestern horizon.  During the entire episode, there was no sound. Weather conditions in the area were thin scattered clouds (elevation unknown) and little wind.  I believe the objects were below the clouds, as they did not appear to dim when passing one or two of the clouds. My first impression was that these were a pair of Air Force fighters on a night training mission.  However, there was no sign of the normal red and green marker lights, and absolutely no sound.  My wife also observed this phenomenon.  After considerable discussion, I decided to report this to you.((My apologies for the date error in the report I just submitted.

While playing a medieval type re-enactment game, on 4/29/00  Myself and at least 5 others witnessed this event.  I was looking up at the sky waiting for a sword combat to be worked out and I noticed a light high up in the sky. (I used to fly planes and I am currently a student at an accredited aeronautical school).  I first figured it to be a plane due to the close proximity of the sighting location to the Pittsburgh International Airport.  I then however noticed a second light directly behind the first and they were moving the same speed as each other.  I then believed the objects to be in a formation at high altitude.  I then noticed a third light somewhat down and back from the second I noticed.  This formed a sharp triangle formation. (This still could have been military aircraft flying in a formation)  However,  When this triangular formation flew infront of stars, the star was blocked from vision until the object had passed.  This suggested a definite mass in between the lights.  I then began to look at it as a triangle.  These lights could not have been an aircraft, because the formation was spread quite far(suggesting a large object).  Had this been a jet on a very low inbound approach, the jet would have passed over us at about 100 feet and the noise would have been deafening. (So an airplane is ruled out).  The mass blocking the stars suggests that this was not 3 aircraft in a formation at high altitude.  This leaves only one classification: (Unidentified Flying Object).  At least 5 others witnessed this event, one witness in a different location than myself and the others.  I am also sure, that Pittsburgh International Airport must have picked up this event on their radar.  That would be a logical place to start an investigation.", "saucer shaped object intercepted by 2 military jetsI had just got out of my truck in the Sears parking lot when I heard jets very high. You always hear jets in Anchorage, but not real high. I looked up and saw two military jets from Elmendorf Airforce base traveling S.E. at a very high altitude, traveling very close together. Could barley make out jets shape, estimate 50,000 feet. I looked ahead of where they were going and saw a large circular ojbect, shining like a star, motionless in the sky. As the jets approached it they separated. One went left around it, the other went right then came back closer together after they passed it. The object stayed put and didn&apos;t move. The jets continued on S.E. and dissappeared above clouds. Watched object for about 2 minutes more, then it took of at super high speed north, dissappeared in less than 5 seconds. The jets came back but couldn&apos;t find it.", "First noted as a bright star, but when looked at through binoculars it was noted to be green, red and white and spinning like police lights.

It was a a curtain of faint red along the ecliptic from West to east and changed in width.  It did not cover the entire sky, may be 1/5 of the sky..I know this is not a UFO but it was rare for this part of the world..I heard earlier there was a powerful solar flare earlier on Thursday..((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the report describes a display of the aurora borealis, which is very rare at the latitude indicated.  The same phenomenon was reported on the same evening from southern New Jersey.  The writer is correct with regard to a major coronal mass ejection from the Sun earlier on the same day.))", "I was standing outside to smoke just before David Letterman tonight.  I always smoke outside, never inside; but, I do not ever expect to see anything strange.  Barksdale Air Force Base is about three miles south of my house.  Generally, aircraft are flying about here quite frequently.  At 10:28 p.m. there were no planes, and I was thinking only of the show about to start.  I was facing directly East.  There are some street lights in backyards which illuminate trees and yards that surround my yard.  Suddenly to my left, North, I noticed something entering from behind me into my field of vision.  I turned my head to the left, North, to see something about four times the size of an eagle in flight.  It was light or off-white colored.  The shape was that of a large bird or boomerang.  Immediately I thought, it&apos;s not a bird, maybe a big kite.  Although there was no wind, and it was travelling about the same height as the Blue Angels were a week and a half ago when they frequently flew over this same backyard preparing for their two day air show at Barksdale.  My mind quickly returned to the idea of it being a bird, but it was way too big to be a bird.  And, I wanted to see wings flap.  Rather, it just soared without any flapping.  At that time, I started to panic and think UFO because I realized there were absolutely no lights, or sounds associated with it.  I lost vision of it because of a tree line.  Although, after losing sight of it, I did move around in the yard hoping I could spot it, then became fearful and ran inside to tell my son.  It was 10:30 when I was back inside.I saw a light colored boomerang shape soaring across my backyard at 10:28 p.m. on April 28, 2000.  It was completely silent and perhaps 200 feet above me.  There are street lights inside two neighboring yards which illuminated it.  When it first came into my field of vision I was facing East, and saw something approaching from behind me which was West, and to my left, or North.  It seemed at first to be the size of a huge bird, perhaps four times the size of an Eagle&apos;s wingspread.  But, there was no sound of wings flapping.  And, there was only the movement of it travelling straight across from West to East soaring, not flapping wings.  That&apos;s when I relized that it was not a bird.  Of course, when I had initially thought of it perhaps being a bird, I also was thinking it was the biggest bird I had ever seen.  At that time I knew I was losing sight of it because it was approach a tree line which I knew would obscure it from my sight.  I quickly moved around the yard to try to catch another sight of it, but did not.  I knew that because there were absolutely no lights, nor sound, that it might have been a UFO.  I rushed inside to tell my son, and saw that it was then 10:30 p.m.  I estimate that I was looking at it soaring past me for about eight seconds, no less than five, and no more than ten seconds.  I am about to return to the yard to smoke again, and hope I get to see this once again, but I rather doubt that I will.  Silent, no lights, boomerang shape.  I only could view the underside of it from my vantage point.  Thank you.", "My friend and I were driving home when we saw an orange light in the sky. When we stopped the truck to look at it we saw that it was moving at the pace of a normal airplane. As we watched we saw a light come off of it, if the object was a millimeter in size the light that came off of it was about 4 to 5 millimeters. In the light that came off, there was a series of blinking lights inside the light. The light with the blinking lights in it lasted about 10 seconds both times it happened. The object made a strange sound. It kind of sounded like an electric engine. I know that it was the object making the sound because there were no other airplanes around. We wathched the light start to slow down almost to a stop then it disappered.My friend and I were driving home around 1:30am when I saw a bright orange light in the the sky. From my town we can see airplanes that are approaching Burbank Airport, so we see a lot of airplane activity. The object caught my eye because it did&apos;nt look like any of the airplanes I&apos;ve seen fly by. It did&apos;nt have any of the blinking safty lights that the other planes have. I pulled my truck over to get a better look. When I got out I noticed the object flew about the same speed as the airplanes we see. As we watched the object a beam of light came off of it. Within the light, there were a row of blinking lights that we could not see before. If the object was a millimeter in size the light that came off was about 4-5 millimeters in length. This happened twice. Each time it lasted about 10 seconds. We jumped back into my truck to move becuase we were parked under a street light we wanted to go to a darker place to get a better look. We drove to my friends house which was about 100 yards away from the spot where we first saw it. When we got out of the truck we noticed the object made a strange electrical type sound. I know it was the object making the sound beacuse there were no other aircraft around. As we watched the object we noticed it started to slow down to a very slow speed. Right when it seemed like the object was going to come to a stop it disappered. I called the local police and the airport to see if any one else reported it. Each said no.", "driving down road looked out window and saw bright orange light,? looked like the back lights to a car did not blink or no noise.I was driving my girlfriends car down Harision Ave. in Rockford IL. at about 7:00 at night and saw a bright Orange light in the Sky it was gowing north east to south west.

When I tried to leave, it lifted my truck up about 5 or 6 feet, then let it drop.

I had been driving for about an hour and a half (I know this because the CD I was listening to takes about that long to play, and it was just about ending) when I saw this huge black mass blotting out the sky! It had know real shape, except for what looked like a point at the front (at least I think it was the front!) It had little lights on the underside of it that kind of made it look like part of the starry sky, but you could still see the craft, because lights coming from the Mts. and other surroundings vaguely showed its sillouette. The object made no sound. I stopped and shut down the truck, hoping this craft(?) wouldn&apos;t see me, but it did. It flew then stopped right over me. I got in the truck and turned the key, hoping it wouldn&apos;t turn into some bad horror movie, where the car NEVER starts! But it did! However, the truck wasn&apos;t moving. I realized that the truck was in the air about 5 or 6 feet. I was going to jump, but then the truck came crashing down. I rolled off  to the side, realizing that if I had jumped when I did, I would have been crushed. I sped away. I was amazed and really happy that my truck survived the fall. I drove to Carlin, NV, and spent the night there. The next day I checked out my truck, and I only broke some bushings, a front brake caliper, and the 2 back brake drums.

When we approached the Mercury Blvd. overpass on I-64N. I noticed a craft off to the left. I thought it was a pair of fighter craft in close formation as we were near the flight path of Langley Airforce base and sometimes two jets on approach blend into a strange shape. It became apparent that the object was not jets and not as far away as I first thought and it was a singular object, rather oblong and cylindrical or boxy with a smaller boxy protrusion about midway down the length off to our right. It was hard to determine how fast it was going as we were in a moving car, but it appeared to be floating as a balloon would. I would estimate the object was approximately 30-40 feet long and between 6-10 tall. It appeared to be dark gray and there were no lights on it at all that we could see. We were probably about 500 yards away at closest approach and it appeared to be about 100-150 feet up in the air.

One summer night a couple of friends and myself were attending a get together of local singers and guitar players in that old building. Suddenly, a couple of guys came in and said that there were some strange lights to the west. We all trooped outside and sure enough, there over Springdale was a huge formation of red lights forming a geometric pattern. These lights seemed to be going in and out of each other in triangular patterns. We jumped into my car and sped northwest toward Springdale to get a closer look. After traveling about a 1/4 mile down the road we noticed that the lights were now moving slowly south toward Fayetteville. I pulled over to turn my car around and got stuck in the ditch. So we watched as this strange procession slowly dissapeared in the haze of Fayetteville&apos;s lights.I was about 16 and this is one of two sightings I had in Arkansas. I will relate my other sighting over Marble Ar. in another box.", "I was outside, it was partially overcast. Object passed over me from west to east, first saw the object straight above me. Object sped over me to about 45 degrees towards the east. Then the object performed a perfect right angle turn to the south and sped out of sight.At around 10:20 p.m. April 22, 2000, I was outside my home looking at the stars. It was mostly overcast, but I could see some stars. As I was looking at the Big Dipper constellation, I noticed a light streaking overhead. This object was bright enough to shine through the cloud cover. In less then 10 seconds the object flew over my head to about 45 degrees in the east, then performed a perferct right angle turn to the south. This object was a round fireball, bright red in color. The speed of this thing was incredible, making me believe it was a meteor. I would still believe this if I had not seen the right angle turn. I am a 31 year old factory worker.", "((NUFORC Note:  This report seems strongly suggestive of the new four-light, rotating advertising lights.  We have proposed this possibility to the witness, and are awaiting a response.  This type of advertising light, somewhat new in the U. S. market, may be new to the Asian market.  It has caused many reports from the U. S., as well.))4 oval white lights circulating in the night sky.I did not see how it began. My wife alerted me and others to see some moving lights in the sky while all of us were at my house balcony. 4 oval lights were seen circulating in a constant circle, each of the light would travel a quarter of the circle and all the 4 of them would merge together with one another (overlapping) at the center of the circle (circular path). It was just a moment after they merge that they dispersed and circulated again. They took about 2 seconds to complete one  cycle. I took serveral photos of the sighting using a normal camera, but i am not sure whether the lights could be seen upon development of the film. The lights were oval in shape and white in colour. It seemed like someone have used a very powerful spotlight to shine it into the sky, but there was no beam/spectrum from the source of the light. The sky and the moon was covered with some clouds. The lights were not flying in the clear sky. They seemed to be flying among the cloud. It was about 15 minutes later where they disappeared. All the 4 lights have merged together before flying away from  us. Their flying away was fater than the speed of lighting. In the midst of our observation, i have noticed a plane flying past the phenomenon. I will email the images upon development of them.", "We had seen a Bright light in the sky just NW of Waseca Mn,We had noticed a very bright light in the NW part of the sky,after we had droped a friend off at there farmhouse we thought the light might hav moved when we reached the end of the drivway it had not moved we sat at the end of the driveway for about 20min to watch the light, my friend and I where looking at it he said he saw it &quot;swaying slightly&quot; when I was looking at it I saw it change colors white,red,blue,changing patterns at randome always starting with white and ending with white.

It was there for approximately three minutes.If you are looking for a close sighting with lots of witnesses, this is a classic case. I&apos;ve never seen it discussed before. When I was in Preflight for pilot and observer training in 1953 on Lackland AFB, about three weeks before we went home for Xmas leave, about 500 underclassmen and a few upperclassmen were standing at attention for reveille just after 0400 hours. As officer candidates, when we stood at attention we were not even allowed to move our eyeballs (gaze). Suddenly I heard an upperclassman yell: &quot;Underclassmen may gaze.&quot; I looked to my left and directly across the narrow street was a small one bedroom house, perhaps used for some kind of communications. Hovering directly over the house, about ten or twenty feet above it, was a very clear view of what I could only describe as a flying saucer. It was the shape of two saucers placed face to face with a &quot;gondola&quot; type protrusion below. The gondola had lines of light around it, as if it had a series of portholes but was spinning. There was no actual heat or sound, but thinking about it later, there seemed to be a sensation of heat and sound, as if it were just out of the range of our senses. We watched the saucer for a full two or three minutes, it seemed much longer. It was good long uninterrupted look. We had the distinct impression that it was watching us. Suddenly one of the upperclassmen started across the street toward the house, which scared me, and then the saucer moved from that spot to out of sight over the horizon, soundlessly and rapidly. It was probably out of sight in a half second or a second. We could see a blurry line of light while it was passing. When we got back to the barracks, always pressed for time, we had little time to discuss it, but we did briefly discuss it amongst ourselves. By that afternoon or the next day, I&apos;m not sure which, we were told the upperclassmen had reported the incident. They were told that we were mistaken -- that it was not a UFO -- but also that it was to be considered confidential. Therefore, being on a strictly operating honor system, none of us discussed it after that to my knowledge. It would have meant we washed out. And if someone else mentioned it to us and we didn&apos;t report it immediately, it would also have meant we washed out. So I simply formed a habit of not talking about it, and I never told anyone till perhaps thirty  years later. When I was on my way home for Xmas, a man came up to me on the train and asked what the epaulets on my uniform meant. I joked about it meaning I was secret service. He started a conversation with me and eventually began to tell me about the time he&apos;d seen a flying saucer. He kept asking me if I&apos;d ever seen one, and I insisted I hadn&apos;t. I didn&apos;t think much about that till I got back to base after Xmas. Then some of the cadets from our bay in the barracks never showed up after the leave. I can&apos;t remember how many. Maybe two, maybe five out of a bay of 25. Someone said they had washed out on a security violation. Later when five of us were talking, though tiptoeing around without actually ever mentioning the saucer incident, we all remembered being approached by someone who wanted to talk about flying saucers. One said he was approached in a bar by someone who kept asking him if he&apos;d ever seen a UFO. Because I haven&apos;t kept track of anyone from from that class, I&apos;ve never discussed this with any of them. If I could find some of them, I&apos;d really like to talk to them and see if they remember it the way I do. If you wanted to investigate it, it would be easy. It was the J-54 class. Started preflight in 1953, scheduled to graduate 12 months later in 54. Right during the Tony the Tiger program. There was a write up in Look magazine about that class that showed one picture of the whole group about that time. The questions at the bottom of this page are too simplistic for me to answer. For instance, as I mentioned, there was no sound, but there was an impression of sound. There was no real aura or haze, but there was a slight glow because it was somewhat luminous.", "Bluish white lights in the southeast at high altitude.First noticed stationary bluish white lights in daytime sky. Weather condictions were clear sky with haze. Objects viewed through 40 power telescope. Objects viewed through to telescope appeared to be circular in shape. One object seemed to appear coming from behind from other object. Viewing through telescope revealed  two objects at a lower altitude and five or six dim points of blue light at extremely high altitude. Objects disappeared from sight.", "2 large orange spheres- one slightly behind the other- travelling extremely fast above cloud layer.I was in my back garden along with my brother and a friend and I happened to glance up at the sky.  I then saw two large spheres of orange light, one slightly behind the other, moving from south to north and traversing the entire sky in approx. 10 - 15 seconds.  This sighting was backed up three days later by a news cutting stating how local witnesses had seen two huge orange spheres hovering over houses and pit tops in a local village and then shooting off rapidly. I&apos;ve kept the cutting.", "Slow moving large red spherical object moving in a upward direction over the town. The object then split into two seperate objects and each one went a different direction at a high rate of speed.In the spring of 1968, I was standing in my front yard with a few of my relatives. I was looking to the south over the town of Delta, CO (western Colorado) and saw a very large object that seemed to be moving away from me and slowly rising. The object was spherical and bright red, it also seemed to have a glow about it. After watching this object for approx. 15-20 seconds it suddenly split into two seperate objects.  Both objects took off at a very high rate of speed, with one moving in a horizontal western direction and the other moving in an upward southeast direction.  They both were moving at such a great speed that they were out of vision in just a few seconds. This happened over thirty years ago and is not a fantastic sighting, but I am curious if there is anybody out there who might have been in the area during this time and witnessed anything like this.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

More from Little Rock.Last Thursday night march 9th around 10 pm two of my friends saw a huge portion of the sky north of little rock light up for 5 seconds. From their perspective this is the description I was given. Looking north from the most northeast side of one of the tallest hills in North Little Rock, In clear view of the city lights to the south over downtown and the dark sky to the north, as well as the entire eastern skyline (mostly the lights of NLR). It was a partly cloudy comfortable evening, the northern night sky lit up like a fireball. There was no streak from the sky, it looked more like a tremendous explosion which lasted for almost 5 seconds. They went on and on about how they were actually able to stand there watching the tremendous north lights and talk about it at the same time. Both kept asking the other &quot;do you see that, look at that!&quot; and was able to ask each other that question 3 times each while the light stayed illunminated. Niether of my friends, whom both are intelligent people, would make up such a story. I have sat with one of them in his backyard on the Arkansas River on meteor storm evenings and watched meteors with him. He would have identified the light as a meteor if he thought it was one. That night at 11:00pm i met up with them both and they shared the story with me. It dominated the conversation for the next 20 minutes. They left approx 11:30 and I remained on the back porch of my friends house looking from the same perspective. Around 11:50pm, right before the art bell show so the time is approx, I heard a boom noise, almost like an explosion sound, come from the southeast. Turning around I saw what appeared to be a mushroom cloud come from the south. To be honest I was scared to death and quite shaken, not quite sure what i saw. I ended up staying up to 2am listening to art bell wondering if the local radio would report anything. I went to sleep and learned about the fire the next day. All 3 of us have seen the local TV coverage of the fire south of little rock. The local talk radio shows on Art&apos;s affiliate here in Little Rock have mentioned the fire. Details however are very limited. I do know however that the area of the large fire had camera crews on the seen either 1 or 2 days later, because i saw it on TV.  The scanner reports apparently is what makes this case interesting. I have heard 2 local media personalities talk about what the people on the scene said. However niether of the media guys mentioned any specifics. Good luck with this, hope others can confirm what I saw. Please only contact me through email and do not release my information to anyone.

Unusually, the sky was very clear above Ljubljana so I just gazed at the stars. I saw a rectangle shape flying thru the sky. It had no lights, nor did it make a sound. It seemed close (I tought it was around 200-300 metres, but no one can tell actually). It zoomed thru the sky faster than a plane but slow enough so that I could see it for 7-10sec.

In the sky, very low, was  a diamond shaped object completely covered with smaller white lights. This object would have been slightly larger than a full moon. It was very overcast, but no rain. There were many cars pulled off the road viewing this object. I and a friend left after 10 minutes of viewing this object. There must be others that have reported this, because it was just too obvious. No Noise what so ever!", "Was observing thru telescope for casual astronomy. Looked up in the sky to find a target star in Ursa Major when I saw due East at around 1,000 feet a sauces shaped object hovering abnd bobbing gracefully in the sky.I am an Amateur Astronomer and on Saturday night 5/29/00 (sic),  it was the first clear night in a while over the New York area. I was trying out my new 150mm refactor telescope and I was searching for star clusters near Ursa Major. I started to set up the scope at 9 P.M., and I aligned the scope to Polaris, and was setting up the tripod for 1/2 hour at the most. I decided to search for M13 in Hercules, but it was straight overhead at R.A 16hours, and I decided not to bother since the scope would be inproperly positioned for a decent view. (Too low to the ground on a small tripod.) The time was approximately 9:30 P.M. I then decided to search for M51 in Canes Venitaci when the neighbor turned on the garage light and I waited for the light to turn off. I went into the house at this time to get a cup of coffee and proceeded to got back out to the yard after the garage light went out. I started to view in the scope at a 45 degree angle due East. After searching around a bit I saw a white rotating streak in the field of view which was spiraling but figured it was a meteor falling to Earth. No problem, a typical event to see as an Amateur astronomer. After that I pointed the scope at the Star, I believe it was Altair or Arcturus. Not sure cause I didn&apos;t have the map with me. Anyway, I decided to focus the scope on the Star to see how much cromatic distortion the scope had. After all that, I decided to stop viewing. When I got off my chair and stood up, I looked at the sky for incoming clouds and saw some coming from the West. When I turned around to the East, I saw an object, rather large hovering and moving East. The object looked disc like but it was a dark shaded craft, black/dark gray. It had 4 lights, 2 red horizontal lights pointing North/South, and the other 2 lights were green pointed East / West (toward me). The lights were mounted at exact opposites to each other. The object was rather low, around 1,000 feet and was the size of a plane. The lights did NOT blink, and the craft or object made absolutely N! O NOISE. The object was hovering but moving slowly toward the East in a bobbing up and down fashion. There were 2 slow bobbing actions while it was in  my view. It did that twice, while moving East and then it slowly moved East to the horizon and over the neighbors tree and out of my viewing sight. This sighting occurred at the 10:30 P.M. time frame. I saw it for around 10-15 seconds. I immediately went into the house to tell my relative (mother) what I had saw. The time was checked at 10:34 P.M. I was not abducted cause I had a strict account of the time. I started setting up the scope at 9:00 P.M. and I was out there for around 1.5 hours. I did not wear a watch. I used the kitchen clock for all time references. Though I live near an airport, all the planes move from South to North, and North to South always. There was never a plane moving in the West to East direction here and I &apos;ve been living here since 1969. The only aircraft were helicopters, but they make lots of noise when they come over here. THe object seemed to have appeared suddenly cause I didn&apos;t notice it come over my head from the West.((NUFORC Note:  The witness has indicated that the event occurred on 29MY00.

In the middle of our conversation my friend said loudly and kind of in surprise &quot;look&quot;!! I looked around and didnt get it and said &quot;what,what&quot;? He grabbed my head and pointed me to the southeast and up. We both just shut up and watched then. What we saw looked like a very large ,softly glowing boomerang. It approached fairly slowly and looked to be only about 100 or so feet up. one thing that seemed strange to me was that it flew absolutey perfectly level and straight. It had no lights or sound whatsoever. The whole body of it had a very soft glow like one of those lightsticks only a bit softer and white not green. It seemed to trail a vapor or mist off of its entire rear edge. It flew almost directly overhead and i noticed it blocked out the stars as it went by. Because of its low light and it being night i couldnt say for sure but it was large. Maybe 200 or so feet from one end to the other. We watched it go by overhead and kept watching until it eventually flew beyond our site. Afterward we both kept asking eachother what the hell was it and it became obvious to both of us we didnt have a clue. I remember being quite excited and we both mentioned it to several people together just so we wouldnt get laughed at as bad . A few people told us that about at the same time the tv reception in the nieghborhood had gone out briefly. My friend and i were only teenagers at the time. neither of us are kooks or attention seekers or whatever. im posting this only because someone else may have seen something similar and it might be of help. Also right after it passed we noticed a very large amount of air traffic . Some of it seemed to circle or crisscross the area. Some headed in the same direction this thing went. We left shortly after.", "What at first appeared to be stars, were not.  The UFO&apos;s (numbering at least 75 in number) had definitive patterns and actions.Approx. 2am, my 19 year old daughter came running anxiously in to the house to tell me about 5 *crafts* that she originally thought were stars, until she watched them closely and they began to move; moving in a V pattern, until they stopped overhead (at a very high level). (My daughter is taking an Astronomy class in college this year, and is interested in &quot;space&quot;.)  I frankly didn&apos;t think a great deal about what she had told me, thinking they were probably planes from Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton, until I felt I should go take a look for myself; at which point I witnessed one of the most amazing unexplained events I&apos;ve ever seen.  From North/Northeast to South/Southwest, the *lights* came, one after the other.  At times, the *lights* were in a V pattern (mostly consisting of 3 *lights* ~ sometimes 5).  The V pattern *lights* were mostly in the middle of the huge number of *lights*, while the outside edges of the majority of the *lights* were lined with patterns of 2 *lights* ~ one closing following another, or running parallel to each other. At times, the outside *lights* appeared to be moving exceptionally rapidly, as though chasing one another; but could and did come to a complete halt at times, in mid-movement.  The *lights* appeared to be quite high in altitude, although at times, we could see them move through the clouds, as a small airplane would do if flying at a lower level.  Time and time again, 10 to 20  *lights* would move in this southerly fashion from the north, and stop directly overhead (over our home ~ my neck is still somewhat stiff from leaning my head back to watch them.  I saw a UFO once before, up close and personal, during the daylight hours on the campus of the Univ. of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky, in 1973, which I have never forgotten, nor have seen anything like it since: immense cigar-shaped craft with 4 huge square windows of brightly colored flashing lights).  Anyway, then as now, I never in my life witnessed anything like what my daughter, my husband and I saw several nights! ago.  T hese *lights* could stop~completely at rest; other times they would *flash* a pale sea green color; at times, they&apos;d flash and disappear, only to flash again in a few seconds (appeared as communication between 2 craft); there were 2 much larger *lights* which flashed different colors so swiftly (blue, green red) and they could turn very quickly (a 90 degree turn on a dime, so to speak).  These *lights* just kept coming and coming over a 2 or so hour period...unreal.  At one point, next to a group of 2 V shaped patterned lights, there appeared, as if through a cloud, a much larger object (possibly cylindrical?) ~ on which I could not make out a distinct pattern...flashing all colored lights at once ~ a mix of lights, not specific light colors at separate times.  There wasn&apos;t any noise from these *lights*...completely silent.  My husband witnessed these *lights*, and this man does NOT believe in easily in anything out of the ordinary.  About these lights, he merely states &quot;I&apos;m not sure what I saw.&quot;  This is the first time my daughter has ever witnessed anything like this, and when she first told me about what she had witnessed outdoors, she was startled and scared.  After I went outdoors with her, she was exhilarated, and her fear calmed.  Since my experience in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1973, I have never had any fear of UFO&apos;s.  Note:  My daughter and I checked a constellation map for February evenings, and these *lights* were in the area of what we believe to be the Orion Constellation ~ flying directly under it, and on either side of it.", "Saw a bright hovering light near the Transco Tower.I noticed a large bright shimmering light near the Transco Tower, as we watched it appeared to hover for 4-5 minutes, it then proceeded to move to my right, bank and come straight for our building. Once it got very close and made another right bank, we could see the underside through our window at the 1 o&apos;clock position. We then could see it was a very large triangle. It was huge. What struck us as odd, was how it was just sitting there, and moved so slow in it&apos;s bank but was so large. It had four white lights one on each point and one in the middle, it had two smaller lights one red and one white on each side of the middle white light. Was also is odd it is passed very close to our building, and we didn&apos;t hear a rumble or anything. (Later a plane passed overhead and we could hear it clearly) Something of that size should have made a large rumble, especially banking as much as it was.

This object hit the earth. After hearing Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast 5-9-00 I am not so sure it was meteorite.Myself, my brother and two other teens at the time were hanging out in my parents front yard. I was looking accross the flat land east of my parents home when low on the horizon i saw what at first glace was children shooting a Roman Candle. Within less than a second a realized the ball of fire was too large to be a Roman Candle firework. (plus i thought it was strange that the children at my neighbors would be shooting fireworks at this time of the year. The ball of fire was low on the horizon and moving from east to west. It was not moving at a large rate of speed. It looked sort of how a jumbo jet seems to float when it passes close over head. The object continued to move from east to west and flew almost directly overhead. It looked to be aproximately 300 feet over us. It was a ball of fire approximately 3 to 4 feet in diameter. It passed so close we could easily hear the sizzling of the fire. The object was yellowish orange in color. Just prior to passing overhead the object broke into two pieces. The larger continuing along the same trajectory, but the smaller one still traveling horizontally began a sharp decent. The smaller object appeared to have fallen appx. an eighth of a mile west of my parents house. My friends and i scouted the area on bicycles knowing the object would have to be smoking or burning. We found no sign of the object. We were certain it hit the Earth. The next day on the school bus to school we were telling the story, when we noticed a group of kids began to crowd around the back of the bus. I went to see what could be more interesting than my story. Two friends of mine were out in a boat ( the Mermentau River runs just behind my parents house) running fish or crab lines, when the ball of fire fell from the sky hitting so close to thier boat that it actually splashed water on them. The object is still on the bottom of the Mermentau River, All witnesses are still alive. And with the right metal detectors could most likely still be recovered.", "3 Objects traversing the sky, burning out eventuallyI was looking roughly to north and noticed 3 bright yellow lights in the sky about 35 degrees above the horizon altitude unknown.  They moving one behind the other approximately from the north to the south at about the same speed as a high altitude jet liner would be moving.  With my arm extended straight out, each object was two hand widths from the next in a single file.  When they reached the highest point above the horizon, about 75 degrees, the middle light went out.  As it went out, smaller bright yellow pieces fell off.  They looked to be burning.  These pieces went out after a few seconds.  As the remaining two objects approached about 45 degree off the southern horizon, each burned out within about 10 seconds of each other.  They also dropped pieces that were lit for about 2-3 seconds.  This is all I saw. My first guess was some kind of missle.  What is strange is that they were moving north to south.  I am not aware of any missle ranges north of Sacramento.  Also, if they were dropping debris, it is likely that some might fall onto a city.  Beale AFB is close by.  Perhaps they were testing something.  About 2 years ago, I saw something similar occur over my house, but the direction was south to north.

These were very different from typical tower, aircraft or other lights I am use to seeing. They were also not the typical color of military flares that are claimed to have caused the &quot;Phoenix Lights.&quot; After seeing them every night for about a week they disappeared. I still check every night hoping I can catch them again and get some neighbors as witnesses.

Our interest was first piqued by the witness, who reported that 1) headlights on nearby vehicles may have failed for a few seconds, and 2) a nearby maroon colored van seemed to have disappeared from her sight during the flash.   These preliminary impressions on the part of the witness apparently did not bear out under investigation. John Kirby and Skip Schultz, State Director, can be reached over the internet, or through NUFORC.))[This is being written by MUFON investigator, John Kirby, section director, Multnomah County, Oregon] Witness was stopped at a traffic light at the corner of 72nd and Woodstock in Portland.  While waiting for the light to change, there was a brilliant flash &quot;for just a few milliseconds&quot; in front of her vehicle and up about 10 feet in the air (very approximate height).  When the flash occurred, power went out in the area -- the traffic light went off, street lights went off, and lights in a tavern at the intersection went off. Her car continued to operate and so did a car across the intersection (that car turned left just after the incident).  The witness was &quot;temporarily blinded&quot; by the brightness of the flash and said that things looked dark all around (presumably / possibly) by her eyes&apos; reaction to the light. The power came back on in just 1-2 seconds both at the traffic light and at the nearby structures.  Street lamps did not come back on. None of the other drivers (there were at least two other cars nearby) seemed to react unusually (they continued to drive on when the light changed).  Nobody got out of their car to look, etc. Investigator&apos;s opinion: This is consistent with an electrical arc (short circuit, fault) on a power line near / above the intersection.  When this occurred, presumably a circuit breaker opened (cut off the power) to the area.  Usually circuit breakers used in power systems are configured to reset after a few seconds, and if the short circuit is cleared, the power will come back on and stay on.  I have been told by members of the power company that small animals or birds sometime straddle power lines causing a temporary short circuit. The animals are unfortunately killed or seriously injured in the process, and are knocked free of the wires by the explosion.  Therefore the short circuit is &quot;cleared&quot; immediately and the power is restored in a few seconds.  This could also be caused by debris falling on wires and temporarily shorting the line. I did not go out to look at the wires to see if there is an obvious place where short circuits might occur, but I may do that in the coming few days. Note that the reason why the street lights did not come back on immediately is likely due to the fact that lights commonly used by cities, such as mercury vapor lamps, if the power is cut off for even just a moment, will take a few minutes to restart. When this explanation was proposed to the witness, she said that it made sense to her.", "shaped like a tear drop but upside down i.e point down, seen through cloud cover, movment slow but erratic, someone a little further up the valley took approx 4 photos, then slowly grew fianter until gone", "Heard loud low flying jet or aircraft pass over me.

Please see other reports of same incident.)) &quot;On August 25, 1995, at approximately 12:40 am, my wife and I were driving Westbound on Route 17 in New York State.  As we neared exit 107, near monticello (at the top of a Mountain), I saw a large bright object streak across the sky at about a 15 degree inclination to the horizon.  I first saw the object in my right side of vision and I followed it until it passed over the horizon on my left side of vision.  The object took about 4 seconds to traverse this entire distance. The object appeared to move at a constant velocity without acceleration.  The object was emanating bright light of a strange blue-green tint.  It was not as bright as a car&apos;s headlights.  The object appeared to have a precise circular cross section.  (I was struck by, and focused on, the object&apos;s precise edges.) The object did not trail a plume or any other meteor-like scatter.  The object was dark at the top and near the center, and I could discern various precise geometric structures in these darker area, as if they were mechanical or machine-like.  The object displaced abou 1/2 steradian, equivalent to that displaced by the moon:  therefore, the object appeared to be the size of the moon.  I believe the object was quite distant from me.  Just before the object reached the left-hand horizon, it emitted what we physicists call an S-wave.  That is, a spherical &quot;bubble of light&quot; emanated from the object.  This spherical &quot;bubble of light&quot; obviously was not travelling at the velocity of light, but it was moving very fast, possibly faster than the velocity of sound.  I talked to several knowledgeable physicists about this phenomenon, and so far, nobody was able to give an adequate explanation.

Mexico.", "I saw an object that seemed to Break the laws of aerodynamics and Physics.  I have also included my first sighting in great detail.At first I thought it was a plane because of the two bright head lights as it moved Northwest; however, it made an slow, short turn north-bound.  It seemed to move slow north until it stoped.   There were three colors of lights on base of the object.  Two green lights, two red lights and one larger pulsating light at the center. The two green lights were perpendicular with the two red lights.  I was driving down Clemens center parkway when I noticed the craft turning north bound while slowing down.  It was on my left hand side about 40 feet in the air.  It seemed to descend sightly. Then it stopped in mid air!  It made no sound!  I expected to hear helocopter or hovercraft engines, but I heard nothing!  Even as I stopped at the light, still heard nothing. There were other small lights on the rim that gave it a disk-like shape.   The wind was blowing quite hard from the North and yet it remained so still.  You might have thought it was secured by a long tower base.  It  reminded me the of the CN Tower in Toronto, CANADA.  I was intrigued how it seemed to break the laws of physics.  After I had stopped the car at the light, the object began to move again northward.  I wanted to turn left down fifth Street to follow it but the traffic light caught me. A police car was in the lane perpendicular to my lane so it did not behoove me to make a U-turn on yellow.  Not realizing that there also was a police car behind me I backed my car up slightly since I just had missed the yellow light and tried to back my car up from the intersection.  The Officer honked to make his presence known.  As a result, I was unable to track down the object.  As I hopelessly tried to quickly get on to Clemens center pkwy North-bound, I realized that I lost track of this stange phemnomena. This was my second sighting. My first sighting was an Iron-shaped object with a small pulsating blue light at tail tip of this a the top rear of the object.  As I traveled down hoffman street in Elmira, October 1993 at 8:30 PM on a thursday, as my father and I were driving to Geroulds Pharmacy.  I noticed the two bright heads lights from the distance.  The object seemed to ascend from a distance as it appeared to come over a hill.  As we were driving south bound I marverled at how slow this object seemed as it moved towards our car.  Normally a plane would be faster.  After parking in back of the westside Geroulds pharmacy my father went into the store to pickup his perscriptions.  I got out of the Car to see this slow moving object pass by.  The base of the object was trianglar and so metalic and shining that it reflected the Orange lights at the southern tier pedictric heath center.  There was also a blue light at the two rear bottom corners of the object.  There were no indentations where wheels might be dislodged, it was a completely flat mirror-like base.  I&apos;d say the vehihcle was about 7-feet long with small dark window sand moved no more than 15 miles per hour.  This area was very well lite and I cound see every detail of this object.  Another stricking feature of this object was that it had no wings.  It was a dark gray color and gave off no emmissions.  It literally looked like a flying iron without a handle.  It flew just above the trees. It also made no sound.  I pinched myself, and moved to different areas of the street to hear an echo of sound that might be ricorchete from buildings, yet I heard no sound at all.  This craft was heading north-bound as I headed south. I have always been skeptical about UFO sightings.  However, I have come to appreciate organizations who are familiar with this phenomenna.  Now I do believe people who see these things are not inviting delusions.  When I see airplanes, there some instances where they appear like flying saucers from certain angles.  I was expecting a plane or helocopter, but saw objects that seemed to break the laws of aerodynamics.  Nor did these objects resemble anything that I have ever seen.

But where the left light had been was nothing.We live about 12 miles west of the municipal airport, so we see a lot of air traffic.  A lot of the planes that I see flying over from east to west are displaying their bright white spotlights, and then it seems like once they reach altitude their spotlight goes out and then you see their blinking &quot;running lights&quot;; it&apos;s pretty obvious that it&apos;s a plane.  Something in the sky caught my attention in the early evening a few weeks ago, and I looked up and saw a pair of very bright white lights, coming from the east and moving together to the west.  There was a short distance between them and I felt sure that I was looking at two separate objects.  My first impression was that I was looking at 2 commercial jet airliners moving together, side by side with their spotlights on.  Their speed was not unlike other planes I see flying in the area; however, I don&apos;t often see 2 planes flying side by side like this.  So I continued to watch them.  When the 2 lights were almost overhead, the light on the left turned off ; like a big stadium light when it&apos;s turned off, it sort of faded out.  I expected then to see the blinking running lights turn on, but they didn&apos;t.  In fact, I didn&apos;t see any structure or lights in that space at all.  The bright light on the right continued on about 5 more seconds, and then it went out and the running lights came on.  There was enough daylight for me to see that where the light on the right had been was a plane.  But where the left light had been was nothing.  It was like this thing on the left was flying with the plane and then just disappeared.  There were no other planes nearby.  I was puzzled and wondered where the &apos;thing on the left&apos; went, but I figured there must have been something there that I missed.

Saw similar event on 12/31/99 - three lights at that time.My boyfriend was leaving for work around 5:30 in the morning and called up to me from the apartment parking lot.  As I ran down the stairs, he was looking up at the sky, muttering &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;  A glowing orange light was hovering above us, much lower to the ground than any kind of aircraft.  He said it came from the eastern horizon, and by the time I got downstairs it was heading west.  At one point it actually appeared to slow down as it went over us.  We stared at it for approximately 5 minutes before he left for work.  I remained outside for another 5 minutes or so as it continued moving west over our apartment complex.  I left the house about 6:00 a.m., and it was still visible.  It began leaving a &quot;trail of light&quot; for lack of a better term.  It&apos;s like it was about to fizzle out, but never did. He and I and a few others experienced the same lights on 12/31/99.  There were three of them at that time.  I dismissed the event since there were quite a few fireworks in the area.

He told me to look outside.   We were both about 10 miles from downtown Vancouver and could easily see above and beyond it.   What we both saw was seemed to appear like a classic &apos;disc&apos; shaped object.   The object appeared to be grey and just seemed to hover over the city.  Although it could have been farther over the water, we couldn&apos;t tell.  We watched it for about 5 minutes as it slowly made it&apos;s way from south to north.    Then without warning, just seemed to disapear.   To this day we tell people about it and have no doubt in our mind it wasn&apos;t a balloon or plane of any kind we&apos;ve seen before.   Unfortunetly, neither of us had the opportunity to capture the sighting on camera.   Which makes our sighting probably one of thousands you recieve.The &apos;disc&apos; as mentioned, was grey. It was stationary when we 1st saw it.  Then it slowly moved towards the north until it just disapeared.   The sky was clear that day.  (which is a rarity in Vancouver)  So we know it couldn&apos;t have been a plane fading into the clouds. I and the witnesses were just out of high school at that time.

I guestimate altitude at about 50,000 + feet, rapidly headed upward with slight South-South-Easterly direction. As it continued up, light became dimmer rapidly, almost as though there was a spotlight pointed down at me and it was slowly rotated towards the horizon as it travelled up. No sounds were audible.

I have never been able to completely discount this event as explained.  I was playing with a freind in his backyard and looked up - due west and at about 2oclock or 45 degrees - and saw what looked like a cylinder, or as I thought at the time, a missile or a plane with no wings.  Moving left to right, it crossed my field of view in less than ten and perhpaps about five seconds. I must have recently seen something about missiles because I remember thinking that&apos;s what I was seeing...but also that it seemed very strange none-the-less.  It seemed at first to be as high as a commercial airliner, but then it appeared to be much smaller and lower that a jet would fly.  It was silver and without any other appreciable detail that I can recall.  My clearest memory of the event would put the objects length at about 30 feet and with a diameter of about 7 feet...less than 25% of its length.  It&apos;s distance would then be about two or three city blocks.  I sometimes thought about this as a child.  When I was old enough to realize that missiles do not normally fly over peoples houses, I eventually assumed that I had seen a plane banking so that his wings were parallel to my line of sight.  But upon further reflection, I also remembered being quite sure that the object was a simple cylinder having no vertical structures.  I never even made the connection to cigar shaped UFOs until recently...it had just never clicked for some reason.  What strikes me now is the lasting impact that the event had on me.  I don&apos;t mean anything mystical here, simply that even at the age of four I seemed quite sure that this thing was very strange.  It was one of those rare events which imprinted clearly as one of my earliest sustained memories in life - like the first time I saw Santa Clause or when I got my first tricycle.  It is this conviction in memory which motivated me to report this story.", "Donuts on a rope smoke trail in the sky pointing west.I looked up and saw donuts on a rope smoke trail.  I could not get too a clear area to see the source of the trail, but did see that it was two lines of smoke before becoming one line with the loops.

S. military flies unusual aircraft, from time to time.))", "On May 4th, 2000 at 9:10 pm in Kansas City, Missouri,  8 witnesses observed a bright, color-changing pulsating orb in the night sky.It was 9:10 pm CST, here in Kansas City, Missouri. My daughter called me out to the front yard to look at something in the sky. I was on the PC, and a little slow to come out until my wife said &quot;Oh my God, come out and look at this. I don&apos;t believe it.&quot; I went outside and walked into the front yard. There, West SW from my house, about 40 degrees above the horizon, was what looked like a fat pulsating star. It was changing brilliant colors. Magenta, Aqua, Turquoise, Green, Gold, unlike primary colors. It changed color rapidly, but pulsed at a slower frequency. It was quite obvious even with the naked eye that it was pulsating and changing colors. You could see the diameter of it. It reminded me of what Jupiter might look like at times. At arms length, about 1/8 inch diameter. Round and pulsating. It appeared to be much too fat for a star, but otherwise you could not tell size, distance was uncertain. It did not appear to be in space, it was in the sky. It was very weird to be able to watch it for so long. It appeared to remain in the same part of the sky, until we lost it in the glare of the highway lights while chasing towards it in a car. A friend who was visiting happened to have a nice SONY Handycam with Night Shot infrared and 72x digital zoom. We got some great footage of it, first without the infrared. It is not like anything I am aware of that is normal in the sky. We got a good 10 or 20 minutes of it. Then we chased it in the car, but it was obviously a few miles away at least. But the best part was when we switched it to Night Shot Infrared. The object was too far away too be painted by the camera. What we shot was the infrared signature of the object, mixed with monochrome, and it really is spectacular. It looks like a pulsing fog, with a bright triangular nucleus that is spinning rapidly. Like a cell made of light with a spinning triangle for a nucleus. I will get the video uploaded to the internet and post it. Stills are up now at http://www((URL deleted)).html/ I made sure to get perspective shots of the trees and streetlights in the foreground. I am excited to have the video evidence, and curious as to what others might think it is after seeing it.", "Spring Solstice,Lunar eclipse, time of the comet,evening around open fire, gathering 20 adults.A pre-arranged group of people gathered around a celebration fire after dark on the spring solstice.  Some of the group had traveled up to Nederland to join in the event.  We said prayers to the earth and the directions and the spirits. We blew flutes and drummed. The group was in different stages of the ceremony when two males standing apart from the group looked west to the comet and saw between 15 to 18 space craft flying in formation over the mountain tops towards the group. It took a few moments for the craft to move overhead and past us.  At that time two of the craft broke formation returning to do a low altitude flyby. At this point, those who hadn&apos;t seen the first fly over saw the second. The two flew in wing to wing -a few yards apart- and did a zig-zag dance. Which meant at the same moment each craft flew away from each other a few yards and then flew back together.  this was done before thye reached the group.  So that by the time they had flown over they had created a vapor trail and within 15 yards after passing the group they abruptly turned their noses up and flew straight up and away at tremendous speed.  The vapor trail following was easily seen and as the craft flew up nose to tail the vapor swirled like smoke following them.  .....now,as to my witnessing the event. I also was standing apart from the group with a woman friend and my back was to the group while she faced it.  The lunar eclispe was full and the country surrounding us was dark.  It&apos;s a very small town and there aren&apos;t many city lights.  Now as we talked we heard the group give up a great cry and whoop.  She said, &apos;look somebody&apos;s flying a kite.&apos;  I turned to my right and saw a craft that was about 12ft wide with wings and a center sphere for the flyer.  The two wings were bent in three places like elbows and wrists. From the sphere the wing dipped down a few degrees then one-third out bent again up, at a sharp angle to almost the length and about a foot short bent again with a down wing. The wings where shaped like a long skinny triangle with the end points showing lighted opake(sp)tips. The sphere was also partly lit. The sight of the craft did not throw me because as a clairvoyant I have seen space craft before.  But none of the others in the group had had my experience.  My thought at first when my friend told me about the kite was that it was a mistake. We dismissed the idea and said go night to each other and she left.  When I walked back over to the group some 20 yards away in the darkness I was approached by several in the group who were all smiles and laughing excitedly.  After they began telling me what just happened, I began asking questions to each one separatly.  They all said the same thing basically but the two males standing apart proved to be the most interesting in their witness.  Each one told me a different number of craft but it didn&apos;t matter to me. What was the most compelling to me was the description that I saw matched their&apos;s. Especially the lighted tips of the wings.  Well many of the group that kept in contact over the next week were blown away. At first it was really cool and something they had waited years to see.  But as the week went on the event began to shock them and really bother them in many respects. It&apos;s different to think you see a ship, most of these folks are new-agers and try to be open, but when the encounter is like this one, up-close with plenty of witnesses, it throws the thinking around. This was also around the time of the Arizona sightings.  Nederland is 18 miles west up the mountain from Boulder.  I did enter this information on a site but had no idea who to talk to. I had just heard of the Art Bell show and hadn&apos;t even tuned in to the program.  Well anyway I thought I would pass this along.  Small craft with a sphere for a center and oragami wings that bent for flight control.  The reason my friend thought she saw a kite was the lighted tipped wings and the swirling vapor trail that looked like the tail of a kite.  My witnessing came from my psychic sensing of a foriegn object in the area.  The picture I received was a left-over image of the craft.  This is hard to explain but the craft had departed before I had even turned to see what my friend was talking about.  My view was the craft eight feet off the ground at level flight.((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain of the date, but the solstice occurs on 21MR.  The comet was most dramatic on Sunday, 23MR97, so we have arbitrarily assigned a date.  It may be incorrect.))", "I was driving down the highway when something caught my eye in a field next to the road.

It seemed like there were flashing lights out in the field, probably 2 different ones, next the to road.  They sort of flew around in the field and flashed so bright im sure you could see them very easily for a mile radius.  I slowed down the car to about 20 miles per hour, and watched as they moved around.  They never got close to the car at all, they stayed in the field about half a mile or less away from us I could only see the flashing, which was not at any specific, uniform rate, thats why I thought it was something strange.

The lights (that were alternating blue, red and white) were at the same height but they were separated from each other.Please excuse my English, I am not native English speaking. At approximately 22:00 hours we saw two strange lights coming up over the ocean as we were walking on the beach. The lights (that were constantly changing blue, red and white) were at the same height but they were separated from each other at what seemed to be about the size of a golfball for me. It was sitting there for a minute (app. 30-sec.) and than it moved closer to us toward the beach, as we all got excited about what this could be I was walking closer to the beach and continues focusing my eye on the lights. The lights now were separated at such a way that I could fit a pencil in between. The strange thing is that because the sky was so clear and I had my eye&rsquo;s focus so much on the object that I could now see that their was a very black &ldquo;ufo looking&rdquo; shape in between the lights and the lights seemed to be at the end of  &ldquo;the wing&rdquo; of the disk. I am not that good in distance estimation but I believe the object was now above the ocean with at least 750 meters away from us and it had reach a higher position. While the lights were still seem to move toward us the object al of the sudden turned around 180* upside down. Than the object very quickly seemed to move away from us and the lights became very weak and blurry. Than I lost track of the lights and they seemed to have disappeared. App. 30 seconds after that one of us saw it again at a complete different distance. It was now very high in the sky and far away. We say it a couple of times at certain positions far away for a second or two during about 1 minute. This was an unidentified flying object because it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be an airplane or anything from earth that could do this kind of movements.

It was in the shape of a long cigar or cylinder shape. It&apos;s color was somewhat like that of a cloud or very light grey.  I used a chimney on a building across the street as a reference point.  It seemed to be a very great distance in the sky maybe 30 miles away.  It did not move for the approximately 60 minutes I watched it.  I thought it would move or be blown about by the wind but it didn&apos;t move an inch.It had perfectly outlined and smooth sharp edges.  I stayed as long as i could to watch it hoping it would disappear or move away but it didn&apos;t, and at this time I had to leave my table.  I would have asked someone to verify the sighting but I thought people might think I was crazy so I didn&apos;t.  Maybe I should have.

They would disappear and appear, as the flock would turn, like one side was silverey and the other dark.while driving on Highway 395, northbound, around the town of olancha, ca. south of Bishop, Ca. in the eastern sierra mts., I spotted from the passenger side of the vehicle what i thought was a flock of birds above the mountains to the east of the Highway. They were turning back and forth in the same location in the sky not going any direction. They would appear and dissappear as they turned and my reasoning was one side of the birds must be silver and the other side dark. They would dissappear in a wave motion and as I looked harder for them I couldn&apos;t see any sign of a one. Then they would appear in a wave motion and be in a flock pattern. I was thinking that I was seeing some native birds that live in the mountains, since i live in the L.A. area and wouldn&apos;t see this type of bird there. But as they appeared again, I&apos;ll be darned if the flock started to make a big circle, with other birds staying in the flock. Then the circle broke up and they started making horizontal lines , 2 or 3 at a time and at different levels in the flock and still staying in the same area above the mountains. The driver also saw this and stated that &apos;&apos; that&apos;s pretty strange&apos;&apos;. As we drove into the beginning of the town of Olancha, I spotted a couple standing in a lot off the hwy. looking at the same flock and pointing towards them, so I felt better that someone else had noticed the same thing.

Southwest sky at 11:00 position. Several aircraft in northeast sky flying southwest at the time.  They, too should have see it.My husband and I saw the fireballs March 9, 2000, at 10:09p.m. It lit up our forest brighter than daylight.  A bright, white light held us and all the wildlife in silence for about 45 seconds. I was looking up (at the 11:00 position in the sky, toward the southwest) when the bright ball hit a glass like dome above the planet.  The ball was about the size of a golf ball.  It hurt my right eye; it was so bright. We stood in the white-light waiting for it to stop.  When it did I quickly looked at my watch.  It was 10:09p.m. We next saw several airplanes in the sky flying toward the southwest from the northeast. At 10:10p.m. a second ball was above us in the exact same path that the first had taken.  It looked like a large meteor.  It had a golden-red color and trails of blue flying from its sides. The second ball was not round.  It had the long tail of a meteor;  unlike the large white ball I saw the first time. The other strange thing to this is that at 10:00p.m. (before this all happened) my husband said to me that he thought we should go outside for a walk down our driveway (we live deep in the woods).  I was already ready for bed but his tone of voice sounded strange - so I said OK.  We stepped outside our house knowing that something was going to happen.  We both joked that maybe he was being called by UFO&apos;s.  Well, when the white light hit us, we didn&apos;t laugh. One more note -  yesterday, March 22, 2000, when I mentioned this to someone, they said they had a friend who was out on the lake that night fishing, and he too, saw the fireballs.  He was so frightned by the first long, white-night light that he thoutht it was the rapture (second coming of Christ). I have to admit that during the light-night(45 seconds long) I, too, thought it was the rapture or something else on a cosmic level. For the next few days we were often confused about what night it actually all happened.  It was difficult for us to remember if it was Thursday or Wednesday.  We thought that was strange.  I had journaled it on Thursday. When the first fireball hit it revealed a glass like dome above the planet.  Its white-light spread above the dome which than revealed a clear distinction from above the dome to below the dome.  I was giving my husband a hug when it hit.  He is a tall man so my head was looking up at the night sky - in the exact spot that it appeared when it hit.  The flash hurt my right eye but not my left.  We felt suspended in a sort of time warp as the light-night surrounded us.  Everything was brighter than white, except the trees seemed to be shadows, yet they, too, were bright.  It was just that the bright light was so bright that the trees seemed shadowed. There was no sound of anykind except my husband and I. We held each other and asked each other - what do ya think it is? The second fireball was the lenghth about 4&quot;.  Typical teardrop shape.  It followed in the same ark of the first, and it hit the same spot on the glass dome - but it did not make the dome. The dome was no longer there. That only lasted a few seconds while the first light was at is greatest intensity. The second fireball looked like a meteor. I often stay up late to watch the meteor showers in the fall.  This one was not only 4&quot; long, it was 1/2&quot; wide in its front.  Trails of blue light curled from its sides. It was the largest meteor I have ever seen. I hope all this informathion helps some how.", "Small white bounsing light over steel bridge in calm weather.It saw this while travelling home in a taxi over a large bridge in the city, the weather was calm, the sky was clear (nighttime), the temprature was probably around -10 to -5 centigrades. While I was in this taxi travelling westwards over the bridge(which is a large steel-structure), I saw a small white light, circular in shape heading in about 20-30 kilometers per hour in a 45 degree angle(towards north) towards the top of the bridge, I observed it moving in this fashion for about 2 seconds. I was shocked at once, thinking it could be nothing else than a helicopter crashing into the bridge. Before I had time to notify the taxi-driver, the &quot;white light-ball&quot; started behaving strange; when about 5 meters above the bridge it suddenly bounced straight up about 5 meters and stood there quite still for about 1 second, it was now about 10 meter above the bridge. The speed it bounced must have been huge, because I could not see it move from a(5 meters above the bridge) to b(10 meters above the bridge), it was like it just &quot;re-positioned&quot;. Then it re-positioned in a straight line about 5 meters to the north, in the same re-positioning fashion as before, it stood there about 1/2 a second. Then it re-positioned itself 5 meters straight down, and stood there fpr about 1/2 a second, it was now almost directly above the bridge. Then it re-postioned about 8 meters to the north, then another re-position about 10-15 meters to the north, and then again about 20-25 meters to the north. These last three re-positioning happend quite fast, the light re-positioning faster for each step. Then it was gone. I recond the light could not have been much larger then about 1/2 a meter in diameter, and no smaller then 1/4 of a meter, all in white light, like a large 200 Watts light-bulb. It never changed shape, intensity or color.

The rounded top was identifiable by a shadow that was cast by the low setting sun at 1840 PDT.  Assuming we were at about 30,000 feet, the craft was at about 25,000 feet as it looked about a mile away, at the 7 o&apos;clock position in reference to the planes forward motion, i.e. pilots 7 o&apos;clock position.  That means I saw it along the bottom of my window, as well as the window in front and in back of the one next to me.  I first caught a glimpse in the window in front of me, across the window next to me, and followed it through the window behind me until it disappeared underneath the wing.  I was in row 10 on the left side of the plane, so I was looking down and to the South.  It took about 10-12 seconds to cover that span of sight.  Ten minutes later I saw another jet liner about 3 miles away, also going from West to East and it took about 40 seconds to cross my view in just the window next to me - hence the UFO was traveling at about 5 times faster than that airliner. I believe we were over northern Nevada at the time, just after clearing a very rugged mountain range.  I estimate the object to be 50-60 feet in diameter based on the width of the occasional dirt road I could see on the desert floor.  It was a very desolate area.

The family believes the  craft hovered over the river, observing them (and vice versa). Craft left at unbelievable speeds and the father, a flight engineer for Boeing  Aircraft and former flight instructor on the B-29s of WWII, insisted the family remain silent about the sighting so his career would not be in jeopardy.I was thirteen years old, and it was a Sunday morning in July, 1955, in Washington State.  I thought it was aspecial day from the start.  The morning mellowed from a nighttime nip into a lovely, crisp summer day, more like late spring than summer, and the skies were a cloudless blue.  Days like that are rare in Washington State, and my parents were not about to waste such an opportunity, so, over breakfast, they suggested a picnic. Later, I sat glued to the car&apos;s window, during our short drive into the foothills of the Cascade Mountains.  My parents located a rather remote picnic site along the Tolt River, near the little town of Carnation, which I considered a perfect setting for our outing.  Our car was not far away, but the spot was totally natural and untouched in appearance.  The river was a bit too swift to wade in; its cold glacial waters spilled over heaps of stones and boulders.  The river banks were even larger heaps of stones, most of them sanded smooth by years of flooding waters.  Large stands of virgin Douglas Fir flanked the banks. We picnicked first, then I started a family game of skipping stones across the water.  I remember laughin at the near impossibility of skipping stones on such wild waters, yet my Dad could often manage two skips.  I don&apos;t remember how long we played like that, but at some point, my Dad picked up a slightly heavier stone and drew back his arm as though to loft the stone skyward, over the river.  Instead, he stood frozen, arm drawn back, for several seconds.  He was staring up, and off to the west slightly, across the river.  With great alarm, I followed his gaze.  There, above us, hovering motionlessly, was a UFO. It would be more accurate if I called it a flying saucer, for it was just that.  It was as though someone had joined two round stainless steel saucers, edges together, only these saucers had no bumps, no varying angles, and no visible portholes or openings.  I could see that the saucer&apos;s mass was easily defined along the edges, and solid in appearance.  The sun was further to the south, and there was no glare on the saucer.  It seemed to hang, suspended, like a monstrous steely plate, at a fairly low altitude, over the river.  It remained there, motionless, as seconds stretched into an eternity.  All was quiet except for the river in my ears. As I huddled near my mom and dad, I experienced a numb uneasiness, which was visibly shared by the rest of my family.  It was not the presence of something alien that bothered me as much as the knowledge that IT was watching US.  And how long had it been up there, hovering, before we noticed it? I noticed that the saucer&apos;s height was difficult to estimate, simply because I had no reference points to use for comparison, except possibly the tree tops.  Was the saucer huge and at great height, or smaller and at a lower altitude?  (This is the only point where my family and I recall things differently:  I remember it as hovering low over the tree tops -- maybe one thousand feet or so --but the rest of my family remembers it as being higher.  We all say it was 8-9 inches across, as the eye sees the diameter.  I cede to their opinion, because I was the youngest of the group, and my imagination the most vivid.  Although altitude is a debatable point, what is most important is that we all saw the saucer and for a considerable period of time (five minutes plus). Finally, the saucer started to move towards the east, silently, very slowly at first, then gathering tremendous speed.  It left no vapor trail.  Never, in my wildest fantasies, had I ever imagined an object could move so fast.  And most incredible of all, it was silent speed.  (Yes, the river could have muffled quite a bit of noise, but we heard nothing.) After it was gone, my father suggested we all sit.  He was quiet and in control, and led our family discussion about what we saw.  He said the UFO did not fit any aircraft known to earth, unless it was some sort of secret, experimental project.  He absolutely discounted weather balloons, based on the fact that we could all see enough of the top portion of the saucer to accurately judge its total shape.  Besides, my father was not making presumptuous statements; he had been a flight instructor for the B-29 bomber during World War II at Mather Field, California, and after the war he was a flight engineer with Boeing Aircraft Company of Seattle/Renton, Washington.  Furthermore, he was an enthusiastic, leisure pilot, flying often in his spare time.  My father also said that the saucer would reach New York City in twenty minutes (or less?) traveling at its departure speed.  In 1955, nothing from our earth, to my knowledge, could travel that speed. My father made us promise that, (with only a few possible exceptions), we would keep this experience a family secret.  He feared social backlash and loss of his job at Boeing if we reported the sighting.  Usually -- not always -- I managed to keep his rule.

The docket is stored in the (offline) NTSB Imaging System. Scheduled 14 CFR 129 operation of SWISSAIR TRANSPORT CO. LTD (D.B.A. SWISSAIR) Incident occurred AUG-09-97 at NEW YORK, NY Aircraft: Boeing 747-300, registration: HBIGF Injuries: 3 Uninjured. On August 9, 1997, about 1707 eastern daylight time, the flight crew of a Boeing 747-300, Swiss registration HB-IGF, and operated by Swissair as flight 127, reported an unusual sighting while in cruise flight at 23,000 feet (FL230) over New York, New York. The airplane was not damaged, and there were no injuries to the occupants. Flight 127 which had departed from Philadelphia International Airport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was conducted under 14 CFR Part 129, and was operated in visual meteorological conditions on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. Flight 127 was en-route to Boston, Massachusetts when the sighting was made. According to a report from a Safety Board Air Traffic Control investigator: &quot;Swiss Air 127 was in contact with the Danbury Sector of the Boston ARTCC at Flight Level 230. Voice communications with Swiss Air 127 were of a routine nature until 2107 UTC, when the flight transmitted, &apos;...sir, I don&apos;t know what it was, but it just over flew like a couple of hundred feet above us. I don&apos;t know if it was a rocket or whatever, but incredibly fast, opposite direction.&apos; The controller asked, &apos;In the opposite direction?&apos; Swiss Air 127 replied, &apos;yes sir, and the time was 2107, it was too fast to be an airplane.&apos; The controller then asked another flight, Eastern 986 if they saw anything like a missile in the area, &apos;perhaps off your right.&apos; They replied that they would take a good look, but &apos;didn&apos;t think that if it&apos;s going that fast they probably won&apos;t get a chance. They had just seen Swiss Air go by a little bit ago.&apos; &quot; &quot;Swiss Air 127 then reported that they had no warning, &amp; that the object was going way too fast. The controller then asked how far above Swiss Air 127 it was. Swiss Air 127 replied, &apos;it was right over us, right above, opposite direction, and, and I don&apos;t know, 2,3,4 hundred feet above. All that I can tell , 127, is that the three of us saw a light object, it was white, and very fast.&apos; &quot; &quot;The flight was then cleared direct to Providence, and told to reduce speed to 300 knots before contacting the next sector.&quot; Interviews were conducted with the captain and first officer on August 10, 1997. The flight engineer had not observed the object and was not interviewed. The captain reported: The flight was abeam of John F. Kennedy Airport, Jamaica, New York, at 2106, and proceeding direct to RAALF intersection when the event occurred. The captain was making a public address to the passengers in the cabin when he looked ahead and saw a white object. He saw it for less than a second, and the only movement he could discern was opposite his flight track. He did not observe any wings, and was not sure it was an aircraft. He thought it was cylindrical in shape. He had never been so close to other traffic before. He was not certain whether it was stationary or was moving opposite of the flight. It passed over the cockpit, slightly right of centerline. If it had been any lower, it would have hit the aircraft. As the object passed by, there was no noise, no wake turbulence, and no disruption or anomalies with any of the flight or engine instruments. At the time of the event, the airplane was flying on a heading of 060 degrees, at 340 KIAS, at FL230. It was clear with cumulus nimbus clouds to the west. The sun was behind them. There was no TCAS warning. In addition, there was no exhaust or smoke, no fire, and he could not accurately discern its size. The captain reported his total time as 15,000 + flight hours. He had never seen a missile in flight. The first officer reported: The flight was cruising at FL230. The captain was making a PA to the cabin. The first officer was putting on his headset, and bent over to adjust the volume. As he looked up he saw the object. It passed overhead very quickly. It was close enough that he ducked his head because he thought it would hit them He said it was white and had a round shape. There was no smoke or fire visible from the object. He thought it passed about 100 to 200 feet above the airplane and between the right side of the fuselage and the number 3 engine. There was no drift, and it appeared to be flying exactly opposite of the aircraft. No actual movement was discerned, and no markings were visible. The object appeared to be the size of a thumbnail held at an arms length. The engine indications were steady, and the visibility was unlimited. The sun was behind the airplane. The first officer reported that he had previously encountered a weather balloon over Italy, and the object did not look like the balloon. The first officer reported his total time as 7,500 hours, all civil. He has seen missile shoots from the ground. A check with a Safety Board meteorologist revealed the following: WEATHER BALLOONS * Weather balloons are launched twice a day. * The normal times are 1100 UTC, and 2300 UTC. plus or minus 15 minutes. * The time to reach 23,000 feet is normally about 25 to 28 minutes. Sounding balloons are light tan or brownish in color. * PIBAL (used for wind observations) and Ceiling Balloons are black and red in color. * The closest launch point to the JFK was Upton, New York, about 43 NM east of JFK on a bearing of 085 magnetic. A check of winds aloft data from Upton, New York, revealed the following: Date Time Altitude Velocity Direction Temperature 9 Aug 12Z 500 MB 35 kts 350 degrees -14 C 10 Aug 12Z 500 MB 15 kts 360 degrees -12 C 9 Aug 00Z 400 MB 20 kts 330 degrees -22 C 10 Aug 00Z 400 MB 20 kts 330 degrees -22 C Radar data was supplied by the Boston Air Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), in the NTAP format. The data contained both secondary targets (beacon), and primary targets (non-beacon). The data was plotted and Swissiar Flight 127 was identified. There was no evidence of an opposite direction target, either beacon or non-beacon.

We observed this object using reference stars and other stationary objects to verify that it was actually moving until it finally moved out of our veiw leaving the reference star in the same place.This is the first sighting of an unidentified flying object. The object was brought to my attention by my mother , who first spotted it. It was 22:00 on the night of May 3, 2000 and the skies were clear. I began to watch the object move at a fast pace from east to west and then return to its original spot. We used many different reference stars along with stationary objects in our possesion. The colors changed at random. The object stayed at the same altitude until about 22:45. We then noticed it moving out of our sight.

Object emitted a flashing white light.I was star gazing from my balcony in NW Tucson, looking westward toward the night sky at around 9 PM, when I saw an object moving at an extremely high rate of speed toward the western horizon. I am an aviation buff, and I have never seen any man-made aircraft move across the sky this fast. I would estimate it covered at least 30 or 40 miles in those few seconds. The duration of it&apos;s appearance was approx 4 or 5 seconds, and it appeared at though it was heading at a 30 degree angle toward the ground. It was impossible to tell how far away it was, but it moved NW toward the mountains and disappeared over the horizon. I watched for a flash from an explosion, but never saw one. I assume it was moving toward the NW and simply was following the earth&apos;s curvature. I&apos;d be curious if anyone in the Phoenix or Las Vegas areas witnessed it as well. It was impossible to see what shape it was; all you could see is a brightly blinking white light. I have watched many satellites and jet aircraft cross the skies at night here in the desert, but I have NEVER seen something moving this fast. There was no sonic boom, or noise of any kind from the object.  Also, at the same time, I saw the lights of an approaching jet airliner from roughly the same direction.  The jet was inbound from the NW, heading for Tucson Intl, and it took about 10-15 minutes for it to come close enough to my viewpoint to identify it as an aircraft. I wonder if the crew on that aircraft saw this object, which was heading roughly toward it&apos;s path? The weather was clear, with a bright, full moon.

He said he was looking up at the sky behind the house and trees when all of a sudden a sudden super-bright flash occured and it seemed the whole sky turned bright white. All he could see was the brightness and the silouette of the house and trees; Even the house lights were not visible because of the brightness of the sky. And then a split second later a loud boom occured. That was it. We never heard anything else.", "So I was playing basketball with my freinds and I saw a flying object in the sky. It was very bright and had three cicles and a sharp point at the end. It was on a diaganel and just disappeared!I was playing basketball with my freinds. I was going to take a shot. When I looked up I saw a very brigt object. It was pure white. It had three white circles and had a very pointy end. There was only 1.", "my girfriend and i saw an opaque outline of an oval elongated object with lights foreward, midship and aft dissappear within an instant with no sound of any kind.my girfriend and i were returning home at about sunset when we heard the loud noise coming from a propeller plane overhead. we stopped on an open outside porch waiting to see the plane clear our roof line so we could determine if it was in trouble. the plane cleared our roof line at less than 1000 ft so i thought it was either in trouble or may be trailing a lighted sign for us to see. neither seems to be the case but as we looked at the plane going from east to west we noticed south from our house an opaque shape. the object was about 60 feet long by 30 plus feet high narrower and the ends than the middle with lights fore, aft and midship. what we really mnoticed was the absence of lights coming from an adjacent street or the four floors of our hospital we normally see or the lights from a 10 story apartment bldg our vision was being blocked by something. we stared at the object and felt we were being watched but neither of us felt afraid. we could not grasp what our eyes were seeing it just would not register. it is as if you were looking at a puzzle to solve and need a lot of time to solve it after 3 to 5 minutes of us staring at it and looking back at the noisy plane trying to make sense of anything. we kept returning to the object again and again as if each time we refocused it would make sense. within an instant, this does not adequatly describe the spped. within a millesecond all we could see was a trail of the three lights we noticed stretching for over a mile in the sky. at that momemnt we knew we had come accross something out of anything our mind could accept. there no sound when it left, no noise  from the leaves on the trees and bushes which wee near. no noise at all except from that noisy plane which had turned from east to west to west to east from the south. the other uneplainable was when we first started looking at the object there was a beautiful sunset and when it left the sunset was gone and it was dark. strange yet was the noisy plane was alwys in ear shot with us it never left us. my girlfriend and me wrote each other notes about waht we saw without dicussing it in detail that night. our notes comapre exactly with the primary emphasis on the speed and no noise. while lokking at the object we kept ying to each &quot; what is this&quot; &quot; what are we seeing&quot; each time we would both say i don&apos;t now. the next day we thought we would contact our local airport to see if we could track down the pilot of the noisy plane but decided not to draw attention to ourselves. however, later the next day while listening to our radio while washing our cars we heard a live broadcast of a sherrif chasinfg a ufo in another county. never heard another word after this. i would appreciate any kind of response either affirming this report or explaining it away. thanks", "Bright star with red flashingOur bedroom window faces south giving us an unobstructed view of the ocean and that part of the sky. We routinely sleep with our blinds open to view the stars... what few of them we can see here in the light polluted southern California sky. At about 9pm I saw what I initially thought was an unusually bright star. It was brighter than anything in the sky. I would describe it as nearly the same color as those new auto headlights... the kind that make other headlights look yellow by comparison. Same with this star -- it made the others look yellow by comparison. Another unusual attribute of this star was that it seemed to flicker more than other stars. At about 10pm I noticed that there was a red flash in the star. I got out my binoculars to confirm. The red flashing didn&apos;t look like that of an aero plane. It was random, not steady like an aircraft. My thought at this time was that is was some kind of natural space event like a sun going nova or something. I hadn&apos;t detected any movement up to this point. I called a couple of my ham radio buddies to ask if they could see it. One could view it by standing on a ladder. It&apos;s about 10:20pm now. My buddy noticed it was moving very slowly... like the minute hand on a clock. He said it was dropping relative to the phone wires. He couldn&apos;t see the red flashes per say, but thought the atmosphere was altering the color and causing the unusual flickering. We also noticed it was starting to dim. From then on I made note of the movement and brightness of the object. At this point I was thinking that it was falling out of the sky and on fire, gradually growing dimmer as the fire burned out... maybe it was a weather balloon. Eventually I threw out that idea and decided it was not falling but remaining an the same altitude and moving south-west away from me... growing dimmer as the distance increased. I continued to observe the object until about 11:15 pm when it went dimmed to nothing. My opinion at this time, Sunday morning, it that this was some kind of very high altitude aircraft.", "3 balls of light were in the sky. They were in a triangle formation, I heard that it might have been one ship with three lights.While I was on a trip to Baltimore, Maryland, my family and I stopped at the Gateway restaurant, it&apos;s a big travel center, As soon as I got out of the car, I saw three balls of light that looked like fire. They were in a triangle formation and seemed to be rotating. I knew this wasn&apos;t a plane or a helicopter because of the light, planes and helicopters don&apos;t have lights on at noon. I told my parents about it and my two brothers. We seemed to be the only people to see it. The event lasted about an hour, then the lights just faded out and there was a giant burst of light in the sky.", "A very bright object passed between the trees very fast with no sound.I was sitting outside on a clear night a little after 10pm.  I glanced up and saw the brightest object I&apos;ve ever seen speed by between two tall trees.  It was not high in the sky, like a falling star.  Planes fly over all the time so I have an idea of the size of aircraft related to distance and sound.  This object was well within the atmosphere and made no noise!  It was definitely going faster than the speed of sound but no sound followed.  There was no tail of light.  I don&apos;t believe it was a meteor or it would have landed on the houses nearby.  It was going in a horizontal position in the sky.  It was very strange.", "while driving on i690 by the lake.looking to the south.a small blue light shot down like a falling star but it blinked out not fading like a star dose.i seen many many fallen stars.this was between the trees and the sky line.it happened in a split second (the disappearing part). i also,sent a email about it to art bellok...while driving on i690 in syracuse,ny about between 0315 to 0330 going west looking left or south.I seen out of the corner of my eye a seen a small blue light zipping downward.thean it blinked out.it was between the tree line or horizon and the sky or star moon area.now i have seen lots of shooting stars and i am in through there all during the week at nite.i know it was not a star,light,plane,shooting star or anything as such.shooting stars fade and there ar no lights that high and i kepp looking for several min. and there was no plne around.", "Evening sighting of UFO at two different locations.We were camping at a private camp ground when we heard a very strange sound and looked up to see what at first appeared to be a jet airplane passing by the campsite very slowly and at a very low altitude, as if it were landing. The sound was very foreign and did not sound like any aircraft either of us had ever heard. Then the craft became silent and seemed to disappear over some trees. We then went out to a nearby field to see if we could figure out what it could have been &amp; where it went. We saw nothing for a long while. As we decided to go back to our campsite I noticed what appeared to be a falling star. I pointed out the location I saw the light drop when all of a sudden a craft slowly approached us. It was triangular in shape and huge as it came to a stop right in front of us, almost above us. We noticed that it made no sound whatsoever. My friend noted that is did not have any flashing red light that all registered aircraft are required to display. Right after he stated that a large red light began to glow at the bottom, center of the craft. As soon as that occured we freaked thinking that the occupants may have heard us and responded. We then witnessed the craft swiftly drifted away silently then sped upward at what appeared to be a 45% angle until it went out of sight.", "Sighted WW II barrage balloon at 1500&apos; AGL (no lights) which accelerated rapidly as I approached in my light aircraft.I was southbound in my light aircraft from Jefferson County Airport during some pleasure and proficiency flying.  The weather was clear, very light to no wind; my altitude was approximately 1500 AGL, airspeed 90 knots.  Appproximately 5-6 nm south of Jefferson County Airport (10-11 nm south of the town of Port Townsend), directly ahead approximately 1 nm ahead and at about my altitude I saw what I immediately thought was a WW II barrage balloon, like those used in the Battle of Britain--it was so like that that no other thought or association came to my mind. It was brown or olive drab in color and seemed too small to be a modern blimp. The &quot;balloon&quot; was stationary, as if tethered in the fields below, though I saw no tethering lines; it had no airfoils or control surfaces except the fin-like empennage typical of barrage ballons and blimps, and it had no engine, propellor or other visible source of power. I saw no lights anytime during the episode.  It was pointed in a westerly direction.  My immediate thought was to wonder why anyone would tether a barrage balloon in at this point.  I altered my heading to pass behind (east of) the balloon and take a closer look. When I was approximately 1/4 nm from it, the balloon suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed to the west, toward the Olympic Mountains; I turned to follow it;  in a few seconds it had gone from my sight.  There was no visible exhaust or other indication of power or motion.  I have been a certified flight instructor for approximately 30 years and was in instructor in the Strategic Air Command.  I have seen interesting sights while flying but I can remember no other sight that I could not explain to my self.  I recently learned of your web sight, which is one reason for the timing of this report.

On a different story... a current airforce MP friend of mine was stationed at the air force in / near las vegas a couple of years ago (for two years) who told me/confirmed what an older ex-air force crew chief friend/ex-partner of mine told me. That there are a bunch of hollow mountains in Nevada near las vegas. The ex-crew chief told me that years ago he and the pilot/co-pilot were told/ordered to take off with some cargo but didnt know where they were going and would find out once they were enroute. He told me that they flew for hours and then received directions to fly to a certain coordinence (spelling) and they couldnt believe their eyes, they were instructed to fly into the side of a mountain, but when they got closer the side of the mountain opened up and they flew into the mountain and were told to not get out of the plane. the cargo was unloaded and they were told to leave. Ofcourse he told me to not tell anyone but i figured after all this time a bunch of people probably know about these &quot;hidden&quot; airstrips/bases in the mountains. Back to my friend the MP...he said he had clearance to go into the restricted areas of that secret base as he was a security/police and he has heard many people say that yes those hills/mountains are all hollow. One day a friend of his was taking a break in his humvee near a top secret building and a guy came out the door of this secret building and later the guy taking the break was taken to headqtrs and asked what he saw when the other man came out the door. he said nothing as it was to quick and he wasnt even paying attention but within 24 hours the airforce transfered him out of state and made him sign the 50 year &quot;i saw nothing paper&quot; this kinda stuff is exciting but i wonder what the heck our government is doing in those secret bases..i wouldnt be surprised probably.... so, has anyone/group ever tried to sneak-in to this area and take pictures etc.? dont we have a right to know whats going on? ofcourse we do!!! i will try to squeeze more neat stuff out of my buddy the MP.((NUFORC Note:  The person who submitted this report indicated that it had occurred in &quot;Tucson, AR,&quot; suggesting the state of Arkansas.

I was in the center of three seats, so I could not actually see well out the window when I snapped the shot.  I just held my camera out to the window and took the picture.  At the time I noticed nothing unusual.  It was a clear, sunny day, and we were flying above the clouds.  Upon developing my film, I noticed a small brownish triangular spot in the distance.  The wing is also present.  I have maintained that this is probably debris on the aircraft window, but persons I have shown it to have been inclined to think that it is something else, often describing it as similar to a stealth bomber.  Since I did not observe whatever it was, whether something stuck to the window or else, I cannot offer any further details.  And although I myself am skeptical, I figured there would be no harm in submitting the photo to persons better qualified to analyze it.  I also have the original negatives, but would be reluctant to submit these since I have excellent vacation photos on the roll.  If you would like me to send the photo to you, please let me know.", "At dusk, my Dad and I were walking out of our blinds after deer hunting and our attention was drawn to the lights in the sky, not far above us. One object was shaped like a pipe with lights on each end; the other was just a light by itself.My Dad and I were out in the woods deer hunting and when it got too dark to hunt, my Dad walked over to my blind to get me. Just after we left my blind at about 5:55 that evening, our attentions were drawn to some lights up in the sky. There were no clouds and no wind that evening and it was still light enough out, that you couldn&apos;t see any stars yet, nor did you need a flash light to see where you were going. My Dad and I saw them at the same time. They weren&apos;t that far up into the sky; maybe a 1000 feet or less. The larger object was the shape of a pipe (but of course, much larger) with a bright light at each end of it. They seemed to be as bright and as large as head lights would be on a car. The other object was sightly lower and to the left of the larger object and it was just a light. Neither of them made any sound and they just hovered in one spot; we never saw them move. My Dad then drew up his gun to look at them through his scope. When he did this, they slowly dimmed their lights and disapeared, vanishing, without ever moving! It was as if they were watching us. As light as it still was out there, we should have been able to see the outline of the objects, in the air, but they were gone. I was shaking soo hard after we saw them, I had a hard time walking out. Note: Earlier that evening, we heard military jets flying around the area. I don&apos;t ever recall hearing them fly around there in the 16 years I&apos;ve hunted there. Do you think they were looking for something? Note: After we came home, after our week of hunting, I did create an ink and watercolor painting, of the objects. I would submit them, but I didn&apos;t know how to scan and email pictures yet. If you would like a copy of the painting, contact me and I&apos;ll mail you one.", "At approximately 12:10a the witness left her brother&apos;s home in Beaufort Missouri returning to her home in Arnold, Missouri; a trip she had made many times before. There had been a bad storm earlier, the road was wet and she drove cautiously at about 35/40mph over Highway 50 East. She went through Union, about 11 miles from Beaufort, and was heading toward the Bourbeuse River Bridge, a steel truss bridge, when she saw a brilliant light approaching in her rear view mirror...Before she could make an evasive move the car was hit. No sound was heard. Upon impact the car heated up, the windows fogged and the inside was bathed in light. The rear end was lifted. There was a vibration throughout. She could neither steer nor stop. She could see she was heading for the bridge,suddenly the car was dropped and she regained control. The light lifted over her car and disappear to the north. She crossed the bridge, got out, inspected the car, saw no damage,drove to the Arnold Police Dept. (Jefferson Co.). It was now approx. 1:40a. Arnold tells her to go back to Union. She got her husband and returned to Union. Union Police discover two shallow dents in the trunk lid about 22/24 in. apart, no other damage. A complaint is filed. Witness had aches, and bleeding from nose and ears after incident. Also remarked that weddings rings were off her hand and on front seat of car after incident.

At first we both assumed that it was military craft but after observing them it was obvious that it wassent due to the fact that they were traveling much slower than a airplane and they made no noise at all and the lighting on the craft were not consistant with those of a normal aircraft...all three vessels had dim blue lighting on them in a triangle pattern, while observing them they flew out of view within 10 minutes of seeing them they were heading north.", "Fireball seen, long duration and larger than normal brightnessThis is most likely the same situtation as the Little Rock Arkansas reports.  The fireball was observed while we were traveling east on I-40 at Sallisaw Oklahoma.  We observed a unusually bright and long duration shooting star.  This object appeared to travel from east to west, but could have been south to north.  The object appeared to impact the ground in the Sallisaw area, north of I-40.  My viewpoint was from the mile marker 311.  The size of the &quot;fireball&quot; appeared to be about the size of a BB held at arms lenght with the arm at about 25 degrees of elevation. I am a remote site electronic technician so I normally see a lot of shooting stars, this one appeared much larger than any I have seen previously.  We were able to follow the star below our visual horizon as it traveled through the sky.", "Bright light several thousand feet over the Owens Valley near Bishop, California.  Attacked by airplanes and left at high speedLong time ago, in late 60s.  Bright light in clear sky over Bishop, CA was witnessed by hundreds of residents.  It was surrounded by a dayglow type of flourescent green vapor. When 4 or 5 fighter planes came from the south and flew straight at it, it accelerated almost vertically in what would approximate the speed of a shooting star. I have ruminated over this for years and feel that I might add something not known.  I had a communications receiver tuned to the frequency that the chase planes were using to communicate with the Blackbird which was being tested at the time over the Owens Valley.  I went in the house in time to hear a pilot say &quot;have sustained some damage-request to land at Tonopah&quot;  Reply was &quot;permission denied,return to ship-do not fly over valley-stay over mountains-give film to so and so immediatly&quot; or something very close to those words. After that transmission, I never heard that frequency used again.

What caught my attention was the lights were flashing back and forth kind of like strob lights.  They would do this for about 4 seconds and then flicker and then go out completly for about 5 to 8 seconds before coming back to a real bright lumination.  The lights seemed to be hovering well over the wasatch mountians.  I quickly phoned my aunt and uncle and they did see the same thing about 6 blocks away.  No one that I know of saw the lights even at the store.

I noticed how clear the sky was as it had been cloudy, cool and rainy for quite a few days prior. Astronomy is a hobby of mine and I was facing west adimiring some of the stars when I noticed a plane approaching from the direction of Pearson International Airport. It wasn&apos;t to high up, probably a few thousand feet and I could see the wings, tail and fuslage as it flew over head. Just as it passed over I noticed three disc shaped objects that formed a triangle moving north and seemed to be lower than the plane. I could not see anything in between the discs such as a body or wings, and I began to wonder if they were in fact three separate objects moving together. They were not very bright and did not have any flashing lights nor did the brightness fluctuate but the discs themselves were well defined and not at all fuzzy or blurry. I called to my father who was at the top of the driveway but by the time he came down they had moved over the house and were getting lost in the light of a large mall directly north were they went out of site. The object/objects were larger against the sky than the plane and seemed to be lower in altitude. They made no noise whatsoever, they were silent, and moved quickly in a straight line north with no noticeable change in altitude. The siteing lasted about 10 seconds. I do not believe it was an aircraft as I could not see anything other than the discs and I could make out all of the jetliner that passed by. They did not make any sound, and it most certainly would have, had it been a plane. It was moving quite fast and must have been fairly low. If it was in fact much higher, than the speed was allot quicker than I origianally thought and the object would have been huge. The object/objects were about the size of the nail on your small finger held at arms length and about 1/2 inch apart at arms length.

I was ((deleted))  near the Lincoln Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial when the following events occurred.  I was standing in Constitution Gardens on the north side of the pond, looking approximately southwest towards Orion.  I saw what I at first took to be a shooting star because of its speed and the way it seemed to be falling or dropping, but it didn&apos;t fade away the way falling stars usually do.  Then I saw that there were actually two lights which were moving along parallel to each other.  The lights were small and white with a pale greenish tinge.  I thought it might be an airplane with a light on either wingtip, but the lights were not flashing, and they seemed to be moving too fast for an airplane.  As I watched, the two lights converged into one, and then changed again so that one appeared to be following or chasing the other.  The rear light seemed to be &quot;swinging&quot; back and forth behind the path of the front light.  It crossed my mind that they might be fighter planes, but they looked like they were much too close together, and there was no noise (I noticed this because a few seconds after they disappeared, a regular airplane went by in approximately the same location, and I could clearly hear it).  The lights were headed almost directly towards the North Star, but a little lower on the horizon.  They disappeared into the lights of the city.  I looked at my watch and it was 10:05 pm - the entire incident had taken about 10 seconds.

Around 6:27am I went outside for a cigarette break leaving my fellow associate to run the machine alone. After a few drags something caught the corner of my eye. I immediately looked up at it to see it was an orange egg shaped object with a bright white glow around it travelling on an upwardward diagonal course at a steady fast rate of speed with a bright white tail or trail of sparks behind it. Then within milliseconds it accellerated 2 to 3 times faster and then accellerated about 5 times faster than that and dissapeared with a small cascade of the white light from behind it either breaking the atmosphere or disintegrating. Puzzled I took a few more drags of my cigarette coaming the sky with my eyes then looked to my far right (which would be the direction where the egg would end up had it warped or jumped) and I saw a black triangular shaped shadow of an object about cloud level or slightly above fly at a very fast rate of speed in the same direction as the egg. The black triangular craft flew out of site as it was obscured by the warehouse part of the plant. Niether object made any noise. I immediately told my foreman of the incedent and he had a compass on hand. There was a magnetic disturbance at first as his compass read approximately 90 degrees off (the general direction both objects had travelled.) After my shift was over at 7:00am He came outside with me to the exact location I was standing to figure out the location of such crafts in the sky. His compass seemed to work properly then and we came to these conclusions. I was facing 330 degrees. The first egg shaped object travelled approximately 30 degrees North by NorthEast. The second dark triangular craft flew in the same 30 degrees NNE from the east.", "Approx 3:00am 0n 3/29/00 the following opbervations were observed by myself while observing the Pleadies star cluster in northern sky.

It is quite an amazing sighting. I first heard about it in Novemer of 99, from a co-worker who heard a short news segment on it on 910 AM KFYI here in Phoenix, which is Art Bells local affiliate. When my friends son contacted the station they stated they knew nothing about it. When he told them they had done a news segment on it, they said they would research it for him. A representative from KFYI contacted him via e-mail and supplied him with a transcript of the conversation between the crew of the PPD helicopter (Firebird) and the crew of another helicopter .According to my friend, when KFYI contacted Phx P.D. about this they at first denied it, and later when told about the transcript said the conversation took place but that they had no further comment.

Tiny dim lights around edges.On the eigth of May, I witnessed a black triangular craft fly over our house three times in the course of about a half an hour.  My father saw it first, and called me outside.  After waiting for a couple of minutes, it showed up again, cruising slowly and silently, directly over the house.  The object was about five hundred feet up, and I could see the structure that the lights were attached to.  There were lights along the two leading edges, and the back was slightly inverted.  I would estimate that the object was about one hundred yards across.  After we lost sight of it, we waited, and it returned within five minutes, this time headed in the opposite direction, as if it had made a turn, and come directly over us once again.  We waited for it show up again, and about ten minutes later we saw it make a turn towards Foothill (Mountains).  We were out there four nights in a row, and it is almost guaranteed to show up.  It usually flys over from about 9:45 to about 10:30 P.M.  We both get the impression that the craft (or whoever may be piloting it) knows when we spot it.  Due to the way it flys directly over the house, it seems to want to make contact of some sort.  Last year around this time of year, the same thing was happening.  It gives me and my father a very eery feeling everytime it flies over.  My father works for the county of Santa Barbara, and I&apos;m a junior at Carpinteria High School, 16 years old.  I myself have never seen any unusual objects in the sky before, such as this.  I also did not really believe in the UFO phenomenon until I saw this.  Needless to say, it is kind of spooky.  We&apos;ll keep you updated if anything else happens.", "these crafts had a light on each side and a big one in the middle. they came out of a larger triangle then spread out and hovered more around the mountains behind my house they hovered arouned for abit then combined in to one and shot straight up up into the skyi was sitting at my friends house in a community called juniper i had two kokanee beers (can sized) me and my girl friend went on the back porch alone when we noticed a large triangular object hovering in the mountains out back about six kilometer. we called in my buddy and watched it for about five minutes when it separated into four more crafts all triangular shaped with lights. one on each side and one in the middle. it appeared that they emmited an aura that was darkest at the lights and lightest around the ship. this aura changed colour according to when the lights changed coulor. then at the same time like a really powerful strobelight lit up the mountains for a few seconds then the ships formed into one and shot up into the sky and dissappeared.", "red ball in skyI witnessed what I believe to have been a UFO. At first I thought it was a sattelite, but the object heading south out of the north sky quickly changed direction to the west for about 15-20 seconds then switched back to a southerly direction at which time it dissapeared into some clouds and i lost sight of it.", "We saw 3 lights, as bright as stars in the city, move due south. They seemed to be 1000&apos;s of feet above us and moving quite fast. The very weird thing was that they oscillated rapidly in a lateral direction while moving.My girlfriend and I stepped off of our front porch in downtown Madison, circa December 1999. Looking straight up to see the stars, as I am wont to do, I noticed three lights in a triangular formation moving very rapidly to the South. The lights were about as bright as stars and seemed to be very high in the sky. From the time I noticed them until the time they left the horizon it was, at most, 10 seconds. The thing that was very bizarre was that all three of the lights oscillated or &quot;jiggled&quot; very rapidly in a lateral direction as they flew.", "I was having my morning coffee and loooking at the sky for a satellite that passes by every night around that time when i noticed the stars starting to disappear.They were disappearing ina straight line; so i watched longer and noticed a triangular shape about 700ft above me and at a 70 degree angle in the sky then it turned on edge and zip was goneIt was a black triangle approx.200ft by200ft by 250ft in size it made no noise and seemed to float in the sky then it turned on edge about ten ft deep and just zipped away.I didnot report it sooner until a friend said he new someone on the radio reported something similar I worked early morning shifts at that time so it was common for me to be awake and drinking coffee at that time of day.", "OBSERVED TRIANGULAR FORMATION OF LIGHTS AT EST&apos;D 30,000 FEET TRAVELLING S.E.

The light was stationary as long as I was looking. I watched it as best as I could on my way to school on the buss. This happened in the summer at the begining of the school year, either in 1974 or in 1975. I think Skylab was orbiting back then.", "I saw two bright white objects in the night sky swoop down and out of the horizon.I was driving north and the two objects were observed ahead of me in the NNW sky.

The evening was warm and balmy, and large white clouds drifted by at low altitude. I was driving back home from the local convenience store around 9:30pm, and had just pulled onto my street when I saw a bright, white flash apparently emanating from a large cloud. It was roughly directly ahead of me, and at some unknown altitude. I thought at first that it was an airliner with brighter strobe lights (the FAA is always testing new anti-collision devices). I think I remarked out loud, &quot;He&apos;s too low!!&quot;. He was not only low, I felt, but also off course! That was definitely not the approach to the Mpls/St.Paul airport. I pulled into the garage, stowed my groceries, and decided to wander out to the deck since it was so nice outside. I had been outside only a few seconds when I saw another flash. It looked like the same one I&apos;d seen before, but now it was southeast of me instead of almost straight south. It appeared to come from inside the same cloud as before, although it might have been below it and in front of it, creating its own haze. Since I had sighted it from 2 different angles, I was able to mentally triangulate its location, and later used a city map left over from a Street Light Project to do the same with a ruler. This thing was located approximately over a neighbor&apos;s house or front yard across the street, not much higher than the tops of the trees - perhaps 1 1/2 to 2 times the height of the local elm trees. I watched it for quite a while and noticed that it flashed about every 30 seconds. Finally, I was able to see - very dimly - a searchlight beam originating from the south, going around in a circle. Whenever the searchlight beam aligned with the object, there would be a flash apparently in the cloud. The searchlight beam was far too high to hit the object and cause a reflection. The closest advertising searchlights (used by car dealers, etc.) would have been about a mile away since the area is entirely residential up to that point. At that distance, a searchlight beam would have been hundreds of feet high by the time it intersected my neighborhood. Why I didn&apos;t try to photograph it or turn my binoculars on it, I&apos;ll never know. I simply stood there and thought, &quot;Isn&apos;t that interesting....&quot; - knowing full well that it was very interesting, and unexplainable. Finally, I went into the house and watched the 10 o&apos;clock news til about 10:30. When I came out again, the flashing was still continuing! I went in again, and when I came out at perhaps 11:00pm, the clouds had drifted away. But the flashing continued with each sweep of the searchlight!! The flash seemed to be enveloped in a haze when it occurred, but there was no visible haze in the air prior to the flash. There was also no &quot;object&quot; visible. This went on until midnight when the searchlight quit. So it was hovering (?) near my house for at least 2 1/2 hours - possibly longer. I mentioned it to a friend in our UFO group (an engineering type), and he had never heard of anything like it either. Since that episode, I&apos;ve purchased a videocamera and a 500,000 candlepower, hand-held, portable searchlight of my own!

They were triangle shaped with three lights at each point of the triangle and one light colored dot-like thing (maybe it was a light) in the middle.  We were driving in the car traveling east towards Ionia.  It was on the southside of the car, directly above me.  I was thinking about the game and I happened to look out the window to try and see the big dipper.  And then I saw the 2 objects.  They flew together about 20-30 ft. apart, never breaking their formation.  It was kinda scary, so I stopped looking at them for a little while.  Then I had to look at them again, because I was interested.  And amazingly they were still there, as if they were following the car or something.  At first no one believed me, but then my sisters saw the same thing a few nights later and then they started to believe me too.  Now whenever I&apos;m alone I get this insecure feeling that someone or something is watching me.", "the object first appeared as a star.  A blue line somewhere between a meteor tail and a long rocket boost appeared from it.

We saw an object in the sky that looked like a star.  Suddenly a long comet-like tail appeared behind it.  It was long, thin and very bright.  Instantly, it turned from a blue tail to a perfectly square and straight bar that was mostly orange.  At times, the point of light looked as if it had a very smooth metallic object below it.  The light and disc were almost surreal.  It faded in and out as if maybe it was bordering our visual spectrum or something.  As we were driving from Encino to Woodland Hills, it shifted position in relation to us.  It moved from in front of us to behind us in that 10-mile drive, meaning that it must have been very close to us.", "I saw 2 orange-red craft closeup felt static electric.On 23 June 1995 I was employed as a long haul truck driver.

I watched for about 5 mins. or more before I reached for a cheap camera I had above the windshield in a map Pocket. I got out and stood on the top step (running board) and heard no sounds from the craft, there were no lights on board and I never felt in danger. I snapped the first shot and then the film advanced automaticlly and as I took the 2nd one there was nothing in the view finder that I could see. I had the film developed a few months later and when I saw the second shot (streaks) I was really surprised because I never saw those streaks through the camera. The first shot is quite a bit dimmer than it really was but is like I remember it.The objects were about1/8th of a mile or less from me. For years I was afraid to tell anyone or show the photos but I know what I saw and it was real. I did lose some time but I have never tried to find out what happened to the time.

It was located SE of me along and above the freeway. The light was noticeably brighter than the headlamps of oncomming automobiles. The light was not a point source: it had a visible diameter perhaps 1/10 of the diameter of a full moon. I observed this object for about two seconds. It was stationary above the freeway and I at first thought it to be a police helicopter monitoring traffic. There was enough ambient light (this was post sundown but before twilight) to readily see details on cars and scenery miles away. I had the impression that I could almost see some sort of vehicle behind the bright light in the sky. There were neither wings nor identifying aircraft lights visible on the object. I looked down to size up the traffic around me for no longer than one second and then looked back up to try to identify the airborn object. It was gone. I looked all over the southeastern sky and could see no trace of it.

We were traveling due east. It didn&apos;t register as odd because it appeared small and distant. I checked my watch and it was 0505. I kept glancing at it because it was directly in front of us and I asked my rider if she saw it too. She said she did and we discussed it&apos;s characteristics. We watched it steadily for the next ten minutes. When we first saw it it was the size of a baby aspirin at arm&apos;s length. The road was windy at times and the object would disappear behind pine trees. When the road would turn back due east it would appear again in the exact same spot. It was totally motionless and stationary in the sky. We watched it until the Perryville turnoff came up. By this time it was the size of a quarter at arm&apos;s length. Just before we turned off a vertical gray bar appeared at the front of the object and immeadiatly moved to the rear. When this happened the object faded, came back and then disappeared. My rider said &quot;did you see that!&quot; when the gray bar appeared and moved. We both agreed that we had seen the same things. The object tilted about a 10 degree angle to the horizon front to back and about 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon. The sky was clear with no other objects such as airplanes or balloons in view. There was a solid bank of low clouds on the horizon up to about 5 degrees. The object was well above the cloud bank.

The interview and investigation was conducted by this writer on 4Jan98 while serving a Chief Field Investigator for MUFON of Georgia and as an ISUR FI. The two witnesses in this case were found to be middle aged parents living in Troup County Georgia. The couple have several grown children, one of which is a Police Officer with a major west Georgia police department. The couple maintain a very nice rural home, which is a focal point for their grandchildren and many neighborhood children. The witnesses go to great lengths to provide informal recreation in the form of various ball games for these grandchildren and others in the neighborhood.  The husband had recently suffered a stroke which affected his speech somewhat, but seemingly not his thought processes.  The wife is still employed by a major corporation in Troup County. During the summer of 1969, this couple was living in Freedonia Alabama, near the Georgia line, the state line being delineated by the Chattahoochee River running north-south. They were employed in nearby Lagrange Georgia on the 3rd shift at a major corporation.  On the event night, they were enroute to work at about 10:15PM.  Driving east toward the state line on Glassbridge Road, they had to cross two bridges very close together, the Weehatkee Bridge and the Chattahoochee Bridge. The Mrs. indicated that as they approached one of the bridges (she does not recall which one) they noticed a circle of lights hovering just over the tree tops at the edge of the water on the left (north) side of the roadway.  Her husband stopped the car in the road in order to get a better view. She said that the light/object was about 25 to 30 yards away, at an estimated height of 40 or 50 feet.  She added that the circle of light(s) appeared white in color and about the intensity of Christmas lights, the whole configuration being about the size of a china saucer held at arm&apos;s length.  She recalled no dimming or blinking, but could not recall if there were individual lights or one solid unbroken light circle.  She added that she did get the impression there was something solid and substantial behind the glow, even though there was no sound.  After watching this hovering circle for a minute or so, a second identical circle/object appeared, possibly coming out from behind the first, and they hovered side by side.  The Mrs. then picked up a large flashlight in the vehicle and reached across her husband and shined it directly toward the nearby objects (!). She indicated that the beam projected out, but seemed to &apos;get lost&apos;, as when you shine a flashlight straight up into the air and the beam disappears after going so far. Her husband knocked her hand down, telling her to stop (!!). At the same time, she noticed that the objects seemed to seperate a little bit as if from having the light shined on them. One object suddenly accelerated away over the top of the car to the south at a high rate of speed, and was immediately followed by the second (both still silent).  She commented that they seemed to go from a hover to this high depature speed instantly, and she had never seen ANYTHING move that fast.  She saw them quickly recede to the south, seeming to go upwards a little as they flew out of sight in just seconds. No human or EM effects were noticed.  Witness did not recall the weather other than it was summer and not raining. An interview was also conducted with the husband, who had difficulty speaking due to his stroke.  His personal account was similar to that of his wife with just enough difference to indicate the truth was being related i.e just a slightly different personal perspective was being accounted.  He recalled a bluish tint to the glowing lights and felt that they followed more closely the direction of the roadway when leaving with the incredible burst of speed. Both witnesses were shocked by this event and had held it in for 29 years. Their home in Troup County is within a location known as the &apos;Troup-Heard UFO Corridor&apos; due to the extreme number of UFO reports by reliable witnesses in recent years. The publicity generated by these reports convinced this couple that they would be taken seriously if a report was filed.  (Note:  The event site in this case is also in the same &apos;Troup-Heard Corridor&apos;, although the creation of West Point Lake in the 70&apos;s has done away with the bridges described above and obliterated many miles of river). Both witnesses seemed to be completely truthful with this FI and the various cognitive and kinesic interview techniques uncovered no inconsistancies or indications of deception. This couple is exactly what they appear to be; hard working and loving parents proud of their successful grown children and doting on their many grandchildren. (To quote the Mrs. &quot;One thing we do right down here is raise kids!&quot;) Anyone with information relating to this case, or a similar case in the same area/time frame, can contact this investigator at&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mufonga@webtv.net&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Tom Sheets, FSA Scot, State Director MUFONGA-ISUR Board", "Saw 5 orange lights in the sky viewed them for awhile they formed the big dipper then dimmed outWas driving south on Alpine Road when I happened to look out toward the east and saw five very bright orange lights in the sky.  I knew immediately that they were out of place and were acting in a way that there was no label that I could put on them from previous experiences.  My daughter and I pulled into the parking lot where we were going and to my amazement they formed the big dipper one star short.  Then they started to dissapear one at a time slowly then there was only one left.  I looked in the paper but could find no accounts and it was a full week before accounts began to appear along with someone in So.Belot who has a video tape. A stream seem to come down from one object", "OBSERVED ONE VERY LARGE TRIANGLE WITH 5 LIGHTS TRAVELING TO THE NORTH EAST, POSSIBLY IN EARTH ORBIT.BACKGROUND INFO,I AM A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN BRIDGEWATER MA. WORK THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT AND ENJOY STAR GAZING (FINDING AND IDENTIFYING CONSTELATIONS) WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT FOR MANY YEARS IVE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE NIGHT SKY,BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON.I HAVE SEEN SATELIGHTS, COMETS, FALLING STARS AND EVEN SKYLAB WHEN TOLD WHEN AND WHERE TO FIND IT.AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER I AM TRAINED TO BE OBSERVANT AND TAKE NOTE OF ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. IN ORDER TO BETTER PROTECT THE PUBLIC. IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1997 (I FORGOT THE EXACT DATE)WHILE ON DUTY I DID OBSERVE A GROUP OF STARS THAT I DID NOT RECOGNIZE, VERY LARGE IN THE NIGHT SKY,FORMING A TRIANGLE.CONSISTING OF THREE WHITE STARS IN THE FRONT AND TWO RED STARS AT THE BASE OF THE TRIANGLE. I ASKED MY SELF WHAT CONSTELATION IS THAT, NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. THE NEXT THING I OBSERVED WAS THAT THIS (GROUP OF STARS) WAS MOVING. IT APPERED TO BE IN EARTH ORBIT MOVING IN A NORTH EASTERLY DIRECTION. I OBSERVED THIS IN THE SKY FOR 10 MIN. ITS SPEED WAS  CONSTANT (ON THE SLOW SIDE) AND THE TRIANGLE FORMATION NEVER VARRIED. I ALSO LOOKED THROUGH BINOCULARS,HOWEVER THIS DID NOT REVEAL ANY NEW DETAILS.THE NIGHT SKY WAS CLEAR AND I DID OBSERVE THE OBJECT UNTIL IT WENT OVER THE HORIZON. MY THOUGHTS BASED ON MY OBSERVATIONS, MY FRST OBSERVATION THAT THIS WAS A GROUP OF STARS WAS INCORECT BECAUSE THIS OBJECT WAS MOVING. THE FACT THAT WITH A EXPERIENCED EYE FOR STAR GAZING THAT I MISTOOK THIS AS A CONSTELATION REVEALS ITS SIZE. IF MY OBSERVATION THAT IT WAS FLYING IN EARTH ORBIT WAS CORRECT THAN THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A MILE WIDE,MORE OR LESS, IT WAS TRULY HUGE. ANOTHER POSIBILTY IS THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN THREE SEPERATE CRAFT FLYING IN PERFECT FORMATION IN EARTH ORBIT,ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE THIS TO ME AT THE TIME,I HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO RULE THIS CONCLUSION OUT. THE FORMATION SEEMED TO ME TO BE TO PERFECT TO SUPPORT THIS CONCLUSION. THE REASON THAT I HAVE REPORTED THIS SO LATE IS I HAVE JUST GOT ON THE INTERNET WITHIN THE PAST WEEK.SINCE I HAVE GOTTEN ON THE INTERNET I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING U.F.O. FILES TO SEE IF ANY ONE HAS SEEN ANY THING SIMILER TO WHAT I HAVE SEEN. I DID FIND ONE WHICH HAPPENED IN RENO NEV ON 11/15/97.WHOEVER READS MY REPORT SHOULD CROSS REFERENCE IT AGAINST TIS REPORT. IF I HAD TO PLACE A DATE ON MY SIGHTING I&apos;AM SURE THAT IT WAS IN NOVEMBER OF 1997 THE DATE WAS SOME WHERE AROUND THANKSGIVING,DEFFINETLY THE LATTER THIRD OF THE MONTH."]
