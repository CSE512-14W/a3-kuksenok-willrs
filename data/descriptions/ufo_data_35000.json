["Possible U.F.O. captured in photo, while out  by the river with my dog, at dusk, snapping some &quot;Moon Rise&quot; pic&apos;s w/digital camera.I&apos;m a 45 year(young)woman, living in a rural community 12 miles N.E.of Payson Az.While taking my dog out for a romp at nearby river, decided to get out my digital camera and take some pic&apos;s.  The sun had just gone down behind the mountain,and the moon was coming up at same time time.  Started snapping pic&apos;s of the moon.. until it got too dark. Did not notice anything unusual while there,In fact,i was the only one in the area,a nice quiet time of evening. Also no air traffic that i saw while there either. When dark,drove back to our cabin to make dinner ect. Had not looked at pic&apos;s i&apos;d taken,until i loaded them to my c.p.u.3-4 day&apos;s later. While viewing my pic&apos;s, I then noticed an object in only one of the &quot;Moon&quot; shot&apos;s i&apos;d taken. Not a plane, or a bird ??

The light erradically moved in multiple directions and different velocities (sometimes startlingly fast), yet remained in the general locale originally observed. The object waxed and waned in intensity and color. At one point, a helicopter ventured over to the area, when the object quickly moved in its direction resulting in the chopper making a quick evasive manuveur. At that point, the object broke-off and returned to its former erratic movements including a &apos;falling leaf&apos; pattern. Its size was difficult to estimate, but smaller than the helicopter. I would characterize the movements as kite-like with the exception of the event with the helicopter. That seemed to demonstrate &apos;curiousity&apos;. The sighting lasted about 2 hours, off and on as it was a very cold night and we retreated into the camper for warmth, coming back out for observations.", "More strange lights and even smells over cannock chase.i went downstairs at 3am to get a drink when i had a sudden feeling we were about to have a power cut (outage).  Within one minute of getting upstairs all the lights went out.  i went back downstairs to check the fuse box but the fuse were all on.2 days later a friend text me and said he saw a ufo the other night, i told him to come round and explain.  He said he woke around 3am and through a small gap in his curtains he could see a strange white light in the sky totally stationary one minute, moving up, down, left, right the next.  He said he watched it for an hour and it was definitely no airplane, helicopter or star.  The next day he told his nan who took him quite seriously.  The next day she showed him the local newspaper,  The Burntwood Post, and it had an article about sightings of a ufo by 3 different people.  He said there was an artists impression of 3 lights but my friend only saw 1.  Another person to see it was a lady woken in her sleep by an intense smell.  She looked out the window and saw a light in the sky.  As her husband was downstairs she went down to find him looking out the window also.This happened near pye green, staffordshire.

There was an intense bright light, low on the horizon.  I wondered why an aircraft would be so low as the airport is too far away.  As I approached, the light did not move.  The light was so intense and bright that I cannot find words to accurately describe it.  I kick myself to this day for not stopping - I was in such shock that I kept driving.  As I got closer, the object was above the Troutbrook Exit.  It had to be only 200 feet in the air above me.  It made no sound.   It was silver, triangular shape.  It had a red light on the tip and red and white lights on the bottom.  It had an elongated rectangular door. As I got underneath, I was able to see that the underside was concave.  After I passed it, I could no longer see it behind me.  It vanished - it was completely silent.  In early December, 2005 I saw the same intense light above my house as I came down my street.

This is a point that is right along the water.  My father and sister got tired and they decided to go back to the room.  Myself and my mom decided we would just hang around for little while longer since it was so nice outside.  I then questioned her about the &quot;North Star&quot;. We were looking around for it and I spotted this bright light in the sky.  I thought that it was the &quot;North Star&quot; because they say that it is the brightest star or whatever. But as I watched it, it didn&apos;t &quot;twinkle&quot; like all the other stars seem to do.  As both my mom and I watched this bright light it began to move. Now it didn&apos;t move fast like most UFO sightings claim and it wasn&apos;t an odd shape it looked like a very bright star.  But it started to move very very slowly back and forth.  It moved left to right in kind of a dipping motion. Then it started to increase in size and brightness as if it were getting closer. I started to get a little nervous and started to back away but my mom was fascinated and remained there. Then very slowly the light got very small and became very dull, barely visible. Then after a while it got larger and brighter again. Then all of a sudden it decreased in size very very quickly and it disappeared. It was as if it shot out of the galaxy. This is the strangest thing to this day that either I or my mom have ever seen. Before this event my mom didn&apos;t believe in extra-terrestrial life or UFOs, but i was always interested in alien life and UFOs.

This could be true, however, the lights you normally would see shooting up to the sky were not ever present. The farther you moved away, the larger the distance of the lights would become.

All three did this.Around 7.10pm 6 miles from Swansea, I noticed some stars in the sky. As I focused on the highest star, I noticed it was flashing, but the two below it (diagonally) were also flashing simultaneously. I was convinced they must be planes, but continued to watch them. The lowest in the sky continued to move downwards, whereas the second one followed it relatively slowly, before suddenly moving quickly after it. The highest &apos;star&apos; remained in the same place, and, as I watched it, I suddenly felt as though it was watching me. Once I thought this, it began to &apos;spin&apos; and a pinkish light emanated from it. The other two objects lower in the sky became visible again (behind two houses opposite) and all three objects spun and emanated the same light simultaneously. There was no trail (as in a plane), and no noise. Then all three disappeared very quickly. I&apos;m not a UFO enthusiast, and have never witnessed anything like this before. Around 30 mins later, I noticed a plane moving from the direction where the objects had disappeared, with a bright red flashing light, and a number of white lights all around it. This was a plane which went over my house, and left a trail in the sky. It wasn&apos;t a commercial plane. Planes never travel directly over my house either. I&apos;m pretty skeptical, although try to maintain a sense of critical open-mindedness. I have never seen anything like this before, and felt compelled to share it with others. It really does make you wonder. My profession is psychology - I have a PhD in psychology (one of the most skeptical professions ever), and I&apos;m just finishing a doctorate in clinical psychology.

The objects did not seem to be in formation, however they we clustered/grouped and a number of the objects on the perimeter were moving/swirving in and out of the group.  After the group of objects passed, there was a brighter star-object that followed in the same path.  The trajectory of the objects was right over Logan Airport.

It was early evening and there were no clouds in the sky.  I remember, as do all that were there, looking just above the big pecan tree and seeing a giant (the size of two 747s) eagle that was made out of what it seemed like to be metal.  It a light on the end of the beak and around the wings and on the tail.  It was solid...meaning that the wings did not flap.  It&apos;s head was turned to where looking up, all you could see was one eye.  The color was very detailed and there was no sound.  It just hovered.  We all were standing there in awe looking at the eagle when my granddad started yelling at us to get in the house and go to the closet.  The last thing I remember was running into the closet and everyone was crying.  My stepfather started to close the door and everyone started yelling for granddad.  My stepfather said that he would go get him and he closed the door.  That&apos;s the last thing I remember.   What I do remember, I remember very vividly...as do all that were present.

Lauderdale prestige golf community.I lived on the 6th floor of a condominium in a gated, private golf community.  It had a balcony that faced (what I remember may be) Commercial Blvd. in Ft. Lauderdale.  I had gone out on the balconey (as was my habit) to watch a boyfriend drive out of the complex on his way home in the early morning hours.  It was a beautiful and clear night.  As I hung over the balconey watching for the boyfriend&apos;s tail-lights (which he&apos;d tap to say goodbye), I heard a very low, throbbing sound to the back and right side of the building.  I had a good view of the space between the condos nearest me and I peered around the corner.  I saw a &quot;craft&quot;, which I at first thought was some kind of advertising thing-- because lights were revolving around the mid-section slowly, like a marquee of some kind.  It also was bathed from the top and bottom by soft red and green light-- I cannot remember at this time which color was at the top or at the bottom, red or green. But those were the two colors.  As it moved between the buildings, very, very, slowly, I saw it was, well, a saucer.  An honest-to-God &quot;flying saucer&quot;.  It was no more than 75 feet from me on the balcony. It was so close that I could see the &quot;windows&quot;. It was dull, gray metallic looking and seamless.  It had a dome-shape on both top and underside.  It was well-proportioned. It had &quot;windows&quot; or &quot;ports&quot; encircling the middle circumference that revolved slowly.  I could not see into these &quot;windows&quot; as the light seemed to be opaque.  The &quot;windows&quot; were similar to, I guess, airliner windows; rounded at the corners, appearing to be slightly recessed.  The light was not bright, but not glowing, either, possibly a little bit &quot;fuzzy&quot;.  They revolved slowly and clockwise.  The red and green glow(s) at the top and the undersurface pulsed, but only slightly.  The sound it made I have best described as a low &quot;warbling&quot; of two tones. I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off it, of course.  I was trying to believe what I was seeing.  It continued over the grounds moving south, and the thing that freaks me out to this day is that it started to follow the exact same road my boyfriend was traveling on out of the complex.  It was pretty much right behind him.  I thought, &quot;He MUST be able to see this thing, it&apos;s right on his tail.&quot; This was BEFORE cell phones... I lost sight of the road out after a few minutes and couldn&apos;t figure out if the craft had left the area over the road, but I think it did as it got closer to what I THINK was Commercial Blvd.  At that point it quickly gained altitude, like pretty much straight up into the air.  It didn&apos;t go up slowly, but just popped up like a balloon on a string you let go of, and then took off quickly southwest. I called the Ft. Lauderdale police immediately and asked if anyone had reported a UFO in the area around Environ.  They simply said, &quot;no&quot;.  I didn&apos;t make a report, I just said thanks and figured I&apos;d read something in the paper the next day.  I didn&apos;t see anything reported, however.  I told my boyfriend the next day and he said he wasn&apos;t looking up and behind him, and didn&apos;t notice any lights other than his on the road.  But, the craft didn&apos;t have &quot;beams&quot; shining down on anything, anyway.  The road was fairly well-lit with those orang-y lights.  He believed me.  I&apos;m a sober, logical, well-educated and intelligent person, not very excitable, either. I took the experience in stride.  I know I saw what looked like the classic &quot;flying saucer&quot;, and that&apos;s as simple as it is.  I don&apos;t know if anyone else saw the same one I saw, but I can&apos;t believe I was the only person awake in a great big complex such as the one I lived in at the time.  This sighting was smack dab in the middle of an extremely well-populated and popular area.  It still makes me wonder why, if this was an extra-terrestrial craft, why it would chose to show itself so low to the ground and in a place where it could expect to be seen clearly if anyone looked out a window or was walking a dog. I&apos;ve told other people in a matter-of-fact way exactly what I saw.  I never thought to find a website like this to report to until I finally got mad at the zillionith TV program about UFOs STILL with no explanation about similar sightings and went out to find a place to report my experience to add to all the others.

I&apos;m positive these quotes were not something the newspaper had said and I am also not sure of exactly how long the ship was there but I know many people seen it driving across the bridges to get to work down town as did the traffic controller that moniters traffic from his news cam via helicopter. This was a huge thing. I&apos;m hoping you can help me find more on this. My other incident was in the late 1990&apos;s. Myself and a boyfriend at the time were standing outside talking on a warm summer night at a desolate softball diamond behind the appts I used to live in altoona, Ia. All of the sudden we look up and there is a flat shaped saucer. You could see the dimension of it so well due to the full moon. There were no lights on the craft that we could see. we both watched this as I would hover in one spot for 10-15 seconds then it would move straight to its left and stop and hover there where it stayed for much longer. At this point we went inside to get my dad to come out and see it adn of course he insisted we were seeing things and that we were. I grabbed an old telescopr that most likely was going give me no help since it was very old and we came back out where it was still there. I was so quite out side that it almost scared us but intrigued us even more. No sooner did I get the telescope out of its holder, the saucer shot straight out to the south and dissapeared. There is no way this was shooting star, or a plane or anything else made by humans as planes and such cannot hover in one spot and move at the speed of light with no noise whatsoever. There was not a trail, sonic boom, nothing. I am now 33 years old and to this day I believe in what I seen what not my imagination nor was it the person I was with.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When he mentioned it I instantly recalled the event and how it got pushed back in my mind I&apos;ll never know. Anyway,my ex was a young Methodist minister and was assigned 3 small churches in and about Ripley.We call it a circuit. We lived in a small parsonage in the Edith community which was a bit in the country. My Mother had gone with us on the move to help with my daughter who was 4 at the time. We&apos;re from Mississippi. My ex.was going to school at Lambuth college in Jackson, Tn had 3 churches and boy were things hectic. Anyway we had an elderly couple who lived next to us that we&apos;d become friendly with. They were in bad health so we took it upon ourselves to sort of check on them. They lived about 350 to 400 feet from us if that and had a huge garden spot to the side of their house and back view of ours. Our bedroom window faced their garden and part of the house. We&apos;d been in bed for awhile and my mom comes knocking on the door and says,&quot;children, gret up,get up, there&apos;s something going on at the _____ next door! I wake up and think what in the world now. I was on the right side of the bed with the window next to me and when I looked in that direction I saw lights flashing. My ex was awake at the same time and said,I&apos;ll bet its an ambulance. Mama,by this time was in the room and was going on about,&quot;look at that ,its an airplane! I&apos;m trying to get awake and say Mama,how in the world would an airplane get out there?!!! So I peeked through the window,well we all werepeeking and there was this thing flashing all these multicolored lights right in the middle of these folks garden. I told my ex,Man that&apos;s ot an ambulance, why would they be in the garden out back, and have you ever seen an ambulance like that. This thing looked like a christmas tree lit up. there were red,blue,green,yello,white and amber lights just flashing all over it. I mean, if anyone had driven by,they couldn&apos;t have missed it. It looked like it was a pretty good size,the garden area had a lot of land on the back side. It didn&apos;t make any noise and it seemed like it was just a little above the ground. Mama is saying she thinks its a drug drop from a helicopter, I&apos;m half awake and trying to sort this out and get her to calm down and be quiet. My ex is just WOW,look at that. I tell Mama, its not a helicopter,its got the wrong lights,its quiet and why in the world would anyone drop something in the_____garden in podunk Tn. I don&apos;t really know what I was thinking,it was just so weird. so we watched it for a long time. It just kept flashing and seemed to be turning, it kinda looked like a lit up turnip. That sounds silly but is easily understood. My daughter doesn&apos;t remember too much of this but woke up and thought it was Santa Claus. The lights didn&apos;t seem to have any pattern,they were just flashing all over this thing. What my ex and I did notice was that the lights didn&apos;t seem to be shing outward in a long direction but were confined pretty close, and cast shadows. By now,we&apos;re wondering why the ____ haven&apos;t woke up and noticed something strange in their garden.My ex had the bright idea of just going out there and finding out what was going on. I asked him if he was crazy,didn&apos;t he realize that we didn&apos;t really know what that thing was,my mom told him it was drug dealers and he&apos;d be killed. I mean this was just really,really surreal. Mr. Davenport,at this time I don&apos;t think UFO had even crossed our minds. I know Mama didn&apos;t. That would be just too far out of her realm of reality and experience. So we watched some more. We remarked that if it was a helicopter we&apos;d hear something,It was so close I could have probably hit it with a rock from our back yard. About that time,Mama pulled the curtain open wider to get a better view and I was trying to get her to quiet down and don&apos;t right in the window and the thing beamed a whitish ,blue light right at the window. Well whatever we thought it was, we all knew we&apos;d been spotted. ___and I hit the floor with the baby,and Mama started crying and screaming that we were going to be killed. I remember peeping up at the bottom of the window and seeing this thing out there sorta of shifting and this light going through our room like a searchlight. Then it just shut off, the object rose slowly and just eased on. No big burst of speed, or anything like that. Mama wanted to call the police about drug dealers,my ex started the UFO thing and I remeber telling them,look, we can&apos;t call with wild stories about drug dealers cause that implicate the old folks next door, and we really didn&apos;t know anything of the sort, I told my ex that, we were new,in a goldfishbowl being in the ministry and young,what would people out there think of their new preacher seeing ufos in the neighbors garden? And God forgive me,I told my little one that it was santa checking the area out and that if she told anyone he wouldn&apos;t come back. The next day,I went over to the ____ house and asked them if they heard noises the night before. They told me they went to bed around 7 and didn&apos;t wake up until 6. They had a big,old house and probably wouldn&apos;t have noticed much anyway as their room was on the opposite side. I eased around and took a look at their garden area and there was no sign of any kind of depression,suggesting a landing,but the old stalks in the garden were whipped around.Looking back now,this was a very extrordinary event,maybe even more so than I know.How this got into the back part of my mind is the real mystery. But I was just 29 years old in a strange place and trying to be the perfect preacher&apos;s wife and model mom. I just installed a scanner and tomorrow am going to e-mail a drawing of what we saw. I&apos;m 50 now,my ex is 53 and my mom is 76. I don&apos;t know what we saw. Neither does my ex. My mom to this day still believes it was drug-runners as she calls them. Me,my ex,who lives in Memphis and my Mom would have no trouble answereing any questions about this. Don&apos;t take my sense of humor relating this as this is some kind of joke, its just that it was just that way. Since then I&apos;ve seen a &quot;few&quot; strange things and have no reason to mislead anyone. I just think by reporting what we see only helps us get a grasp on this thing. I would like to add that my mom is a very fine lady and pillar of her church. My ex is a man who I don&apos;t think would even know how to fabricate something and me.... I just tell it like it is.

The sky was completely overcast and my star was in front of where the mountain outcrop would be behind the city, so it was no star and no one was driving behind me or on the opposite side of the interstate, so the light could not be a reflection of headlights in my windshield.  However, the oval light stayed hovering over La Grande long enough that I was able to drive several miles closer to it and I was able to distingish faint lines dividing the oval light into quarters, and somehow I got the impression that inside the quarters were several tightly pacted lights within, like stadium lights, but I could not see past the light to count them individually. When I started to pass under an eletrical weather hazzard sign that warns people of dense fog or winds in the pass behind La Grande, the light started to move.  It made a wide turn and became super thin, like it had turned on its side, and I watched it disappear in a straight line to the east.  I have watched jets cross the sky many times, but this object left no smoke trail and the light disappeared in about five seconds while it seems to take jets forever to cross the sky. I have no idea what it could have been but I would love to see one again.  It had been so beautiful and I felt peaceful for having looked upon it.  The closest thing I can compare it to is a diamond filled with starlight.  I really could have used a camera right then so I could have looked on it always.", "Low flying angular object seen near Hollis Crossroads. Heflin, Alabama. Jan. 28 2006Me and three friends were on our way to Anniston, Alabama in two seperate vehicles. It was around 6 and it was dusk. There was still light in the sky and we could see an outline of the object we saw soon after. We had just turned at Hollis Crossroads and were driving down the road when we saw what was either a very low flying object, or an enormous object at a higher altitude. It was trianglular with a flashing green light on it. It moved slowly, or slower than a plane would, across our field of vision, which was the windshield since it was almost directly above us.  There were trees on either side of the road and it took up most of what part of the sky we could see. We called our friends in the other vehicle to ask them if they saw it, and they said they had and described it like we did. They were about 30 seconds in front of us and said they saw it going the other direction, as if it made a loop or a circle. There wasn&apos;t any airfield near by that we know about and it didn&apos;t look like any plane we had ever seen. If it was an airplane, it would have to be either landing, taking off, flying way too low, or gigantic. When we arrived at school the following Monday we found that 1 or 2 other people had seen the same thing at the same location. It was unlike anything we had ever seen.", "many green,blue and red light.  no sound just + just hovering. location 78611", "mysterios grey silent blob like shape errily glides across from my viewOk first of the date is not exact due to me not actually thinking about posting my sighting on the net anywhere and to be honest it has taken alot of years to come to terms with this sighing. I have tried to convince myself that i was dreaming. So it was a thursday evening i no this as i was waiting 4 my fave program to come on TV called top gear it started at 8.30 in the evening. One of the most strange things about this sighing is that i felt compelled to go to my window as if it wanted me to see it while waiting 4 this program to start had i been watching sumthing of a longer duration i would of never seen it and to be honest would of been much more happy to not of seen it. The instant i got to my window and looked out i see this object, first i thouhgt it was a grey bollon but almost instantly realised it wasnt. After about 20 seconds i was frozen still as i watched this grey blob like thing silently glide across from my feild of view (from left to right). i watched almost till it was out of sight as it started to go behind a tree and i swear it stopped dead in the sky 4 a moment then carried on till i could no longer see it. i wanted to rush out to follow it up the feilds but i was to shocked to move i looked around to see it any1 else on the street was looking but i think it was only me. must point out that it was still daylite altho the sun had just started to go down. This object must of flown over the local airport which isnt that big as it was on a same flight path as an aircraft taking off. Later that night by about midnight there was an awful lot of aircraft activity like iv never seen b4. i have spent the last year researching various sights relating to UFOs, military top secret aircraft and the like.During this time of looking around on the net i found a short mpeg video taken from a cctv street camera in kent which shows the almost indenticle grey blob craft at about the same hight same speed as what i saw and even more chilling is that the date time on the cctv camera coincides with my sighting.

Neither of us have ever seen a UFO previous to this occasion, and have only heard stories. I was out on my apartment balcony which faces south, just after night-fall, when I noticed a orange looking star-like object slowly streaking &quot;down&quot; the sky in the west. The character of the object was that of a comet. The object began above us and to the west of us, and was slowly streaking down in the western sky. The object was moving at an angle so that it may have been only reaching the western horizon, and not actually falling. As the object neared the horizon, it disappeared into the clouds. Six main points of interest that may be helpful to anyone reading this for investigative purposes.1 - my wife and I both agree that the object had a tail (comet like tail).2 - my wife and I both agree that the object was shifting horizontally in the sky, and that the tail was not effected - the entire tail was shifting with it (jumping to the left and right).3 - My wife and I both agree that there was some sort of activity around the object, appearing as dancing blue specks of light to us.4 - Upon calling my brother who lives about 50 miles away in Greenville, TX he confirmed the same comet like light with a comet like tail, in the same part of the sky, headed the same direction. He saw this briefly before it disappeared into the clouds. (Brother is a religious conservative who would never believe he saw a UFO - he felt this was a comet).5. My wife and I researched every website we could find on the sky that night, and found no reports of a comet. The Perseids meteor shower was scheduled for within the next couple of days - but this object moved much much slower than any shooting star/meteor that I&apos;ve ever seen.6. Both my wife and I agree that the object was an orange ball of light, looking about the size in the sky that a planet looks like when we see mars, only it was moving with a tail streaking behind it. Myself (age 26)- Open minded individual, who has shown intrest in UFO/paranormal activity.Wife (age 24) - Not open minded, does not show intrest in UFO/paranormal, and pokes fun at these types of things (feels there must be some logical explanation for what we saw that night, like a sattelite or something).Brother (age 29) - Definately not open minded, very conservative (also feels there must be some logical explanation for what we saw that night, thinks it was a comet).

On 11/13/04 at around 10pm to 10:30pm, I was passing through Circleville, OH on my way to Ohio Furnace, OH. As I neared Circleville I noticed three bright, fire colored orange lights lined up in a row. They were front to back from my point of vission. Very quickly however, the lights went out one at a time from back to front. The best way I could describe this is to have you imagine three radio tower lights on a mountain, and a cloud comming from behind at a brisk pace and obscuring them. Anyway, the lights proceded to come on, and go out repeatedly, never showing in the same location twice, and never together again either. This made it very difficult to count them. I can say for sure there were three, but there could have easily been more. I didn&apos;t stop, but watched this &quot;weird&quot; occurance until I could no longer see the lights.

I had decided to take my morning break from work and have a walk around the neighborhood, specifically so that I could watch the Blue Angels practicing their maneuvers.  There is a park near the bank where I work that has a large, open field.  I decided to linger a bit longer than normal in the beautiful, clear, warm day and watch the planes work their magic.So, I was standing in the middle of this field facing North.  The Blue Angels were flying all around the sky, so I was just standing in one position and trying to catch as much of it as possible.  It was a very clear day.  All of a sudden, I noticed an object almost directly above me very, very far up in the atmosphere.  It was something between a cigar and an egg shape and had almost a khaki color to it.  It was moving extremely slowly from west to east.  I have never seen a flying object move this slowly before.  I was astonished at seeing this mainly because the Blue Angels did not seem to notice it at all.  (Granted, its position was much higher than their own.)The object just continued on its trajectory at the same speed the entire time.  It seemed to be pushed by the wind more than move on its own power; however, that said, it was a very regular speed and constant direction.  There were no windows on the object, but it did seem to have the same shape and indentations as the object sited in St Louis this past summer.  There were some very high cirrus clouds in the area, and the object seemed to disappear and reappear through those clouds, so that might give an indication as to its altitude.  I watched the object for probably 10 minutes (which gives you an idea of how really slowly it was moving), and then suddenly felt very disturbed by it and walked back to work.  No one else seemed to notice the object, though there were several other people walking through the park and commenting on the Blue Angels.The reason I decided to post this report was that the object looks almost identical to the report from St Louis posted on your main page today.  The only difference is that this object I saw was not metallic.  It had a khaki color and no irridescent or reflective qualities at all.I thought it might be a weather balloon, but never having seen one, I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s what it was.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

DavidsonAt around 6:45 PM on December 3, 2005, a friend and I were outside on our back deck looking to the crystal clear night sky facing west when we saw two large black triangle shaped objects move slowly and at a low altitude (500-1000 feet) directly over our house from the north west Mt. Davidson area to the south east.  We live in San Francisco on the south east side of Mt. Davidson at the cross street of Terasita and Los Palmos in Miraloma Park. The two distinct objects that we observed were flying in side by side formation and appeared to moving as one.  Both craft were perfect equilateral triangles with pulsating dim star like lights on each tip of the two triangles, six lights in total.  These were most definitely two solid black large triangle shaped objects which from underneath appeared to be much darker than the night sky as they passed in front other stars in the night sky and were darker than they night sky with no moon.  The objects were very well cloaked (best way to describe it) against the background of the night sky and could have easily been mistaken as constellations but they were moving slowly which is what caught our attention. The entire sighting lasted for approximately 30-45 seconds.  The objects did not appear to change speed, direction or altitude and moved slowly together overhead until they dimmed out of sight near the south side San Francisco crossing over 280 onto the north west of the San Bruno mountain range.   I have been an amateur astronomer for over twenty five years now and I can say with conviction that these were definitely Not planes, satellites, blimps, helicopters, the International Space Station, meteorites or fire balls.  They were two solid triangle shaped objects that move in perfect formation together and made absolutely no noise as traveled directly over head.  The two craft were identical in size and were significantly larger than a 747. The weather conditions in San Francisco last night crystal clear and ideal for sky watching.  The crescent moon had also just dropped below the south western horizon about 15 minutes prior before we witnessed this once in a life time sighting.  We were both truly shocked by what we had just seen to the extent that we felt it necessary to call into two local TV stations (CBS 5 &amp; KGO 7) to report what we witnessed. I am in my late thirties and the other person in their earlyy 40s.  We both have always been rather skeptical of alien spacecraft visiting Earth simply given the vast distances between stars and the time required to travel such a distance without bending space/time.  But having just what we say with our own two eyes list night, we can now say with absolute conviction that they were highly advanced craft that ones gut feeling tells them to be &apos;other worldly&apos;.  Nither of us had been drinking nor were we in any other altered mental state of consciousness at the time of the sighting. If anyone else saw any strange objects lights in the Bay Area night sky last night please feel free to contact me.  I consider this experience one of the most amazing events of my lifetime that I cannot refute.  Weather the objects were deeply classified military X-Project space craft or Alien cannot be proven (yet) but the objects had an eerie feeling to them in the way that they moved together and at the angle the triangles were positioned in flight.  The profound impact of this event will forever change how I look at humanity and that such highly advanced technology does exists regardless of its origin. I have not heard anyone else reporting what we saw last night in the media or on the internet but hopefully other people in the Bay Area witnessed the same event.", "I witnessed a series of lights traveling from the north (heading south) over the nation&apos;s capital from my apartment balcony. At first I thought it was a constellation (like Orion&apos;s belt), but it was moving in a worm-like wiggle formation toward the National Mall.  There appeared to be about 8-12 lights in a sequence and wiggled in a straight trajectory. I grabbed my binoculars to get a better look, but by then, the light formation was fading from my view. I didn&apos;t see any type of shape or solid formation. It was definitely within the atmosphere and it made no sound. I thought it being DC, it might be some experimental flying military craft, but the fact that it made no sound and wiggled made me suspicious.((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no e-address.  We do not know whether this is intended to be a serious report.  PD))", "Four vertical lightsI don&apos;t know if these were crafts or not.  My son and I were at the Giant Market on Linglestown Road.  In the N.E. sky we saw a warm yellow light.  It divided into two then three, then four lights of the same size lined up vertically.  Then they disappearred.  I then saw a flare just above the tree line and then very small individual points of light blinking on then off in different locations all over that area of sky.  This much of the event probably lasted for about five minutes.  We had seen something similar in the same area of the sky one week previously at approximately the same time when traveling on Linglestown Rd and Progress Avenue.  Fort Indiantown Gap is located in that region and there may be some experimentation going on there.  When I reviewed your listing of other sightings, I saw a siting posted on 5/24/05 of an event that occurred on 4/1/1996 in Harrisburg, PA in the same approximate area.  The sighting was very similar to ours.  If anyone else has seen anything there or may know what it is we saw, I would be very interested in hearing about it.", "Light in the sky disappearsI noticed a ball of yellowish-green light with a very small tail moving quickly across the sky (The tail may have been an illusion because it was moving so quickly).  It was about the size of a pea and very low in the sky.  I pointed it out to my boyfriend, and he saw it too.  Then a few seconds later, it broke up like it disintegrated and was gone.  We both were confused, yet amazed!!!  We have no idea what it could be!  He thought it looked like a missle, but I thought the only thing it could have been was a meteor.  Still don&apos;t know what it was!  Another strange thing that happened 45 minutes earlier, was a huge boom (like a cannon) sounded throughout town and shook the houses.  Many people heard and felt it from miles apart, but no one knew what it was.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  We would welcome other reports.  Please see other reports for this date.  PD))", "Very large and bright flash at treeline - directly in front of meI was with a friend looking at the stars in an empty and dark field. We were pretty acclimatized to the darkness and were able to see very well at this point.  My friend was looking slightly to the left of where the object appeared (if it was at 12 o&apos;clock, she was looking in the 10 o&apos;clock direction).  I was looking directly in that area. All of a sudden this HUGE bright light just &quot;exploded&quot; in the sky right at treeline.  It was very bright and very intense, but there was no sound associated with it.  It was yellow-ish and white.  We came back to the area about 40 minutes later after investigating surrounding areas with no luck.  I saw the flash a second time after spending another 5-10 minutes looking in the sky.  The second time it was a very quick flash of light...bright, but not as large, and above treeline a little farther up in the sky.", "Very bright star/light goes out in millisecondsI was driving the short 5 mile (10 minutes) journey back to my home through very rural English countryside after a small christmas night gathering of friends and had consumed no alcoholic drink or food during this day or evening.I have good eyesight and am an Engineer by trade who&apos;s worked in various military lighting fields with private flying experience and am an observer by nature.Being christmas day evening the roads where very quiet with almost no traffic at all when i noticed what i assumed to be a very bright large twinkling stationary star emitting green and blue light in my 11 o`clock high position while driving.This was the only visible light in the sky and by my judgement a very bright star compared to the normal countryside night sky we have around here but on looking around i could not see any other stars or aircraft navigation lights or anti/coll strobes to compare this Light/star with in my 180 degree arc of view This very bright star remained visible to me for approximately two to three minutes and then completely disappeared in a millisecond as i closed distance on it The sky was a cloudy night and my guess is with a high cloud base of 2000 feet and the wind speed at ground level almost zero I arrived back in my driveway at home in less than two minutes after this star disappeared and the one thing that struck me as i closed my gates while gazing at the spot in the sky was how quiet everything was, no cars or people out and about, wind or weather noise&apos;s, aircraft movements or sound&apos;s in general, a very quiet evening with almost the best chance possible of not being seen, stange huh?", "one object, like large, overly bright star, circular, emitting flashes of color, moving slowly to SW from Latitude N 27.0917  Long W 82.1132 .

My friend and I were about 14 years old.  We were wrestling in a neighbors yard as we did often.  I had my friend pinned down and he was fighting to get up.  All of the sudden, he froze and stared into the sky directly behind me.  I turned around and saw three orange-red circles in a linear fashion.  This object was not moving nor did it make any sound.  It would have been approximately 50 yards in the sky at about a  45 degree angle.  After a few seconds, the object starting moving towards a wooded area about 300 yards away.  We followed it to the woods.  I probably would have never mentioned this except for the strange events that followed.  I honestly do not remember anything after we got to the woods.  I do not remember going home and as far as I can remember, my friend and I have never talked about the incident.  I remember one time mentioning the event in the presence of others and was stopped short of telling the story by the friend that was with me.  The part that has always stuck with me is the way he looked at me.  It actually frightened me and still does to this day.  I have always wanted to ask him about the event but, I always &ldquo;chickened out.&rdquo;  After that incident, I did not mention the event to anyone for at least 9 years.  I, of course, leave out the details of the mystery of the event to the 10 people I have told.  I just say the object disappeared past the woods.  I do not want people to think I am crazy but, I just cannot get the event out of my head.  I just felt I needed to say something.  I have started to report this incident many times but, always erase it and try to forget about it.  The comical thing about me reporting this is the fact that I never planned on doing so.  I wonder how many people out there never do report their stories.  I know of a few that never did.  I bet you would have at least twenty times more reports filed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

However, I do believe that most were natural phenonomen. At least two I witnessed were not. 1987 approx, I was competing on a nocturnal motorsporting event in Wales, UK and witnessed a sighting that many people world wide have seen over the years.  In the sky, approx 60 degrees in front of me (and a crowd of non believers it seed at the time, I stood transfixed to a point in the sky.  An unusual line of 4 stars appeared.  They did not twinkle or move, but they were equidistant.  After a number of minutes these objects begand to move very slowly.  First one object moved from the right to the far left, passing each light in sequence then stoped.  Then another did the same.  This continued for a period of about two to three minutes before they all started to move being joined by further lights all on the same trajectory moving quicker by the minute.  Eventually a number of lights approx 8 to 10 moved back and forth until at what I can onlt describe as light speed (sorry) they shot off in different directions.  A collegue of mine, a lady, locked herself in her car and refused to come out!  This was witnessed by at least a dozen people.  None of which were aware that either of us were looking at the same thing until it ended.  Time did seem to pause for at least 2 hours.  Sounds silly I know but...it happened!  THe second episode was many years later between Christmas and New Year. I was walking through the towns car park on a clear night.  I was aware that there was something amiss above me.  To give a full description of the scene, I was in a built up area with mainly single storey buildings around.  As if a fog filled the sky, an object dusky grey in colour moved almost motionless over head.  This seemed to be, not necessary delta shaped, but simlar, with pale amber lights on each wing.  It took the size of this object to be the size of two large football pitches!  Then without sound one wing overlapped the other and the thing disappeared and the night sky was clear once more.  Where the Heck did it go!!!!  Unfortunately, I had my dog with me at the time so no witness to this sighting. The above are true accounts and believe me, although not frightening to me, would have been to most persons.  Have you any other sightings of similar?  OK  It is Christmas Eve and I am off to stuff the Turkey, then nip out for a beer, so I am not drunk at this moment and am totally genuine.

The light it emitted seemed to be more muted in intensity than the stars or planets, such as Venus. This light had no flicker, nor movement of any kind. Self-illuminated? That was my thought about it. Thquality of this lightimmediately struck me as a bit odd, and it stood out from the rest of the night sky. As I was watching it, I thought I heard jet engines, which I did. Another aircraft passed by, crossing the other vehicle&apos;s path, though clearly not at the same altitude. This is when I took special notice... As the jet appeared to get closer to the path of the first craft, the first craft came to a complete stop...totally stationary...and it sat like this for 10 seconds or so.Once the jet had traveled for about 6 seconds, across the path and beyond, the first vehicle returned to motion and continued on its way. At this time, there was no audible sound from that area of the sky, or anywhere else in the sky...eerily silent. As this vehicle continued on, I watched it for another 5 seconds or so...as I did this, its color changed from the white light it was emitting, to a reddish orange color. Once the color changed ocurred, it streaked out of sight...yes, it accelerated from the speed it had been maintaining to &quot;gone in a second&quot;. No contrail, no sound...just gone.

The night was clear with little to no wind. As I glanced up (toward the south) I noticed flashes of light near Sirius. I thought it was odd because aircraft don&apos;t fly that close together unless they are military. As I looked closer, I noticed that the flashes were not moving and not consistant like aircraft lights. Instead it was as if they were &quot;popping&quot; all around Sirius. There were very faint but observable from my vantage point even with the light pollution from the city. I am also sure I saw some sort of thin green/blue light sreak near the flashes.

It was a clear cool day on 17 or 18 November, 1978 and I was hitchhiking east from Jackson WY to Denver CO on Interstate 80. Outside of Rock Springs WY, I got a ride with a twenty-something year old professional driver who was ferrying a U-Haul truck.He asked me, &quot;Where ya&apos; goin&apos;?&quot; I answered, &quot;To Denver&quot;.He replied, &quot;Sit back, we&apos;re headed all the way...that is if you don&apos;t mind going about 50 mph. That&apos;s all this truck&apos;ll do.&quot; That of course was fine with me. The ride was mostly uneventful. It was a cool sunny day and there seemed to be almost no wind. Sometime mid-afternoon I noticed a point of light blinking due east at about 30 degrees, but I didn&apos;t really give it much thought and put it out of my mind. I figured it was sunlight reflecting off of an aircraft or something. As we headed towards Cheyenne WY it was becoming dark. The light I had noticed hours before had become strangely luminescent compared to the clear moonlit night sky. Things started to get strange when we turned south to go to Denver. The light turned as we turned and remained in front of us.The U-Haul driver became alarmed and pulled over to the side of the road and stopped. &quot;What the heck is that? I said, &quot;I don&apos;t know. I think I saw it blinking in front of us hours ago.&quot; He replied, &quot;Yeah, I saw it too.&quot; Then he continued, &quot;Here let me see.&quot; At this he blinked his headlights on and off as if he was trying to signal whatever it was we were looking at.Suddenly, it appeared to get much closer (about the size of a quarter at arms reach). It seemed to have a cylindrical body with a cone on top, but I couldn&apos;t be sure as this was darkened by five luminous points on its perimeter. Each shot out what seemed to be rods of white light. I remember rolling down my window and I could faintly hear a high-pitched whirring sound. This all happened very fast and frightened the driver. He stepped on the gas. As we sped away, it seemed that we went under the apparition.Excitedly he yelled, &quot;Is that thing followin&apos; us?&quot; At first I said, &quot;No.&quot; Then I rolled the window down all the way, leaned out of it and looked back as far as I could. I came back in, &quot;Yeah, it&apos;s following us.&quot; At this time, I could see out of the corner of my eye it shoot back into the eastern sky and hover from where it had begun before we turned south. We watched it several minutes and just couldn&apos;t believe what we were witnessing. As we talked about it, I glanced to my right at the moonlit mountain landscape. I noticed three or four hazy translucent purple spheres in the distance. I couldn&apos;t tell how far, but they were about the size of a nickel at arms reach. They seemed to be floating slowly, effortlessly, almost bouncing. It seemed as though I could almost see the landscape through them. They each had a smaller amber light that seemed to rotate, somewhat quickly and irregularly, around them. We watched these for sometime also. Again, I glanced to the east and noticed two star-sized points of light moving from north to south. I also noticed another point of light of similar size, further south, that was stationary. For some reason I remember telling myself that when the two moving points of light were in line with the third stationary point of light they would all move together. Surely, just a moment later when they all came on line, they all proceeded &apos;together&apos; and disappeared slowly into the southern horizon. As we entered the Denver city limits we left the purple spheres with their amber companions behind. Only, the original luminous point of light in the eastern sky remained.The driver took me to a part of downtown with which I was familiar. So I wouldn&apos;t inconvenience him I asked to be dropped off. I walked about a mile to my brother&apos;s apartment and knocked on the door. When the door opened I looked up over my right shoulder and could still see the luminous entity/object flickering its shafts of light. It was about 1:00 A.M. so I went in and prepared to retire. I didn&apos;t mention anything to my brother or his roommates until the next morning. I can&apos;t say whether or not I experienced &quot;missing time&quot;.Since then I have been reluctant to refer to what I saw as UFO&apos;s or extra-terrestrial. I have maintained a cynical view of contemporary scientific academia which too often relegates itself to dogma. I have complete conviction that our science at its highest is completely incapable of defining the infinite and infinitesimal dimensions of time and space much less defining whether or not margarine causes heart disease. I continue to keep my faith in Christ and I have come to believe that our best understanding of what I saw can be found only in metaphor.

Long story short, very short,considering all related material about our lives since that is so important. My brother, father and I used to visit our family&apos;s cabin in northern wisconsin every summer when my brother and I were young. One night after fishing late, we returned to the boathouse, unloaded, and sat on the dock as we did everynight. Sudennly, I looked at my dad and he was pointing at the mouth of the channel our dock sat on. I turned and looked... here was this bright light, but contained, like not a flashlight, or anything else, and there was no sound at all, just a light layer of fog that night about a foot above the water. It was a very beautiful night, with stars, fog, etc. unusual. very dark, but moonlight. What I remember is my dad pointing to this light and I&apos;ve never seen that look on his face.I look and from my left (this is narrow opening to a bigger part of the channel, at the point) a very bright light moved slowly from the edge of the woods on one side to the middle over the water. moved so smoothly, yet not on the water, but gliding slightly above it. It stopped right in the middle, which gave it a perfect view of us starring at this, and then it turned colors. Thats when my dad&apos;s trying to scare us by making a drunk fishermans flashlight seem like a ghost, actually scared the shit right out of him. after it stopped it faded into an orange color, almost spinning orange and red, I always remember feeling like it was focusing on us or trying to communicate, then at deep red and much smaller it took off, light speed, i don&apos;t know, but left a trail of red behind it into the woods at the point. My dad swore to my grandma he was just fooling us, scaring us, but as I learned later she was very concerned, because she knew of it, and was very interested in what the gov&apos;t is hiding from us, and used to lecture me of such things on that very dock, as if one day i&apos;d understand, thesame with my greatgrandmother, one day(with a grin) you&apos;ll know. There is much, much more, and know i do Know, and i want to share it. It wasn&apos;t until i started growing up, reading and searching, and suddenly an explosion of reports, abductions(including my mother&apos;s, even though she believes it was supernatural gift of God) well, it was. I realized all these things i thought were isolated to me and my family were really happening all over the earth, fireballs, &quot;balls of light&quot; what we saw.This is all real and while discovering what i had always known inside on paper from writers such as Zecharia Sitchen, Graham Hancock, Erich von daniken.THIS IS REAL AND I KNOW SOMETHING ELSE AND I&apos;m ready to let the cat out. please contact, anyone. thanks.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Greenish-Blue Sphere Shape Object Seen Over Alabama&apos;s Skies. People In Multiple Sites Witness Same Thing.On yesterday evening, I observed 2-3 unusual objects in the sky. My trip began on U.S. Highway 82West as it leads out of Tuscaloosa, AL towards Columbus, MS. I made a left turn at the junction of U.S. Highway 82West and AL State Hwy. 86East. AL State Hwy 86 leads to the city of Carollton, located in Pickens county. Midway to the city of Carollton (a distance of some 20+/- miles from the junction of US Hwy 82 and AL State Hwy 86) I observed what appeared to be a &quot;shooting star&quot; pass from the right side of the sky to the left. I must point out here that my primary occupation requires me to drive extensively. As a result, the road(s) I was traveling on was very familar. In addition, since a great deal of my driving in general is done in the evening and night, the sight of &quot;shooting stars&quot; is equally as familiar. What made this particular &quot;shooting star&quot; stand out to me was the intensity of white light displayed as it tracked across the sky. So much so that I half expected to hear a thud or see some type of impact crator. Again, it must be stressed, that at that paticular point in my minds eye I had simply seen a &quot;shooting star&quot;, no more. After making what amounted to about a 20-25 minute stop, in Aliceville(a town about 12-15 miles past Carrolton), to complete some work, I proceeded to take AL State Hwy. 17South to reach the city of York, my destination in Sumpter County. As I reached the outskirts of the city of Aliceville, with the thought of the unusual &quot;shooting star&quot; still fresh in my mind, I observed yet another &quot;shooting star&quot;. This one, the second &quot;shooting star&quot;, tracked from left to right across the sky and emitted a somewhat dull pale orange color as it passed. Nevertheless, I was still of the mindset that the two objects I saw, less than an hour apart, were just &quot;shooting stars&quot;. In fact, I would probably still be of that opinion if I had not observed the third and most impressive object. I had been continuously traveling along AL State Hwy. 17South( i have to point out that this particular state hwy.runs almost parallel with the AL-MS state lines and serves as a lifeline to some of AL&apos;s most rural communities. there are very few lights of any kind, except when passing through one of the small rural towns aforementioned) and witnessed nothing at all unusual. That is until I arrived at the junction of AL State Hwy.&apos;s 17South and 28West where I made a left turn that would take me to the city of Livingston in Sumpter county. Almost immediately after turning on to AL State Hwy. 28East, I observed a spherical object in the sky to my right (this would have been along the South-South West horizon). Initially I thought that it was a star. The object was not illuminated in any intense way, but instead seem to emit a greenish-bluish glow or tinge. I slowed my vehicle to about 15-20 mph and to my amazement, I could see that this greenish-bluish object was hovering in the sky (as a point of fact it was moving so slow that it appeared to barely be moving at all). I looked around the sky and at first I saw nothing else in the sky besides the spherical object. Then a few seconds later I saw what I percieved to be a low flying airplane in the Eastern part of the sky. It, the low flying airplane(?)blinked about six times and then it was gone from view, but the sphere continued to leisurely hover about. I was able to view this spherical object in the sky about 10-15 minutes until I reached the junction of AL State Hwy. 28East andUS Interstate 20/59, which passes through the city of Livingston, in route to Meridian, MS(about 40 miles away). At about the time I reached the interstate either the spherical object had gone or it was obscured by the lights of cars, businesses, etc.. The conclusion, about 6 hours and 150+/-miles later someone who could not have known what I had seen, said very casually and somewhat jokingly, &quot;hey guys, I thought I saw a U.F.O. tonight&quot;. I let this person tell everyone present what they thought they saw. When other folks started laughing, i started crying because I knew that what I had seen was real.", "Large glowing light hovering low on the horizonMy family and I were driving home from a Thanksgiving celebration at my parents house in Caledonia Mn.  We were a few miles out of town when I noticed a very large light in the sky very low on the horizon.  My husband dismissed it at first as an airplane or a helicopter but by the time we arrived home about 30 minutes later he was convinced this was something out of the ordinary.  This light was extremely bright (almost hard to look at directly for any length of time).  It seemed to hover in the same spot.  I ran in the  house to get my video camera and when I came back out my family and I witnessed it as it just disappeared.  It was almost as if someone turned off a light.  It was just gone.  I am really curious to know if anyone else in my area happened to see this light.  I spoke to my parents this morning and they commented that about an hour after we left their house (about the time we would have arrived home) they heard several what they said sounded like helicopters go over their house.  They ran out to see them but when they got outside they noise immediatly stopped.

We slowed then stopped the car as it was coming over us. Then she turned the radio off and the windows down as it was pretty much going right over the top of us.  It was very large in size very quiet and the light coming off it was brite enough to cast an image of itself.  It was triangular shaped with red lights down the sides and it seemed to be flying about 100 feet taller than the tallest tree. As it left us we new this was something like we have never seen so we tried to follow it but the tree line cut us off.  And when we could see the sky again it wasnt there.

After goin thru the drive thru I stopped in the parking lot to put the straw in my drink. before I started again I checked down the road and saw several lights in the air.  I was about two miles from Dyess AFB at the time and thought it was a plane landing,  then I noticed the lights were all blinking and the pattern did not fit any aircraft I know of. They were all a very pure white color, I couldn&apos;t see any yellowing or blueing like aircraft or car lights. I started watching it and saw the light reflecting off some trees under it, it appeared to be apporx. 15 feet off the treetops which were maybe 150 yards away from me. After about 15 seconds of watching them blink they &quot;slid&quot; over to the SE about 100 yards  I estimate. the movement took a full 2 seconds. There was no acceleration or deceleration, it moved and stopped. After stopping it hovered and all lights went steady for a few seconds then all shut off at the same time.

We noticed coming from the north a sphere very high up heading towards the south east, because it was so high it took quite some time to cross the sky. Then we noticed another coming from the east, at a right angle, at about the same altitude (very high up). The two shperes came together, looking like a figure eight, almost appearing to be right above us. They remained together for at least ten to fifteen minutes.  They then separated and the one coming from the north continued to the south east and the other went straight back towards the east.  This was a Saturday afternoon.  In the Sunday newspaper there were reports that others had seen the same thing.  Rhodesian Air Force had received reports but had no comment.  They were not birds or aircraft.As a child in the 50&apos;s, I remember my uncle who drove a truck that picked up corn from farms saying that early one morning out in the countryside he had had a frightening experience when a large light appeared behind his truck, it was a dark night, the light followed him for some time then flew at very high speed over his truck and disappeared up into the sky.  There had been two black workers riding on the back of the truck when it happened and they were absolutely terrified. Also in the 50&apos;s my grandmother, a no nonsense type of woman, had also seen a UFO from her house early one morning.  These were times before any jet aircraft were common in African countries.

Therefore, I am pretty sure the siting occurred in Mississippi, though it could possibly have been in eastern Louisiana.

It was trully awesome!My girlfriend and I were driving home to San Luis Obispo from Chico California on day and spotted something flying in the sky a quarter of a mile ahead of us. We were headed south-bound on highway 5 parallel to the city of Patterson, Ca.The sun had just gone down and there was still light out when we noticed a flying object over the highway headed toward us. It had flashing lights on it and its movments resembled that of a helicopter..at first. The object began to descend from above the highway of north-bound traffic into an area over an aquaduct. I turned my head to see where the flying object was going. The flying object stopped when it was parallel to us and changed course, flying at the same speed as us. When I finally caught a good look at it, I realized it was not a helicopter at all, but an obscure shape with lights rotating around it. It was a wierd sight. I didn&apos;t know what I was looking at. I intended it to be a helicopter, but it was not. My girlfriend was shocked. She pointed at the object with her mouth open and her eyes wide with awe. Her harm blocked my view of the road, so I slowed down to about 45 miles per hour. I turned my head again, and examined the flying object further. I realized at that moment, next to our car was a FLYING DISK with two RINGS rotating around it, one ontop of the other. The Craft was comprised of an approximately 25-30 foot long disk with the color of gun-metal silver. The shape was not round, but more oval in its length-wise, with a rounded off pointy tip. At the end of the disk was a smaller disk apparatus of the same color. Its length was appox 10-12 feet.After seeing this I slowed down the car to roughly 25 miles per hour. The Flying Aircraft then began to speed up and rise into the sky. It flew above the northbound highway and stopped in mid-air appox 200 yards ahead of us. My girlfriend was panicking. The Flying Disk then began a perfect diagonal decent to an area above the south-bound highway 5. I remember the crafts movments were so perfect, as if the craft was in another world, uncontrolled by gravity. The movments it made, made me sick to my stomach. They seemed very unnatural to me. I began to cough. After the diagonal shift downwards to the side of the road, the craft stayed there for a moment and then made a perfect upward movement approximately 35 feet straight up into the sky. (I am sorry, this experience is very hard to describe). We were driving very slow and there was no traffic infront of us. A few cars could be seen in my rear-view window, but they were about a half mile behind us. There were oncoming cars going northbound, but they were atleast 3 quarters of a mile away. Then the Flying Disk with rotating Rings made a perfect opposite movement towards the ground. Its movements were that of a mouse icon on a computer. It moved very unnaturally and fluidly. I slowed the car down to approx 15 miles per hour and we watched as the Flying Disk hovered above a grassy hillside. My girlfriend scrammbled for her disposable camera she brought with her on the trip.There was still light out, so the whole examination of the Flying Disk was unobstructed. I noticed its shiney body, and rings that had becons of lights on them. It was a marvel to whitness. It was the most awesome piece of machinery I have ever seen. This is when, under further examination, I noticed that the rings were huge metal looking apparatuses rotating around the disk. But there was something I could not intend to fathom, they were not connected to the craft by any bars, cooks, anything physical. The first ring closest to the Flying Disk was rotating at a 45 degree angle to the ship. The second ring rotated around the first ring 45 degree&apos;s to the ship counter to the first ring. This was trully an amazing sight. After about 10 seconds, of examination, we were parallel to the Flying Disk. This is when I began to rise upwards about 20 feet straight up. Again its movements, made me feel ill-at-ease. After rising approximatly 20 feet, a bright light lit up from beneath it. It permiated the ground and I saw dried grass sparkling underneath. I was trully in awe. Again, I was shocked by something that could not be intended by modern physics. The light was not attached to the aircraft by a light bulb. The light (similar to that of a hallogen) began from a point approximately 5 feet below the craft. It was as if it was a hallogram or something. Whatever the craft was doing, it was obscured by its awe-inspiring looks and movements. We kept our speed and moved on until the Flying Disk was out of sight behind us. A mile ahead we saw a police car in the middle of the north-bound highway with its sirens on. The police car was traveling approximately 5 miles per hour and was evidently there to stop traffic from passing. Every light I saw for the next 145 miles, I thought it would be another Flying Craft, the same Craft that I saw before. For a least a month I tried to explain to people what I saw. But the words would not come out of my mouth as I intended to voice them. I was completely spellbound by the awesome sight of that strange Flying Disk with Rotating Rings around it. The object made no sound. A detailed drawing of the becons of light, shape of aircraft, can be offered upon request. My girlfriend was unable to find her disposable camera, which was later found just beneath her feet under the passenger seat.", "Extremely fast moving light high in the stars!!My sister and I were sitting outside talking.

A friend and I were outside, maybe six miles east of the Utah/Co. border on what was highway 666.  I looked up and to the north there low in the sky was a huge ship.  I can only say that it was huge possibly the size of 20-25 blimps.  Perhaps 300-400yards up.  I asked my friend, Do you see that?  Oh my god yes I do was her only response.  It had as best as I can describe &quot;a stealth look&quot; to it. It seemed to have uncloaked as some of its basic points were in alignment with certain stars.

Well we could not believe our eyes!   What was this huge dark triangle that was so black, no emissions, no sound, no color, flew so slow and low to the ground?  It kept a straight and even paced course.  My first thought was &quot;oh my word, not only is Boeing near, Scott AFB is not that far either.&quot;  My husband got a bit ahead under it and I looked more and more closer and noticed that it was flat and triangular.  No reflections under, etc. What appeared to be lights on its side, were indeed the aircraft surrounding it.  It was thee strangest thing I ever seen.  And ominous.After about 15 minutes my husband pulled over to the side of the road.  We got out of the car and watched it move slowly away over highway 70.  I remember thinking &quot;why do not more people pull over and watch this?&quot;  But my eyes were more glued to the skies than worried to see just who was or not pulled over to watch.  As we watched the dark triangle &amp; escort fly off east, following highway 70s course, (geesh how blatant I kept thinking), I remember noticing that it appeared rather &quot;thin&quot; in thickness ... which added more to the whole bizarreness.  I barely remember getting into the car.  And I do not recall the drive home.NOTE: when the object was directly over us I felt sick to my stomache.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My background is one of a traveling troubleshooter and consultant in the field of electronics.  It was my job to find what others had missed and detail was part of my daily routine.....Also, while in the Air Force, I taught instrument flying techniques and procedures.  I am quite familiar with aircraft and have lived my life with an objective eye.Story, objective side: While driving (after sundown, before dusk, with wife and two youngsters, only car on the road) just outside of town we spotted a soft white &apos;glowing&apos; object. &apos;It&apos; was hovering a few feet off the ground about forty yards from the highway to our left. It was shaped something like a slender football, maybe twelve feet long (including the aura) with rounded ends, although the shape was somewhat obscurred by something of an &apos;aura&apos; around it.....While the object was close to the ground, nor at any other time, I did not notice any reflection from the glow and it was not necessary to squint while looking at it. There was no audible sound and no discernible markings or lines. I had slowed down to observe through my open side window and the &apos;object&apos; began moving parallel with us..... I stopped. The &apos;object&apos; continued slowly approx fifty yards, rising to about forty feet, and made a ninety degree right turn, came to my side of the road and made another rt turn and came straight at us. The shape at this point was approx. five feet wide by four feet high, as though a front view. (About that time I was very excited and had my eyes glued on it.) ....At any rate, the object, just over the power lines (maybe 25 feet), hovered right over the top of the car for a moment and then quite suddenly disappeared - in the blink of an eye! My next focus, amidst bewilderment, was on one of a few stars which had braved the twilight. Subjective: I sensed communication, that the &apos;object&apos; was not a vehicle, but life/intelligence. My wife&apos;s objective description is the same as mine, the children remember that they saw the object, but nothing more.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I, in the same month (unfortunately, do not remember the day) witness what seems to be the same or simular object. It was approximatey 23:30 E.S.T when I had finished some school work and decided to go for a walk and have a cigarette because I didn&apos;t enjoy smoking in the house. Brampton, Ontario , at the time was stil a developing city (at least in the west end where I was) So you can have an idea of the area, there would be pockects of new developements and open fields in between. I had my walkman with me at the time and I enjoy my music very loud. After about 20 minutes of walking and taking in the beautiful weather I heard a humming noise over top of my walkman - I naturally assumed that it was a transport truck or something in the area. I turned off my walkman and that&apos;s when I realized the sound was coming from over head. When I looked up I was in awe of what I was seeing. I was not frightened or nervous. The object was no more than 50 stories above me. It was black, Triangular shaped, and had only three light at each corner. The object must have been the size of a football field. The object hovered in one place, directly above me for 1 minute when it shot off (from a stand still) and out of my sight in less than a second. This is when I became nervous. I do not know anything in physics that could propel itself from a stand still like that. I hurried home and as you probably encounter daily, I was met with ridicule from my friends and family. Three days later, while I was at school, three men in black came to my home and asked my mother all kinds of strange questions. They repeatedly asked if they could come in, and when my mom responded, no, they would ask something else. Where I was from? Where I was? How old I was? Could they come back and see me later. When I spoke with my mother later that day. All she kept saying is that they looked very strange....very odd. that&apos;s it. At that point, I dropped the UFO conversations and left it alone until tonight when I came across your site and the people from Newbrunswick that witnessed the same thing as I did, and in the same month.

I saw them from the base of Granite Mountain in Prescott, AZ., which is approximately 100 miles North of Phoenix. It was still light when I saw them traveling in a Southerly direction. The most important point I want to make is that they were absolutely not flares, as some would later claim. I come from a family of pilots and have my flight ratings as well. These craft seemed to be moving faster than most planes I have observed. They were traveling in a very symetrical formation-- like an elongated triangle, with probably three lights on either side of a single light at the point. They simply looked like round white lights to me. They seemed more luminescent than typical jets; made no sound; left no contrails; contained no other plane-like lights; and again, seemed to be traveling very fast. I have wondered if they might be some new secret military craft, but couldn&apos;t understand why they would fly over a highly populated area like Phoenix-- wouldn&apos;t make sense. This would also have placed them on Sky Harbor&apos;s (Phoenix&apos;s international airport&apos;s) radar as well. Anyway, I don&apos;t know what they were, but they sure as hell weren&apos;t flares. I will always consider them as having been individual craft unlike anything I had previously seen. I wish so much I would have had a video camera. I know others reported seeing these lights at least as far North as I did. I just hope that my report will lend support to the idea that they were not flares.

The object carefully maintained a course to fly just above the top edges of the mountains peeking over Mt Pisgah. What stumped me most was that it was flying much too fast to be a conventional jet and it left absolutely no contrail at all.

On May 10, 2005, approximately 3:00pm, in the courtyard behind my townhouse in McLean, VA, I witnessed three balls of &quot;white,&quot; hovering over my home.  It was the day before fighter jets were dispatched in DC to intercept a civilian aircraft--very much in that days news at the time, which had intruded into restricted Washingtion air space.  One of these jets also flew low over my home. I have since learned the objects I saw are referred to as balls of light or BOLs. I was gardening and happened to look up at the very blue sky to the right of my chimney...south. I saw three small balls, more like three round white puffs, not illuminated from within...that I could tell...but just reflecting sun light.  At the time my estimate of their altitude was approximately 100 feet. They were bobbing around one another in a circular pattern; the formation was staying stationary.  Quickly after spotting them, and as if they realized I had noticed them, one shot off to the northeast, going behind my chimney and again becoming visible on the other side.  If the object was at 100 feet, I estimate the speed at 50-60 mph...the day was sunny and rather calm. This object, slightly bobbing, but moving in a straight line, quickly moved out of sight behind trees and other townhouses. When I turned my eyes back to the other two, they were also gone, obviously in different directions from the first.

We watched the object for a minute or two and my friend noticed another one to the southeast.  Amazed, we watched.  My friend got out to relieve himself when he told me to get out.  As I got out, I noticed one directly above our heads.  The were 4 lights on the underbelly of the craft.  There was one red and 3 white strobing lights seeming to make a diamond shaped pattern.  The craft hovered there for about 15 seconds or so and propelled forward.  We then looked to the southeast and saw 10 more or so more objects moving toward the southwest in no particular formation. There were clouds in the sky because we really couldn&apos;t see the stars that well, but these objects were flying below the cloud layer.  We stayed parked there for about  30 minutes with the lights off.  There were a handful of other cars on the highway so there were no distractions from other headlights.  We saw probably 25-50 aircraft that night while we were parked.  Truly amazing.  There was so much activity.  Before we started driving again we saw a huge dark cloud directly above us.  It was flashing a huge light from inside the cloud.  The object seemed to be going in the same direction as the other aircraft to the southwest.

We got out of the car to watch this phenomenon happen before our eyes.  Then suddenly it zipped to the west at an amazing speed, then it would slowly come back to where it was when we first saw it.  It had done this 3 times.  Then it started moving to the south. We got back in the car and I  turned south down a gravel road and we could see it through the trees that it was moving a little faster than us. The object was to our right hand side and in front of us on the other side of the trees.  Then it began to go to the south east.  Then I turned left down another gravel road so we could meet it on the next road over. We got to the next road over that went north and south.  We turned to the south and could still plainly see it over the road about 1/4 mile ahead of us.  Then it crossed the road still heading south east.  We got up to a bridge and then started to go up the hill that followed. Then there were open potato fields on both sides of the road.  We could still see it, but now it was &quot;pulsing&quot; orange and red.  We came to another highway that went east and west, but we stopped to watch it again.

My son, who was in the car with me, and I both saw an illuminated object that appeared to be close to the ground in the next town of 2 and 1/2 miles distance south on that road.  As the object was located along the road we were traveling, we continued to see it as drove along Alt Route 113.  Before entering the town of Magnolia, it became apparent the object hovered directly above trees in the center of the town.  Alternate Route 113 intersects the town and the Magnolia Fire station is located on the northbound side of alternate Route 113 at the intersection of Walnut Street. The object was hovering directly above trees and houses located behind the Magnolia fire station and along East Walnut Street. The object was round, at least 900 feet in circumference.  The saucer had 3 sections, a dome, a middle section and a bottom section.  The dome-like top , had one large white or off-white light forming the top of the dome.  The center of the saucer had lights of varying colors that were oblong (almost square) in shape, with rounded corners.  These lights were either blinking or the center of the saucer was rotating.  I did not focus on them long enough to determine which.  The bottom  had off-white or light yellow lights that did not seem to blink or move.  The object was no more than 300 feet away from the road in front of the Magnolia fire department.  I did not hear any noise coming from the object and the trees below the object did not seem to be disturbed by any wind.  Just across from the fire station, facing south, there is a water tower.  The unidentified object was directly behind the fire station (facing east) and hovered lower than the water tower.  We were in clear sight of both the object and the water tower and there was absolutely no mistake that we were seeing an object other than the water tower.

I also recall asking my son, who was 10 years old at the time, if he would mind if we stopped and took a closer look.  He seemed calm, but said he was scared and just wanted to go home.  As soon as we got home - about a 5 minute drive further south along blank road, my son asked if we could go back and take another look.

I grabbed my coffee and stood out on the deck of the machine to see better. There were two round lights connected together by an oval shaped light.These lights were much bigger than any star that was in the background so I assumed that it was fairly close or really big. The two round lights were what I would call irradecent.It was hard to nail down a specific color as it constantly seemed to faintly change color. The oval light was more like a pale white light, like from a dim flourecent light. I had shut off the engine of the machine and all was very quiet.After about five minutes of watching I observed the pale oval light that seperated the other two lights begin to get brighter. The lights then moved a good distance, angled upward in a straight line, stopped, moved down in a straight line,at an angle of about 100 degrees or so to the first line, and about the same distance and stopped again.It then took off again at an angle that intersected, roughly, with the original position so that a large triangle pattern was formed by it&apos;s movements.The lights were heading, in a northeast direction, into the horizon and faded into the distance within ten seconds or less.Also, like I said, all was quiet around me and not a sound was heard.I&apos;ve never seen anything like that before or since and this is the first time telling this story in this fashion.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I heard a guy call in to Coast to Coast radio show that following December right around Christmas and describe almost the exact same thing even to the flash in the sky but can&apos;t recall now where it was he saw it  ,western states I think, maybe Utah or when he saw it....I have argued with myself since it happened to report it. I haven&apos;t  told anyone until now, it feels good to get it  off my chest...thanks.", "9 objects that appeared to be bright hovering lights, then lit up, dimmed, moved to the east and began blinking.A friend and I were watching TV when around 5:27 he went out to the balcony of my apartment for a smoke.  I live up on a hill on the border of Golden and Lakewood that overlooks Denver and its suburbs to the north.  He knocked on the window for me to come and look at something.  I am a MUFON Investigator so I watch the skies often.  He pointed out a bright greenish light in the sky to the NNE.  It was just sitting there perfectly still.  I thought it looked very strange so I grabbed my binoculars.  He then pointed out that there were actually 4 objects.  All of them were still.  That looked even more interesting so I grabbed my video camera.  Once I got out there with the camera they began moving.  When I got my camera on them there were three left.  The forth had moved off to the east.  When I began video taping one object began to move off to the east, and one to the west.  The one to the west then came back moving to the east.  Then while filming the remaining light, which was perfectly still, just its right and above it another light lit up.  Soon after, the bottom light lit up very brightly.  When it got very bright, it appeared like an angled disk shape.  It then began to move to the east like the rest and dim out.  All of them did this when they flew easy and as they got dimmer they also began to blink.  The remaining light did the same thing.  It began to get extremely bright, and then it began moving east.   Here again it would get dimmer and begin to blink.  This can all be seen on the tape.  As it moved to the east, I noticed yet another light appear the same place the last one had appeared.  This one was dimmer and began move to the east blinking immediately.  When the tress got in the way I stopped filming.  However, we could see at least two of the light off in the distance over Denver.  Then after a few minutes they began to fade too dim to see. At this point I called the Director of Investigations to let him know what we saw.  That call was made at about 5:55. While on the call at about 6:15, my friend could see another light appearing in the same spot they had appeared before.  I got off the phone and went back with the camera, however right when I got the camera on it, it faded very dim.  My friend saw another one of them over Denver that was lighting up very bright again.  Again once I got the camera on it, it faded out.  Because I thought they might be reacting to the camera I put it away.  A couple minutes later another light appeared where the others had.  This time, this one stayed still.  It looked like it actually was two light side by side.  As it sat there another light began to light just below it to the left.  The light appearing looked very disk shaped through the binoculars.  After 30 seconds or so as it finally seemed to be finished appearing or whatever it was doing and they both moved to the east.  One headed east over Denver, the other seemed to keep a regular distance from us and moved in an arc to the east with us in the middle.  Once it got due south of us, it just seemed to hover out there.  We then noticed one out over Denver.  This one seemed to be east of downtown and it had two lights, one at either end.  It moved south and appeared very large for as far away it was.  I would say about half the size of a dime at arms length.  The light towards the front was brighter, and eventually the light at the back began to pulse.  It eventually dimmed out.  We could see one of the light heading east still, but after a couple minutes it began to get too dim also.  At this point the light to the south was no longer visible either. In total we saw nine of these objects and got seven on tape.  You can look for yourself, but it does not appear that these objects had the characteristics of any known craft.  The closest would be a helicopter, but that would not explain why some appeared to come out of no where, and why they seemed solid at first.  It also would not explain the apparent disk shape.  Two other things I would like to note, although they seem extraordinary is that they seemed to react to being video taped, and they seemed to intentionally blink to mimic airplanes.((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting such an excellent report.  This is one of two reports submitted by this individual, over the last three years.  PD))", "4 Round Orange Glowing ObjectsThis happened very briefly, was outside bringing the trash out when I looked up into the sky and saw this glowing orange circle which quickly turned into 3 other circles (so 4 total) they went downwards at an angle about 45 degree angle, the objects all appeared to be connected to each other, then quickly went out, didnt fade out went out like you would turn off a light switch. Then about 5 minutes later in the same area this bright orange circle appeared and quickly went out. This time it was only 1 circle. Saw nothing again after that.", "Irreguelar &quot;cloud&quot; formations in sky above Bahia de Banderas.In addition to my report of last night, which I myself find UNBELIEVABLE.... I was sitting at a beachside cantina located within the Bahia de Banderas when I noticed over the far northern most point of the bay (Punta de Mita) a saucer shaped flucuating cloud.  This was a rapidally forming cloud that seemed to dissapate within about a sixty second time frame and than basically reform in a basic triangulation (or saucer type shape) in a two to seven minute context.  I witnessed two appearqnces before I notified my friends,  seeing as the experience the past evening was a little out of the ordinary for us. This &quot;phenomenom&quot; followed no exact time pattern and we were witness to it for over two hours.  As I explained in my report last evening (02-01-06), we had witnessed five different unidentifed sources.  Upon first noticing the &quot;cloud&quot; above Punta de Mita, there was one clear, distinct, but slowly and yet rapidly, changing SAUCER shaped cloud.  I will elaborate further, however I have lived in Puerto Vallarta for almost NINE years and I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING like this before.  This &quot;cloud&quot;continued to dissapate and reform multiple times before my eyes as wells many others all within the same approximate location.  When it had disaperred from this location for the second time, I began to look around and noticed that the same type of formations &quot;clouds&quot; were forming and dissapating in other locations  in the north bay (Bucerias, La Cruz de Huanaxcatle, Sayulita).  The primary(?) cloud source was an in and out over Punta de Mita.  There was one, and then two, and then three sources from my viewpoint above Bucerias which is north of the airport.  The ones located towards Bucerias maintsined shape for much longer than the PdM.  I do not know what to think , but the Pd M was primarily 1, and at times 2, faint flash points to largely growing and then disproportionate saucer shaped &quot;clouds&quot;.  These &quot;clouds&quot; (as my friends kept referring to them) were all in the SAME location.", "Three lights in atriangle shape flew across the sky below the cluds heading northeast over Citrus Heights.There were three very distinct bright lights flying in a triangle shape. There formation would change shapes from a triangle to a line and back. They were flying from the southwest to the northeast. It was cloudy but they were flying below the clouds. Finally one by one the lights slowly went out. I couldn&apos;t quit tell there speed but it didnt seem to be to fast. It lasted between eight and ten minuts. This was the second time two of my friends had seen these lights. They saw it sometime in early 2000. None of my friends cell phones worked when this happened. They called aand all they could hear was there own voice talking back. About a minute after the lights dissapeared a helicopter headed towards the general area of the crafts, if this is relavent.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The occurance happened and 1am and it lasted until 3:05 am. It moved north towards Branch, MI. It would disappear andten reappear periodically. Almost as ifit was landing. Then it flew off and disappeared in the fire ball behind it. It seemed very  close to the ground and kept getting closer and closer. The lights would change colors and blink as if they were sending us a sign or trying to communicate with others.", "3 motionless objects w/ blinking lightsMy husband was on the phone with a friend of ours who lives just down the street from us in our neighborhood.  He and his wife had spotted objects in the sky and asked my husband if we had seen them/been watching them.  My husband went outside to see them then came back inside, woke me up and had me go out and look at them.  There were 3 distant objects (that I could see) in the Eastern sky.  They appeared not to be moving at all.  They were brighter than stars and &quot;twinkling&quot;/&quot;blinking&quot;.  Had they been moving I would have thought they were airplanes or helicopters or something.  But what struck us all was that they appeared to be motionless but just as bright if not brighter than an airplane or such.  When we first looked at them there were two other aircrafts in the air that were moving so it was easy to tell the difference between and airplane/helicopter and what we were seeing, which were seemingly motionless. I decided to use my husband&apos;s binoculars to see if I could get a better view of what they were.  I looked at each one and they each had the same characteristics.  It was FREEZING outside so it was hard for me to stand still and my shaking from the cold made my vision a bit blurry at times through the binoculars.  I couldn&apos;t see an &quot;object&quot; per say, but each &quot;object&quot; had bright, blinking lights (red, green, white, blue, etc.) that appeared to blink very quickly and seemed to change the pattern of their blinking/lighting-up.  With the binoculars, I could clearly see the lights.  The lights lit up clearly in circles but it was difficult for me to see their patterns as I was shaking from the cold and the patterns that the lights lit up in seemed to change very quickly.  We came to the conclusion that they were satellites since we know very little about this type of thing, but after looking into sattelites on the internet have determined that not to be the case.  We are all completely stumped at what we saw.  But these objects didn&apos;t appear to move a bit for at least an hour and a half (till we finally went to bed).  There has been no mention of it on the news and am very curious for an explanation of what we saw.", "Large sphere above the American RiverMyself &amp; three others where driving up hwy. 50 north towards tahoe, when we looked over to the passenger side of the car... appx 500 feet off the hwy, right above the American River &amp; about 20 to 50 feet above the tree line, we saw a LARGE Sphere shaped hovering ufo... it had gold colored lights on the top &amp; bottom. just below the top &quot;light&quot; there was a strip of circular lights(multiple colors, white red blue green yellow/gold) spinning to the right... same thing at the bottom of the craft, except that the lights where spinning in the opposite direction(to the left). there was also a similar strip of lights around the middle of the craft, but they where stationary. in between the middle and the top &amp; bottom of the craft, there where what looked like thousands of bright BLUE windows... all in all the thing looked very similar to a disco/mirror ball, except that it had lights spinning around the top &amp; bottom.I&apos;m not sure how long it was there for, it was there when we saw it &amp; we did not stop. we just kept driving. myself &amp; 1 other person saw this sphere shaped ufo, because we where on the passenger side of the car &amp; awake... the driver could not take their eye&apos;s off the windy road, &amp; the person next to me was asleep as far as size... it was pretty large, I&apos;d say at least a couple of football fields wide &amp; high. there was no sound what so ever coming from the sphere...

We heard a low humming noise and clattering against all the windows of the house.We looked outside, and saw 20 or more tiny blue lights in the sky. We quickly picked up the video camera and began filming. The objects were very high up in the night sky, but were clearly not human, they moved freely in any direction, or they hovered together, one ontop of the other, a few miles apart in the sky. This continued for about an hour. We noticed the objects getting much larger, as they slowly lowered themselves to earth. We managed to get one or two close ups on video, but the quality was not the best. The ridge above the house, about 1 1/2 miles to the north began to emit a daylike glow. Most of the objects were no longer visible but the humming sound had become almost deafening. Suddenly the wind began to rip at the house, out of the north. the lights pulsated on the horizen and clouds of smoke appeared to rise up slowly from each light, there were about 6 lit up areas. I picked up the phone to call someone, but the line wasnt working , it was buzzing like it does when the tv has no channel on it. We leaned out the window to see better, and listen. We heard the most erie howl, not like any coyote we had ever heard, almost a siren, but not as perfect. They came from each lit up hilltop. They were followed by a loud bloodcurdling deep scream, definatly not human. It filled the entire valley, and what followed was odd for mid winter in canada, a warm strong breeze came from the north, almost hot, and it smelled like burning plastic, or somthing close to that. The sensor light outside kept coming on, and we heard crashing and banging against the house, scratching through the walls on every side. Neither one of us saw anything for sure but we both thought we saw a tall very pale figure, that had a humanlike shape, and glowing eyes, running across the driveway. Petrified, we shut ourselves in and listened intently. We looked out the window for a bit longer to see the smoke puff up from the lit up hilltops again. and than tiny blue lights like we had seen earlier, shot up qickly from them to an instant hover, and than began getting smaller as the flew higher into the sky, they remained visible for a long time.", "Bright White Light Moving Slower Then Normal Aircraft.I went outside for a cigarette and noticed what looked to be a light on top of a nearby mountain top.  It looked as if it was moving slowly, so I kept an eye on it to determine if it was moving.  Once I was sure it was moving I was thinking it was a plane or a helicopter.  There was no noise as would be normal with a aircraft.  I then noticed that it was moving way to slow for a plane.  I kept watching as it started to move closer and closer to my direction.  It went into some trees and shone brighter then before and then it just vanished.  At first I was thinking it was behind the trees so I kept waiting for it to clear and come into view again. It never came back into view and I even went to higher ground and couldn&apos;t see it.  After another 10 mins or so of looking I gave up and decided it had just vanished.

Unable to accurately describe size as I do not know how far away it was. Judging only by it&apos;s clarity I guessed it to be less than half mile distant at about one thousand feet altitude. Size at a guess about 30 feet in length and approximately 8 feet in width. It was floating horizontally, stationary at first for about 10 seconds then slowly moved South East out of my view. It was cylindrical with rounded ends, the same shape as a medicinal gelatin capsule. I am  a licensed pilot (fixed wing)and a retired police sergeant.

The light then began moving further northwest slowly at first and then very quickly left to right and then up and down very rapidly but in a very erratic fashion. It moved left to right in a wide 180 deg. movement across the horizon and then up and down in about a 45 degree movement above where it had been originally positioned and then back down again. The erratic fashion in which it moved can only be described as if a leaf were falling to the earth moving quickly back and forth as it falls. Another interesting thing is that it changed colors when it moved. While stationary it was a very bright white light, but when it moved it turned blue and then blue green in color. As soon as it stopped and became stationary, it turned white. I had never seen anything quite like this before and watched it for about an hour and a half before it slowly moved to the Northwest and disappeared over the horizon.

The only information that I was told my mother was that their car engine stopped, their watches stopped (they had to reset them when they arrived in Salina.)  The watches were approximately 30 minutes slow.A silver-ish disc like object came down in front of their car and hovered there. They did not speak, too stunned by the event.  From their standpoint, it hovered for only a few moments and then zipped off into the sky.  However, they always wondered what had actually happened because of the time difference with their watches.That is all the information that I know.  Anyone else they might have told is now deceased.

About halfway back I feel like something was watching me, I scanned the field then the sky and there it was. It looked just like the older ufo footage of the saucer type ones, it was silver in color but the bottom was dark. It was to the south of us and a guess would be 1,500-3,000 feet, object was at least 20-40 feet round in diameter.  It was a perfect still day with no clouds, all blue. It had a mirage effect to it, like when your on a road when its steaming hot out and you get that wavey heat effect when you look in the distance, I could sense a type of energy coming from it.

Bear in mind this is a very wooded area but about 5 minutes into the walk the woods clear and there is nothing but sky and fields forever. The ufo was not in the sky when we were walking toward the road, so I know it was moving and stopped sometime after we turned around to walk back.  We walked and then ran back to camp after we had observed it for about 20 minutes, this was a mistake.

The object was very high in the sky, at approximately 10-20 thousand feet.  It appeared to be hovering or &quot;orbiting&quot; in the same spot.  This object was bright light yellow to white in color. Initially I thought it might have been a planet such as Mars or Venus.  However, after observing it, I ascertained that it was way too large, and bright to be either planet.  It appeared to be a big around as a Quarter turned on its side. The object was hovering over an area approximately South, Southeast from my vicinity (Sharkey), and it appeared as though it were over Montgomery County (Mt. Sterling). As my wife and I turned out of the subdivision where we live, and traveled south on KY 801 towards the community of Farmers, we could see this object with no problem whatsoever.  We just kept looking at(not a good thing to do while driving) it and when I arrived approximately 1/4 mile North of the West bound on ramp to Interstate 64, I decided to pull over to the side of the road.  We continued to sit and watch in amazement, while this large object remained stationary in approximately the same place. I am a very methodical and logical man, and so I decided to rule out ALL possible explanations.  As I mentioned earlier, I ruled out a star, or planet, as it was too large and too bright to be either.  I then ruled out a fixed wing aircraft, as it had NO strobes, or beacons.  I also ruled out a fixed wing AC with a landing light on, as it never left the altitude OR heading to proceed to base, and would not have been able to hover.  I then ruled out rotary winged aircraft, using a spotlight, as it was too high to have used one effectively for ground searches. Lastly, the object stayed this way for at least 15 minutes, after which, we decided to proceed on our way.  However, it was in the sky at least another 15 minutes, as my wife continued to monitor it after we turned East onto US 60 towards Morehead.  Once we arrived at approximately Big Perry, we could no longer see the object, due to the vegetation and elevation.  Unfortunately my wife FORGOT that she had her digital camera with us, and didn&apos;t take a few photo&apos;s. Coincidentally, we arrived back on KY 801 about 30 minutes later, after traveling West on I-64, and saw no trace of this &quot;light in the sky&quot;, ruling out virtually ALL possiblity that we saw a planet or star earlier.((NUFORC Note:  If the object was not a high-altitude aircraft, with a contrail behind it, being illuminated by the setting Sun, we do not know what the witnesses observed.

Was outside on apartment balcony hanging laundry (which always puts me in a position looking out &amp; upward, with view of the sky).  Without a prior sound or warning, almost directly above in sky, suddenly a huge WHITE bright ball takes shape &amp; then bam! a loud explosion. The entire event was at most 2 seconds. It was just so odd. My husband who was walking home from the train station was about 2 blocks away from home, when he seen it.  No pre or after-shock noise, no pre or post lightning &amp; certainly no rains.  I was very shaken by it.  As well as disturbed.  My husband after walking into apartment was puzzled too. (Note: he would tell you he has never seen an UFO or even believes in them.  When I tell him about the few times I have seen UFOs, he looks at me like I saw &quot;a thing wrong.&quot;) I was shaking because it was so unusual.  No further strange weather that night and nothing on the news about strange weather, etc.   Nothing about explosions.  Itami airport is near and I thought perhaps a plane exploded? Although that would be odd ... this was a sudden white orb of LIGHT! just BAM! then gone. No light trails in sky. (Like when you look at the sun.)  I have seen lots of electrical storms, and bad weather, but never seen anything like this.  A perfect round orb of white &quot;light&quot; ... no blue emissions ... just white!  I do not know if weather &quot;fireballs&quot; can be white, rather huge, stationery, &amp; result in nothing more than bang! and no after-effects.

NOTE:  After finding a link about BTs, then a link to this site, remembering my own encounter with one other person of a BT in the late 90s, in Missouri O-Fallon HWY 70 area, for whatever reason, I began to think and wonder &quot;wow you know, you never see or read reports in Japan news about UFOs&quot; (well at least I do not yet ... Ive only been living here for about 8 months) and I wondered about BTs here.  When this event of the ball of white whatever-it-was happened, I kept thinking &quot;did a BT just arrive?!&quot;  I wanted to post the sighting but thought it would be of no need, perhaps.  Then, last night, I find the report of a BT near Kyoto!?!  Thus my decision to post this, and ANY other &quot;event&quot; should any occur.

It  was not a helicopter nor a plane.  Above the bright magenta light was a smaller dim white light that was visible every other second.  As we drove north on the 5 freeway the object seemed to stay stationary and we were slowly passing it. Just as it was about even with my shoulder straight up, the bright magenta light fell from the sky like a rock and got brighter as it approached the ground.  We could no longer see the object.  It became blocked by a distant freeway wall. This sighting lasted about 3 - 5 minutes.  I must say this is the most amazing thing I have ever seen in the sky to this day.

It flashed on very quickly, but it only lit up one cloud instead of the entire cloud bank. It also grew ateady in intensity and then faded slow to nothing. The lengthof time and the fact that the light did not flicker or fluctuate in intensity ruled out lightning in my mind. I have NEVER seen lightning do this in my life.

On the way up the hill to our home, we saw a very bright elongated light in the south southwest sky.  It was about 4:05 pm and dusk was falling.  The sky was a clear midnight blue and there were very few clouds.  The unknown object was to the right of the moon and a bright planet (I think venus...).  I stopped the car to establish a  point of reference and determined that the object did not seem to be moving.  It was far in the distance and did not look like anything that I have ever seen before.  We decided to drive down a different road to get another look.  As we drove it started to fade away.  It eventually became a grey streak in the sky and then completed disappeared.  My daughter said &quot;it looks like someone cut a gash in the sky and was shining a light through it.&quot;   I agree.

In fact, until this event, I never really believed in UFO&apos;s at all. It was just something that I never thought about. This took place in a very rural area of southwest Michigan, and I was 15 years old at the time. I was waiting for the bus at approx. 6:35 am. It was still very dark outside. It was very cold, around 15 degrees farenheit, and it was very clear, no clouds at all. I was standing at the end of my driveway, which is about 50 yards from the house. There are no neighbors in this area, and there were no lights on of any kind - no streetlights, vehicles, etc. Across the street is a very large field of soybeans. Above this field I saw four large lights. The lights looked exactly like stadium lights. They were very bright and close together. They were very high in the sky, perhaps twice the height of a normal stadium light. Strangely, I was mesmerized by the lights. I could not figure out why the farmer had put these huge lights in the middle of his field. I watched the lights for approimately 10 minutes, and they never moved. I had no reason to think that they were anything but very tall stadium lights. Suddenly the lights came towards me and zoomed over my head. There was no sound. As the lights approached me, the craft went higher and took off over my head. At this point it was going very slowly. I looked up and saw it in full detail, directly above me. It was only a few hundred feet off the ground. It was triangular, but the edges of the triangle were rounded off. There were lights on either side of it, small red lights that were blinking. As it went above me, The light in front of the craft turned on. It was an interior light, and I could make out a shape moving around in the &quot;cockpit.&quot;  The craft was huge, but not as large as a jetliner. As it went over my head, it veered sharply to the left (west) and took off very quickly. It completely disappeared within seconds. It was completly noiseless, and it was only after the even that I realized I had seen something extraordianry. The main thing I remember is that for some odd reason i could not take my eyes off the thing. It was like it hypnotized me. After I realized what I had just seen, I was completely terrified. I felt like I could not breathe. The bus came and I asked everyone if thay had seen anything weird in the sky. They hadn&apos;t.

There were no flashing lights as you would see on an airplane.  As we drove the closer, the light was actually 2 lights.  Each light was round and fairly close together.

I was dropped off a mile or two from camp, to guard an ammunition dump in a clearing of about 100 yards by 150-200 yards, surrounded by tall trees.  The moon was full and the sky was clear.About 100-200 yards past the treeline, a craft arose in the vicinity of a small lake.  It rose like a helicopter and flew slowly, like a helicopter, yet it was silent and lacked distinctive characteristics of both a helicopter and airplane, like a tailfin, wings, propellers, or safety lights.In the bright moonlight, I could clearly see the entire craft, which was long, possibly oval or round, and tapered towards the tail.  There were three sets of lights in a 120 degree arc around the front of the craft, which appeared to be windows, but may have been headlights. I was paralyzed with fright and tried not to move, lest be seen.  I slowly turned my head to watch the craft pass by.  After it had passed, I could hear the faint sound of a jet-type engine, however the craft moved far too slowly to be a jet.  There were no runways, from where it took off - it had to come out of the lake.  Having seen many helicopters throughout my training, and ridden in them, I can say without equivocation this was no helicopter.  With the bright moonlight, there is no doubt in my mind this was neither a commercial nor military craft known to the public.Another soldier was posted about 1/4 mile away at another ammo dump. We had agreed beforehand to pick up our field phones at 11:30 to make sure we were both awake. Our exact conversation went: me,&quot;Hey, you there?&quot; him, &quot;Yeah&quot; me, &quot;Did you see that?&quot; him, &quot;Thank God you said that!&quot;  We had both seen the same thing, described the same thing to each other, and agreed we had both seen a UFO.This incident was never reported because our fellow Reservists thought it was a joke we had both concocted and we eventually dropped it.

We have seen this object twice this month- 1/8/2006 and now most recently 1/24/2006. We saw it both times at S-SW from Stanwood..that would put it over north Everett or west Marysville (Snohomish County, WA).  It appears to be a bright light, making one think it&apos;s just a really bright star, but it was too bright.  Just when we are arguing w/ourselves, the object moved.  It would just &quot;hoover&quot; in the same spot and then would shoot off the to right, then come back to center and go to the left.  It had lights that were twinkling and they would get brighter as it was about to move in a direction.  Red blinking lights were spotted occasionally..but it was too far away to be clearly seen, we thought it resembled a &quot;V&quot; like shape. We thought- helicopter, but there was no noise on either occasion.  Then within 1/2 hour two planes passed the object and we watched totally fansinated because the &quot;object&quot; disappered.  No lights were seen when the planes approached the area of the &quot;object.&quot; After the planes passed the object reappeared and went about it&apos;s &quot;searching&quot; or &quot;scanning&quot; like manuevers.  Last night we noticed that the object made circular motions very quickly and that we had not noticed before, as well as little &quot;U&quot; shaped motions to the left and right.

Then I noticed what I could describe as a somewhat boomerang-shaped craft gliding silently from North or North-by-Northeast to South or South-by-Southwest, almost directly over my head.  It was dark, so it was hard to tell exactly how high up it was, but my best guess is about 75 meters.  It looked to be about 20 times the size of the moon.  It had 5 round, significantly sized lights that I could see, quite faint, and they seemed to get fainter at the edges.  They were spaced as such: one at each corner, and the other two were spaced just between the corners.I can&apos;t be totally sure because it was dark, but the craft looked black, and I could somewhat make out the shape of body as it flew by; it looked like a boomerang, but, hm, how to describe this- if you were to take those five round lights, then make a circle around each light so that the outer circles were about 80-100% bigger in diameter, then joined them all together in a chevron shape, that&apos;s basically what it looked like.  Though between each of the circles there was a smooth connection.  Really the best way to describe it was like it was a lumpy boomerang.It made no sound that I could hear, even though it looked close.  The speed was also too slow to be an airplane.  It looked like it was just gliding along.  It flew with the point (to clarify, it wasn&apos;t pointy, it was rounded all the way around) of the chevron first.  It was clear to me that what I was seeing was not ordinary.  I thought about trying to get the attention of someone in a parked car, but it looked like it was about to go over the hill, and the bus was coming.  Since it looked like I wouldn&apos;t be able to see it anymore and it was really cold outside, I decided to hop on the bus after a moment of hesitation (now I regret that).  I was able to see it for about 20 seconds total.My background: I was born and raised in America and studied Japanese and Computer Science related fields in University.

As I turned to show them what I was asking about, it silently moved vertically, and then just zipped off. So quickly, that all they could say is &quot;what are you talking about?&quot;. It drives me crazy that I cannot verify this sighting. No one takes me seriously, yet I know what I saw.

They appeard to be perfectly still in the night sky.  I tried to focus on them as best I could while at the same time looking forward to watch the road. The formation itself seemed to be 2-3 miles wide and the mass was fairly low to the ground.  After about 10 minutes they blinked out all at once, as if they vanished into thin air.

The shape of the craft could be seen because of the glow of the lights of the town that were behind it.  I do not know what direction it was travelling, or how far away it was, but it was obvious that it was very large.  I come to this conclusion because the treeline that I compared it too was at least 3 miles away, and the object looked large as it went over the horizon.  As it neared the treeline, there was a ring of white lights that started flashing at the center-rear of the craft.  I don&apos;t remember if there was any pattern, as I was very scared at this point, but each &quot;pulse&quot; lasted less than a second.  I also remember seeing diffuse red lights near where I thought the &quot;points&quot; of the triangle would be, but I have less of a memory of them.  I was just out of high school at the time, with my girlfriend, visiting her relatives.  I had wanted to be an airline pilot at the time, and when I saw the craft I started listing any large aircraft that I knew of, but none matched what I was seeing.

The thing that caught my eye was that the lights were stationary and not moving much.  At this point it looked like a single line of white lights.  I would estimate the pattern to be the size of a Concord jet (I have see one of those before flying kind of low in Europe at a special air show, so I know how big they look.)  I was driving toward the object when it did something that really caught my attention.  It made a right angle turn in the sky.  It did not make a slow turn like a plane but a rotating right angle turn. When it turned like that I could see that it was &quot;V&quot; shaped.  I have seen the TV show where all of these people saw a &quot;V&quot; shaped object and it looked just like that.  After that, it headed North at a very high rate of speed.

The shadow flashed across the road in front of me then was clear as day on the brick sidewall of the overpass as it moved away at a speed of over 100 MPH.  I immediately assumed it was an airliner as Baltimore Washington International Airport is about fifteen miles away so I looked up in the air and their was nothing.  Since it was a warm day I had my window down.  There was absolutely no sound.  I thought that perhaps it had been a State Police Helicopter.  There was nothing and their Dauphin Helicopters have a distinctive sound. There was not a cloud in the sky.

I was in the back seat, looking out the left window, and the object was in the air a few thousand feet up at about 10 o&apos;clock high.As we got closer to it, the other kids noticed it, and we pulled over the car and started piling out.  By the time all 6 of us had piled out of the sedan, it was moving.  It accelerated in a straight line away in the direction that we had been driving, and was gone in the distance in maybe 5 seconds.  I never heard a sound.  One of the other kids claimed to have heard a low hum.The most interesting thing about how it had initially hovered is that it was not moving at all.  Not bobbing, not leaning from the wind.  It was steady enough to cause me to think it was the top of a tower initially. Then, when it accelerated away, it was in a perfect, straight line.

When a young child, around 6-8 years old, I was out back playing in the yard alone during the daytime.  My mother was inside.  Our house and backyard were very small. Backyards were all ajoined by wire fencing; and most had open space in yard between back of house towards the end of the yard, where most had trees for privacy. I looked to the left and notice something that I would describe as shiney but dull metal, shaped like a perfect ball. &quot;Silverish or grayish&quot; in color. It was very SLOWly rising up from the ground ... straight up!  I first took notice when it was about 4 feet from the ground. &quot;Superballs&quot; (rubber balls of size from 1 inch to fit-in-your-palm size) were popular then. At very first I shouted &quot;wow! a huge superball...&quot; but realized it kept going up ... and up ... and straight up it kept going! and so slow! I watched it till I decided to yell for my mother before it disappeared.  I remember it getting shinier but not sure if that was due to the sun reflecting on it or not.  My last recollection was a shiney round sphere that ascended very slowly into the &quot;sky&quot;, going straight up, and I do not recall thinking it rotated.  My mother first said &quot;oh that was a weather balloon&quot; but was clearly shaken.  I kept insisting on what I know I saw. I knew that was not a weather balloon. She did NOT let me go out to play the rest of that day. NOTE: My mother before marriage had witnessed a &quot;cigar&quot; UFO in St. Louis.  (This of course I never knew till I was much older and after talking about the sphere incident now and then when growing up.) So this might have been why she was worried that day.

However i believe it may have been tear drop shaped or perhaps something akin to a triangle with smoothed edges.The craft moved very quickly over my location and dissappeared on the otherside of an apt. building.

When the two blinking light arrived at the pond they both disappeared.  Approximately 30 seconds elapsed from first seeing the lights till they disappeared.  Another 20 seconds passed and then the big surprise.  Down our two hundred foot driveway and perhaps another 75 feet hovering silently about 100 feet above an oval craft that glowed at first dark red then light red, pink, orange, yellow and then a bright white like a fluorescent light.  As the whole object glowed it was not possible to make out any detail.  The craft pulsated all this time like it was building up pressure to take off.  My wife and myself had come down the stairs and were viewing the event from the front stoop of our home.  We both felt very tranquil and had no fear.  I would have given anything to go and satisfy my curiosity.  As a matter of fact it will be my first question when I reach the here after.  Viewing the craft was about a minute.  I had the feeling that it just shot upward at blinding speed, however, it could have just disappeared with some other technology.   After the event the animal sounds subsided.We learned a few days latter that a neighbor across the street had also seen the unusual event.  Other reports were made as we learned it was reported in the Akron Beacon Journal and other media.Could something been exploring our earthly world and the animals with their superior hearing know it?((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At least one of our national networks (MTV3) reported (nonchalantly and in passing) in more than one news program a luminescent or highly reflective trail/object sighted over the morning skies of Helsinki. Two things make this interesting. First, there are apparently quite a number of eyewitnesses, at least one of which had captured very good footage of the phenomenon with his camcorder. A short clip of that was shown on the news program. Though it was impossible to make any definite appraisals based on the few seconds I saw of the anomaly, it moved quite slowly along a trajectory and most likely reflected the rising sun rather than emitted light of its own. But this is just a layman&apos;s opinion. Second, (and get your conspiracy hats out for this one) there was a separate report about a radar malfunction at Helsinki airport starting from 8.55 AM (local time) which lasted for 25 minutes delaying a total of 16 in- or outbound flights. There are two complementary radar systems at HEL, one of which didn&apos;t display any traffic during the malfunction. Apparently the system came back online as the GPS synchronizing clock was replaced. I have no information whether the sightings and the malfunction actually coincided in any manner or form. Apparently neither the Finnish air traffic control or Meteorological office observed anything out of the ordinary during the sighting. An astronomy club pointed out that there is a meteor cloud in the vincinity that might result in &quot;spectacular&quot; sightings. This is my full knowledge on the subject. If you wish to pursue this further investigate the issue through the news services and any local contacts you have.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the object reported and photographed might have been a high-altitude jet airliner, illuminated by the rising Sun.  This type of phenomenon is reported to our Center on a frequent basis.  We have no idea what may have caused the failure of the radar system, but we have no convincing evidence that the failure could have been caused by the presence of a genuine UFO.

We went out around between 1900-2200, I don&apos;t remember, but it was night and a chilly fall night. We set up the telescope facing the western sky and I do remember Mars was about half way up the night sky. We took turns looking.

It was way off in the distance and I remember thinking it was moving faster than a normal airplane, but not impossible. I was very curious and thinking it had to be an airplane of some sort.

We were approaching the four-way intersection of rt.9 and rt.287.  We both suddenly saw what looked like the headlights of a car in the sky and both exclaimed. There might have been one other car at the intersection but it pulled away before we got there (we had a red light). We stopped and looked at the lights and as they approached and we noticed that there were smaller white lights along the bottom of the craft as well as a slowly pulsing/blinking one on top.  All the lights were white.  I opened the car window and hung my torso out and did not hear any noise from the craft at all.  The craft was lower than any aircraft I have ever seen and was moving much more slowly than a normal plane.  We were not close enough to Dulles airport for the craft to be attempting to land there.  I&apos;m not sure exactly how high the craft was as I am not great with distances but it was certainly above the tree line but significantly lower than normal planes.  As the stoplight changed to green, my friend pulled through the intersection and the craft was simultaneously passing over our car.  I was still hanging out the window watching the craft and saw the shape of it from below.  It had a elongated triangularly-shaped nose that was split directly down the middle and it had a compact body with short wings and no tail. There was no exhaust.  My friend and i drove on discussing the sighting. About 5 or 6 minutes later, we were still driving to my house and were on a non-lined paved road right before the turn onto my dirt road.  My friend pointed at the sky and exclaimed that it looked like there was a storm far off in the distance (it looked like there was lightning behind the clouds. The light was slightly glowing and pulsating).  At this point I suggested that we stop the car and watch the storm.  My friend stopped and a craft that looked exactly like the previous one sighted, (same shape, size, speed, and height, and similar bearing) emerged from the clouds.  The pulsing light that was on top of it was what we had thought was the storm behind the clouds.  I rolled down the window completely and stuck my whole body out of the car, leaning on the roof and, admittedly, yelled profanities at the craft.  This craft did NOT pass directly over our car but  passed over about, maybe....25 yards away.  My friend and I sat in shocked silence for about a minute and proceeded to my house.  She dropped me off and for the rest of the night I was entirely jumpy and kept darting to the windows to see if another craft would appear.  The crafts could not plausibly be the same due to time and distance differences. Neither my friend nor I were intoxicated nor did we have drugs in our system.  We are both responsible and trustworthy high school students and while I know that my reveal of our ages can lead to an assumption of untrustworthiness and unreliability, I assure you that every bit of this account is true and unaltered.

Three friends and myself were sitting outside looking up at the stars from my deck around the pool.  I looked over to a radio tower that is approximately 1 mile from my house.  I noticed three lights that I thought at first were balloons and I told my friends to look.  Everyone thought that it was indeed baloons until they broke into a formation of first three, then four, then five reddish orangish almost squiggly like lights.  They were moving in a formation at a very high speed.  When they were in a direct line to my house and also a short distance afterward, my dog became very agitated and started to whine and cry.  None of us heard any sounds, nor did we feel any vibrations.  These lights were traveling at a very high speed, almost similar to when you see a satellite in the sky but they were only about 1500 to 2000 feet up in the air.  We watched them for about 50 seconds (maybe less) until they were rendered invisible to us due to the city lights.  We are all in agreement that none of us has ever seen anything like this.  When first spotted we all thought that it was balloons, so I guess it started out as an oval type of shape and then it turned into more of a squiggly shape.  There was one prominately on the top that was visible at all times.

Then, the craft seemed to slow down as it was perpendicular to me, and then sped up to do an incomplete U-turn and stopped dead in one spot. At this point it is 40 degrees up in the sky or so, and I&apos;m curious. There was no sound. The craft then moved diagonally down-right in the sky to a lower point, but seemed closer at the same time. The orange color was gone, and it was dark and blinking a white light and a red light. Blinking white, white, red, could not detect any pattern to the flashes. Now I was getting very very nervous and started to take a few steps backward further up the hill in the direction I was originally going. Then jogged a few more paces and turned right onto a side street and waited behind a house which covered that part of the sky completely. It swung to the right of the house, (west). It was definitely under one thousand feet up, and seemed small. Only could make out the flickering red and white lights, and a reddish glow that would brighten and darken as it moved. The lights seemed higher up on it, and the glow was on the bottom part of it. Watched it for 15 seconds or so, and became scared beyond belief and made a run for it, looked behind a few times and it was pursuing, swinging wildly left and right to keep a view of me. I turn another two corners in my run and stopped to get my bearings. It was nowhere in the sky to be seen. Feeling jittery and worried for my safety, I walked for a good 20 minutes.

I walked around the house to check on things and look out various windows into our front and back yards.  I ended up back in our bedroom where we have a set of French doors with windows looking into our back yard/Northern sky.  Immediately my eyes were drawn low into the sky where I saw an extremely bright white light.  It actually looked like a close cluster of lights rather than a single solid bright light. The object hung completely still, low in the sky.  My first though was that I was looking at a helicopter, but upon closer inspection there was simply too much light coming from this object.  With the distance it appeared to be at, 2 miles away, the area the light was occupying would have been about the same size as an entire helicopter. The light did not fade or grow in intensity either, so the object was not moving toward or away from me. It appeared to simply hover there. I stared at it as it hung there in the sky for at least a couple minutes. I remember thinking that I wished it would move or turn so that I could get a better idea of what it was. You know, we all have a pretty good idea about how an airplane or helicopter should appear to move in the sky.  Although it looked and &ldquo;felt&rdquo; odd to me, I still wasn&rsquo;t ready to call it a UFO.  My wife noticed I was still staring out the window and asked me what I was looking at.  Not wanting to sound crazy, I simply said &ldquo;the sky&rdquo;.  About 15 seconds passed after she spoke to me the object started to move, very slowly, to the east. It maintained its low altitude in a perfectly straight line as if it was on rails. I see airplanes in the sky from my back yard all the time. The amount of light this thing was putting out was simply abnormal, even if you consider the possibility that I was looking at airplane landing lights, or a helicopter &ldquo;night sun&rdquo; spot light pointed perfectly in my direction. What finally made me think that I was not looking at an airplane or helicopter was the way it moved.  Its movement and acceleration was not smooth.  It would sort of surge forward a little, slow down, surge forward, slow down, surge, slow etc. The object&rsquo;s total speed was very slow, so the surging was sort of subtle, but was still very noticeable.  It did not move smoothly across the sky as an airplane or helicopter with momentum would. I should also mention that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s acceleration from stop to its &ldquo;cruising speed&rdquo; appeared instant and effortless. As for sound, it was silent.  There was no aircraft or other types of sound other than normal early morning ambient, which is pretty quiet in La Quinta, CA at this hour. We have a local small aircraft strip nearby about a half mile away, but the planes landing and taking off from there can be heard and seen quite easily. There was no wind this morning either, it was calm. At this point I wanted my wife to witness what I was seeing, so I said calmly to her, &ldquo;want to see a UFO&rdquo;? She was still awake from being startled by what she thought was a noise outside our house, and because I was still investigating. We were both very lucid.  She said, &ldquo;There is no UFO&rdquo;.  I then told her to come and look, and she could tell I wasn&rsquo;t joking around, so she jumped right out of bed and walked over to me quickly. In our decade plus of marriage, I had never asked her to come and look at a UFO.  I pointed the object out to her, which wasn&rsquo;t difficult, and she watched it move.  I told her to note how it was moving in a (for lack of better word) &ldquo;surging&rdquo; fashion, and that airplanes/helicopters do not move like that.  She agreed, and we watched the object disappear behind our neighbor&rsquo;s roofline. After this I stepped outside and tried to get another glimpse of it, but it was gone. It&rsquo;s important to note, that if you look to the North from my back yard in La Quinta, you can see mountains, which are part of the San Andreas fault line.  The base of the mountain is only about 5-6 miles away from my house.  It was easy to see that the object wasn&rsquo;t very far away, and was very low in the sky. If I had to guess at the altitude I would say 400 - 500 feet above the ground. I am an IT professional, and my wife is an interior designer for one of the local home builders. I have an extremely open mind when it comes to subjects such as UFOs, but this is the first time in my life that I felt the need to report a sighting, and it&rsquo;s the first time since childhood that I saw something in the night sky that was strange enough to qualify for me.  I am open minded, but also very analytical.  I wasn&rsquo;t simply looking at a &ldquo;bright light in the sky&rdquo;.  What prompted me to make this report was how it moved, as described above.  If there is a logical explanation for how a &ldquo;known&rdquo; aircraft can exhibit a perfectly straight, visibly &ldquo;surging&rdquo;, very slow movement across the sky, I would like to know what it is.", "disk about 40 feet in dia. a ring of round lights about the egdes. moved slowly, no sound, 75 feet of the groundAt the time I was statioin at KI Sawyer AFB UP Michigan.

The object remained directly overhead for not more than 20 secs and then tilted forward, moved slowly at first over the highway in the direction of Helena.  My friend and I followed the object in the van speeding at one point up to 100mph for not more than a minute then the object seemed to disappear (lost in the city lights of East Helena).  We drove to the Helena airport and saw no activity there.  The next day we returned to the Helena airport (in the daylight) and saw no strange aircraft but a few USAF cars - as far as I know there is no AF presence in Helena.  My friend an I were basically laughed out of high school when we told a few friends and our parents...although one friend had an uncle who was a veterinarian that seemed interested because of some strange cattle mutilations that had happened in the area... I put this out of my mind as something that I could never talk about but a coworker mentioned about flying triangles after seeing some t.v. shows regarding this subject.  After looking on this website, I noted that another gentleman in the Helena area had a similar experience in broad daylight..I would be very interested in talking to that individual.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I thought that it could be a meteor except it was so large it was the size of the moon when it is huge and full in the sky.  It was a distinct circle just like as if the moon was falling out of the sky but it was a bright green color with a tail. It happened very fast.

We remarked on how dumb those, what we thought were helicopter pilots, guys were to be hovering over the nuke plant.  Then we realized they weren&apos;t aircraft.  We watched them for about 10-20 minutes, when they suddenly flew across the lake, about 3 miles distance, in about 1 second.  They hovered over a mountain for about 5 minutes, when they suddenly flew back across the lake immediately over the nuke plant cooling tower again and came to a dead stop.  They hovered for another 10-20 minutes, then went straight up out of sight.

It moved quite swiftly from my Left to my Right leveling out as it passed in front, and slightly above my position. I have no memory of any sound associated with the incident. The object might be described as a fat cigar with round features distributed down the side, somewhat like portholes. I don&apos;t recall how many. There did not appear to be any wings or lights. The overall impression that I have is that it had a metallic greyish appearance, with a slight blue or turquoise cast.  I remember it as being quite large which may be a reflection of my own size at the time.  Memory tells me that it was about as long as the width of the field below me.  It achieved level flight before it passed my position, and maintained it untill it disapeared to my Right.I don&apos;t remember anything about my circumstances at the time, either before or after the incident.I have questioned my parents about this, but they have no memory of any incidents that correlate.

However, they would stay relatively close to one another at all times at a distance that appeared to be about 1-2 inches at arms length.

I consider my powers of observation very sound. As an interesting side note another person from the Kingston Ontario area also saw a noteworthy sighting around the same time, place, and date as reported on HBCCUFO.org website.My sighting was a rather complicated event but basically  my attention was drawn to the night  sky initially due to display of Northern lights. This was around 7 pm.Some minutes later I saw a very bright moving light approaching fairly quickly from the North/East which could easily be misperceived as a UFO. However this light eventually turned out to be what I believe was a conventional prop  aircraft---although one which I have never seen presenting such an intensely bright light nor such a large craft at such a low altitude. I believe it was a conventional craft as it appeared to have small blinking  red lights on the ends of both wings. Strangely it was silent until it began a banking turn and then I could hear the drone of the engines. But most noteworthy was the intense white light that must have been affixed somewhere up front. I say up front because after it banked and turned it was no longer visible but the smaller outside marker lights, as well as a couple more, were weakly seen. This intense illumination is the brightest  light I have seen in the sky besides several reentering meteors seen during meteor showers.But the quality of the light was quite different.Returned inside my house. Went back out with  video camera and observed a  patch of evenly illuminated light to the North which I took to be this prop plane which must have turned back again and then flew farther North of my position and then West while I was inside ( I surmise that but am not sure if it was the same craft). Diverted my attention and now this patch of light was due West and then much more South in what in retrospect must have been a very quick progression.  Not sure how it moved from North to South so quickly.  But I don&apos;t believe this was a UFO.  However what I caught on video next surely was. To make the story short....After returning inside and back out again  I saw 2 light balls or orbs at about 1 km/half mile distance due North of me. They were in a line and  separated by about 30 feet and looked to be a few feet above the ground. First I took them to be lights from 2 cars--although brighter.  One had a reddish hue while the other was more white.But they started to act &quot;strangely&quot;---appearing to move slightly up or down or forwards or backwards. Then one winked out and to cut to the chase the solitary remaining orb approached to about 300 feet away and appeared to be about tree top height.  It was quite bright and was a soft yellowish white in color.  The time it took to approach and then leave was less than a minute.It is clearly discernible on tape. I never zoom the camera so its change in apparent size and luminosity shows it moved forward and then departed after some moments.I took some video a few days later of the  same daytime setting and it helps to illustrate how this light had to be floating over a farm field.  As a final note I should add that this is not the first time I have witnessed strange aerial activity.  But this is the first time I have captured it on tape.What I have observed is clear, what it is, is not.If you require more info or want video please contact me via email.", "Opa Locka 1967.

Navarre Beach, Florida December 12, 2005 starting  at 9:00AM Picture taking didn&rsquo;t begin until  9:18AM and ended at 9:21AM. On December 12, 2005, I was in Navarre Beach, Florida working on a construction site erecting a 29 story [level] condo.  At 9:00AM after being on the reed bar slab since 6:30AM,  I came down to the ground from the condo slab for my 9:00AM coffee break.  I was still wearing my polarized sunglasses at the time when I just happen to glance up into the sky and noticed what appeared to be a circular and grayish cloud with a colorful rainbow on the outer skirt of this circular-like cloud.  The barely noticeable rainbow completely encased  the round type cloud  similar to a halo effect.  I was thinking to myself, &quot;This is unusual.  I have never seen a cloud formation that was so perfectly round; not only that, I never seen a rainbow that was so perfectly round during the daytime, only a rainbow that was half a circle and normally connected to the ground at both ends.&quot;    I removed momentarily my polarized sunglasses to see if I could see more clearly   defined details as in colorfulness in this rainbow that was on this unusual cloud effect.  To my dismay, the colorful rainbow effect was less perceivable than when I was wearing the sunglass and looking thru it at the rainbow.  This unusual cloud formation with the rainbow, kind of reminded me of what I once saw many years ago, when I was looking at the moon on a very cloudy night.  It had a rainbow ring around it when the moon shined through the clouds.  That phenomenon is explainable: When there is a high concentration of moisture within the cloud, the moonlight shinning through the cloud can possibly create a rainbow effect as in a halo around the moon.  When a halo effect around the moon is normally seen, this is usually a good indication that within a 24 hour period, there is a very good possibility of rain occurring in the region.I told my supervisor  who was standing next to me, and I guided him with my hands and pointing in the general direction of the unusual cloud formation with the rainbow on the outskirts of the grayish, circular cloud.  He could barely see with his eyes what I was showing him; yet, he was able to perceive that there was something there with a rainbow effect which was almost unnoticeable .  He joked that it could be a UFO, and I told him that I didn&rsquo;t think it was a UFO but a very strange event; possibly Eglin experimenting with weather control which is a joke in itself.  I also told my boss as in a joke that is could be a wormhole, and that is how UFO&rsquo;s were able to travel vast distant, but that was only as a joke; although, it had me thinking a little about it after I said it.  I told him I had a camera in my truck and asked him for permission if I can takes some pictures of this unusual cloud with the rainbow which he granted me permission.  I took 9 pictures with a digital camera. If I didn&rsquo;t have to work at that moment, I would had taken more pictures and watched this cloud until it could no longer be seen.  Let it be known, there was no doctoring to the pictures that I had taken nor is there any hoax that I know of associated to the rainbow cloud mention above.  Not known at the time when the pictures were taken,  there had been some sighting on November 7, 2005 seen in the general area which is bizarre when you connect those UFO sighting with the odd cloud event.  I  may had witness maybe once in a lifetime an unusual cloud formation with the rainbow effect.  This could explain the event I saw several years ago of changing patterns of lights I saw at night which I originally thought to be a planet or large star.  I&rsquo;m still searching for an answer for how a cloud can be formed perfectly circular with a rainbow effect.  If it were not for color gray inside the cloud, you could say it was a big bubble, but what could make a bubble that big?", "Metallic sphere over Los Angeles International Airport.On Mar 10, 1998 at approximately 5:30 a.m. my wife woke me, she was very excited and wanted to show me a light in the sky to the south of Santa Monica, she was sure it was something unusual. I went out my front door with her and looked up, it was a very brilliant white light, I told her it was just a star (I&apos;m forever a skeptic), we had planned a flight to Las Vegas that morning and I had to check weather and file my flight plan. As I was making coffee (first priority), I kept checking the light up in the sky, it didn&apos;t appear to move at the time.  After I had prepared for the flight we walked out to the street to get in my truck and leave and to my surprise when I looked up in the sky, the light from earlier was now lower on the horizen and appeared to be directly over the north complex of LAX, it now looked like a large metallic sphere. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing, nor could my wife(and of course, she told me so). I grabbed my binoculars from my vehicle to view the sphere and it was definitely metallic, was no longer glowing and was just hovering, at about 2500 ft. I am a commercial pilot and have been around aircraft since I was a child, this was nothing like I have ever seen.  To estimate the size I referenced it against a 747-400 above and behind the object traveling southeast and roughly state 50 ft in diameter, and thats very rough.  The sphere very slowly decended to a slightly lower altitude as we observed it, I decided that I was just going to go ahead and leave for the airport, assuming that if it was anything of significance it would be all over the news, but of course after returning that afternoon and watching the news, nothing.  That is the first and only time I have ever witnessed something like that, and it really has sparked my curiosity about such sightings.

I was squinting but thought they were there to take the TV.  As I have at this time just moved to West Orange from Newark and only thinking that they were African American because the afro&apos; look was still prevalent at the time.  Being a harvest moon at the time in a house surrounded by 300 acres of reservation land and a large picture wall window was directly in front of me an my brothers bed so the moon lighted the room well.  Upon opening my eyes a second later I realized even as a child that they were not black children, but what is now the so called grey&apos;s which I would deem grey more a light blue an silver but very similar to what has been popularized fictionally an very much alive.  Still seems funny to me when people throw the line maybe were not alone in the universe because if one is right in front of you that thought blinks buy to the&rsquo;s next.  To cap this quickly one the larger one stood off in the back an just stood there with what seemed a nasty look on its face one to the left of my brothers bed and one knelt on the other side of my brothers bed with what looked like a box an was doing something to his arm.  I at this time thought they were killing him and could not summon any courage to do anything but not move or be seen myself.  I thought that I could fight but there were three a seemed an eternity for me of what was my fate or what I should do.  My thought of screaming and or jumping up a tackling one was the best idea I could think but I was petrified in fear and didn&apos;t have the courage.  Sure as shit they say the little bastard near my brother&rsquo;s bed got up and walked around a came to me.  Let me get this straight to you this was like having a terrorist coming at you to do harm as far as I knew.  He knelt and opened a strangely shaped box he was carrying at least for the 70&apos;s but still haven&apos;t seen anything like it today reached in the box to grab something.  I made a noise if I remember by accident and was beginning to cry an the &quot;man&quot; made a very unforgettable wince face ((hope you get)) maybe a grimace but the wrinkles curled and it was like he was yelled at for doing something wrong but during this time they did not speak although they looked like they were talking the whole time.  I can&rsquo;t really explain the unexplained but the one who stood in front of me the whole times head moved and pitched slightly from left to right.  Anyway immediately after the grimace it was like a b-line to get out he closed the box immediately stood up an im telling you this was the icing on the cake they all moved like 1.  I mean it was like a the finest military coordination you have ever seen in unison they in stride not missing a beat filled out of my room abruptly. With two more sliding into the rank from my parent&rsquo;s room as they passed all together as one.  Anyway of course no one saw anything I didn&rsquo;t move till light, told everyone and everyone didn&rsquo;t believe yada yada same old story right.  But I assure anyone this was no dream and is not a situation where someone may feel confidant in saying I believe that he believes he saw something.  This was as real as anything; the sad part about it is that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter.  An even if I could prove it, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter anyway.

But now it&apos;s all better and so I&apos;ve been taking some time and catching up on all the latest ufo buzz.  Even though I wasn&apos;t keeping up with the postings on the National UFO Reporting Center, I still continue to observe the sky every night.  I&apos;ve been out every night since Nov. 3, 2003.  Anyways, it&apos;s been very interesting to read everyones different experiences (I decided to only read reports from California for the time being) and  hear their discriptions of the wonderful and unique objects that are always in the skies above us.  I have to say that many of you are writing reports and describing some of the EXACT same kinds of things that I have seen!!! For instance, one couple have seen in the Eastern sky,(5 or 6 times they said) a bright white object that is emitting other white objects from it that fly away on their own.  I too have seen the same thing about 3 times over the past 2 1/2 years.  Quite a few people have seen &quot;lime green&quot; objects in the sky that also light up the sky all around with a flourscent green hue.  I have seen this many times and have observed many green objects that somehow form a green vapour cloud around themselves that comes and then disepates every few seconds.  Sometimes it appears that the object does this to camifloge itself.  I&apos;ve seen purple vapor clouds around a purplish object also. It is such a rush each and every time I&apos;am lucky enough to see these strange wonders.  I think I was one of the first people to report seeing what appeared to be &quot;stars&quot; that suddenly became &quot;moving stars&quot; that moved about in a certain area of the sky as if they had a certain raidius around them to guard or protect.  Well, I just wanted to say that I&apos;am so happy that there are others of you who can truely relate to me and I to you, and I feel very fortunate to be a small part of the BIG picture.

This stretch of highway is about 10-15 miles north of Butte, MT. At approx. 2:20pm-2:30pm as I was climbing the winding pass up through Elk Park canyon I spotted 2 triangle shaped craft in the sky between 2 mountains. I was filled with a sensation of panic as soon as I spotted them because I knew what I was seeing was neither ordinary, nor something that I had seen before. Because I have no idea of the actual size of the craft, it is difficult to guage their altitude but they did appear to be flying higher than the mountains, and one craft appeared to be flying slightly higher than the other. The sun was bright that day and from the reflection of sunlight off of the craft they appeared to be chrome, they were very bright. At first glance the craft appeared to be stationary but after a few seconds of observation it looked like they were moving slowly towards the southwest. They also appeared to be moving much slower than any aircraft I have ever seen. It was a very cold day, yet the craft left no contrails as they moved. As I continued up the highway, my view of the craft was obscured as the road wound around a mountain side. I thought for sure I would have a clearer view of them another 1/2 mile or so up the road where the highway comes out of the canyon and opens up into plains, but when I got there they were gone. I thoroughly searched the sky for them and could not see them. They appeared to be moving southwest, and there were mountains a few miles south that I suppose they probably moved behind. There were other motorists on the highway that day but I&apos;m not sure if anyone else saw them. Judging from their position in the sky I would guess the craft would also have been visible from another highway further south than the one I was on.(Homestake Pass, the highway from Butte MT to Whitehall MT) I did not observe any other aircraft in the sky at the time. I did not notify the police or any other authorities, but I felt that what I saw was so unusual that I should notify someone.By the way I am a ((deleted)) worker for the State of Montana, Department of ((deleted)).", "Bright white, slightly flickering light that &quot;wobbled&quot; slightly, but VERY rapidly and wastoo bright and big for a star or planet.Just after 6 AM on Januray 25, 2006, heading north on my way to the commuter lot to pick up riders, I noticed what I first assumed was the bright approach light of an airliner.  Sometimes, they can appear stationary when they are headed straight towards you.  There were several other aircraft in other parts of the sky, all clearly moving in various directions. But this light remained stationary in relation to the moon, which was visible to the east.  I and my passengers coud see it all the way into the Washington DC area.  It seemed much too bright and large to be a star or planet, but I didn&apos;t really give it much more thought.  However, this morning, same time, same route, it was there again.  The moon was lower in the sky than it was two days ago, but the light was in the same place.  This time, I paid more attention to it.  While I waited at the commuter lot, I watched this light closely.  Ever so often, it seemed to move up, down, and side to side, very slightly, and very rapidly. I guess you&apos;d call it a barely discernable wobble.  Coincidentally, one of the riders from two days before got in, and I called his attention to the light.  As we sat waiting for another rider, we both watched it, and he observed it wobble.  I&apos;ve seen bright lights in the sky before, and never really thought much about it. But the &quot;wobble factor&quot; of this one really has me wondering.", "About  0600 am going to work i saw this most unusual light  from something overhead.About 0600 just before day I was going to work .

At first I thought it was a grain elevator light so we rode around to an open field where the grain elevators are. Then we noticed there were more than one and thought maybe someone was using flares to get help, sometimes boaters use them to signal for help on the Pamlico river and they were orange like flares or fireworks look in the distance. We live near Pinetown, at an intersection on HWY 32 N. called Five-points. It is north of the Pamlico river and north-northwest of Cherry Point MCAS which is in Havelock, and we thought maybe they (marine corp) were doing some type of manuevers there, maybe using multiple flares. We watched and to our amasement, there were three lights, two lights closer together, southsouth east of our position, with one which was further to the west of the first two, directly south of our position. They were orange round lights and they turned, like a lighthouse, they would go out and after 3-4 minutes they would come back around. We were about 5-10 miles as the crow flys north of the Pamlico River and as distance is very hard to judge in the night sky, I would say these objects were at least as far away as the river. They were higher than the tree line but definitely in the southern horizon, not overhead. It put you in the mind of a helicopter with a search light flying in a circle looking for something only they were too high to be a coast guard or police helicopter and be effective and they had no other tail lights, wing lights, or other marking lights of any kind. They didn&apos;t do any exceptional manuevers but my 8 year old daughter did get a little scared when the southern one seemed to be getting closer. We observed them a good 15 to 20 minutes. I will not be surprised if this is explained but it was no burning space garbage or meteor, it was some type of aircraft or spacecraft.

There are tv towers on the same hill my granparents live on, to the south we saw a group of lights slowly approaching, at first I thought it was the blimp but as it got closer I could tell that it wasnt. The body itself blended into the night sky, but it had what best looked like passenger windows on an airplane, but they were slowly revolving around the side of the object with a soft flourescent like light emitting from them. Without a sound it very slowly hovered around a tv tower that was no more than a 1/4 mile away, it had dropped down about 20 feet lower than the top of the tower, moved around it and then stopped for a second and then headed back in the direction it came moving very slow and quiet.

It was approx. 1:30 AM, my daughter was asleep. There was an overpass in the distance maybe one half mile ahead when I saw an amazing acrobatic display of three lights (all attached to one flying vehicle, I could not see the structure of the vehicle itself but the lights were attached to something triangular). The lights were a blinding white and bluish color, almost like the headlights on new european import cars. The vehicle was flying very low turning rapidly and banking east to west then north to south along the freeway. I had the window down on my vehicle and was traveling approx. 75 mph, I heard no destinctive sounds. I was surprised that other cars were not stopping ( I did not stop either), I thought that this might be routine for local drivers. I thought that I was possibly seeing a helicopter crop dusting the citrus trees to the east of the freeway. I am the type of person that would normally stop on the side of the freeway to see what was actually out there. I did not do so in this case, I was in awe,rattled, and honestly a little scared by the display.

The airspeed was a little faster than my driving speed of 75 mph. I estimate the aircraft&apos;s speed to be somwhere between 80 to 110 mph, but I am not quite positive. When the event was over and I continued along the freeway I began to question what I saw: Was this a crop duster? Why would a crop duster be doing these displays over a busy freeway, and if so was he or she drunk and pulling a prank? Was this a military aircraft, and why would the military be so ignorant to pull a sunt like this over a busy freeway? Was this a sighting of a UFO?

The lights never rose or fell, only lit up like balls of fire, remained lit for several seconds, then disappeared. I was knocking on the window to try and get people to come out. The lights showed up again even further to the left - this happened seven or eight times. One other person came out in time to see the entire final display - this last time was the clearest, and it looked like six balls of fire that lit up on a horizontal line (right to left), then disappeared - not moving up or down, just disappearing.

So I decided to look up a month I too saw something I could not explain. On March 11, 1993, 2 friends and I were heading out for spring break, first to Austin, TX and then to South Padre Island. I looked at the reports for March 93 and found, &quot;I SAW 3 BLINKING / JUMPING LIGHTS FOR MORE THAN 3 HOURS&quot;. I can&rsquo;t say it was the same object, however, I know it was the same stretch of highway and at about the same hour. Heading south from Fort Worth, TX, between Waco and Austin, we saw something in the sky that we cannot explain. I know, 13 years have pasted but this experience, I&rsquo;ll never forget. We saw an object moving East to West at about 8:30 - 9:00 PM, a strange object with segment of lights blinking in a row. We first noticed it from a distance as it was moving from our left to right at a slow rate. Shortly after, we saw that other vehicles have pulled over on I-35 to watch this object in the sky. I-35 runs North and South, so the object appeared from the east and moved over I-35 to the West, it wasn&rsquo;t moving very fast at all. Then from the South East, a huge bright light appeared, but that turned out to be a helicopter flying fast towards the direction of the object. When I look back to the object, it was nowhere in site. We know a helicopter in the sky, but we could never identify that object.

The object was dark but I could not make out the color. There were no lights on the object. The sky was overcast, so this object was moving under the backlit cloud cover.

My impression is that it was low, yet somewhat above the building, it didn&apos;t seem far off either, maybe 50 feet straight out yet we were looking up towards it. It was dark that night but clear, with street/city type lights present.To me, it only appeared about 3 feet tall and if I got a hold of it, as if I could just get my arms wrap around it.  I don&apos;t remember any lights, ignition source,exhaust emanating, sound, or distinguishing marks.  It FLOATED up right, like we walk.  No jerking or fast movements, just a steady float in a forward direction.  That is what was most bizarre, what made it float?  I remember trying to rationalize it..see if it was connected to something, like electrical wires, etc..asking my roommate the whole time if she sees what I do, and what does she think.  She said yes, but was speechless beyond that (even, was so freaked out after, that she never would make claim to it again.)  What kept coming to mind, was a probe of sorts, not a space ship with aliens, but who knows.  As it continued on that steady floating forward path, it cleared the corner of our building, making it so we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.

The lights were in a diamond pattern, three lights were white and one that blinked red on the front side of the diamond.  These lights did not blink like beacons on commercial aircraft.  The white ones were a very fast strobe and/or a shuttering effect with the red light blinking a steady pulse.

About 5 or 10 minutes before we started driving again, we saw a dark cloud about the size of 3 football fields flashing a white light every other second or so.  The light was flashing from inside the cloud.   The size of the light was about 60-100 feet in diameter.  This lasted about 5-8 minutes.

I thought it was probably an airliner, but it didn&apos;t blink different colorslike they usually do - it was a steady white light.  What is really odd is that it suddenly disappeared.  I was following its path, and it should not have been out of sight if it had continued on a direct path.  Very odd.  Do not know if anyone else is seeing something and then &quot;not seeing something&quot;.

At least 100 of them dancing across the sky silent,graceful- making all kinds of formations and designs.

While sitting on a patio chair I gazed at the stars. I noticed an orange &quot;star&quot; that was moving northward. It was too high to be a helicopter. I thought it may be a jet. But it was too high and bright. I saw a seemingly shooting star shoot up towards it but it burned once it was near it. It moved in a straight line then stood still for 3 minutes. Then it would move west and stand still again. The strange thing is a saw (for lack of a better word) sparks falling to earth fom this mobile star. They would look like a falling star very small and burn(perhaps at 30 feet in the air) before they would get close.

When I initially noticed the object it just seemed to appear on the horizon. We live in a mountainous region.  I was observing this object on a VERY clear night night with almost unlimited visibility. The object was observed on the horizon on a mountain ridge across from my residence.  I approximate the distance from myself to the object at 1 mile.  From my view point, I was looking across the artificial horizon created by the mountain against the sky.  Beyond the mountain, there was illumination created by a local shopping center. The object was certainly in the air.  It was approximately 150 ft in the air over the ridge.  It just stayed there.  There was no movement as an aircraft would behave. I know the aircraft traffic patterns in our location and this was way out of those normal patterns and very low.  It had no defining navigation lights.  It had a very odd shape.  It seemed to change shape.  The illumination coming from the object was very aura like.  It had an electric, clear, sort of blue color to it. It seemed to change colors slightly as I observed some slight red and orange but overall the electric blue. The object descended into the tree line and moved in an almost hover like fashion. There was left to right movement moving slowly along the top of the ridge. Finallly, it descended into the tree line and I could move to look between the trees and could catch glimpses of the illumination coming from the object.

Moving extremely fast they came in and were in a group - then one moved to the right and took up a position not far from a star..the other three moved to the left and spaced themselves evenly apart and also became motionless at that time.  They went from being very bright to almost fading out completely and then they would all start to come into brightness again.  A type of synchronized strobbing was taking place with these (4) unknowns.  We watched for approximately 1 hour.  3 disappeared altogether from our sight as they went behind the tall pines in front of us.  The 4th stayed in place not moving - just changing in brightness from time to time.  The interesting thing about this was that the 4th unknown moved with the night skyline.  If we had not seen these 4 unknowns come into our skyline from the flash of light, we would have thought that they were just stars after they took up positions.  Exciting to say the least... From our position we estimated that they were probably staged over the Pacific Ocean as the crow flys from us..", "Fast Moving Green LightI had just laid down to go to sleep when a very bright greenish light flooded my bedroom.

Somwhere over Los Angeles. It then makes a straight beeline towards the north, stops at approximately over La Canada or 10-15 degrees north of my horizontal and then heads east to the original point.  It will often stop and repeat the pattern or will execute a right turn and head straight south and out of sight.  Other times when it turns to the North it keeps on going until out of sight.  When there are two lights, they fly in irregular patterns and sometimes seem to go around in circles like they are chasing each other.  Then, one will stop and the other goes off to the South West.  Very seldom, a pulse trail appears when the light starts to move from a stopped position and it will also change to a dull orange or red color when it comes to a stop. The time of tracking is normally seconds ie. 5-10.  Sometimes, they move in straight lines, but most of the time, they travel in a slight waving pattern at a high rate of speed.

I watched as a circular light moved from the west to the east very quickly and then stopped dead in the sky.  That brought me to my sharpest attention as I know there are no sattelites or planes that will do that and it was so far distant in the sky that I knew it was not a helicopter or other man made light. It appeared to be situated in the stars yet closer if that makes any sense. It paused for only two or three seconds and then left so fast I guess I would only describe as up and it was gone in about one second.  I sat there and knew that this was not man made. It was not a light created by a spotlight, it was not anything that we made as it moved incredibly fast.  There were no colors and it did not flicker or anything than being a solid white circle.

The object was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon and was slightly descending in a tight corkscrew pattern. Suddenly the light was emitting glowing red balls that were larger than the object and with a much brighter luminosity. These lights seemed to descend to different altitudes before disappearing.  When I saw this I thought that they may have been doing exercises off of the back end of MacDill Airforce base and that the balls might have been flares but these balls did not remain luminous for a long period (a few seconds).  Then the object made the most stunning emission of what looked like a flood of sparks. It took on the appearance of the classic comet type of configuration and moved in lazy circles speeding up and slowing down; becoming more luminous and less luminous. I was hypnotized by the object. It was very beautiful. I asked my wife, who was driving, how would you describe that and she commented, &quot;It looked like fireworks&quot;. I tried to notice the turns this object was making and the sudden turns and decreases in speed were amazing. The object continued to emit this flood of sparks and move in a lazy corkscrew while speeding up and slowing down.  During this observation we noticed that a bright light of white yellow color split from the head of the object and rejoined a few seconds later. The observed event lasted approx 10- 15 minutes when we exited on Westshore Blvd.  The buildings obscured the view of the sky.  It may be of important note that the annual Gasparilla Parade was taking place in Tampa this evening, though I am not sure the times.  I am very interested to know if anyone else submitted a report. My background-I am a 41 year old Graduate Student in History and my wife is 32 and a Graduate student in Library Science. We are both completely sober and do not drink or smoke.((NUFORC Note:  If anyone can identify the object, we would welcome additional information about this incident.  We wonder whether it might have been caused by an aerobatic display, performed by an aircraft with pyrotechnic devices on its wings, but that is just a guess, one of many possibilities.

I wrote about a bright amber light that &quot;pulsed&quot; and released flare-like objects.  Ever since I saw these objects (on several occasions) I was obsessed with finding out what they were. Today, I was looking through old NUFORC reports. There were several similiar reports coming out of Burbank, CA.  NUFORC stated the police officers in that area reported that the objects people were seeing were not UFOs, but mini home-made hot air balloons with some sort of pyrotechnic devices. After doing some online searching, I learned about &quot;Fire Balloons&quot; &amp; found these two sites:  http://php.indiana.edu/%7Elrobins/candbal.htm (explains how a fire-balloon can let off sparks or bright flashes of light among other things)  http://www.overflite.com/index.html   This could very well be what I saw on in Lake Havasu City, AZ.  However, during the very last sighting of these objects I had, the objects faded to a pin-point of light and flew over the mountains. I know this could have been an illusion and it could have been me looking at the light burning out and it just *appeared* to be flying away from me. Anyway, as dissapointed as I am,  I just thought I would pass this along.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We called inside to the rest of the family and they all came outside.  We watched it slowly move, northeast for about a minute and a half.  It then dropped what appeared to be a fire ball to the earth, then completely disappeared.

It was late at night...I don&apos;t know how late...but probably after midnight. The road was through a pine forest. We were travelling toward sea level and as a consequence the plane of the land ahead of us was visible for a few miles to the horizon (we could see the tops of the trees for a ways ahead due to the downward slow incline of the land). About near the horizon, I see this lighted object. I first think that it must be an airplane. This is for a good minute or two. As we approached it however, I realized that the object was not moving and that it was shaped like a squat spheroid and had lights evenly spaced around its equator. I then assumed that it must be a water tower. As we got closer it became apparent that the thing was hovering right on the left hand side of the road about 3-5 feet above the trees. It was no more than 30-50 feet away from the car at the closest point. The lights on it were bright white and were shining downward. I guess it must have been 30-50 feet in diameter. On the underside of the object, there was a fanlike rotor structure composed of many thin metallic looking fan blades. There were so many blades that you could not see a gap between them...but it my also have been that they were spinning too fast, so maybe there were fewer blades and it was more of an optical illusion do to the spinning. There was a slight fog around and above the trees, and the convection of the fan was sucking the fog into the object. I was filled with a very definitive fear and hightened anxiety like I have never felt before. I pointed at the object and could only say, &quot;look, a UFO!&quot; and kept driving.

The craft was approached by two military helicopters, which came within very close proximity to it. The helicopters closed on it briefly, then backed off to a distance of about 200 yds. and maintained their positions. Three seperate missles, apparently ground fired from the Fort Carson military installation were seen to impact the object, causing it to fall to the ground.

I was heading outbound on the St Johns River entering Trout River Cut on a NE course.  The weather was poor all day with rain and wind and the weather at the time of this sighting not exactly perfect with rain squalls and wind. As I turned into the cut I could make out one white light up ahead about a mile and a half off of my bow slightly to starboard.  I figured it was probably a small vessel that I would keep an eye on.  As I got a little closer I notice two lights, one on top of the other, like the mast lights of a tug with a tow so I gave a security call on my VHF with no response.  I checked my radar but it was obscured with the rain and was, &quot; all greened out&quot;. The lights seemed to be stationary about a mile or so ahead of me and seemed to be at or just above water level.  About a minute later I was becoming concerned about having to meet a tow in this narrow channel in this kind of weather, so I decided to shine my spotlight at the lights.  I did this to make the other vessel aware that I was heading in its direction and to also try and see if I could tell what kind of &quot;boat&quot; I was about to meet.  As soon as I hit the lights with my spotlight it made a Bee-line right for me at a pretty good pace.  I immediately turned off my spotlight and thought &quot; Oh great, I just blinded a Navy Helicopter pilot from Mayport&quot;.

It was fairly large , about the size of a bus.   I watched as it passed and the silhouette against the low clouds looked almost saucer like from the back.  In few seconds it was gone heading towards downtown Jacksonville.  I never heard a sound.I have ran tugs for a while and have never seen anything like this.  I have never believed in little green men or any of that other stuff but this shook me up.

It spooked me so much I had my engineer sit with me in the wheelhouse the rest of the trip.  I did not tell him why, just that the weather was bad.

The concert was a big summer ending event that lasted three days. An orchestra from Portland was performing Swan Lake before the first of three sets on the evening.  During the performance a glider was towed in and released and started doing aerobatics that went with the orchestra.  It was a clear afternoon with very few clouds that were very high in the atmosphere.  As my wife and I were watching the glider we both noticed, without saying anything to one another at the time, a cigar shaped object in pretty much a stationary position directly above us.  The object was very high (I&apos;m guessing at least cloud level] and as I stated seemingly stationary. The object stayed at this location for a minute or so and then began to slowly move.  It never at this point moved straight.  It just slowly moved in slight arcs and almost made a circle.  It continued this for another couple of minutes and then stopped,almost motionless for avery brief moment [maybe 10 to 20 seconds] then it seemed to elongate and amazingly fast stretched almost 5 to 10 times its original length and disappeared.  I did&apos;t say anything to my wife, nor her to me,for a couple or minutes.  We both told each other the same story and were very bewildered.  I have only told a few others of this.

A huge disk silently gliding through the air!  Set in from the outer diameter a few yards were a ring of lights, pulsating different colors at different timing.

They were close enough at first that I could see their sphere structure, but no lines or dots or ribbing or anything, just opaque globes. They appeared perfectly round and exactly alike. They flew like they were a single unit but I could see space between them. There were no lights or twinkles or anything like that. If I wouldnt have been gazing right up there I probably wouldnt have noticed. They were mostly white but ever so slightly orange tinted. Their coarse looked like due north and about 6 or 7 seconds into my event the formation made a slight but instantanious course change of about 5 or 6 degrees west. It appeared to be a perfectly angular turn with no perceptible curve. That really blew my mind. I watched and strained to hear a sound as the formation became so dim I could no longer see it. I never heard a sound. It was really dark, visibility was very good, the moon was rising . The whole thing was over in about 15 seconds. I know what I saw, I just dont know what it was I saw.

Shortly after this event, I provided an in person report to a well-known ufo author. On this (Oct. 3, 1996 evening people across the west saw what was reported through many news sources as a meteor. I didn&apos;t believe what I saw to be such an object, although it occurred at the same time as the meteor. Deductive reasoning concludes that I either a) witnessed the meteor event and have somehow interpreted it as something else b) witnessed something that was totally unrelated to the meteor event yet uncannily coincidental in the timing of it c) experts were wrong in that the reported meteor event was something else and that is what I saw. There are probably other explanations but those are the three logical ones I can think of. While car camping at a friend&apos;s property just outside of Crestone, Colorado, I saw four balls of light traveling in a southwest to northeast direction approximately 10-15 degrees above the horizon at about 8:15 pm, I was looking southeast. The balls of light were equally spaced, had no sound, no streaking, no change of speed or direction of travel. To me at first it appeared to be an airplane, but then I realized there was no sound associated with it and for the speed it was traveling and the distance away it appeared to be and altitude, there would have been. After about 30 seconds, these lights disappeared behind the crest of the Sangre de Cristo range which was about five miles from where I was. I listened to radio accounts that evening of people throughout the west who witnessed what was reported as a meteor at roughly the same time. They reported seeing color in the meteor, what I saw was white. Whether these objects were just behind the ridge or outside the earth&apos;s atmosphere I couldn&apos;t say, although I felt as though they were just behind the ridge.", "I noticed two bright stars to the right of the moon.

Now don&apos;t come to the conclusion that we are a group of jug heads and half-retarded socialites, we are actually rather prominent students, 2 of them are music majors home for the weekend. Anywho, we were &quot;yarning&quot;(taking yarn and wrapping it around desired objects.) a bridge above an aqueduct so that if anyone drove by they would run right into it, we did it so it was a wall, not too dangerous but itll scare the hell out of you. So we hide in the orange groves and wait for someone to drive by, low and behold its a cop. So he slams on the brakes and starts searching and what we believe to be calling in other units. We take off backwards in the groves for about an eigth of a mile so we can cross the aqueduct without the cop seeing us, so we can enter a much larger feild of orange groves to get in the clear. The plan is to make a full 2 mile flank to get to our vehicles which we parked purposly away from the scene. So as we are running in this very very large grove, a mild and warm light starts up in the direction we were running in, so we make a turn, scared as hell it was a cop car in the groves or something(by the way this is what we live for, we do it for the rush). We had to turn in the wrong direction because if we hit the road at that time we would be seen. So we then run into a large aqueduct and head down that for a couple minutes, but the light reappeared to the right and up ahead of us. We felt very exposed so we decided to bunker down in the groves on the opposite side of the light. Once in the groves we watched as the light then started to rise in the air, and I thought we were screwed that they called in a helicopter, and being they have the large lights and night vision, we would surely get caught. We didnt hear any propellers though, so we were confused, and thought it might be a guy with a lantern climbing up these really tall windmills and towers that help to keep the tree&apos;s from freezing in the winter, what he was doing at three in the morning in the warmest january we could remember we hadn&apos;t a clue. Then the light started towards us left, and very slowly it seemed, so now we were pretty much crapping our pants. as it got a little closer, maybe half a mile to a quarter mile away it took shaper. We could see that it had a colored tinge to its outside(not the part that held the light) but what color im not very sure, I say it was more of a burnt orange to a redish gray, everyone else has their own color interpretations so who knows. The shape was hard to tell because the light on it was so bright it hid the parts further from it. This thing kept going without regard to us, so when it got to where it seemed it was leaving our presence we booked it to the road faster than I think any of us have ever ran in our lives, made it to our cars, the cop was gone, the yarn was cutt, and we then went to denny&apos;s and talked it over for about an hour.

There is no way any known aircraft could have made that maneuver. About 6 minutes after that we saw 2 more of the same lights traveling East.

Then I noticed a bright shimmering light above the next ridge. I found this to be strange because I look at that ridge on a consistent basis and there has never been anything over there. As I watched it the light began growing slightly larger and pulsating, inbetween pulsations a red light would appear. I got another smoke and continued watching, after a couple minutes it started to rise straight upwards. Then it started to come towards me, all I could do was smoke and watch in astonishment as this thing came straight at me. The craft started to gain shape as it got closer, I could tell it was triangular in shape and it had one extremely bright white light on the front and a pulsating red light underneath. It gained speed as it got closer and passed a regular jet in a couple of seconds. As it passed overhead I could tell it was huge, dwarfing any regular jet in the sky. It passed by without making a sound and within a few more seconds it was gone. The hairs on my neck would not go down and I had to have several more smokes before I could calm down and go to bed.

You could see the flames it was red in color. It had to have been huge and it was moving faster than an airplane but it did not shoot across the sky like a shooting star. It was a bit alarming to see a fireball coming across the sky like that. We watched it for about 5 minutes when it disappeared for about 15 seconds and then reappeared again. This is when we noticed two other fireballs. They were going in a triangle shape going east in the sky. Just about 5 miles from the Sallisaw exit the first one disappeared. The fire seemed to disappear from the front and then from the back and then nothing. The second fireball did the same as the first.

I was 13 years old at the time, and it was about 9:30 at night. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a round illuminated globe through the trees in the direction of south/south east. It was about the size of a full moon and I assumed it was till I realized the moon itself was out also more to the southest.  It was clear, no clouds and average summer night temperture.  As I stood in my back yard, facing in a generally south direction the object came over the trees towards me into view.  It was travelling north west about a lazy 5-10 MPH straight and level course was silent and with no trail.  It was about 200 feet from me. probably about 75-100 above the ground. I will now describe what I saw, even though its 38 years later I have a razor sharp memory of it. The object was a globe, approx 25-30 feet in diamenter. The globe glowed light green. It was not necessary a solid object, although it could be.  It had a haze around it, sort of like looking at a car headlight in fog.  Note however, that the haze only surrounded the object a foot or so, as it was a clear night.  The haze was without question caused by the object. The haze was unusual in that it resembled fog, but was not fog. The were NO other lights on the object of windows or the like. The object was completely silent.  As it continued to approach in my direction and was not to far from being directly overhead, bright flashes began coming out of the bottom of the object. These were not lights or beams of light, but very closely resembled the bright white flashes one sees when you use an electric arc welder.  Almost identical.  So much so, I am sure it was some type of electrical device causing it.  The flashes were so bright it lit up the top of a 30 foot tree under the object.  At no time was there any noise.  At this point I had an intense feeling of fear and ran in the back door to my house.  I did not say anything to my mother, but she must have noticed something was wrong as she said, &quot;you look like you&apos;ve seen a ghost.&quot;  Later I advised her what I saw, and when I gathered the nerve to look outside again, the object was long gone.My guess is that it was one of the following. 1. an alien spacecraft. 2. Some sort of life form, or 3. some still unknown electical phenomenon.  I lean either toward an unknown life form or electrical phenomenon, as I don&apos;t feel there was a crew inside, but I also do not feel it was a natural occuring event, but was under some kind of intelligent control or the object itself had intelligence and I had the feeling it knew I was standing in my yard looking at it! Bottom line, my mind doesn&apos;t know what to make of what my eyes saw, and probably I will never find the answer.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were on Interstate 81 heading North and right as we were getting off at the Paxtonia/Lingelstown Exit I slowed down on the ramp as I saw 4 yellowish circular lights in a long stretched out row very low in the sky directly in front of us. My first thought was &quot;Man that plane is low!&quot; I slowed along the ramp and rolled down the window, my fiance was observing as well.  We did not see any plane body and there was no sound either, and then just like that it fizzled away. Now, I never bought into anything with UFO&apos;s so natually I was trying to come up with a justification and could not.

I had been looking at Orion (it was a very clear night) and noticed that the object was sustantially brighter than other stars.  My wife also noticed it when she came outside.  Then our two friends also started studying it.  We weren&apos;t sure if it was moving, but we all watched it for about a minute or two and realized that it was heading towards us.  From that point of view, it just appeared to be three very bright lights.  I went inside for my binoculars and by the time I got back downstairs, they were yelling that it was over the house.  I went outside and my friend said it seemed to be diamond-shaped.  I focused my binoculars on it and I could make out four bright lights, one at each corner (or possibly several small lights at each corner).  It was definitely diamond-shaped, I could just make out it&apos;s outline, but I couldn&apos;t see any fine details such as texture or any contours on its belly.  As it continued moving, one of  the lights dimmed and then was no longer visible (I assume they were directional lights, maybe), but we could still see the other three.  It continued moving in a NNW direction until it was out of sight. This event happened over a time period of about 10 minutes.  It was never really directly over our house, but I would estimate that it passed over the the small town of Espy, through my &quot;neighborhood&quot; and continued over the I-80/Rt 487 interchange.  I can not say for sure, but it seemed like it was only several hundred feet off the ground at the most.  I could not give a good estimate of its size.  I did not notice it making any sound during this time, but afterwards, my friend said he thought he remembered hearing a humming sound.  If its direction remained constant, I would estimate that it came from near Mainville and continued on towards Millville. The following day, a coworker of mine told me that he and his wife witnessed a bright flash in the sky near Millville that same night at about 9:00 PM (two hours earlier than my experience).

Upon passing ((male)) had an incredible feeling to put as much distance between them and the strange car.The (male&apos;s) disconcerting/freaky feeling  was not communicated to ((female)) until further down the road when both admitted they had had very strange feelings about it.((female&apos;s)) Comments: &quot;Upon approaching and passing the car, all I kept thinking was that something about the three passengers in the car was not right-  the shapes and sizes of their heads did not seem human. It was a disassociating feeling that something was WRONG, but my mind could not process it until well after we passed.&quot;  ((male)):&quot;We were joking about it further down the road and half-way wanted to slow down, and let them pass again, to get a better look, but decided against it, still feeling the effects of initial fear.&quot;  End(poster&apos;s) notes: This happened a while ago.

Davidson at the cross street of Terasita and Los Palmos in Miraloma Park. At around 6:45PM on December 3, 2005, a friend and I were outside on our back deck looking to the crystal clear night sky facing west when we saw two large black triangle shaped objects move slowly and at a low altitude (500-1000 feet) directly over our house from the north west Mt. Davidson area to the south east. Two distinct objects were both perfect equilateral triangles with pulsating dim star like lights on each tip of the two triangles, six lights in total.  These were with out a doubt two solid black large triangle objects which from underneath appeared to be much darker than the night sky as they passed in front other stars in the night sky.  They were also very well cloaked against the background of the night sky and could have easily been mistaken as constellations but they were moving slowly which wass caught my attention immediately. The entire sighting lasted for approximately 30 seconds.  The objects did not appear to change speed, direction or elevation and moved slowly together until they dimmed out of sight near South San Francisco on the north west of the San Bruno mountain range.   I have been an amateur astronomer all my life and I can say with conviction that these were definitely Not planes, satellites, blimps, helicopters, the International Space Station, meteorites or fire balls.  They were two solid triangle shaped objects that move in perfect formation together and made absolutely no noise as they moved over head.  They both also appeared to be significantly larger than a 747 in size. The weather conditions in San Francisco last night were ideal and the dark night sky crystal clear.  The crescent moon had also just dropped below the south western horizon shortly before we witnessed this first in a life time sighting.  We were both shocked by what we say so much so that we called into several local TV stations to report the sighting.  But so far I have not heard anyone else reporting what we saw in the media or on the internet. Myself and the other person with me that observed this sighting have always been rather skeptical about people making such claims but I can now say with absolute conviction that what we both saw with our own two eyes was &apos;other worldly&apos;.

My friend spotted the disk first.  We just stood there saying,&quot;What is that?&quot;.  The disk was flat black in color and seemed to have a darker small circle in the center of the disk.  It appeared to spin in a clockwise or counter clockwise manner but would also wobble slightly.  It made no sound, I&apos;m not sure how high up this craft was, but I would estimate its size to the hole in the center of a compact disk. I saw this same disk years later at this field while watching New Albanys&apos; football team practice there. I&apos;ve often wondered if this was a weather balloon, experimental military aircraft, or aliens.

Then one of those two split again and it formed another object making the total three. I don&apos;t know if it was an actual split or if others came from directly behind the ones already there, but the three separate spheres were there.  They were first in a horizontal line, then overlapped each other. Then the one sphere spit back into three except in a vertical line and both of the others split off at once, not one then the other. The top one in the vertical line then stayed as the other two moved off and formed a triangle shape. It stayed like this for a minute or so and then went back to one sphere. That is when we went inside again. I have no idea how long it was out there after we went inside.

Riverside is surrounded by mountains, and since my home is on the top of the mountain, the road home provided a great view of the ufo.  It was a lime green, egg-shaped object, with a couple of red lights that blinked on and off on top of the object.  It was unbelievable. The object did not move up or dowm, it only moved horizontally.  It slowly moved horizontally.  I got the feeling as if the ufo was overlookling the city, it stopped when it reached a mountain. It then went behind the mountain, where it disappeard. I stopped at a road near my home and saw all of it.  When it first caught my eye, it was close, and once I actually stopped by the road, it had gotten farther away.  I tried taking video and a picture with my cell phone, but the object was too far away to get a good capture.  Riverside is close to an airport, and there were at least 5 airplanes that filled the night sky. However, they all looked like airplanes do at night and they all flew at the same elevation, while the ufo flew about half the elevation a normal plane does, and was right on top of the city.

It was late, between midnight and 1 in the morning. The moon was out and the sky was partly cloudy.  My wife was looking out the window of my truck and noticed the outline of an cigar shaped object and it appeared to have dimmly lit, almost like a fluorescent light on the bottom.  The light was round, maybe 16 to 24 ft.??? My wife was decribing it to me while I was driving and looking for a place to pull off and get out to see for myself.  I then pulled into a gravel drive at an old store.  I left the motor running and got out of my truck. And just like my wife had said, there it was,completely silent, the outline was very clear.  It was perhaps, 400 to 600 yards away. And I noticed it was hovering over some very large power lines. This thing was right on top of them.  When I got out of my truck to look at it and only seconds later this dim, fluorescent type light which was on the bottom of the UFO, turned off.  This scared my wife, She was very upset telling me to hurry and get in the truck.  She was ready to go.  I had a flashlight in my truck and I wanted to flash it on the object, however my wife wouldn&apos;t let me.I got back into my truck and started down the highway, no sooner than I on the road again the light on the UFO came on again. I wish I knew what it was, it looked gray under the moonlight.  It gave off no sound. I think it being over those powerlines had something to do with it being there.

Anyways let me explain to you what we all saw. It was close to midnight and we were out on the porch looking at the clear skies when suddenly, an unusual looking object (heading north) flew right over the lake. The object was a bright orange, almost yellow, and very bright. It was pretty low to the ground (around 300 to 400 feet) and it was moving pretty quickly; over a lake where it takes me a minute or two to get across with my boat, the craft flew over it in a couple of seconds. When it came over the lake it was pretty low, then after it got over the lake, it went up , not straight up, but at an angle, because it was still moving. And it wasnt like an airplane (which goes up in a sort of curve upward) This thing was like it went up quicker than you could snap your fingers and it was in a straight line, like it had a course to follow. We had never seen anything like this in our whole life.

I noticed an orangish light moving in the direction of east relative to the moon. Thinking it was a plane but watching anyway I noticed it seemed to change direction and move back west. Still thinking it may be a plane I wondered why it would circle at that altitude and in that location, as the nearest airport is in Portland and the light appeared to be quite some distance away from Portland. I continued to observe and the object began to move in highly erratic ways, not typical of aircraft and at too high an altitude for a chopper. It would move in one direction then abruptly the opposite direction. It made short &quot;arching&quot; motions, &quot;swung&quot; back and forth, and sometimes made very short zigzagging motions. I was sitting on my porch which lies on the left side of my driveway if you&apos;re facing away from my house. The driveway is flanked on either side by trees. The starting point of my orginal sighting was behind the trees on the left side. At times the bare branches partially obscured my vision of it. It continued to &quot;swing&quot; back and forth in a slow, almost drunken-looking manner and at times appeared to travel in half circles (although because of my perspective they could have been full  circles). At times it would appear to move toward me, appearing to rise in altitude, then it would reverse direction with no apparent turning radius and move away from me. About ten minutes into the sighting I called to ((name deleted)), a housemate and the only other occupant at home at the time, to come take a look, asking him if he saw what I saw or if I was imagining things. After observing for a couple minutes he confirmed the object did appear to be moving. I was able to call out the directions I thought it was moving in (right, now left, right again, up, left now) and he confirmed that he was seeing the same movements. The object continued to move in a general direction of east in relation to the moon until it was fully clear of the trees and instead of being on the far left of the driveway it was on the right. Most notable about the movements were that although it was hardly ever still, they seemed to have a &quot;directionless&quot; quality to them. At times it would zigzag in quick motions, sometimes appear to &quot;swing&quot; or &quot;sway&quot;, and it reversed directions seemingly at random. I stayed outside as long as I could. My housemate and I had moved from the porch to the driveway to get a better look, and stayed in the driveway for what might have been 15 minutes. Then we returned to the porch and David went back inside. I was absolutely frozen at this point, the temperature was about 20 degrees. I wanted to go back inside but was afraid to miss something. Back at my original position, the position I was in when the sighting began, it was notable that not only was the object not obscured by trees anymore, it had crossed the imaginary median of the driveway and was at a higher point than when it started. Finally I absolutely could not stay outside any longer. I rushed inside and turned off the lights, hoping it would be visible from the two large windows at the front of the house. I felt pretty stupid for having sat outside for so long when I discovered it was indeed clearly visible from inside the windows. I made ((name deleted)) turn off the TV so there was no reflection on the glass to obscure vision and we watched it continue to behave in much the same erratic and meandering manner. About five minutes into observing it from inside I noticed another light, this one brighter and whitish, in relatively the same spot the first had started in. It was acting much the same way, possessing the same &quot;zigzagging&quot;, &quot;swinging&quot;, half circle-making traits. The first orangish light sort of seemed to calm down with the appearance of the second light, still moving but not as obviously. It seemed to settle in a basic area, northeast of the moon. At this point my mother came home and we all observed the movement. About 4 minutes after that a very bright whitish-blue &quot;star&quot; that had been there the whole time began to show signs of movement. We all watched as the lights eventually settled into basic areas, still moving but not meandering around anymore. They held their basic postions (the first, orangish light appearing not to move at all anymore, the second only making occasional tiny movements and the third primarily seeming to &quot;ascend&quot; and &quot;descend&quot;, but also making the characteristic half-circles and zigzags) and their positions formed an isoceles triangle tipped on its side with the &quot;point&quot;, the brightest and most recent light, pointing southeast. The first, orangish light was holding position on the northernmost tip and the second whitish one was southwest of the orange one. At one time a plane bisected the triangle horizontally and the objects did not appear to respond. A while later I stopped observing them. I was tired and my neck hurt from looking up. I know they were present at a little past ten still. I don&apos;t know when they disappeared but by 10:30 they were gone. Another thing to note...it was dark and cloudless but when the objects moved, especially when they moved dramtically, a cloudy or smoky haze could be seen in front of them and the light would be a little obscured. It seemed like the smoke mimicked the movements made by the light, i.e. if they moved in an upwards backward-facing &quot;C&quot; motion, the &quot;smoke&quot; would also form a backward-facing &quot;C&quot;.", "Dark object with three lights on the bottom arranged in a triangleI was driving north on I-5 at the Snohomish/Skagit county border, and right at the border line this thing flew across the freeway.  It seemed to be going very slowly, but extremely fast at the same time. I don&apos;t know what the shape of the aircraft is, as it was pitch black out (Washington State=cloudy), but there were three somewhat dim lights on the bottom that shone straight down that were arranged in a triangle. I nearly got in a wreck while I was watching-whatever it was, I have never seen one before-and I did not see any flashing lights on the sides (if there were sides, I am not sure), so I am almost sure it was not an airplane. It flew from East to West, and it appeared to be headed for the refineries at Anacortes, which is in a Westerly direction from Mount Vernon.  However, there is an air force base on Whidbey Island, which is also West of Mt. Vernon, so perhaps this was some experimental stealth aircraft.  However, if it was, I would recommend that they turn their lights off next time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

To me left, towards the east, I could see a very brightly lit object that was located beneath a star.  It didn&apos;t seem to move much and may have changed length slightly and gradually as I watched it (as if it were turning?).  It consisted of several, mayby 5, VERY BRIGHT yellowish lights that appeared to be circular in shape and in a perfect line, very close together.  I thought that this could be how the windows of an airplane might look if it were rather close (it seemed rather large) and if it had only a limited number of passenger windows.  It was just starting to get dark though, the sky was well lit and overcast and the stars were just starting to show as I recall.  The lights SEEMED to be FAR too bright for aircraft windows especially considering that it wasn&apos;t really dark yet. The sky was a sort of grey color. The extreme brightness of the lights indicated to me that they might have been actual exterior lights (not windows) but they didn&apos;t strobe at all, were yellowish, were too large in number and I don&apos;t think that they occur in a straight line, one right after the other on aircraft. No strobing navigation lights were seen. I continued to drive towards and then into this small town and looked at it very frequently to try to identify it. when I entered the town and turned a corner, my view was blocked by trees for about 15 seconds or so. When the view was again clear,the object was not at all visible. It was large and seemingly near and very brightly illuminated just seconds before. I saw the star that I assumed was the right one but looked around and could not see this object.

We are both 18 years old, and I am also a Member of my High Schools NJROTC and an avid aviation buff. We were walking home and were traveling North Northwest. I noticed 5 extreamely bright metallic objects in a steep bank to their port sides all in a column with equal spacing between each craft. They then vanished into the clouds, when they reappeard about 2-3 sec later they were in a steep vertical climb. They then leveled out and performed in tandem a bank to their starboard side, once again disappearing into the clouds it was very overcast the sky was so dark it almost looked and bluish gray this also made the crafts more visible. The crafts reappeared 2-3sec later again but this time considerably lower in altitude and were abreast of each other equally spaced and were in a port bank, after leveling out they broke off into a group of two and three with the two intrail and about 1 mile behind the other three. the crafts re-entered the clouds and when they reappeared they were lined up vertically one on top of the other equally spaced and hovered in this for about 15-20 sec. The higher craft then dropped down vertically ( No Gradual Descent ) and spaced out equally next to what would have been the &quot;base&quot; craft for the vertical formation and were now all horizontal. the craft regrouped into the &quot;two&quot; and &quot;three&quot; formation heading northwest they &quot;three&quot; formation was intrail this time with the &quot;two&quot; leading they were abreast of each other one from the outer right side slid up under the starboard side of the outer most craft of the &quot;two&quot; formation. the two craft in the rear now climbed slightly above the leading &quot;three&quot; but kept their vertical and Horizontal separation the craft were all spaced at equal distance. I observed no &quot;nav &quot;, beacon , or strobe lights on these Aircraft, nor was there any sound accompanying them. The shape of the crafts&apos; could be compared to that of a stingray except the nose and leading edges were smoothly arched and melded into one with pointed tips going to the rear of the craft along the leading edges of the &quot;wings&quot;. and from the rear of the craft protrouded a long narrow tail which was thick starting and the base of the craft and thinned out the further back it went making a smooth narrow tip at the end, the undersides of the fuselage were a dark gray almost black color. The flight patterns exhibited by these craft are like none I have witnessed. I only get Commerical and General Aviation traffic over my area and the crafts flight pattern does not resemble that of hulking airliners and small private aircraft.

PD))Train CollisionAt exactly 2:47 a.m. on Jan. 14 02, while working a coal train enroute from Russell Kentucky to Shelbiana Kentucky, our trailing unit and first two cars were severely damaged as we struck an unknown floating or hovering object.  I know it was 2:47 because my watch froze, and to this day shows that time.   Along with my watch the entire electrical systems on both locomotives went haywire. Approaching a bend near milepost cmg 42 in an area referred to as the wild kingdom, for the many different types of animals spotted there, my conductor and I saw lights coming from around the way. This ordinarily means another train is coming and will pass on the other track.  The outlay of the area is this, the river, #1 track, #2 track and a straight up mountainside, carved out for the laying of these tracks.  I killed our lights as not to blind the oncoming crew. As we rounded the corner our onboard computer began to flash in and out, speed recorder went nuts, and both locomotives died.  Alarm bells began to ring and thats when we saw the objects.  Apparently scanning the river for something, the objects, (at least 3) had several &quot;search&quot; lights trained there, the first object hovered about 10 to 12 feet above the track. Metallic silver in color with multiple colored lights near the bottom and in the middle, no windows or openings of any kind that we could see.  Approximately 18 to 20 feet in length and probably ten feet high.  With both engines dead as we rounded the corner we made little noise and the first object did not respond in time, I estimate that we hit the object at 30 mph with 16,000 trailing tons behind us.  It clipped the top of our lead unit then skipped back slicing a chunk out of our trailing unit and first two coal cars.  The other objects vanished into thin air. Our emergency brakes had initiated due to the loss of power and we stopped approximately a mile and a half to two miles after impact.  Our power restored after we were stopped and we notified our dispatcher, located in Jacksonville Fla. of what had happened. We were told to inspect the cars to see if they&apos;d hold the rail and try to limp into milepost cmg 60 which used to be the Paintsville yard which is no longer in full operation.  We checked everything out and the cab of the rear locomotive was demolished and smoking, the second two cars looked as if they had been hit with a giant hammer but looked like they&apos;d hold the rail. We pulled into Paintsville yard at approximately 5:15 am. The huge overhead lights lining the yard were noticeably dark and the only lights came from what we assumed were railroad officials vehicles parked near the end of the track.  We pulled to a stop and began unloading our grips off the wounded train. We could hear what sounded like an army of workers immediately tending to our train.  Vehicle doors slamming, guys running by in weird outfits and lights glaring from all directions, the one thing missing was railroad officials.  A guy named Ferguson shook my hand and asked me to follow him into the old yard office.  We did, once inside they, and by they I mean I have no idea who these people were, began to ask us hundreds of questions, they then told us for our own protection we&apos;d be medically tested before we could leave.  I asked repeatedly to talk to my road foreman or trainmaster and not only were these requests denied but they confiscated my conductors cellular phone. Hours later we were led outside the old yard office and the strange things continued to happen, the 2 locomotives and two cars were removed from the rest of the train we had brought in and my only guess was parked 4 tracks over under a huge tent like structure buzzing with activity.  We were lead off property and told due to national security our silence on this matter would be appreciated.  We were then put in a Railroad vehicle and taken to Martin Kentucky were we went throgh questioning again with railroad officials and were then drug tested.  After all of this we were sent on to Shelbiana, where we took rest for 8 hours and worked another train back to Russell.  Working back we passed by Paintsville, no sign of the engines, cars, tent, people,  nothing.((COMMENT/ADDENDUM FROM VISITOR TO NUFORC SITE, MAY 16, 2006))For what it&apos;s worth, as a railfan I can say the terminology/slang the witness is using is accurate and how he describes the train&apos;s reaction seems likely.  Since he says his dispatcher is in Jacksonville, FL, I can tell it happened on CSX.  You might want to ask him about that and if he remembers the unit numbers or model.  Locomotives last between 15-20 years unless they are totally demolished in a wreck.  That means the units involved are most likely still in service and can, perhaps, be examined.Another FWIW would be the Portland, OR, railcams that operate 24/7 with some sky in the views.  I doubt that they archive their feed but you never know.((END ADDENDUM))JUST A COMMENT  AND  OPINION.   I THINK THE UFO-TRAIN COLLISION OF JAN 2002 IS A HOAX.   I WORKED FOR CSX AT ((deleted)) KY.

I came to a spot where there was clear view of the large mountains in the area and something caught my attention. There was a group of dim lights in the formation of a line at about a 45-75 degree angle. At first I thought it might have been lights from chair lift poles set up on a mountain ski resort. But after some more glances (mind I was driving 65 on the highway) I saw that the lights were far to high to be on a mountain. It was difficult to see the mountains as they were dimly outlined by the sky as the sun was well below the horizon and the sky was turning darker shades of blue. I am positive it was not on a mountain because the lights were far too high. After driving out of viewing range of the mountains and the view disapeared behind roadside pines I was unable to see the lights any longer. I waited impatiently to see if the lights would still be there once I closed some distant on the highway but I didnt see them again. As I approached the plattsburgh area I did notice what seemed to me to be an unusual amount of airplanes out that night as dozens crisscrossed the sky at altitudes so high they only appeared as white dots with their blinking wing lights. As far as describing the UFOs, they seemed to be nothing but dim white lights around in a fairly straight line at 45-75 degrees or so approximately. As far as how many lights there were I would have to say anywhere between as little as 25 to as many as 50. I wasnt able to count because I only saw them briefly and had to focus on the road.

We both looked over real quick to our left (we were watching to our right), and sure enough, we saw something interesting.  A streak, moving particularly slowly from west to east.  As we watched it, it grew brighter, to the point where we could make out the sparks at the edges.

The movement of the &quot;veil&quot; was very smooth, flowing, and somewhat ripple-like.  I did not hear any sound, although it was close enough that if it had made any type of noise within human range, I would have heard it clearly.  It also did not seem to be illuminated; the sky was light enough to see it moderately well (there are many streetlights and the moon was out as well). It was difficult to determine how high up it was - I was simply so shocked to see it and also was trying to determine just what I was seeing that I can&apos;t even guess.  It &quot;flew&quot; over the roof of the middle school that is approximately 20 yards from my backyard (north of my backyard; the yard faces east). As the &quot;veil&quot; moved across the sky toward the school, my dog started barking and ran to the north side of the fence with ears and tail up, but she was looking toward the school rather than up at the object.  The neighbor dogs also started barking at that time.  I then went back into the house, out the front door &amp; looked down the street (runs north, past the school) but saw nothing at that time.  Decided I needed to tell someone, so called my sister.  While chatting, about 10 mins later, a &quot;cop&quot; car drives slowly down the street in front of the house.  I use italics because by the time I got the front door opened &amp; turned the porch light out so I could see, the car had reached the end of the block (also an intersection for a street that runs east/west.  The school sits at that intersection, as well), and I could only see that the shape and size resembled a police car.  It did have lights across the top, but they were white.  Interestingly, another similar car was waiting at the intersection.  After a short pause, they both continued on the north-running street, shining spotlights on the outside of the school.  They continued north on the street.  I went back into the house (still on the phone, telling my sister the events as they transpired), then again to the backyard.  After another 10 minutes or so, an airplane flew over the school, fairly low and slow.  It did not fly north, but rather toward the east and then south.

We looked at the big silver one and saw about 20-30 little ones circling it.  Making &quot;formations&quot; and moving into each other and toward the big silver one and more came out.  Some were stationary.  They moved slowly and then moved fast.  They would &quot;drift&quot; In any direction. We knew it was not ballons.

Helicopters showed up about 10 minutes later, they were black and it looked like they were &quot;chasing&quot; it but they backed off and flew away from the silver one.

How the sighting happened: I went out on my back patio at 12:02 AM PST to have a smoke and noticed a very bright light in the night sky. Originally I kind-of assumed it was a star but after watching this object for a couple of minutes I realized that stars do not change color from an extremely bright white/halogen blue to a brilliant red and seemingly every color in between... this thing was amazing and SO BRIGHT!! I ran inside and grabbed a monocular that I have and ran back outside to &apos;get a closer view&apos;... what I saw when I looked through the monocular was a little blurry at first (the monocular doesn&apos;t have the best range) but after stabalizing my arm and focusing on the object, the lights seemed to be shaped like a triangle (many small lights making up a triangle shape) and the object was kind-of pulsing. I was in dis belief!! This couldn&apos;t really be happening!! I always watch the sky and until this night... I have never seen anything that I couldn&apos;t associate with some type of known object (star, plane or helicopter). After I was able to see some shape to the lights, I attempted to contact a friend who lives about 2 miles from me (I felt it was very important to have another witness - especially from a different angle then my view)... but he did not answer... I watched this object for 1 hour and 21 minutes until it eventually moved behind a building and was no longer visible to me. During the last 8 minutes of the sighting, the object literally completely disappeared from visibility for about 2 seconds at a time on four occasions!! I would describe it as either rotating and therefore the lit side of the triangle was not visible or the lights on this object simply dimmed out completely... but the object was never completely dark for more then about two seconds. I verbally said &quot;OH MY GOD&quot; when the object first disappeared from sight completely and then re-appeared two seconds later... it was absolutely unbelievable!  I took 5 images with my Nikon Coolpix 3.2 Mega Pixel digital camera but only one of the photos came out somewhat decent (attached to this report). I REALLY want to know if any other people saw this object and what thier description is... my monocular isn&apos;t the best so hopefully the triangle shape I saw was not a trick of lighting or caused by the distance.

The things that struck me as odd besides seeing this in relative daylight, was the trajectory of the object and the fact that there was no contrail remnant.  Instead of an arching trajectory from horizon to horizon, this object was coming down at a very high &apos;angle of attack&apos; and did not fade as it approached my observable horizon which was approx. 1/2 mile away.  I was only aware of one other person (also in the parking lot) that observed this object.", "Long cylinder shaped UFO sighted along I-70 near Columbus Ohio.This sighting occured on the east side of Columbus while driving at approx. 3:15pm on Nov 29 2005. I was driving in an area where I had driven on numerous occasions. I was driving on the outerbelt around Columbus (I-270) traveling north. I was comming up to the overpass crossing over I-70 which runs east and west through Columbus. Being the outerbelt is generally speaking circular my perspective of the object was in continual change while I was moving. I looked east along I-70 and noticed a stationary object approx. 1/4 mile from the overpass. It was sitting just above the tree line slightly to the north of I-70. I at first thought that I was looking at a very large waving banner that was attached to something. I had never seen this in that location before. It was very promonent. I quickly realized that I was looking at a solid object that had a rippling appearance moving along its surface, moving from west to east and going around it. The object was sitting parallel to I-70 maybe 50 feet above the trees. It had the appareance of being a long pipe parallel to the ground, being somewhat longer than a tractor trailer rig and maybe 5 feet tall. I slowed down to look at it but couldn&apos;t pull over and stop on the overpass because I had traffic comming up on my rear. This is the point where the situation gets really interesting because just beyond the the I-70 overpass is an underpass for a road that parallels I-70 just to its north and as I approach this underpass I notice a dark blue and/or black helicopter with no markings circling the overpass. I assume that the chopper can see the object but looking straight east now I can no longer see it. From this perspective I would now be looking at it&apos;s west end. I at this point look into my rear view mirror and see a dark blue sedan of matching color right behind me. It appeared to be a current model unmarked Chevy Impala that had a beacon on top.(the beacon wasn&apos;t on and may have been some type of detection equipment for all I know) The beacon and it&apos;s lenses and the windows of the car matched the color of the car so it&apos;s interior could&apos;t be seen. As I passed under the road crossing over I-270 the sedan pulled over and stopped under the underpass that the helicopter was circling. I must comment about the synchronistic aspects of this happening. This was my third non disk shaped close UFO encounter but the only one I have reported.(the other two encounters were actually closer as I was right under them) I have had four other encounters with the black helicopters but had nothing to do with UFO&apos;s. I appeared to be the focus of their attention. At the time of this happening I was scheduled to go to the UFO conference three days later in Virginia beach at the A.R.E.", "A large silent Orange firey orb that seemed to have streams of light falling from it and shooting out from it .Object was seen below cloud level traveling northeast. Pretty clear night with very light cloud cover. At first it looked like a fireball and we thought a plane was on fire. We watched it as it continued without any sound rather slowly with streamers or lights emitting from the fireball. The orb glowed bright orange and it looked as if the streamers were falling to the earth. Our whole family watched it until it left our vision. Sometimes it seemed to jerk around quickly. We live on a hill so we saw it for a long time then it seemed to go into the clouds.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I walked out on to our porch (which is on the second story of the house) and I looked acrossed the street (which is on a right angle from our house)when I realized the sound was coming from that direction to see if the coyotees were that way. Out of the corner of my left eye I caught something in the sky that looked bright. It was &quot;falling&quot; in a straight line from left to right yet at a downward angle, it appeared to be in the sky over the Beaverton or Hillsboro Area. It was just above the line of a tree in our yard, and over the lights of the town. My first reaction was that it looked like a HUGE shooting star but then my brain connected that it was not white but a very bright Aqua (blue green) color.. not a regular blue.... and it was pretty big.... much larger than any falling star I&apos;ve ever seen. Sort of a firey looking bright aqua colored light. I yelled for my family because the door was still open and I really didn&apos;t know what I was seeing. It lasted long enough for me to think they would actually be able to get to where I was at and see it, but at the last moments ...as it seemed to get to it lowest point it suddenly swooped back up in a circle (rounding over itself and coming back around), then in a kind of figure eight and then basically made a bunch of very eratic moves...in a really much faster and crazier pattern. honestly the closest description I can give is that it looked like a ballon losing its air... a kind of crazy dance right at the end... and then it just disappeared. Before it did the circles though it was going very straight and fast at an angle towards the ground. It was very clear .... no clouds skewing my view..... and I saw it distinctly. I don&apos;t know what it was, so I won&apos;t even speculate, but I can say I For SURE saw what I saw and know it wasn&apos;t any kind of plane or ballon or regular aircraft I&apos;ve ever witnessed before.

Then an airplane was higher in the sky and I knew this was much, much larger than a regular plane.  So I ran in to get my binoculars, I looked through them and it was just a glistening huge ball of light.  So I thought I will wake my husband so he could see.

Within minutes it slowly drifted across in a straight line.  I waited, and after some minutes it slowly started moving towards my home, the closer it got the faster the speed was.  I watched it go over my head, still very brilliant.  I heard a faint sound of a muffled engine.  The center of the object had a small red light, the rest of the lights were brilliant white (with that sparkly glow).  I could not make out the shape very clearly because by this time the speed had increased.

One end of the object appeared a bit larger than the other.  I watched the object from a stationary position inside the car, after pulling briefly into a center turn lane. The sky was perfectly clear, ground winds were from the North, and gusting (perhaps 20-25 mph).

After watching them for a while, we saw that the stars behind the &quot;triangle&quot; disappeared as the lights moved. The three bright lights seemed very close to us, and we kept remarking at how strange they looked. They moved as a unit with each of the three lights equally distant from the other two.  At first they seemed to be moving with traffic, but after some time had gone by, they began to pull ahead of us. Gradually, they moved far enough ahead of us that the pattern was smaller than the rearview mirror, and they appeared to be at less than five degrees above the horizon. Before they (it) pulled completely away from us, I recall seeing a military jet being refueled in the sky and the lights seemed to be nearer to the ground than the two planes engaged in the refueling. We had no scale to measure it, but it seemed to be twenty times the size of the larger plane. Finally, it disappeared in the sky over the East bound highway.

My first sighting happened about 3 months ago, when me and my friend were driving down burlington street at 7:45, there was clouds covering the lower part of the lake, but it was a bright sky above the clouds, now all these sightings have happen while i was driving, so we only caught glimplses of them. all of a sudden we saw something shot through the clouds and into the sky, leaving behind a straight line in the clouds. we thought it was really weird.. the second sighting happen at the same time 7:45 while were driving on burlington street again, it was a clear sky, and we saw just a little swiggle in the sky, and it was not moving just sitting there, and i have seen video of the exact same sighting before, it was very weird. But todays sighting topped everything, as we were again driving down burlington street, looking at the view of the lake.. i thought i saw a bird glidding into the wind, but then i relized, it wasnt moving, me and my buddy started to take a closer look, it was a craft!! hovering over the lake, in a disk shaped form!! just sitting there watching all the cars going by on the highway. i know what i saw and it was for sure a disk. I know that there is alot of sighting over lake ontario, know i know why. Ive witnessed 3 of them. If you have any questions please get back to me.", "Strange object over Rome, Italy with glowing orange-red light underneath.Strange object hovered overhead for about 1-3 minutes without making a sound. The craft had a glowing orange-red light underneath.", "it was scaryme an my frind were having a sleep over we were just about to go to bed until we seen this big very strong light shining though our window it just shone it light through our window for a while an the my bed room lights kept flashing on and off. we ran out side and it was gone.", "dark brite red lite seen over whittier ca.I had just arrived home from work and one of my room mates follwed as I went into my apartmet.I went ahead and put my things away from work when I remembered that I had a present for the boy next door, so I grabbed it and I went to the apartment next door and I nocked at her door when I glanced out of the corner of my left eye a dark brite light pircing through the partly clouded north west sky ,I went ahead and gave my neibor the present when I looked again and said to her what the hell is that and my son just came home from work too and I showed it to him and then my other room mate came out and saw it too.  At this point all four of us saw it,I then went down stairs to get another prerson when my son said that it began to spark and started to fall down wards, then it bagan to blink as it moved away towards the north until it. moved away from site.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere.  We do not know what he witnessed, but we believe that some kind of pyrotechnic device would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the object was a genuine UFO.  PD))", "Fireball and  missing timeIt was a warm august night at around 6/7pm  Myself my brother and a friend were standing outside of cunningham school we were talking as we sat on the bike rack suddenly our friend yells out LOOK! we couldn&apos;t believe our eyes a gigantic orange fire ball shot across the sky  from east to west you could see the flames licking off of it leaving a smoke trail, it looked so close to us you could say it was likes a medicine ball flying across the sky on fire. we ran to the other side of the building which was only about 60 feet long but it was gone we ran to our friend house behind the school and talked his mom into chasing after it we drove down landis ave heading west for about 15 minutes but could not find it again suddenly it started raining pouring down tourents of rain for about a half hour,we headed back to our friends house my brother and headed home mom was really ticked off we asked why she said we were late for our curfew we looked at each other and tried to tell her we were only gone from the house for about an hour we looked at the clock it was 10:30 pm we looked at each other we were sent to bed we talked all night about how we lost an hour and a half we went back to our friends house the next day and asked our friend what time did this happen last night he said  around 7/7:30pm when we asked our friends mom she told us  we came in at around 9:30pm we all looked at each other. I&apos;m 45 years old now I was talking to another old friend about that night and he told me that he and my older brother (5 years older than me) saw the same thing on the same night back in 1968.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Four of us saw a ball of light come out of the sky, circle a plane then shoot off out of sight.It was the summer of 1953-4-5.  We were 12-14 years old. One of my buddies&apos; sister was watching tv in their 2nd floor apartment and three of us decided to scare her by climbing up on the porch from the ground below.  The porch looked out over the Potomac river skyline where planes approached National Airport on their landing route.  It was about 8pm.  Two of us had gotten up on the porch and were lifting the last guy up when one of us saw this ball of light coming out of the southwest sky towards a plane coming in for a landing,  along the river, from the west.  We dropped our buddy into the bushes below in our awe of the event but hauled him up right away and sister came running out asking what was going on.  We all watched in amazement as this ball of light went around this moving plane (maybe 100 to 150 mph landing speed) in a huge circle, then shot off in the same direction it had come from and disappeared in a split second.  The whole incident took about 2-3 minutes.  We were so excited we began yelling to people around the community and calling friends and relatives on the phone.  I don&apos;t remember what reaction we got from those folks but we looked in the papers (Washington Post, Daily News, Wash. Star) the next day and found one small article, buried in the A section, about the sighting that claimed it was a meteor out of its orbit.  Well there were 4 of us who knew what we saw and none of us ever heard of a meteor coming out of the sky, making a circle, then shooting back out again.  I&apos;ve probably told this story 5 or 6 times in the past 53 years, when someone&apos;s brought up the subject, but have never reported it or written about it before now.  I&apos;m sure there were others that evening that saw this happening including the pilot, crew and passengers on that plane. I did lie out at night with friends in the late fifties to watch the sky and saw interesting light formations (not airplanes) flying around as well as Sputnik orbiting the earth.    That&apos;s my experience with UFO&apos;s.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Two flashes of light in the sky.I went outside saw a flash of light that looked like it could have been lighting but it was only in a section of the sky that was pretty small.  Then a second flash.  I waited to see if there was anymore but after about 3 mins went back inside.  I have never seen anything like this before and with the clouds couldn&apos;t see a craft of anything so it may not be a UFO but when I searched &quot;flash of light&quot; and &quot;covington&quot; this site was one of the first to pop up on google.  I sure would like to know what it was.  I have not seen a UFO since I was a kid.   I didn&apos;t hear any thunder either so that with the small area of the sky it occuipied leave me to believe it is something other than lightning.", "Large triangle, silent, 50 to 100&apos; altitude. 20 Minutes.  Later 3 small triangular crafts, 8-10&apos;wide, 10-12&apos; alt. 45 sec.I was with a group of astronomers doing some star viewing through some privately owned telescopes.  Someone yelled and said look at that.  A huge, foot ball field sized, triangular shaped craft blacked out the stars.  It was silent, moving very slow (about 7 MPH) and only 50 feet or so over head.  There were lights at each point of the triangle.  We watched for about 20 minutes at which point it made a strange right angle manuveur and speed off.  Two military jets were chasing it. About a week later I saw 3 triangular crafts manuvering through the mountains.  They were very small.  About 8 to 10 feet wide.  They were fast, silent, and very very low to the ground.  Not more than 10 feet above ground.  They were gone within about 30 to 45 seconds.  I have never heard of the little ones.  Have you????((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates indirectly that the date of the sighting in 2002 is approximate.  We have asked him to attempt to determine the date more accurately.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Dear Mr. Davenport,Sorry to inform you but I am not a &apos;mister&apos; (Mr.).  You guys sure took a long time to get back to me.  UFO activity must be getting really busy. Well, lets see ............. This was about 4 years ago and I was never good with dates anyway, but I will do my best.  The astronomy club met on Wednesday evenings.  So in regards to the large craft, I can say for certain it was on a Wednesday night.  It was during the summer months and there was no moon.  You don&apos;t get good star watching when there is a full moon as it gives off too much light for star viewing.  So if you go back to the summer months of 2002 and look for dates on Wednesdays when the moon was not up between about 8:30 or 9 PM, that would give you a couple of dates to go from. I don&apos;t have the tools to research that.  No one logged this that I know of but there was at least 12 or 13 people there that night.  These were all scientists.  (They usually don&apos;t believe in anything).  In fact, the president of the astronomy club, (Sirius Lookers), was only annoyed that this thing blocked out the stars and interrupted his lecture and he had to wait for it to pass.  Strange but true!  In fact, that was even stranger than the UFO.Regarding the small triangular crafts, well, that was also in the summer months of the same year.  It was just around sundown.  These small crafts were pretty strange in the way they maneuvered around the red rocks of Sedona, AZ.  It reminded me of Luke Skywalker on the craft he drove through the woods in &apos;Star Wars&apos;.The crafts were black, made no sound and I saw no lights on them, but then it wasn&apos;t quite dark yet, if that makes any difference.  I don&apos;t have any idea as to how aliens think when it comes to putting their lights on.  They drove these crafts only a few feet off the ground.  I was alone when I saw the small ones.  I did not log them.I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t be more precise.  However, I did get another photograph of a UFO over Hoover Dam in 1991.  I dated that one, wrote down the time and even the type of film I used, shutter speed and the whole banana.   If you&apos;re interested in seeing it we can make arrangements for that.Through out my life, I have seen quite a number of UFO&apos;s.  I guess they just like hanging out with me. ????   Close encounters of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or whatever.  Name your number and I can probably come up with one.  I don&apos;t mean to sound flippant but that&apos;s just the way it is. Sincerely,((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM))", "Black triangle that morning, sat hovering for unknown period of time, and left southbound.  Estimated Rt.64-Rt.171.As I look to the west that early morning before work, from my bathroom I saw a black triangle pointed southwards.  It sat there and hovered for 5 minutes as I looked at it, it started to move away.  Extremely strange. Just sitting there...

It was sometime in November or December of 2005 in the afternoon around 4:30 pm. I was using the internet inside the house when I heard my two dogs outside errupt in a frensy of barking that seemed particularly alarming.  I tried to ignore it for a while, but it only got worse and I was alarmed too.I went outside to see what on earth was going on and I found my grandmother sitting in the garden.  She told me excitedly that she had been yelling for me for a while to come and see a strange craft in the sky though I had not heard her.  She had been watching it approach the house from the direction of Ventura Blvd towards Adolfo Rd., hovering, then flying in a path paralel to Lewis Rd.The dogs were disturbed, barking like crazy looking upward at the sky over our backyard fence.  I looked up and saw a light grey to silverish, reflective, solid disk hovering silently past the house rather slowly and indecisively and then picking up speed.  Amazingly, it had the solid metalic bulk of a normal aircraft but with a saucer-disk shape and  could slowly hover and &quot;float&quot; silently and weightlessly like a baloon and then pick up speed and follow a straight path.  It had a reflective, very shiny exterior.  I could see it very clearly and was amazed.  It was like no aircraft I have ever known to exist in fact.  It looked like your &quot;typical 1950&apos;s&quot; flying saucer.My grandmother said that she had been watching it approach for some minutes and that it had been very low over the house and had ascended a bit by the time I saw it.  It was oddly silent and left no trail.  I was surprised that my dogs were so disturbed by it since they don&apos;t react at all when noisy helicopters and planes fly over the house often and at times quite low since there is an airport and a military base nearby.  They seemed to be able to distinguish the unique and alarming nature of the craft as well as we two humans could.I want to stress that we had a perfect view of the UFO as it was directly over the house and we both clearly saw it.  As I watched it, it finally picked up speed, ascended and disapeared and reapeared in the atmosphere until about a block away it vanished.In the past, when I have seen footage of UFO&apos;s, I have believed that they were pathetic ploys for attention and the result of special camera effects.  I now know that this is not always the case.  What I saw confirmed the t.v. footage I have so long been skeptical of, expcept, in person the sighting is clearer and more dimensional and tangible and &quot;truthful&quot; than a camcorder can convey.  Sometimes the t.v. footage looks blured.  What we witnessed was a solid clear craft.  The truth of its shape was tangible though extraordinary.  I wondered in amazement that a flying saucer could silently and boldly skoot though the skies of a quiet suberban neighborhood in such a clandestine way.  I had to see it to believe it.My friends say they have seen strange glowing UFO&apos;s in the dark early morning skies before work that are &quot;star-like&quot; but absolutely not stars.  They note that there are many sightings around military bases and think that these are secret government projects kept from the public.  It makes me wonder.", "I saw an unmanned craft, 3&apos; long fly 12&apos; over my head slower than a man walks, then accelerate away at a great speed.It was 8-12&apos; above my head, moving about 3 miles an hour.  It looked like something you would see on the hood of a 1923 packard!  It looked like a JET, but the wings came STRAIGHT OUT and STRAIGHT BACK.  The wing tip&apos;s did not extend beyond the end of the craft, but fell short.  Further, There were NO rear flaps, and the entire craft was no more than 3&apos; long.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The object would steadily and slowly move over the ocean and over Cape Spear. The light would be bright and it would fade away. Whenever it would come back it would first be a little white light ,it would slowly move across where i was looking and then it would turn into a bright orangey light. This was over a period o an hour and a half and it may still have been there after i left. This is really hard for me to explain to you and totally new ground for me. I definately think that you should look into this.", "large birds?  flying at a very high altitude in a circle- couldn&apos;t have been birds, they glowed in the dark and traded light- it looked like a swarm of bees but moving much slower and each &quot;bird&quot; would randomly glow or reflect light-  was it a meteor shower?  though the sparkling mass floated across the sky slowly heading north((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

There was a triange craft very large with double white lights at each corner (on the bottom) of the craft.  I could see the plates on the bottom of the craft.  There was no sound.  I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes.  For some reason I didn&apos;t tell my husband.  I didn&apos;t really believe what I saw.  I gave me the sense of something quite large. I decided that it had to be a stealth bomber but looking at pictures of them, they don&apos;t have the right shape.  I won&apos;t claim it was extraterrestial but I haven&apos;t seen anything like it.  Have you heard of anything like this?  There was absolutely no sound.", "orange spheroid seen flying over elizabeth NJ floating north to south &amp; vanishing after approx 12 minutesa bright orange orb seen overhead at approx. 150-250 meters off the ground.  At first I though it was toy ballon that initially appeared over a tree but instead of rising upwards it kept a steady straight line flight from north to south as I watched it crosss over the local YMCA in Elizabeth New Jersey. It was not a balloon but a deep orange colored orb that was moving slowly until it dissappeared out of sight. This sighting is the second time I have seen this orb in almost the same setting in elizabeth, as I saw it last year.  My theory is that it may be a weather instrument launched out of Newark Airport which is close by and I am contacting the FAA offices at Newark Liberty International to see if this might not be the case.  Yesterday the Sunday the 3rd was a day of heavy chemtrail spraying over Union County which I have documented on film.  Unfortunately I did not take any photos of the orb since I was too engrossed in watching the object move slowly across the sky as I was documenting the cloud anomalies from the chemtrails. The orb passed out of view and then I could no longer see it as it seemed to just vanish in its journey south. The other time I saw this orange orb-like object last year the same thing occurred as it was there and then seemed to vanish out of sight, although it was floating much higher in the sky then.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that &quot;chemtrails&quot; are, in fact, just normal contrails behind high-altitude aircraft.

Im able to approximate its size because off to the left was a comercial jet.Anyway this craft hung there for about (4) seconds,then with one movement it went straight up fast. Im talking really fast.The weard thing is it went point first like an arrow,but it was horizontal to the ground.

There were no lights. nitially,  I thought it was a remote control device but quickly realized it was way too large, then considered whether it was a military test vehicle of some sort and finally, that it may be a UFO.

When I turned onto my road (I was driving south on the road) my eyes scanned the sky to see if I could see any other shooting stars when I saw a pretty bright orangish-yellow light in the Western sky and I thought it was an unusually bright star. Once I got home and got out of my car (only 1/2 mile down from where I first saw the object) I could not see it anymore in the sky. There was a clear view from that point as my home is on a hill and there were no trees or clouds in the way. I thought this was strange. When I turned to the Eastern sky I could see what looked like the blinking lights of a plane going from North to South, but what was strange was the object flying about 2 thumbs widths underneath the plane. It was a large object, about twice the size of the plane, but glowed a dull orange color and kept up with the plane. I watched it until both of them disapeared trying to figure out what the orange thing was. I still have no idea. After this I went inside where I saw my husband and told him what I saw. He just shrugged it off. I then went into my kitchen which has windows facing both North and West. Looking out one of the windows facing the west I saw another dull orange object low in the horizon, similar to what I saw following under the plane. However this one was stationary and very low and looked a bit bigger. Below it were the 2 yard lights that I see through the trees everynight that a neighbor on the other hill has on. This orange light was about twice the size of one of the white yard lights and a bit higher than them and was above the tree line back there. The orange light started to change after a bit and would change into a red color, and when it did this it would get smaller almost like it was going further in the distance (further west) and then it would grow again and become the dull orange color. It did this a few times over a 5 minute period, during which time my husband did come to the window to look at it, and finally went to a red that just faded to nothing. Neither my husband or I have any idea what this could have been. My husband went to the bedroom to get ready for bed and I sat there waiting to see if the light would come back when I saw a small flash out of the corner of my eye a bit to the north (but still in the western sky) of where I was looking and there was a yellow light/star again in about the same spot the very first one I had saw when I was driving home would have been if it had still been there. This light started moving to the east and I had to move to the other window in my kitchen that faces north to keep track of it. When the object was almost due north of us it changed from a dull orange-yellow to a rapid flickering that red/blue/white could be seen in. Due to the red and blue I was wondering if maybe this was just a plane, but soon this flickering light grew in size and became even more rapid and chaotic and the flight path became erratic bouncing up, down or short bursts forward at times. Then once it reached the northeast sky it changed back to a smaller glowing dull yellow-orange and came to a stop. At this point another small flash in the north western sky caught the attention out of the corner of my eye - seemed to be the exact place the other objects came from. It also immediately took the same path as the previous one when another flash again caught the corner of my eye and I could see yet another dull yellow light moving to the east. The flashes I never saw straight on - they were out of the corner of my eye. By this time my husband was back to watch and he also witnessed the two new yellow objects going across the northern sky from the west to east. Neither of these became erratic like the first one, but they both stopped in near the previous one in the northeast sky. One then continued on to the Southeast changing to a dull red and I lost sight of it out of the window. I moved to another room to watch it but I found it just in time to see it fade away. The other two didn&apos;t move and just sat there looking like two stars - And I would have believed they were if I hadn&apos;t seen them moving to that point earlier. I watched them for about 10 minutes before finally going to bed around 6:40 AM. 2nd in January: Driving home from work, again about 5:30 am Eastern an orange object caught my attention in the North sky.  It was lower and closer than the the objects in November and below the tree line.  It was more a cylinder shape with a sharper outline.  It glowed a dull orange.  I slowed to watch it but it didn&apos;t move so I continued on home - which wasn&apos;t far away.  When I got home I looked for it and it was there, now above the tree line and brighter, but not as distinct in shape as before - it looked rounder, so I&apos;m not even sure if it was the same thing, though it was in the same area.  My husband also saw this one as I called him to come look at it.  The thing sat there in the sky for a few minutes and then started to bounce up and down in an erratic motion.  I kept asking &quot;what the heck can move like that?&quot; as it was even more erratic than the things I saw in November.  After about 3-5 minutes it settled down and stilled.  Then it slowly moved to the west before dimming out.  It left a smaller and duller red light that blinked twice before completely dissapearing. What the heck could these things be??  We do live in a high-air traffic area, but planes are pretty easy to identify.  There have also been other times where we had slow moving orange lights, but nothing compared to these two incidents.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I called my girlfriend to see it.They were adjacent to the two stars an the big dippers handle and slightly smaller distance apart. they moved in one direction parallel to the handle quite slowly (about the same speed as one might see in a high moving plane). They were too high to have been a plane as well as not hering any noise associated with them. I work with helicopters quite frequently so am sure it was not a sighting of this nature.  As they move in the same direction the first slight began to fade as if it was drwing upward and the second followed shortly after. It was a totally clear night and know that it was not a couple of planes or other objects that i could explain.", "The object had no blinking lights and went in 3 different directions, but those turns were faster than what an airplane could achieveI was with my girlfriend in my car, looking at the stars and she noticed this light that wasn&apos;t blinking moving North.  We were west of the object.  She then noticed it moving back in the direction that it came from, but without making any turns like an airplane.  Then, she saw it move East and it went back in it&apos;s original direction which is North.  I saw it moving North after it did it&apos;s turns and it was moving very fast, faster than what an airliner or private plane would be able to go.  There were also no other planes in the vicinity.", "i saw it at about 11:30 P.M. and it was a couple miles away from my house.It was an orange light that was fairly bright. It slowly moved across the sky that dropped  orange sparks that were the same color as the object. the sparks then dissapeared about 1/4 in the sky. There was a plane quite a way away from it and there was a helicopter flying torwards it but way below it. once the helicopter came just a little  bit close it vanished and never appeared again that night.It was about 60 degrees from were i was standing and the object had no flashing lights it was a constant light but the dissapeared right as it started moving torward my house((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I had just passed through Mathis, T.X in San Patricio county and was about to enter Live Oak county along the interstate when I looked off to the left and not too far off in the horizon there was two HUGE metalic disc sitting side by side in mid air, slanted in formation at least half a mile away.I immediately pulled off the road and put my emergency lights on. I sat there and watched as the bottom object slowly moved down and left and it elongated into a long pillar of fire orange or almost like a thin cylinder. It turned into the sky and disappeared in a very odd fashion.  Almost like it had turned on a cloaking device. The top object stayed as a classic disc shape but also turned fire orange. About this time I noticed a diposable camera sitting in my console so I unloaded.  As I snapped photos I looked around and other cars were looking at me as they passed but no one seemed to be paying any attention. The last disc did the same as the first and just disappeared.  By the time I had arrived in San Antonio there was alot of military ariel activity going on. Like a hornets nest being disturbed they were flying around the out skirts of the city.  Also in Austin I saw alot of jets flying around the outskirts.  Mind you these were not commercial airliners. I had the photos developed and out of the twelve photos I snapped one shows a strange illumonous obbject sitting in the sky.  Because of the quality of the film it is left for someones own interpretation for it can not sum up the actual event.  I have this photo but it needs some one to give it an enhancement on the object pictured, some one to clear it up better with a program of some sorts.  It&apos;s a photo thats worth it! These were what I would call mother craft because of the size.  Note that event took place as the sun was setting on the begining of lent and when the sun was down the moon was already in its place large and only the bottom of it was visible.  It was almost like an eclipse. This month of March 2006 yields alot of cosmic activity with an equinox and solar and lunar eclipses through out it.

At first I saw three fighters and one craft of unknown shape that was lit up all over, yellowish lights hard to tell what shape.  One of the fighters was within a couple three hundred feet of it and the other two were approximatly 2 miles behind in hot pursuit. The large object peeled off and was out of sight in a matter of seconds, however the fighters did not follow but they did kick on their afterburners until I couldn&apos;t see them anymore, even w/ bino&apos;s. Called my girlfriend outside to see this and apparently while I was looking at her telling her what I saw, she saw something move very quickly across the sky 1 sec +-, this definatly freaked her out. As I continued to watch the jets and afterburners, I caught comething by pure chance moving at a high rate of speed, thought it was a dim star but it was moving extremely fast coming from the direction the jets were heading, At this point the base came alive and more jets were put into the air.

Thought it might be aeroplanes, but then I found it very strange that so many are travelling on the same path, from east to west from where I am standing, one after the other. Is it possible that commercial aeroplanes would fly in horizontal lines, all in the same path, one after the other and then disappear and a next one reappear in the same manner?", "Orange Lights And  A Very Large Triangle WatchedI watched three orange lights in the sky making very erratic maneuvers three different times during the over a period of 1 and 1/2 hours.  I thought I was watching fighter aircraft doing horseplay dogfighting.  The objects moved much faster than commercial aircraft.  I guess speed at 3 or 4 times faster than commercial aircraft.  The approx height in the sky of the three objects I guess at 10 thousand feet.  They looked like small fireballs.  They would show up for maybe five to ten minutes, then disappear on the horizon.  But would return again in 20 minutes or so.  I saw them three different times, almost like they were doing laps.  I was hooked to watching the sky but was not prepared for what I saw next. At approx 10:30pm, I hadn&apos;t seen any fireballs for approx 30 mins.  I instead watched 15-20 aircraft moving through the area just amazed at how slow they moved compared to the fireballs.  I saw a small prop aircraft of some kind flying north parallel to Hwy 65.  It was about 5 thousand feet up. I saw a very large triangle following this plane very closely and right above this plane.  I saw the large triangle then bank and head east.  This bottom surface area of the triangle was about 100 times bigger than the small prop aircraft.  I saw three glowing lights on the bottom and at the points of the triangle.  The three lights on the points glowed dim and blueish in color.  The approx height of the triangle I guess equal to a three story house.  The large triangle seemed to be cloaked in a very thin cloud on a very clear night. I&apos;m not sure what I saw.  I saw something.  Not sure if it was military or alien UFO.  I&apos;ve read the stories about huge triangles on this sight.

Today started out normal, I had just returned home from carpooling with babies in tow and sat in the car a little longer than usual listening to this cool song on the radio.  The sky was clear, the weather nice, with no breeze. After about a minute I decided to get out and open the house door to enter my house. Just I approched the lock with key in hand, I hear an extremely loud roaring/churning/oscillating sound, I think &quot; What the...&quot; as the sound is directly on the side of my house and getting so loud that I can feel it shake the ground.  I run to the side of the house and for about 5 seconds (that&apos;s about how long it took for me to turn tail and head back to the car so that me and my babies could hotfoot it away!) the sky just on the side of my house and above my neighbor&apos;s yard was a weird cold greenish blue tint. Like looking thru a funky pair of sunglasses. Anyway, at the car door curiosity takes hold so I am standing on the stepbar of my car and I watch, mouth agape as this orb approx. the size of my car tire, leisurely travels down the powerlines. It is the same color as the sky was glowing seconds earlier but now the color is contained just around the orb itself.  And I recall thinking it is going to set the trees on fire as it rolled and periodically sparked. Just as I decided to grab my camara phone (cause no one was going to belive this!!!) It reached the end of the wires, turned a funny bright white yellow color, sparked a few more times then just winked out.  By this time two of my other neighbors were outside and we were all looking up at the lines. So I called my mom who is only about 2 blocks away and asked if she had experienced anything odd, and she confirmed that she heard the the loud roaring and her lights flickered off and on several times but she never came to the door.  After that phone call, I decided to drive the block to see the damage that this fireball had caused. ( still asumming that logically it must have been a blown transformer or something) yet after inspection, it was noted that 1)no damage whatsoever was done to the powerlines in question, you could still see the mold growing on them, 2) there was no buring ozoney smell in the air, that you would normally get from these types of fires ( I have seen powerlines burn before and they smell bad) 3) and the weirdest thing of all is that I do not remember hearing a loud boom like a powerline blowing, the sound just appeared and then got louder!  I will never forget this day!", "Recalled childhood experienceIn the summer of 1998 my family and I were visiting an aunt in Texas. We were on our way to San Antonio and pulled over on the side of the road to check one of the tires. I caught a strong cinnamon smell that brought back dormant memories of an experience I had back in El Salvador in 1969.  I was eight years old and El Salvador was at war with Honduras which was a neighboring country.  There was a nightly curfew and my older brother (10) and I used to sneak out of the house and go across the street to an open field to watch the lightning from the bombs in the far distance.  My brother went back to the house for a minute.  I felt something grab my ankles and lift me up to the sky.  As I looked up, I saw what looked like a huge bubble with a bright blue light inside.  I still remembered as the blood rushed to my head.  It felt like a long time that I was hanging upside down.  Next I found myself inside this bubble sitting in a chair and looking down.  I felt someone&apos;s hands on my shoulders but could not see anyone.  Someone sort of holding me down.  I also heard what sounded like dolphins chirping.  The bubble moved around the neighborhood for a while.  I could see my brother was outside again with my grandfather looking for me. They called for me and I could hear them.  They could not hear me.  I must have been about a hundred feet above them.  Finally the bubble came down near the same field and I &quot;fell out&quot; on my stomach.  My brother and grandfather heard me crying and eventually found me.  I have never told them this.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was a little freaked out and got up and reached my hand to her to help her but she was dazed from the light. The light sooned went infront of me and i became dizzy and fell on the ground as if paralyzed. I then saw a unfamiliar alienotic face in the light. I soon passed out and woke up in the middle of the night at the same place we were at, my girlfriend by my side. I woke her up and we panicked and i drove her home, when we got to her house her mother was freaking out becuase we were missing for 3 days.

The first time I saw this formtion was in mid-December.  I live in Lower Swatara Twp. and a vertical line of four lights appeared in the northern sky, probably somewhere in the area of Colonial Park/Linglestown.  They had an orangish color to them, were visible for only about 5 seconds, and then faded out.  They did not reappear.  My wife, who was with me, did not see them. About 1 week ago, on or about 02/15/06, I again saw this (or a similar) occurrence in the same area of the sky.  This time, however, the display lasted for about 15 minutes.  The lights were the same orangish color, and each formation that I saw would go out after about 5-10 seconds.  A few minutes later, the lights would reappear.  They would be in the exact same area of the sky, but would take on a different &quot;formation&quot;.  It seemed that one light would turn into two, then three, then four before finally fading out.  This went on for about fifteen minutes.  My wife did see these lights. Fort Indiantown Gap is is the same general area that I have seen these lights, and they do remind me of some kind of flare.

We both saw the object at the same time, directly overhead.  It appeared about the size of the moon when it is overhead.  The sky was very clear with a few light clouds to the northwest of us but none overhead.  They were the kind of clouds that you see at about 5000-6000 feet altitude.  The object was featureless and appeared one-dimensional.  Its color was grayish.  The effect was almost like the blue sky had a hole in it with an absence of color.  The object was moving quickly and silently from directly overhead (when we first saw it) to the northwest.  As it moved away from us it appeared smaller and smaller, like it would if it was getting further away.   It traveled underneath one cloud and as it did, the trailing edge turned bright glowing red.  It then traveled above the next cloud and disappeared from our view.  When last seen it looked to be only 20 percent of it&apos;s original size, which I thought was because it was rapidly climbing and getting further away.  Taking into consideration that it was at about 5500 feet in altitude when we last saw it, it was probably at about 1000-1500 feet in altitude when we first saw it.  I can&apos;t estimate how fast it was traveling, but it was a lot faster than the jetliners which regularly fly over from the nearby international airport.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It made absolutely no noise what so ever when it flew overhead. The lights on the craft were a very dim white lights and there appeared to be 4 lights. The craft was moving at a very high rate of speed, and all we could see was the dim lights. A shape of the craft could not be made out even though there is a little moon light over the area.

My vague familiarity with the night sky told me that the stars were not supposed to be there. So I took interest in them and watched them. As I watched them they grew brighter by the second and appeared as bright as the Venus - the one towards the north was slightly brighter than the other one to the south. They were static and I judged them to be at an altitude of where I normally see the shooting stars. And as I was watching them perplexed, they began to fade and in moments totally faded away leaving me totally bewildered - all in a matter of may be 30 to 40 seconds. I watched intently for several minutes at the spot where they disappeared in the hope they might reappear. But they did not. At about 7.25 p.m, a satellite passed over the exact spot where the two bright objects were - from south-east towards north-west.I felt terribly excited for a few minutes after that.

It was very bright and I thought it was a little strange so I walked out to a clearing to get a better look with no trees in the way.When I was able to get an unobstructed view, in the distance, maybe 2-3 miles just above the tree line, I saw the extremely bright orange light, not moving. Then it quickly faded out.Then, just as it faded out, a little to the left another bright orange light lit up, then another, then again until there was four lights in a row. One by one they would light up until all four were lit. Then they would quickly fade as the first one did. The first lone light would come on again, then fade.

One block south of my house there is a brightly lit car lot and birds and bats can be illuminated up to about 100 feet above the lot.  I first I thought it was an illuminated bird as it moved across the sky but as it moved very quickly (approximately 10 times the speed of a jet airliner at cruising altitude)from a south-south west, to west position it became obvious that it was it was not being illuminated from the ground because it never waivered in brightness and appeared to be at a high altitude.  The light was not brilliant more of solid off white illumination.

I&apos;ve lived in downtown dayton for nearly 2 years now and I know the difference between a airplane a possible ufo. The hospital did not have any helicopters in the area that I know of.

I heard a low roaring sound like a jet and instinctly looked up toward the east for the plane, while I listened to my granddaughter ramble.  I saw a metallic flash through the tree branches and thought &quot;there&apos;s the plane&quot;.  But then, I saw several other metallic flashes and I stepped out into the open looking up.  There was a configuration of 10-12 metallic-type balls.  At first I thought they were balloons, but that didn&apos;t make sense.  Then I thought they must be birds which also made no sense.  The sky was clear blue but was surrounded by heavy clouds to the east over the Santa Cruz mountains.  I watched as they seem to &quot;float&quot; across the sky and I kept trying to figure out what they were.  There were no fins, appendages or moving parts.  They were perfectly spherical and silver.  Then I realized they were flying in a formation of several groups of three to four in each group.  The center group consisted of three.  They seemed perfectly spaced.  Suddenly, the left sphere in the lead group instantly &quot;dipped&quot; towards the lead sphere and then darted back into its previous location.  I watched them move from northeast to southwest heading towards the Monterey Bay.  I called the newspaper to find out if anyone else had reported seeing spheres in the sky flying in formation. They told me no.  I live approximately four blocks from West Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz City.  The weather had cleared, the sun had been shining for a couple of hours and so I know there had to be lots of people jogging, surfing and walking their dogs.  I can&apos;t believe I am the only one who witnessed this phenomena.  I talked to my husband, who has a Ph.d in quantum physics and chemistry.  He suggested balloons..maybe someone let a bunch of balloons go at the same time---but as I told him  &quot;  Since when do balloons fly in formation?&quot;  I used to work on the original F/A-18 program at Patuxent Naval Air Station.  I know a little something about aircraft.  These were no aircraft and were definitely metal or metallic.  They were so bright with the sun shining on them.  The only other observation I found weird was the silence.  The air was still, there were no birds singing, everything was just quiet.", "Weird fireball that just diappeared without fanfare and followed up by 4 fighters.Say it streak east to west.

I noticed I was deeper into the woods than I realized, I think I lost a little time.  I became very scaed and ran directly towards the streetlights.

Then one of my customers says, &quot;whatcha lookin at.&quot; I told her, &quot;those two things in the sky.&quot; She goes, &quot;Well there&apos;s three.&quot; There was another one where the two first came together. So I am freaked a little because things don&apos;t really move at right angles but figure it is pretty far away so could have made an actual turn and me not notice. An hour later I go back outside for another cigarette and there is another one. This time it is lower and bigger and now obviously spherical.It hovered there for a while and moved a bit. I thought maybe they were all balloons until a plane flew underneath it and it was still that big!  Then I had a revelation when I saw it go into the clouds. I could find out how big it was before I would decide if it was something odd.I noted the size and found out the cloud ceiling today was at 25000 feet.My wife is a math whiz so she did some geometry and figured out that it would have to be 242 ft in diameter.", "multiple occurrence of bright points of light separating into 3&apos;ssaw orang amber points of light tonight.  started as one and appeared to separate into 3  saw this happen 5 times tonight over 20 minute period with one other witness seeing one occurrence.  appeared directly west of my south central kokomo location and reoccurred slowing moving north.  one time two sets of 3 lights occurred simultaneously.  no sound no other aircraft near or evident.  lasted 4-5 seconds each occurrence.  nite sky was predominantly clear but first occurrence there was a cloud cover with high ceiling .. lites were on this side of cloud ceiling but  i cannot tell how high or how far away. these things are veryu strange", "Green triangle over Belle GladeBelle Glade, Florida March 13, 06  I was traveling with my girlfriend driving north on route 27 en route to Orlando. It was about 2:00am.  I was several miles south of Belle Glade approaching its small suburb of South Harbor.  It was a clear dark night and the stars were out. Lake Okeechobee was on my left to the east just beyond a retaining dam or dyke and a swamp was just to the east of me on me on my right.  There was what I think was a sugar cane processing plant aglow in a cluster of lights on a hammock about a mile away in the marsh. Suddenly a bright green object traversed my windshield from right to left on a downward path at a slight angle.  It was a glowing iridescent green triangle open in the middle with a smaller triangular cutout.  It looked like one of those fancy new odd shaped Frisbees that kids toss around in the back yard.  Its relative size on the windshield was each leg of the triangle was four or five inches in length.   The object began to fall in a graceful falling leaf fashion, flipping and flopping in several different directions as it descended. Then it faded away and disappeared from view.  My girlfriend was looking out the side window of my truck, the window being open, and saw what appeared to be the same object doing the same maneuver.  I was apparently seeing the reflection of the object on the interior of my windshield while she was actually viewing it. What was astonishing is the reflection itself was very vivid like an image on a liquid crystal T.V. set.  The color, the shape, and the movement of this object sets it apart from anything I have ever seen before.  So far media or law enforcement sources have not corroborated this sighting.This was the third UFO I have seen in my lifetime (I am 65) but the first one I have ever reported.  I have decided to include the details of the other sightings although I cannot remember the exact dates of these sightings. Varadero Beach, Cuba, winter of 1954  I was just thirteen years old and had just jumped off the bus with my Cuban friend, nicknamed Pupi.  It was midnight and we were returning from the movies.  It was a clear cloudless night and the stars were out and shining bright in the night sky.  We were walking along a road that paralleled the beach.  Suddenly in an instant it became as bright as day and I could see a woods a half a mile away.  Trees, houses and every visible object stood out in stark relief as if they were caught like a snapshot by the flash of a giant camera.  Then an object appeared going in the opposite direction of our travel.  It was a round luminous white disk.  It could have been a saucer shaped disk flying on its edge or I could have been viewing a round object.  Other than the flames there appeared to be no other details such as structures or lights. From the trailing edge or rear of the disc sprouted a dozen or so blue flamelets like the flames on a gas stove turned down to a low setting.  I estimated the object to be about fifteen hundred to two thousand feet in altitude and about a half mile away.  Its relative size at that distance was about the size of a melon.  I have often wondered how an object responsible for producing so much light could be easily viewed, not appearing as an intense overwhelming blinding light with no discernable shape because of the glare. What was amazing was that this object appeared in a night sky with a starry background while the whole landscape was bathed in light.  Apparently this same object was seen over and over again and reported to the media. It was once described as a glowing disc that cart wheeled through the air.  This disk did not appear to spin or cartwheel but appeared to be flying in a steady fashion with a leading edge and a trailing edge that spouted flames. Rockford, Illinois, early Nineties  I was just about to enter a bicycle shop on the south side of Rockford.  It was midday with a clear blue sky and a few clouds.  Before I got to the door of the shop I stretched and as I did this I looked up and saw something I couldn&rsquo;t identify. It appeared to be a light silver oval or disc shaped object.  I was seeing it not from the side but possibly balancing on edge like an egg carefully placed upon its end in some kind of magicians trick.  It hung motionless several hundred above me at about an eighty degree angle from where it was soaring above some telephone wires. It was actually hard to determine its altitude and size.  Its relative size from my vantage point was that it was the size of a (egg shaped) manhole cover.  I thought it might be a balloon but balloons tend to rise and to my recollection high altitude weather balloons are sent aloft under inflated to compensate for the reduced pressure of the atmosphere there. This thing was fully &ldquo;puffed up&rdquo; so to speak and it was not moving at all and not rising. I decided to go into the bike shop and get some witnesses to help me possibly identify or verify what I had seen or verify that I had seen it at all.  But just as I entered the shop I became embarrassed, feeling like some kind of irrational lunatic. So I quickly went outside to see if it was still there.  It was gone.  It was not some distant dot high in the sky or any where on the horizon of my view.  It had totally vanished.", "Another object, this time, red and triangle shaped.I just reported a sighting about 20 minutes ago of a red round object.  After I reported this, I went back outside with my husband.  At9:45 p.m., there was a small plane that had passed in the eastern sky, going south to north.  About 10 seconds after this small plane passed, we saw a red triangle shaped craft in the southern sky, going east to west.  It made no noise, the sky was clear, and the object wobbled back and forth.  If measuerd in car speed, it was going approximately 50 miles per hour.  There were no other planes in sight.", "Stoof outside my apt and looking straight ahead saw light that I thought was search lights.  On closer observation, I noticed the objects had a beam projection from the ground but were moving in an unsual pattern.  They were bluish and translucent (kind of pretty).  an aircraft approached and they disappeared until the craft passed. They reappeared without the beam and kept moving together or criss-crossing each other.  I they were there for probably another 5 to 7 mins. and then they very swiftly vanished into the night sky.

Missile Combat Crew received alarms of possible tampering of launch facility and contacted security specialist topside to investigate.  Two man alarm response team was dispatched and drove several miles to the launch facility.  Written procedures for the security team to follow for all alarms was to stop within a quarter mile and conduct visual recon.  Before arriving within a quarter of a mile the team reported a fiery orange red object over the launch facility.  Following their checklist the team leader drove up the access road while the member followed on foot behind the vehicle for cover.  They observed a classic gray alien standing with a rod in one hand outside the fenceline.  Following their training the member immediately challenged the being with his M-16 rifle and the being pointed the rod at him emitting some type of discharge knocking him out.  After this the being and object departed the area.  Upon examination of the nuclear warhead by Air Force technicians it was discovered that the missile had been altered so it was not operational.  This account was published almost word for word in the National Inquirer but drew little attention.

Our farm is located in Hampton County, near a small town called Furman, about 40 miles north of Savannah, Georgia, and 90 miles west of Charleston, SC.  This event took place in May of 1969 on a Thursday night, beginning around 9:00 PM (I remmber the day because we had a service every Thursday night called Training Union; it was a Southern Baptist church).  My entire family witnessed the event, including my father, born 1924, and a veteran of 31 combat missions in WWII as a tail gunner on a B-24 Liberator bomber, my mother (a nurse), myself, born in 1969, and my two older sisters born 1960 and 1962.We were planting crops (I think either soybeans or corn) in a 25 acres field that was maybe 600 yards from our main house, seperated by a strip of woods.  My father was on the tractor (an old Farmall), and my mother and the rest of us kept the tractor filled with seed for the planting process.  I first noticed a very bright star which, because the area is so rural, and the fact that we often worked at night, we were familiar with the night sky.  I brought this observation to my mothers attention who paid me little attention.  As the light approaced (across the highway over the woods in a westerly direction) my mother finally looked up to see what I was talking about.  The object looked now to have approached closer, just above the woods.  My mom ordered us kids into the truck (a white 1963 international).  My dad, we later learned from him, had stopped the tractor at the opposite end of the field, and by his own admission was afraid to come back toward us.  He was, i&apos;s estimate 400 or 500 yards distant at that point.  I remember that my mother started crying and the rest of us did also when the truck wouldn&apos;t start.  Of course, when your six years old and you see your mon panic, you panic.  I do not remember viewing the object after getting in the pickup truck.  But I remember daddy returning on the tractor, saying he didn&apos;t know what it was.As for the characteristics of the object:  oblong in shape, somewhat luminous, made absolutely no soound; appeared as a small star that got larger.  Do not remember a  color.THis incident was often discussed in our family, and a few years before my fathers death, three of the five witnesses drew independent sketches of what we could remember.  The oblong shape matched, although we were in disagreement about a protrusion on top or the bottom of the object.This incident has never been reported to any offical agency until the writing of this letter.((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the witness, and he will attempt to have his older sister submit a report, as well.  He sounds like a very responsible witness to us, and we suspect that he is quite credible.  The witness indicates that the event occurred in May 1969, but he is not certain of the day of that month.

I went outside to urinate at 2:30 in the morning.Directly at about 40 deg.in the eastern night sky was a very bright object somewhat round. It was stunningly noticeable as it was shaking somewhat violently kind of reminded of the way a &quot;bumble bee&quot; moves in flight.  At first I took it to be a regular type of aircraft.  I thought I might have to help the occupants of a aircrash because I thought this aircraft was in trouble.  that was until it came to a complete halt.  At that point I knew this thing was special.  In this area it is extremely quiet especially at night, There was absolutely no sound to this vehicle.  At times it seemed to move from this halted position.  I could not detect how it got from A to B but I could tell it was not staying put.  Its luminescent quality would jump in magnatude for a very brief period. I could tell this light could light up the sky if it wanted to.  You could sense it tremendous power.  The lighted object did not &quot;bumble&quot; after the initial sighting.Later two other object much more faint but with exactly the same luminescence came close to the original object and banked at 45 deg angle at a ridiculously fast rate of speed (like lightning)sped off and dissapered.  When the objects got close to eachother they seemed to exchange energy sort of like static electricity in a way.  The main object seemed to climb but very slowly.  It stayed in position in the same portion of the sky but more like 70 deg.  It was still there very bright but seemed higher and farther away.

I just looked over the Gulf like I have countless times in my 21 years of growing up here. About 1/4 mile of the beach were there reddish-orange lights about 300 ft above the water. I roled my window down to get a better look and asked my brother (who is in the coast guard)if those were signal flares. He replied yes and told my dad to pull over, luckily there was I large stretch of open beach were we spotted them. We rolled down the windows and we slowly realized something wasnt right. the lights were stationary and in perfect alignment as well as space from each other. My brother replied &quot;those arent flares and a curious silence came about us as wew tried to figure out what we were looking at.There were 5 lights, they kept blinking in random patterns(one side to the other or 1 would turn off and on while another did the same in reponse. the night was perfect for visibility the moon was full and to the south shining down onto the Gulf waters. There wasnt a cloud in the sky so I still dont understand why I along with my familydid notseetructure, it was just these lights. had there been a structure I would think we could have made an outline of it becuase there was moonlight behind it but we saw no obvious shape. The lights went on for only about 30 seconds and they dissapeared for about 5 seconds then all of a sudden on the horizon the southeast we saw the same lights only 2 this time turned on and off one time and we didnt see them again. Months later my roomate and I were traveling down the same road as we did every day because we lived in a house on the beach about 2 miles from my first sighting. it was about the same time at night and I saw one the lights agian!

I told all my friends about what I had seen before and they didnt really care because you cant emphasize how amazing it was to see what I had seen. i pointed in my roomates face and said  &quot;Y told you&quot; and he was spaechless like I was the first time. We watched this light for only about 15 seconds and the light either jetted south at a rate of speed which no U.S. aircraft could match or the object literally went down into the water. I still dont know what it did to this day. We then went to our house and stood on the porch and looking over the Gulf and we saw an event of lights whish I cant put into words. I dont know how far they were from us but they were definately more than 2 miles out. i saw countless bright red lights popping up all over the sky close to the water not up in the stars.We also saw the orange white lights again but not in the numbers like the red ones. We watched for over 30 minutes and we heard and saw military planes coming from the east (from Eglin air base9 as well as from the west(from Tyndall air base) they proceeded out into the Gulf. at one point I saw a string of lights go off at once which really resembled counter measures that are released fome fighter planes to evade missles. I should mentionthat none these lightsdidnotdo eratic manuvers but the red lights appereared  stationary when they &quot;poped up&quot; in lage numbers (between 20 and 50). we went back inside beacuse it was so cold and to this day Feb.15, 2006 I have yet to the the mystrious lights which I will NEVER forget. Oh yes and the lights never had a sound or a trail to them. Everytime I look out to the Gulf at night i still hope to spot these lights again. Please E-MAIL me if you have any questions about what I ve just told you. I would be gratful for any explanations for what I saw.", "Unknown object with flashing lights and laser beam behind the Hou ARTCC building/very fast movingI was an air traffic controller at the time.  Often we&apos;d see objects on our radar and on a few occasions NORAD would scramble on them. (That&apos;s another topic).  The incident that I&apos;m reporting occurred after the end of my shift. Three of us were hanging around in the parking lot talking.  One controller made a comment that Venus was bright that night.  We then started visibly scanning the sky.  We noticed a brighter light to the North of the ARTCC building and wondered if the other light in the sky was indeed  Venus, then what could that be. (The back door of the center faces east and leads to the back parking lot). The object was standing still and was just visible above the far tree line. Someone made a comment that it was probably a street light.  An airliner became visible climbing out of IAH but farther North of the light we were looking at.  The light then dimmed.  As the plane got farther away on its climb out, the light came back to the full density as we had seen before.  That got our attention.  We were wondering out loud what it could be.  At that moment,  the object moved from our left to our right at an extremely fast speed and stopped immediatley. almost a blur.  As fast as you can turn your head from 10 oclock to 2 oclock was the speed it seemed to move. (if east was 12 on the clock, then the object moved from 10 to 2).  We could not judge how far away from us it was.  The object then just stood still for a minute or two.  Very bright red, blue and green lights starting flashing around the object.  A thin laser like beam of light, approximatley 6 to 12 inches in diameter, lit up part of the parking lot and starting scanning the parking lot.  All three of us ducked behind a car without saying a word.  The beam shut off and the flashing lights stopped.  The   white light on the object then came back on and the object began moving very slowly back to our ten oclock position and stopped at the exact location it was when we first noticied it.  We didn&apos;t say a word for about a minute.  When it sunk in what we had just seen, all three of us jumped in our cars and left for home.  The next day, we considered reporting this to a national hotline number in Washington D.C., that the FAA had provided us to report strange occurences that we observe on our radar screens (UFO&apos;s)  but no one ever  did for fear of losing our airman&apos;s certificate.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It got closer and closer and was moving very fast.  As it got closer i ran back to the house in fear.  As i looked out my widnow the object seemed only 100 feet away.  It then stopped adn just hovered near my home.  After staying there for about 30 minutes it zoomed back into the air with a loud bang noise as it sped off.  I went back to try to find the object and it was gone.  This was not the first time I have seen UFOs in my area.  However, usually they are really high up and brealy able to see.

It sat there hovering for about a minute (possibly more because i was literally freaking out when i seen it) then in less than one second it darted straight infront of us and hovered on the horison for about 30 seconds, darted to the right and hovered for around 5 seconds then shot straight ahead again and disapeared. Once it disapeared my friend said &quot;thats going to be covered up&quot; and i was in a massive panic, my friend tried to calm me down and we continued to walk home shortly afterwards.

What I saw next was awesome.  As I looked east,were what appeared to be 2 UFOs, one was quite large the other about 1/2 size or so. They were moving very slowly, spinning slowly toward the north.  There was NO sound. I dropped the hose and ran inside the house yelling for mom &amp; dad to come out quickly.  My older brother(20yrs) also ran outside.  Much to everyone amazement, the UFOs were still there.  What I can best describe the sight is the shape was like a spinning top only compressed top to bottom with lighted windows around the center horizontally, and blinking lights on top&amp; bottom.  Like I said &quot;NO NOISE&quot;  The size was larger than 3-two story houses and they were about 300-500 feet up in the sky.  I could see vehicles driving eastbound on the 134 freeway &amp; the UFOs passing over the top of them.  I have always wondered why no one else reported it.  WHAT DID WE SEE????

At that time I was in the military the US AirForce  we were dispatched to Egypt pryor to the start up of desert strom to build a fuling base in the desert along with a large MASH unit.  While at the site we would start working at dawn and many times would not finish up to well after dark.  The first 30 days we were in country we were house at a large hotel complex in Cairo Egypt.   Not sure of the date but one evening after we had finished work we all were waiting on the tarmac for our buses to takes us back to Cairo it was about 72 Degs and a very clear night.  Their was aprox 70 of use including our commander.Shortly after we all gathered to wait for the buses one of the guys pointed to the south east and said what is that well we turned around and looked up.  I have never seen anything this until at that moment.  There were aprox 100 objects pale orange in color that were at a very high altitude in two V formations one next to the other looked like a W in the sky. These objects moved very slowly from the south east to the northwest.  As they approached our location you could drop a pin and hear it hit the sand not a single person was making a sound.  Once they got over head at a high altitude they changed course in unison to the north.   We watched them for about 30 to 35 minuets. I looked over and saw our commander looking up at the objects and asked him what he thought they were.  He said I have no idea.  To this day I have not been able to determine what the objects were.  I did go to base ops the next day to see if their may have been a large military flyover.  NO traffic was in the air that night  The Egyptican military do not fly at night and no commercial traffic was in the area.I submitted this report some years ago to MUFON but have never heard anything back from them or if they received It.  I am now retired from the Air Force and this incident still bugs me I would like to know what they were.

The object was a pulsating light and the shape was unknown.  It appeared to be five miles out over the ocean and was moving slowly north by northeast. After watching it for a few minutes, the police officer directly south of my town contacted us and told us that there was an object over the ocean, approximately five miles out over the ocean heading our way.  Two police officers were sent to the beach area where they were able to see the object.  The Sergeant guessed that it was 500 feet off the ocean between 3 to 5 miles out over the ocean. When it was directly off our coastline, the object made a sudden turn South and disappeared. A week prior to this sighting, a caretaker of a local lighthouse called our police station, quite upset.  He asked to have an officer come see him regarding an object  that was actually floating on the water approximatley 100 yards off the rocks. He saw the object from ground level and ran up to the top of the lighthouse to get a btter look.  When he got to the top of the light house, the object took off from the water straight up in the air.  The object lifted at a high rate of speed, not consistent with a helicopter or anything he was familiar with.  He wanted to see one of our officers to confirm that he had not been drinking and was sane (he had to make a report to his supervisors).", "My cousin and I saw what looked like a firework at first glance.

It was low in the sky and was approaching very slowly.  Dogs started barking all over the neighborhood.  We stayed outside and watched it pass over.   It was very large and oval and had multicolor lights around the edges that slowly rotated as it moved forward.   It very slowly went off into the distance (I think we watched it for a long time) and I ran inside and called the police (more because I was hoping they would say what it was) and the dispatcher said he was getting tons of calls and he was assuming everyone had a lot to drink this St. Patrick&apos;s Day. The next four hours the sky was full of helicopters with searchlights.  The newspapers reported the next day it was likely ultra lights in formation.  I have no idea what it was but you could see the solid bulk of it as darker against the night sky.  It made no noise either, and the lights weren&apos;t in plane formation.

I looked outside my window and I saw a light, which at the time I thought was an aircraft travelling left to right in the direction of Heathrow airport, but it flew very fast much faster than any other plane, which would not be allowed to fly that fast even if they could because of the distance it is to Heathrow Airport due to speed regualtions, laws etc. It was not a fighter jet because I know and I have seen them fly and this thing flew much faster than one. Also the object was very bright much brighter than lights from planes which I saw near it (next to flight path)  but it was much further away than the commercial planes and it had brighter lights. Unlike the planes it which have several lights, it did not have any it was emitting light from itself; it looked slightly less bright than a star. It could not have been a comet because the object was flying parallel at an average speed and then it suddenly (not gradually) increased in speed. It was definatley not a plane because living under a flight path for all my life I can distinguish between a jumbo jet to a unconventional looking hazy light. Other planes were in the vicinity of the object but they were going into land on the airport or had just taken off.

I have picturesOn Sunday October 2, 2005, I was standing by the window of my 15th floor apartment in New York, when I saw a ver strange object coming from the east (Queens), flying at relatively low altitude.  I live in a high rise on the East side of Manhattan by the river, and I have unobstructed view of the city, including La Guardia airport nearby and JFK farther in the distance, so I normally see all kinds of aircraft flying around, but this object caught my attention because of its odd appearance.  It was a dark, almost black, very big object that flew very smoothly without making any noise.  Its shape was extremely unusual, very difficult to describe, but it was not aerodynamic at all.  The only thing I can compare it with is a modern sculpture.  It was definitely not an airplane, a helicopter or a blimp.  But it didn&apos;t even closely resembled either the image that, at least mentally, we all have of UFOs.  It was not a bright-silver flying saucer, did not emit any lights and did not fly at great speed.  It came very close to my building and then veered north and disappeared in the distance.  I had it in front of my eyes for at least 3 minutes.  It was such as strange sighting that I even thought it might be a hallucination.  Amid my disconcert, I was able to grab my camera and take two pictures which, to my surprise, came out as sharp and crisp as my memory. I want to point out that it was a beautiful early-fall day, there was still plenty of sunlight, the sky was clear and lots of New Yorkers were outside.  I could see many people walking the promenade along the East river so they all had to have seen this object.  It was impossible to miss it.  And, still, no newspaper or TV news made any mention of it.  I have shown the pictures to all my relatives, friends, co-workers, neighbors, acquaintances, etc. and they all look at them in disbelief.

We both freaked and immediately drove in that direction but did not find anything and blew it of.A couple nights later we again were siting in the car but this time facing north listening to the radio when we saw a bright orange light approaching us. It appeared to be flying very low. My friend said it was a helicopter. Then all of a sudden it began to move back and forth eradictly. We both jumped out of the car as it flew directly overhead. It dimmed its lights and sat there motionless and silent overhead. It slowly turned off its lights and hovered above us. You could see all the detail of the ship. It had an observaton deck on the side and you could see inside a window and I noticed objects moving inside but could not make out any details other then something inside. The craft was probably about 1000 feet in the air. I would estimate that it was about 100 feet long. You could see dark burned looking edges on the craft. It was shaped like a cigar and had half domes in the back side of the craft that spun like gyros. In these gyros there was red and green lights. When the craft departed the gyros began to spin and the craft moved faster as the gyros spun. By this time my friend ran into the house to tell his parents while I just stood there staring. It finally took off and was instantly gone leaving a trail like Star trek. I was obviously freaked out. My friend ran out of the house and explained that his mom and dad were in the house watching the news as they were explaing that peopel were at the airport waiting to see the lights that were spotted the night before. We called the airport and they laughed. So they gave us the UFO report center number. I called and reported the sighting.

I went into a room and came out and it was gone. I was again kind of freaked out about it. I then put away all my equipment and was walking towards my bike when a truck load of friends came flying around the corner.

The sun was on the west side and that fireball was going towards Maine ( so it was going from north to south when looking into the west direction).  We all saw it for a few minutes untill it desapeared ( some peole said it plunged into the st Laurent river so if it did, it changed it&apos;s directory to go down). Some other people said that an army aircraft tried to chase it but i haven&apos;t seen any aircraft at that time.  It must have been at least 5 times bigger than the sun.  It was just amazing an no one ever knew what it was. It left no trace of smoke on it&apos;s path. The second time, i was back home after going to see a car accident that happened up the street from where i lived ( there must be a report somewhere at the police station about that accident if i ever want to know the exact date of ny sighting).  At that time , it was peach dark and there was no light post around.  I saw the exact same fireball on my way back home.  This time i was in the north direction and the firewall was heading West.  Same fireball, same speed, same everything but it was much furter. I&apos;ve seen shooting stars many many times before and after the events and i can tell that it was not one. The movement was constant. Both times, they were not going in an angle but on a straight horizontal line.  No noise, no crashing ( that i saw) , no reports in the medias. What strikes me the most is when many years later i saw the movie about the Allagash Abductions.  The fireball looked a lot like the object in the movie. Was it the same object? I don&apos;t know.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The four of us, three males and one female aged in our early twenties, finally arrive and decide to celebrate down at the beach on the sand..... At about 4:30am a mate starts yelling about a UFO he is seeing that is flashing a light in the night sky....that he has been watching for a minute or so. Then we all saw it....It was right near us out to sea, there were some clouds that probably shaded our view for where it started. It first was a bright white light that was maybe 3-4 kms altitude. It was moving east towards Melbourne. Then changes direction slightly and the white light dims till it is almost out, while moving in a NE to E to NE continually. Now it is quite dim and you could almost not see it. Then the light dims on again but it is red and it is shining. But it wasnt as strong as the white light, but it was further away. If I could speculate as to the shape, it was probably disc or a ball, and probably the size of a small plane..... One thing I dont have to speculate on now is the existance of EBE&apos;s as I can safely say, that was no man made craft....", "Do Shooting Stars TURN? Longmont, Colorado, 02/21/2006,Last night as I was outside smoking, I thought I was observing a shooting star except when it should have been at the point of disappearing it turned and kept going. The object was heading north and when I expected &quot;it&quot;(shooting star) to burn out, it than turned to the East and continued until it was out of my sight.", "Acrobatics and in broad daylight over city.It hovered in the distance, above near-by tree line, and for the first moment I thought it was a blimp circling on a route around the university stadium.  It was about that size, and from the side it appeared to have an oval shape.  There was a flashing light to the right side, which went out of view as the object rotated.  The light was visible again as the object pitched so the apparent top was visible.  At this angle it looked like a Vinn-diagram, with three areas of the structure coming together at the middle.  These three areas were equally spaced, equal in size, and if the spaces between them were filled the perimeter would have been roughly circular.  The color was dark and slightly metallic, but overall blackish and in the southern sky versus the setting sun.  As the object continued to hover, it spun and also flipped over completely very slowly more than once, moving eastward and we though downward slightly.  At this point we discussed the possibilities of a stunt plane (a completely unfamiliar variety moving entirely too slowly), an RC disc (which typically would have had a limited range and would have been either enormous or easily distinguished), and a helium balloon in free fall (which would explain the manuevers but not the shape and apparent size at that distance).  The loss of altitude we determined to be an illusion as the object was becoming smaller and we observed it traveling away from us.  The object then rapidly decreased in size, moving very quickly away southward.  The altitude also changed as the object got further away  and apparently gained height.  We observed it until it was a barely visible dot in the distance.", "Faint star-like object became larger and sat over the ocean for at least ten minutes.I was traveling from Minnesota with a friend.  We were both eighteen years old and did not have much money so we were sleeping on the beach (Black&apos;s Beach).  My friend had gone to sleep in his sleeping bag near by and I stayed up to look at the stars.  I liked to watch satellites going by when away from city lights.  I spotted what I thought at first was a satelllite straight above me.  It was very faint at first and going in a straight line heading west. But then it suddenly changed direction. It began heading southwest for a time. Then Northwest. Each change of direction happened instanly i.e. not in an arched tradgectory but more like an instant change, if that makes sense. At this point I woke my friend and he watched it with me. After doing these maneuvers for ten minutes or so, it began to get larger and move toward the western horizon over the ocean. It finally came to a stop just above the water. At this point it was quite large, perhaps the size of a nickle if held straight out. It was a white, glowing ball. It just sat there for about ten minutes. Then it began to ascend again and grow smaller. After a while it just faded out and disappeared. Even thought this happened a long time ago, I still have a vivid recolection of it because it had a big impact on me at the time. It did not fit into the profile fo any aircraft I could think of and its maneuvers were beyond anything I knew of.", "PHOENIX LIGHT OVER SCOTTSDALE IN 1991I HAVE WITHOUT A DOUBT &amp; SWEAR ON MY LIFE &amp; THE LIFE OF MY FAMILY, THAT I TOO HAVE SEEN THESE LIGHTS AND IT CHILLS ME EVERYTIME I SEE A REPORTING ABOUT THEM.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE TO MY STORY IS THAT THE DATE THAT I HAVE SEEN THEM IS ABOUT 4 YEARS PRIOR TO YOUR SIGHTING.  I HAVE SEARCHED FOR DATES ONLINE BUT HAVE SEEN NOTHING DURING THIS TIME.

AND FROM 1992 TO 2004 I LIVED IN THE FAR NORTH SUBURBS OF CHICAGO.  I WAS AT THE CORNER OF SCOTTSDALE ROAD AND E. SHEA BLVD. AT THE NE CORNER OF THE INTERSECTION IS/WAS A &quot;MOBILE&quot;  ((sic.

WHILE I WAS FILLING UP MY CAR WITH GAS, I SAW THESE RED LIGHTS IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING IN A &quot;V&quot; SHAPE IN WHAT LOOKED VERY CLOSE AND MOVING VERY SLOWLY!!! BECAUSE THE AREA SITS AT SORT OF A HIGHER ELEVATION OVERLOOKING THE PHOENIX, TEMPE &amp; MESA AREAS, THE LIGHTS SEEMED ALMOST EYE LEVEL.  YOU DID LOOK UP SLIGHTLY BUT THESE LIGHTS SEEMED NO MORE THAN ABOUT 1 MILE AWAY IN DISTANCE AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT A HALF A MILE LONG OR LONGER IN SIZE.  THE OBJECT MOVED IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION AND MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND WHAT-SO-EVER. THE FACT THAT IT HAD NO SOUND IS WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.  I HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF AMBER LIGHTS, WHICH I DON&rsquo;T BELIEVE IS WHAT I SAW.  I BELIEVE I SAW RED LIGHTS.  ALSO, I HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF FLARES. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT I SAW.  THIS MAINTAINED A CONSTANT ELEVATION IN A VERY SLOW EASTERLY DIRECTION.  I WAS IN SO MUCH DISBELIEF THAT I DIDN&rsquo;T HEAR ANYBODY ELSE AROUND ME MAKING COMMENTS THAT I HAD TO ASK AN OLDER GENTLEMAN, WHOME WAS WALKING OUT OF THE GAS STATION AFTER PAYING I ASSUME, IF HE KNEW WHAT THOSE LIGHTS WERE.  HE DID SORT OF A DOUBLE TAKE, ANSWERED, &quot;I DON&rsquo;T KNOW,&quot; PROCEEDED TO GET IN HIS CAR STARING AT THE LIGHTS AND DROVE OFF.

I THINK I KEPT AN EYE ON THE LIGHTS FOR A WHILE AS I WAS DRIVING BUT AFTER THAT I CAN&rsquo;T REMEMBER WHEN I STOPPED LOOKING.  I REMEMBER TELLING MY GIRLFRIEND ABOUT IT WHEN I WALKED IN HER HOUSE AND SHE CHANGED THE SUBJECT AND I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING ON THE NEWS THAT EVENING ABOUT IT, SO IT WAS FORGOTTEN UNTIL ABOUT 1997 WHEN I SAW THE FIRST REPORTS OF THE LIGHTS ON TELEVISION.  I REMEMBER SEEING THE REPORTS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND FEELING THE HAIR STAND UP ON THE BACK OF MY NECK. I WONDERED, &quot;NOW HOW DO I TELL SOMEBODY MY STORY WITHOUT THEM THINKING THAT I AM NUTS?&quot;  WELL, I NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT MUCH BUT, I TOLD MY FUTURE WIFE AND I RECEIVED THE TYPICAL RESPONSE I GUESS ANY CRACK POT MIGHT GET, &quot;OH, COOL OR THAT&rsquo;S NICE.&quot;  SO AGAIN, I PUSHED IT ASIDE.

I lived in Fremont Ca. It was a hot August day in 1977. I wanted to get out of the house, so I called up couple of girl that I knew and asked them if they wanted to go for a ride. They said yes. So I went and picked them up. I decided to take them to a place where I knew about. It was outside of Pleasenton Ca.  There was a abby where these monks lived. These monks had painted a bridge. It was done in different seens. They were seens from 1776 thru 1976. They were very beutiful, and I knew it would impress the girls. So I took the girls there and they were impressed. When we were done we drove to the end of the road. Theres a parking lot over looking a small lake. I shut off my motor and got some beers out of the trunk of my car. When I got back into the car I gave the girls a beer and cracked one open for myself. As soon as I looked back up, there it was. I couldn&apos;t beleive what I was seeing.

This disk was changing colors and had a haze around it. It was hovering over the far end of the lake and then it would fly off. When it flew off it was at about a 45 degree angle. It seem to go around ten miles away. then in a blink of an eye, it was back over the lake. I apeared to change shapes right before my eyes. I couldn&apos;t understand what I was seeing. Needless to say, I was scared ((word deleted)). I wanted to look over at the girls and see if they were looking, but I was afraid it would fly away. So I didn&apos;t look over. I just asked them if they were seeing what I was seeing, and they replied I hope so. I asked them if they were seeing a flying sauser. They said yes. That really scared me too. I think part of me was hoping they weren&apos;t seeing this flying sauser. My brain was working overtime. I had never seen anything like it before so I didn&apos;t know what to do. As I kept watching this sauser it was flying back and forth around the lake. Then another sauser appeared. About 1 min. later a third sauser appeared. It was really stange, it was like they just appeared. We watched them for about another min. then one of the suaser flew right over to where we were parked. It stopped around 50 yards from us. Now it was hovering right in front of us. I was trying to move but couldn&apos;t. I was frozen with fright. We were looking right at them, and I felt like they were looking right at us at us. It felt like an hour, but was only about 15 sec. Then it flew over to west end of the lake. We watched them for a couple of more min.s. I not sure what they were doing there. But when they finally left it was the most amazing thing. All three sausers flew of to the west. they flew around 5 miles at a 45 degree angle. Now this is a little hard to exsplain. But they all three seem to fly in the same spot, and then they flew off as 1 sauser. It left a trail when it left. When it left it was so fast, it looked like a shooting star.

When I first observed this, it was glowing orange with a very short tail behind it.  The object then had smaller glowing pieces coming off of it.  This lasted for approx-imately  three seconds. The glowing object then went out and reappeared for 2 seconds.  It seemed odd because of the slow speed that it was moving at.

The striking thing is to a non-astronomer at first I thought this was a twinkling star.  It is not a star. It moves sometimes slow, sometimes fast and its brightness changes. I thought at first it was some sort of surveillance aircraft, it moves not linearly, but seems to be moving about the night sky. I bought a spotting lens 30-90x. Tonight I was able to focus on it and was amazed. This object changed form freqauently but had a basically tranlucent body with a dark orb at the bottom or within.   At times it appeared bell shaped with a glowing hot blue white band where the base of the bell would would be  base form was fairly smoot but appeared as though it was flowing in shape and nearly constantly changing shape. At the bottom of the bell or parabola was a dark globe like form. Not to be trite but the object looked like a taco bell logo, sort of. It&apos;s activity was similar to one of those static electriciy balls, a pulsing electric form, but with straight lines and a ring rather than truly static. The bell or parabollic form was a hazy white which seemed to rotate about itself slowly. It seemed to have stripes running from the arch to the base around it. It rotated its nearly continually, so as to appear as though it was floating about itself. It was of intense brightness without magnification. It seemed 5-10 degrees elevated from the horizon.  It eventually took off to the west and suddently disappeared. I viewed it a number of diffent ways.  At less magnification it looked like a parabola which was bright and squiggling. From this perspective it was multicolored including a bright blue white, with varous colors inlcuding red continually fluctuating. As it rotated it also gave the appearance of a cylinder with the globe portion at the end. and with stripes of brighter light running the length of its body which seemed to rotate about it. The object always appeared translucent or nearly so. although not truly a triangle, it appeared to have an elonated parabollic triange. It behaves as though it is conducting a survey.  It is out at night regularly. It was of such intensity that I have eye pain from watching it. I made some drawings of it.  I figured it for  some sort of reconisance craftbeing tested out of one of the numerous bases around here, and I say this because it truly gives the appearance of beig a bright star but doesn&apos;t behave like a planet in terms of its&apos; motion.", "THE NEXT DAY &quot;THE LIGHTS IN THE SKY&quot; WAS ON THE NEWS ON TV RADIO AND NEWSPAPER..&quot;JUST AFTER SUNSET IT GOT COOL AND A FAINT FOG CAME IN..I WENT OUTSIDE JUST BEFORE WHEEL OF FORTUNE AND JEPORDY..AND NOTICED THE FOGGYNESS AND HEARD A LOW-LEVEL CYCLICK HUM LIKE A BIG GENERATOR..SORTA I LOOKED UP PUZZLED AT WHAT I WAS HEARING..I NOTICED THE STARS OVER MY HOUSE WERE &quot;GOING OUT&quot; MY HAIR WAS STANDING UP LITERALY..THEN..ONE BLUE LIGHT..THEN TWO MORE EVENLY SPACED..THEN TWO MORE..THEN ONE MORE..LIKE THE POINTS OF &quot;THE STAR OF DAVID&quot; WERE LIT WITH BLUE LIGHTS..IT WAS A PERFECT TRIANGLE BLACK AND HUGE LIKE 250&apos;- 300&apos; ON A SIDE..MOVING SLOW AND DELIBERATE IN A N.- N.W.DIRECTION..I WAS IN AWSTRUCKNESS!!..I KEPT SAYING WOH..WOH..ONE MINUTE IT WAS OVER ME AND MY HOUSE THEN..IT WAS LEAVING..I WENT IN THE HOUSE TO TELL THE FAMILY &quot;WHAT I SAW..THEY ASKED ME WHERE I HAD BEEN FOR SO LONG?I SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN?..IT&apos;S JUST BEEN A FEW MINUTES THE WHEEL&amp;JEPORDY WERE OVER AND THE EVENING MOVIE WAS ON!!

I looked up and out of the corner of my eye i see a Plane, or something, that was flying pretty low and looks as if he is having trouble with turbulance. It is visable that it is going up and down while trying to ascend. Then as he passes by, I see a light way up in the atmosphere just to the right of the plane.

The thing is though it that it wasnt wide. From where i was standing it was about 1/2 inch wide and an inch tall. It was a rotating craft as i could see, but it was too dark to conclude this.

The lights were in a vertical line and appeared to be blue, red, and blue. I watched both nights for about 10 minutes. On the 11th, the configuration was in the south east, and on the 13th it was almost due south - perhaps slightly to the west. The sky was overcast in the southern area on the 11th and totally overcast on the 13th, but on both nights I was able to see the lights very distinctly. They appeared to be at least three or four times as large as most stars and larger than any planets I&apos;ve seen including Venus or Mars. The closest description I can think of is airplane lights, but they did not move and they were in a vertical line.

I have attempted to find photographs of satellites on the internet, but have not been able to find anything that looks like what I saw. The lights did not blink or move at all in the time I watched.

We were heading East to Santa Rosa County. The sun had gone down as we traveled on Interstate 10. As I was driving, I was close to the water tower that is on the interstate which is just before the bridge going over Escambia Bay.  All of a sudden and out of nowhere, a space ship was suspended over the interstate before the bridge. There was no sound eminating from the spacecraft however, it was extremely large; almost covering the width of the interstate.  Also, it was vast in height in comparison to a five or six-story building.  Underneath the craft, the structure seemed to be comprised of steel girders with a circular area in the middle of the bottom of the spacecraft. It was lit up so that one could see the structural design of the craft.The main superstructure was very large with colored panels lighting up at times. I recall a red, blue or green, and yellow panel lit up as if the space craft was tying to communicate something using color and the sequence of when the panels lit up.There was no sound coming from this sighting. It was just suspended in space. It was so close to my friend and me. Then all of a sudden the lights went out and in total darkness and without sound, the craft moved over the water tower. It was hovering over the tower when out of the circular area located at the bottom of the craft, a light shown down on the water tower. It was as if the light was searching the tower and nearby land where the tower was built. Again, the lights went out and without and trace of sound, the spacecraft moved a little west and farther into the sky. Again, it was suspended in the sky and the only lights eminating from it were white lights. If I am not mistaken, the lights seemed to be outlining the perimeter of the spacecraft.It has been several years since my friend and I saw this sighting. If I am not mistaken, once the craft had allowed us to see the white lights surrounding the perimeter, it fled in an amazing speed towards the southeast.That was an incredible evening for both my friend and me. Once arriving to my home, excitedly, he and I ran into the house sharing this information with my parents. I called the local newspaper and radio station(s) explaining what we had seen and asked if anyone had seen the same thing to please get in touch with me. However, as was in a lot of cases back in the 70&apos;s, the receiver(s) of my inquiries laughed in unbelief.Today, I know this sighting was real. I don&apos;t have to prove anything to anyone to the reality of this matter because I, as well as my friend, know what we saw was truth. I only wish I could have communicated with the intellectuality of the spacecraft to understand more. But yet, maybe another time will take place so that intelligence can share and learn from other sources within the universe.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Moved with intellegenceThe incident hapened a few days after we got plowed with a couple feet of snow in march of 2001.Iam glad I have a place to post this because what happened was very strange. I hope this is not too long.I have lived in wayland my whole life and live adjacent to miles of conservation land. No one knows these woods as well as I do because I have been out there almost everyday of every season since the early 1980s. There are no conservation trails in this area and does not see any traffic from dog walkers or hikers. The area is sort of swampy which I think helps keep people away. Its the kind of area that if you know your way it can take you five minutes to get to a point that would take someone else an hour to get to. I love it.Anyway. There sure is history out there in those woods. European settlers have been in that exact spot since the early 1640s. My woods was home to one of the original families. They were millers and provided timber for most of the early town works. But unusually they were quite far from their neighbors. Also there is an ancient fishing site thousands of years old well within walking distance. This site was also intricate in the king Philip Indian insurgency and the revolutionary war. This is a brief history of what I know about my woods out there. Maybe this pertains? At about 1.00 am I was in my yard letting my dog relieve himself before bedtime. Looking out into the forest I noticed a light, that looked to me like a candle being walked around through the trees at waist length. Knowing that there are no houses in that direction and that there should be no one walking in the woods at night I became curious and went with my dog about 30 yards in, past my yard to get a better look. I couldn&rsquo;t see much but something was happening out there. The flickers of light I was seeing had no explanation, had never been there before, and shouldn&rsquo;t have been there at all. But I could still hardly make them out, there was a hundred yards between us and lots of trees. I went inside woke up a family member and told them there were people in the woods with candles or flashlights. We went into the yard but the small flicker of lights didn&rsquo;t impress enough to go out there and check it out.The next day my friend heard about this from me and begged me to go out there with him at around the same time, I agreed. We bundled up, I grabbed a B.B. rifle(makes me feel safer) and we headed out.Immediately we saw the same thing I had seen the night before, small flickering through the trees just above ground level. We were about 300 yards in when suddenly there was like a camera flashbulb going of in front of us deep in the woods,  about another 80 yards in front of us. Then one way to the right of the last flash, but still in front of us, then a flash to the left. Real bright flashes. The flashes then started flashing towards us. We were talking to each other saying &quot;you&rsquo;re seeing this, right?&quot; There were about 30 separate flashes from different directions in front of us gradually getting closer and closer. One flashed about 3 feet from my face. It looked like someone struck a huge match of different colors but it was not fire, it was all of a sudden light from nowhere. They flashed about twice the size of a basketball and the one that flashed next to my face seemed like slow motion. When it flashed there was slow motion. that&rsquo;s the best I can explain it.My friend and I looked at each other and ran back to the house as fast as we could out of sheer terror.(I should have stayed but my stomach got very queasy) When we got back to my yard. We talked about what we saw and decided it would be stupid not to go back out and really experience and try to interact and get to the bottom of the &quot;ORBS&quot; that just seemed to display at least some intelligence by coming directly to us.We walked in complete darkness back to the exact spot we had 25 minutes earlier seen the orbs. No flashes or peeks of light through the woods greeted us. We couldn&rsquo;t believe they were gone. So we went farther. When we reached about 3 quarters of a mile into the woods(significantly farther than the initial experience)we saw light.Almost to the top of one of the oldest trees in the woods(an old field corner marker next to a stone wall)were 3 Huge orb lights circling this tree!!! We were about 25 yards away and they were suddenly in very clear view, literally in perfect view of us. They were about 6ft by 6ft and one was slightly larger and had a slightly different tint than the others they made no sound. We watched in shock, from an excellent vantage point for what felt like it was 10 minutes. I still had the B.B gun and we took turns looking through the scope at them for an even better view. They were totally unnatural and foreign to anything I had ever seen before. They had a natural very bright bio luminescence sort of look to them but the spheres themselves did look metallic. They slowly circled, lucidly, near the top of the tree.We started panicking about how we might start to get out of there. Continuing to face them we backed away. I turned and started running as fast as I could. When I turned to look back all three orbs had stopped circling the tree and had begun to follow us in a single file 10-12ft above ground. They were slow and didn&rsquo;t catch up to us.We ran all the way back to the yard non stop.  In my yard we were safe.  We kneeled down panting, relaying to each other what had just happened. We had not said a peep to each other during the whole encounter trying not to give ourselves away.I haven&rsquo;t seen anything similar out there since. Not even the initial flashbulb things through the trees no matter how deep I am out there. But in that spot, where the tree they circled is located the branches of all the surrounding trees are bent in the same direction in a very odd and obvious way. This, like the rest of the story is very hard to explain. Never the less it happened and it proved to me that there is much more out there that still is unexplained by modern science.If you have had a similiar encounter or have questions email me at ((e-address deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Resolution Northwest Territories. My snowmachine experienced mechanical difficulties which resulted in us being forced to walk approx 12 miles back to a highway where we had left our vehicle and snowmobile trailer. The weather at the time was quite mild for January minus 10 and there was light snow falling. My snowmachine had broke down at approx 11:00 a.m. We walked for several hours until about 5: p.m. at which time we stopped for a lunch break. We made a small fire to warm up and boil some water for tea. We were in the center of a small clearing roughly 300 ft in diameter and sitting under a large spruce tree. We had been there for approx. fifteen minutes when we began to hear a low humming sound approaching from the east. The sound grew steadily louder and the hum turned to a very low throbbing sound-like a huge engine running at idle. The whole area was charged with an electric tingling. We looked up but did not see anything of any substance. After about one minute the object seemed to be hovering directly above our location. We still did not see anything. Suddenly there was an intense flash of light like a million flashbulbs going off at once. There was a pause and then another intense flash of light approx 5 seconds after the first and finally a third flash.At this point the noise began to move west in the direction that we whad been travelling. The low heavy throbbing sound continued and finally faded away.We packed up our belongings and continued our walk back to the highway. At no time did we observe anything, just the incredibly deep throbbing sound and the three flashes of light. We arrived back at the highway at 23:00 and returned to Ft. Resolution.

I asked him if he was holding something at arms length between his thumb and index finger that would represent the objects size what would it be? He said, without hesitation, &ldquo;about the size of a BB&rdquo;.One of the strangest things about it, he said, was that when it appeared it was already moving &ldquo;as if it decided to just appear as it was moving slowly west&rdquo;. He stated that it made no sound or changed it&rsquo;s direction of travel. After observing it for about 30 seconds or so he said he picked up the faint sound of a jet and then he saw it pop up over the trees in the west. When  he glanced back over to the object it had stopped moving.  After just a few seconds the object headed north at an incredible speed and disappeared below the horizon. He said he tried to count down the seconds using the 001 method as it moved away from the jet but never made it to the second zero.Our friend has always been a true blue skeptic about these things, but now as he states, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about this anymore&rdquo;.This is the second, close to identical, sighting of this object from our property in six months.

Right away my dad turn the light on the beam of light would stop but not for long. It would start to moving side to side, and come closer and closer to me and my dad.

As times pasts it get down the hill and now in the valley, now about 500 yards way form us. I with knive in hand and light start to walk towards the light, the beam was moving side to side so i just walk in a straight line form the truck. I pointed the light at the beam of light and start to walk away form the truck about a 50 yards my dad was about 25 yard way. He was talk to the tow truck guy. I think it took them 3 hours to get there. But any way as I&apos;m walk to the beam of light I heard no sounds, the beam of light came at me so fast it was not funny. It was so close I could see the bushes and the little hill on the land, at the same time I saw the light in a better veiw. It did not light up anything that was not in the beam, like a lazer. I ran to the truck and my dad fallowed, we all jumped in the truck and waited. As the light movie side to side it was about 200 yards a way. We just waited as it got closer then start to back up, but then it would move so fast i dont even really think any would go that fast then stop and move to the right and left. I was scared my dad was scared my girlfriend was scared. As we watched the light move for about 30 more mins. The tow truck guys came, the frist thing we said was can u look at that light, as he did he was like its nottin, just like me the beam of light started to move. He went to work get us out of their, 15 mins of look at the light we were got out of there. But as we left the light rose form the ground and start to fellow us about 5 miles the light went away.

These objects were large and ethereal in nature- almost as if translucent.We&apos;re certain that they were not commercial jets- nor did these objects follow a flight pattern that we&apos;ve ever witnessed in these parts.  Moreover, they were totally silent which really amazed us.My husband ran quickly to the front gate of our property as he tried to follow their flight path which seemed to be heading west by northwest towards Manhattan.

From here in Blackwood, Camden County,South Jersey,the comet was North by Northwest in the sky. as I looked up I was amazed by this huge cloud that was rising up after the storm. It was illuminated by the sun and the passing storm was in the backround, making the cloud even more spectacular! The colors ranged from yellow to blue,purple,orange, and pink! I wished I had a camera with me! Just then I witnessed five or six Gold Discs passing from left to right in front of the cloud! They turned left in formation like our planes do, to go around something!

There was only one spotted at first, which was a white-blue color.  Then after further observations, several more were witnessed of similiar color as well as different colors.  They blend in with the night time stars rather well.  The objects move unlike stars however.  Some appear to be closer than others.  It is not possible to determine distance nor shape of the objects, as the reference point is the night sky.  At approxiamatly 22:30 on 03/01/2006 a low altitude jet had a set course to one of the objects located South by South east of the location of observation.  As the jet approached, the object&apos;s movements was similiar to that of a bumble bee, very quick and in various directions.  A college (which has not witnessed this but was told about it) reported today, 03/04/2006, that he overheard conversation refering to the same details as described above about the objects being in the area. I would like to note that the objects are holding a &quot;static&quot; position, meaning that they are NOT rotating with the stars, rather staying in particular locations.  Sometimes they will leave the location they are in and then return shortly afterwards.  The movement is a slight but steady bobbing in multiple directions.  They range in colors from white-blue to redish orange.  Attempts were made to make visual verification by means of Cam Corder, 35 mm camera with zoom lens, as well as a telescope.  The camcorder images are crude looking due to the fact that the exposure settings.  The camera and and the telescope provided a better view.

We were returning home, which was about 1 mile past the Fayette and Jessamine County line on Tates Creek Rd. As we traveled along Alumni Dr. to my right (West) I saw a large diamond shape object above the trees. It was the size of my thumb. As Alumni meanders, it seemed to stay in a constant attitude. No movement.When we reached home, I walked to the front of the house and it was then, south, but the same size and stationery. This was about the time either Mars or Venus was supposed to be so close. My friend thought it must be that. But, what I saw did not resemble a star or planet. It was diamond-shaped with the tallest points verticle. It was very bright and clear, possibly lit from the moon&apos;s glow. This was night time. Through the center was a green belt. The entire surface was faceted, as though it was made up of millions of tiny crystals, including the belt. Since distance can fool you, I can say that it appeared to be between the earth and it&apos;s moon, however, the moon was to my north-east. I am 60 years old this spring, and even though I haven&apos;t flown since the mid 80&apos;s, I do hold a 3rd class, single engine, land rating. So, even though I have had only about 100 hours flying time, I have had some training in observation.The next night, I thought I would walk out to see if anything was there. Again, it was there, in the same position, and looking the same as before. I went back into the house and retrieved my binoculars and viewed the object through them. It was so bright, I could never get it in good focus. Since it never did anything but set there, I went back inside and forgot about it.

After I lost them in the Horizon to the east, I thought that was the last of it, but two minutes later, another object appeared in front of me, also moving fast on an East-West direction, as if trying to catch the other 3, except that this object seemed to bounce up and down as it flew westward.At about the time the 3 objects flew by, but before the last one passed, a helicopter happened to fly by right over my head, at a fairly high altitude, that&apos;s when I realized that I could hear the copter&apos;s engine noise, but the 3 objects did not.I can&apos;t be sure if they were man made or not, but even at the distance and altitude that they flew, they were visible enough to have seen wether they had wings or propellers, and I did not see either.If they were made by the military, all I can think is that they might have been Jet powered Drones, or they must have been testing missiles near our area.This is not the first time I&apos;ve seen strange objects in the sky.Last January I also saw an object hovering over Santa Ana, And I happen to know that someone else saw that object as well.

It was to in the front of the house just over the oak tree tops in an opening in the tree branches that made it visible.  I was convinced that this thing was watching me.  It was about the size if a mini van.  It was the shape of a plump M&amp;M candy.  It was inky black in appearance and would have probably gone unnoticed by me save for the lights in it. There were three white lights on its underside. They were about the size of those saucer sleds that kids use. They were not airplane lights but big and round lights. The lights curiously did not illuminate the rest of the object. It remained absolutely silent and stationary for maybe ten minutes or so.  I was terrified the moment that I saw it.  I also stood motionless the entire time of ten minutes.  All I could do was hope that this was not going to turn out to be an abduction.  I was fearfully dreading seeing those little monsters with big black almond shaped eyes.  Nothing at all happened to me.  I decided to start shoveling again and pretend it wasn&apos;t there. The moment that I looked away the UFO left.  I just remember looking down for a second and then looking back up there and there was no sighn of it. Then I ran somewhat toward where the thing was in order to get to the gate and then run into my house.  I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. That was all that happened.My personal interpretation of this was loooong thought over and pounded through in a lot of objective consideration.  In the end and after many changes in my life and a radical transformation which began in late 1996 I came to a sound and peace filled conclusion.  If I indeed saw something that night (meaning that this was not in my mind) it was unquestionably supernatural. The thoughts that I progressivly began to consider brought more and more confusion, meaninglessness and ultimately despair into my heart.  What would the existence of alien Intelligent life mean to me?  Why would they come here?  Why me?  What does this say about humanity&apos;s origen and its inextricably linked purpose for existence and its destiny?  Is the abduction phenomenon real?  I read quite a number of books about all these things.  Many different explanations were offered. The acceptance of any one of them would impact my world view tremendously and therefor my life would be conducted based on my conclusions which I was desparate for.  Years later after putting faith in the God of the Bible and His Son, Jesus, I saw things in a new and clear light.  Mankind is actually created by an entirely supernatural God.  We were created to be his children.  This means that we are in many ways like Him.  One thing is for sure:  He is the absolutely most superior person there is.  We are created as the most phenominal and superior life form, reflecting our creator (in the image of God).  Thus, there can not be any life that is more capable or &quot;intelligent&quot; in any way comparable to Mankind.  There are however both good and evil entities called angels (messengers of God. The &quot;evil&quot; ones wish to hide and distort the truth about God and thus bring death and destruction to humanity through sin.  God conversly works through His unique and eternal God-man Son, Jesus, to intervine and save people.  Hence, the reality that there is to the UFO/abduction phenomenon can be attribed to these categories: 1. Natural or explainable phenomenon.2. People who are crazy to one level or another, or on drugs, etc.3. Secret military aircraft.4. Evil spirits expressing themselves through UFOs and abductors as an effective means to mislead people into believing in lies about God and mankind.  Lies like &quot;you are your own god&quot; or Atheistic evolution theories, various magical, new age, and eastern mysticism worldviews.  The list never ends because there is no reliable measuring tool for interpreting the phenomenon.As a believer in Jesus however, I have made it a priority to either validate or repudiate the Bible as a true book from the one creator God.  A careful search into this will reveal to anyone that the book is fully relable. Jesus can save us and also bring the universe and life into its proper context. This is liberating. &quot;If you obey my words than you are really my disciples (followers); and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.&quot; Jesus, John 8:31-32.

I watched it just hovering in the one place for several minutes and on one occasion it seemed to have disappeared only to appear just as quick. My partner rang back and I was trying to explain what I was seeing...  at that very moment and although it may sound very strange I said to him that it looked as though it had a light coming from beneath (as though it was beaming something up) after 14 minutes it disappeared completely.

I had been retired from the USAF three years. All of us witnessed this sighting.  I did not report this at the time as I did not know who to call.  I did call the FAA at the time, but they had no radar returns on the local SEA/TAC radar. I and my brothers swear to this sighting as we have nothing to gain from this report.

You can get an array of dancing and blinking lights that at some time emit sparks. They appear to stop in mid air, dissapear and at some point, even land. There have been sightings of at least one cloaked individual on the ground. There have been other sightings on the road between Fairfield and Gooding of upward pointing spotlights that criss-cross and always seem to remain behind the rocks and landscape. A few day sightings have been seen of disks that often appear to turn sideways and dissapear. The most reported sighting turned nightime into day with no evidence of explosions, crashes or even a craft of any kind. For some reason there is interest in the south hills of Fairfiled by strange visitors.((NUFORC Note:  Celestial bodies or satellites?

The flash of light had a frequency of between 15 to 30 seconds and appeared to be the same color of a strobe light.  It varied in magnitude from bright (like that of a magnitude -1 star) to dim (like that a magnitude +3 or higher star) and was generally stationary, displaying occaisional slight varience from time to time. We observed this phenomenon for close to 25 minutes. Although we were using both a pair of binoculars and a telescope in our stargazing, we could only sight the object in the pair of binoculars.((NUFORC Note:  Over recent years, we have received a number of reports that are similar to this one.

I could see five or six square lights in a row: the middle light being the biggest.  Inside or behind these six lights was a brighter light that moved from the middle to the far right side.  There was no rhythm to the movement of the brightest light.  Sometimes the whole object would fade away, like it was going away from me, not across the sky like an airplane, but move back from me in depth.  I did see clouds moving across it.  The object stayed there in the same spot in the sky for at least 30 minutes.

I then looked and did see a red light in the horizon just hovering, nothing too spectacular just a light like radio antenna or something.  I tried to make sense of it by telling them that It seemed to be moving cause we were in a car and the slightest turns would make the light seem like its moving. But the strange thing about it was that it did not seem to move away like it should if it was standing still? We asked dad to stop the car for a better look and he downright refused and seemed to speed up instead like he was frightened.  I thought it was kind of strange to see him so scared like that. Eventually we lost it and did not make too much of a deal about it when we got home....The next day I heard of reports of UFOs all over the airwaves and in the newspapers also.

She said, go outside and look up . .. I did so and over my head came a set of lights in a boomerang configuation.  (Immediately after this event, I made a drawing of the lights, but have since lost it).  The lights were arranged in five or six sets of three.  The three lights in each set were identical: pastel yellow, green and blue.  There were some smaller red lights, but not in a configuration common on commercial or military aircraft.  The sets of lights were absolutely symetrical in their arrangement and fixed in their relationship.  My wife joined me and alerted our neighbors to our right who also came outside to look. The lights were relatively low, and I could hear the throb of an engine.  The sound is best described as the sound made when a set of twin boat engines is operating a little out of synch.  Its speed was very slow and it made a turn around our small area during which I saw a small red light behind the &quot;craft&quot; move suddenly to the craft and disappear, like it was on a tether.  Its speed remained slow, so slow that I wondered if it was ligher than air . . .  faster than drifting (there was no perceptible wind) but definitely powered in a direction at a speed that should not have supported aerodynamic flight.

I estimated its altitude above me at about 400 feet (based upon clarity with which I could see the lights and hear the sound).  It was two fists wide, perhaps.  Using the roof line of the opposing duplex (which eventually obscured the craft from view) as a reference, I make the following estimate of its size.  The duplex was approximately 30 feet tall (top of roof line) and 40 feet wide.  When it was obsured by the roof line, the craft was about half the width of the duplex.  If the craft was at 400 feet and did not change altitude as it moved east, and my eyes were at about 5 feet above the ground, then the craft&apos;s width was approximately equal to 8000/25 or 320 feet, a very large craft.  I also estimate that the distance from my viewing point to the duplex roofline was 80 feet, making the distance the craft traveled before it was obscured to be approximately 32000/25 or 1240 feet, almost 1/4 mile. It probably took about 30 seconds for the craft to travel that distance once it headed that way, making its speed to that point approximately 30 miles per hour, very slow for an aircraft! (I did these calculations as I am now making this report). I called Stewart AFB and reported the sighting . . . or more appropriately inquired as to what might have been over this Federal installation.  A coupld days later they returned my call and told me it was several ultra-lights operating in formation.  After seeing this craft do a 270 degree turn without changing geometry and after hearing a sound that did not equate to more than two engines, I knew this was not a plausible explanation. Strangely enough, I shortly thereafter was given the book Communion by Whitley Striber.  I didn&apos;t even realize, as I read it, that he lives across the Hudson and a bit south from West Point.  It was amazing to read his descriptions and the explanations given to him by Steward AFB!  The following week I talked to a couple of the cadets we sponsored and learned that they heard cadets talking about something strange they saw circling over the Academy!  Lastly, my partner&apos;s father saw the same object in Connecticuit approximately the same time!  I didn&apos;t learn of that until 13 years later. For your notes, I was at the time a Major in the Army teaching electrical engineering at the US Military Academy, from which I graduated in 1976; I recieved a MSEE (control systems) from the University of Washington in Seattle prior to teaching at the Academy.

We are both forty years old and niether of us really had much of an opinion about UFOs until the night of our sighting.We had traveled from Effingham, Illinois to Mermet Springs, Illinois in the southern most part of the state to go scuba diving at an old rock quarry which had been turned into a scuba faciltiy. We had ran into some severe storms on our way down but it turned of quite clear once we got to Mermet Springs. My son and a friend of his had come along to camp out with us.After we arrived we sat up our camp, grilled some brats and ate. We then took our chairs and sat them so we could see the sky clearly because there was supposed to be a meteor shower that night after ten o&apos;clock. We sat and talked for a while and were looking up at the stars waiting for the showers to begin. I was sitting to my friends right with my head leaned all the way back looking up when I noticed a light &quot;pop on&quot; in the sky to my right. I thought perhaps it was the north star but it was not. I kept my eye on it trying to figure out what star it was when it made a very sudden and tremendously fast move accross the sky moving to my left. It stopped as suddenly as it had taken off. The light sat there for about five seconds, flashed off then back on one time and then took off at a perfect right angle from the direction it had first moved. It traveled extremely fast. It was moving away from us this time. I could see what I would call a &quot;light trail&quot; behind it. After it made this move and took off it vanished and we did not see it again.During the time that the light was visible during this event, neither my friend or I had said anything, moved or alerted the other one as to what we were seeing. Once it was gone I simply turned left to look at my buddy. He turned to look at me and simply said &quot;yep, I saw that.&quot; We then talked about it for a little while basically trying to rationalize what could move that fast and stop suddenly and then take off again at a right angle to it&apos;s previous path. We could not come up with anything that made any sense based on our experiences. We both finally decided that we had seen a UFO and thought that was amazing! To describe the object all I can really say is that it appeared to be a bright light which very much resembled the North star except for this was much brighter. I could not see any shape at all since this object appeared to be very high up in the sky.Neither my friend or I can say what this object was but we both know for sure taht it was not a meteor, aircraft, reflection, star, or any other object known to us.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was large and out of place, not significantly higher than the treeline. 2 smaller lights were then emitted in order from smallest first to largest last, which formed an angled formation, the original light being the largest and highest. I would approximate the formation to be a 30 degree line. The lights formed this line from west to east.  Then, the lights melded back into the larger, original light in reverse order and it disappeared. Altitude and size is difficult to estimate. The initial sighting to its disappearance was around 15 seconds.

I am not sure of the time but it was approx. 8:30 pm. The sky was very clear &amp; the moon had not risen high enough to wash out the stars. There were also several commercial aircraft flying at different altitudes. Some were on approach to Charlotte Douglas &amp; some were much higher. We did not see a craft. We saw the first 2 bright white flashes about 1 second apart. Then after approx. 7-8 seconds, we saw 1 more flash in the same spot. We didn&apos;t see anything else. Since we couldn&apos;t see any shape of a craft &amp; didn&apos;t hear any sound, we are assuming that it was from something high in the sky. It very well may be something quite &quot;earthly&quot; &amp; not a ufo. Approximately 5 minutes later we observed a moving craft that had a bright white light on the front and a blinking white light behind that light. It was traveling very fast compared to the commercial aircraft in the sky &amp; was low in the sky, also traveling towards the North.

I recieved a phonecall from my husband on Friday March 10,06 about 8:40pm telling me to run outside and view this big red light object in the sky.I ran out with the cordless phone still in hand.  He was about 2 miles or so from home at his Dad&apos;s house off of Meyer and Imperial.  As he had arrived at his dads getting off his car he said he looked up at the moon, (1/4 moon that night), and saw this big glowing red object.  As he watched it for a minute or so, it appeared to be dropping something or shooting something out the bottom.  He said it looked like possible flames, or lights.As I viewed from my front yard, it was stationary.  It sat at about 2 miles or so in the south/east sky, I was looking towards the right and up from my driveway.  It&apos;s kind of hard to judge the distance from me. It wasn&apos;t real high up either, but it shimmered a vibrant red that you really couldn&apos;t get an accurate shape of it. It appeared as being oval.  Now thinking back, I&apos;d say with an arms length measurement, it appeared to be about the size of a hot air balloon, not too high up and not too low.We were experiencing a storm from Alaska at this time, but the skies were pretty clear. There was some clouds around, but not in the area of this object. The sky was really clear in the area it was.As I watched it in awe I began calling alot of family and friends so they could see it.  In years past I have viewed some strange objects, etc, and I wanted everyone I know in this area to see this.  The only ones I got a hold of were my two brothers.  One, who lives in Montebello, and the other who was visiting here from Hesperia.  He had been here earlier in the day and went to do some visiting in Montebello, taking my youngest son with him.It was stationed in this position for about 5 minutes, then slowly started moving towards the north/east, and then became stationary again.  This time I was looking at it directly infront of me.  It sat directly above the house across the street now, and just to the right lower area of the moon.As it sat there for about 7 to 10 minutes it started doing a slow flashing.  It would go off and on with a duration of about 4 seconds in between flashes.  It flashed this way maybe about 5-6 times, then stopped.I live on a busy street, Gunn Ave and Mulberry Dr, and I can&apos;t believe that all the cars driving by didn&apos;t even notice it.  Nobody was pulling over to look at it!  At about this time, my brother and son arrived. I had called them on the cell phone to tell them about it. They were on their way here to Whittier from Montebello. They weren&apos;t even a full mile from here when I called.  They pulled over and saw it from the intersection of Laurel and Lambert, then kept driving here keeping it in view.When they arrived, it was still stationary across the street from my house.  We watched it as it started to flash again with the same amount of duration.  As I watched with them now for another 5 minutes or so, it started to slowly move again, still going in a north/east looking direction.It stopped again.  This time it looked to be in the area of Whittier Blvd and maybe Colima.  It appeared smaller at this distance, but you could still see it.  It became stationary again, and started to again flash a few times.  At one point it went totally dark, like it had disappeared.  It was out for about 10 seconds, then came back on.  It started moving further away, and by this time the clouds in that area of the sky from the storm seemed to swallow it up and we couldn&apos;t see it any longer.Upon discussing with my brother from Montebello of his account from that distance away, he was able to run and get his binoculars.  I could have ran in my house to get a camera, but was afraid I would miss something, so I just watched and called everyone.He said through the binoculars, even at a distance of about 8 miles west of my house that the object appeared to be of a triangle shape.  He must of had some good binoculars, because I thought it looked to be oval. Again it was shimmering alot, so I couldn&apos;t see the exact outline of it.  At one point he said a different colored light on each end of the triangle came on.  A green one, yellow one, and I think he said a red one.  To me, the whole time it appeared to be a very vibrant ruby red shimmer.  When I saw it flashing on and off, he said that it was flipping.  The kind of flipping you would get from flipping a coin. From his distance, he said at arms length it appeared to be the size of his thumb.I can&apos;t explain the differences in our views of the shape, only that he may of had an advantage with using the binoculars.It was just an awesome sight to see!   When discussing its viewing with my husband later in the evening, he said the flight pattern of the airplanes seemed to have changed too, as if being diverted away at a further distance.  My son also commented at the time of the viewing that its strange we weren&apos;t seeing any jets being sent out to investigate.  Didn&apos;t anybody else see it??? I also remembered a few years back that a very similar object had been spotted in Montebello and Monterey Park Ca too.  It came out in the Montebello Newspaper.  I also found it posted on this site:http://www.100megsfree4.com/farshores/ufo03us6.htm If anyone else in this area seen the same thing, please post it!((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were carrying on a conversation when my wife interupted and asked me what the blinking light outside my passenger window was in the sky. I figured since it was in the sky it was a plane and ignored what she was looking at. Again, she asked me about the light and this time looking for it where she was pointing, it moved from us observing it from the passenger window of my car to the driver&apos;s side. Having caught my attention with the rapid rate of speed, what had me in awe was now it was stationary. We were unable to make out a shape due to the cloud cover, but the lights spread at a pattern to large to be a plane. They now appeared dirrectly above us as I drove into town. I found myself leaning as hard as I could on my steering wheel to observe these odd lights. The lights burst through the clouds reminding me of powerful spot lights or explosions, except the lights would flash in the exact same position in different patterns. The lights appeared to be a fire orange, but again more as a powerful spot light not a flame. Going from two to six to four, it changed constently flashing a different number of lights every second. I immediatley called a co-worker from my cell phone to see if he could see the ligths from the town to the east of us. Picking up his phone the first words were not hello, but &quot;What are those lights in the direction of your house?&quot;. Soon after the phone call the lights disappeared from what I could see, but the co-worker could still see them. I had turned around with no luck of resighting the strange lights. The next day I spoke with the co-worker and he advised he had seen the same type of pattern of lights. The only difference was that he described them in an orb shape. Another co-worker had heard the conversation and said she had seen the same type of orb shape with the same description of lights. I still am curious as to what could have caused not only a huge area of lighting, but to be able to move at the witnessed speed of the lights. Especially to come to a halt after the rapid speed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They did not seem to be on the lake but above the lake about 20 to 30 feet or more. There was a light in front and several different color lights that seemed to following the one in front. It did not make any noise. The lights did not all move at the same time but seemed to move in a chain like formation. The one in front moved and the others would then follow it. My wife said, &quot;What is that?&quot; I said joking that it was a UFO. The children were so frightened they clung to my wife and my mother-in-law. I thought it was a boat coming toward us. The lights continued slowly coming toward us. I also became frightened but I didn&apos;t let my family know. I thought it was going to continue directly toward us.

Across the street there was a high school football field with an old wood grandstand on the opposite side that faces the field and across to our house. Getting out of the car I heard an intermittent buzzing sound which seemed to come from the field. I thought it might be new sprinklers but the sound was odd so my curiosity was aroused. As I attempted to focus on the sound it shifted from the left to the center of the field and it also echoed off the grandstand. Audibly I realized it was off the ground. I looked up attempting to identify the source of the sound and I saw an object with multicolored lights that were flickering in a sort of rotating pattern.It appeared to have followed my car and was maneuvering in a tightening circle thus shortening its trajectory directly at me, and it was descending. I was awestruck long enough to observe subtle lights of green, red, blue and white on the bottom of the object. I have piloted a plane, boated, and I understand navigation lights well and these were not regular navigation lights. My hair stood on end as I was aware that I was likely witnessing a greatly advanced mechanical object. Suddenly, in sheer animal panic, I ran to the back porch of the house. I was really shaking as I fumbled with the key to unlock the door and the buzzing got louder indicating that it was getting closer yet. I rushed in and yelled at my parents who had been in bed a little while. They came out to the kitchen by the porch but the sound dissipated and they didn&apos;t hear it. Reflecting back, the object seemed rather small, perhaps smaller than my car.

Also two small flashing lights near the front, one on top of the other.    Object moved from southeast to northwest at a slow pace.  There was no sound.  I thought it may have been a plane or helicopter equiped with lights to advertise something at first but there was no sound and it was pretty close.  About 1000 in the air, and 9-10 blocks to the east of me.  Two lights in the front flashed white, they were stacked one on top and one on bottom.  The Four red lights pulsed slowly, fading out and comming back on.  It did not fit any aircaft to which I am famillar because of the configuration of the lights and their pulsing nature.  The shape was rectangular or Square like a four cornered box flying across the sky. The craft was low and did not head in the direction of the airport in pasco but kept moving northwest.", "white square object moving very fastThis thing was unlike anything I have ever seen. Instead of the disk shape and metalic color I&apos;m used to seeing this thing was square and white. I tried to watch it for changes but my husband couldn&apos;t get off of the road fast enough and it shot through the sky so fast it was gone by the time we got pulled over to the shoulder.When I first caught a glimps of it I thought it to be a bird but then I realized it was a totally square object and I thought; Oh my gosh! this isn&apos;t a bird, and what bird can fly as fast as a jet; which happened to be about the same height as it was.It was traveling across the area of the jet and went through the jet stream just after the jet passed. But then it shot away so fast it was gone.", "Classic UFO Flying Saucer seen in Mountains near JasperWell. I guess technically what I saw was NOT a UFO...becuase it was not flying. However, there is no other way for this object to get where it was.I live in a National Park in Canada. I commute each work day in and out of the park. I know this stretch of road very well. When you travel a route as often as I do...you recognize things that are not usual.On this particular day, the sky was fairly clear of clouds...and the sun would have been to the south at the time of my sighting. I&apos;m thinking the object would have been...as the crow flies...maybe 5 miles(8km&apos;s) from the highway. And up at the top of the mountains that surround our town.What I saw was the classical UFO Flying saucer. It was perched up behind 2 mountain peeks. Probably 2/3rds of this object was visible. It was VERY large. I suppose that if you were not from this area...and saw this thing..you may think it was some kind of manmade structure. But I assure you...there is NOTHING at the top of this Mountain Range. Not before my sighting...and not since.If I can find someone who can help me to measure the distance from the highway where I saw this object more accurately...or the distance between the 2 peeks where I viewed it...I will pass this information on to you.The thing that I find very curious about my sighting is what &apos;I&apos; did. Nothing. I just stared at it. In disbelief. I didn&apos;t even stop my car. I do not know how long it stayed there or which direction it flew to.But since that time...I have seen incredibly bright lights &apos;behind&apos; those peeks. I even took a pic with my digital but when I zoomed in on it...all you could see was distorted pixels. I keep my eyes posted on that hill on a daily basis now. I hope I&apos;ll be able to supply you with a REAL picture some day soon.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The lights were moving slowly across my rooftop from north to south, coming in from Dallas, TX (Waxahachie is about 35 miles south of Dallas). The two leading edges of the triangle were each lit with 12-14 white lights.  I could see no lights along the back (trailing) side of the craft. Movement appeared initially to be very slow.  So slow, in fact, that I first guessed these lights to be those of WWII planes from the Confederate air force flying in a tight formation.  I quickly discarded that hypothesis due to both the number of lights (estimate 25-28 total) and the precise distance of one from another. Just as the craft cleared my roofline it appeared to speed up radically.  Within 1/2 second it had vanished far to the south.  It made no noise whatever. I cannot estimate how high the craft or how fast it eventually was going.", "My sighting of two objects in Chicago, IL as a pre-teen in the early 50&apos;sThis event happened when I was a young boy, just pre-teen when I&apos;d guess I was about 12.  I&apos;m now 65 and want to leave this report before I can&apos;t.  This would put the event in the very early 50&apos;s. I lived in a south suburb of Chicago (on a small farm), about 20 miles SSW of downtown.  The township was Calumet Park, IL. One afternoon I was standing in the yard looking due North.  Suddenly coming out of the west there was a very high, extremely fast round object moving west to east.  The speed was unlike anything I had ever seen.  Many times that of the fastest plane.  From the ground the view angle was probably about 60 degrees.  From my distance it appeared to be about three or so times the size of a pin head held at arm&apos;s length.  When it was due north of my location it suddenly came to a stop, motionless.  It remained that way for several minutes. Then another identical object came from the East at the same blazing speed.  It came to a stop right by the other one.  Now there were two of the round objects together.  They hovered for a few minutes.  Then they went straight up, got smaller and smaller until I couldn&apos;t see them any more. There was no sound, no vapor or contrails.  The day was bright and clear, not a cloud in the sky.  No wind.  Just a perfect summer day.  I remember the temperature being plesant too, which would normally mean early summer or late,late spring.  In the above part of the form I&apos;m only guessing month-day-year.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Jackson exit, I noticed a round silver object coming from the right.  Object was pretty far away and high in the sky and seemed to stop over the interstate in the center of my view.  After about a minute of hovering in place it just vanished.

I too have witnessed the black teardrop or sphere shaped object. At first I too thought it was a black baloon and watched it for a few seconds but then it occured to me it was moving in a perfect straight line (PERFECT) no sound at all and very smooth, I was looking west and the sun was still up , the object was moving from the south heading north. I watched this thing until it got to far away and out of sight but I knew that it wasn&apos;t a baloon after I watched it longer, I am an ameture astronomer and am always looking up. I have never seen anything like it. Sure wish I had a pair of binoculars at the time I would like to know what it was or at least get a closer look because at first I dismissed as a baloon and that is when it was closest to me......((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I spotted an object fifty feet in the air as large as a house.I was driving back to where I was staying that night after dropping off a friend, I was driving up a road in Avon CT. when I saw a bright light up ahead, I thought this was unusual for this time of night. I proceeded up the road and when I got to where the light basically was coming from there was no light present, I looked arond in curiousity and discoverd an object the size of a house hovering about fifty feet in the air, It was basically a half moon and visability was good, this object was very dark and large, there were no lights on and it made no noise what so ever. I parked my car in the middle of the road and left it running with the lights on hoping someone would come down the road to witness this as well. I stood still in one spot staring at this object for about 5 min fearing what it would be capable of doing. I looked around and saw a house that had it&apos;s lights on so I ran over to it and knocked on the door, I waited for a couple of minutes but nobody answerd, I ran back to where my car was and the object was still there. I became so scared I jumped in my car and drove off quickly, as I went to the stop sign at the end of the road I looked up and the object had followed me all the way down the road, I turned to the left and saw the object was still following me, I floored the gas and never looked back again, it took me over a month to tell anyone else but eventually I told my parents, we ended up moving to an area basically right where this event occured and a neighbor saw the same thing almost one year to date later, she described the exact same event I witnessed.", "2 bright white lights moving away from the ground rapidly over the mountains of western PAmy fiance and I were watching a movie, with my children, outside on the lawn of her fathers house in the hills of Westmoreland county PA.  To the east over the mountains she and I witnessed 2 white sphere shaped lights equi-distance apart moving away from the ground in a north easterly direction.  They moved parallel to eachother and the event lasted 20-30 seconds.  I describe the event like a reverse shooting star as the lights were as bright as a night time star moving rapidly although not as fast as a shooting star.  the lights didnt fade but just stopped being visable.   Aircraft and sattelites in orbit are frequently spotted over this area, as the night sky is very dark and clear.  No aircraft were witnessed at the time of this sighting and no aircraft have ever been seen moving in such a manner as was witnessed.  The kids were watching the movie and didnt see the event which might have spooked them.   I&apos;m 37 my fiance is 27 and we&apos;ve never witnessed anything like this before.

They seemed to be moving towards us north to south at about tree top level, it&apos;s difficult to tell how far away they were because it was dark and overcast and we had no perspective.  As they moved slowly towards us they began to move, as if they were  rotating so that eventually they were aligned one on the top of the other, they then started to move away from us and slowly moved back to their origional position.  Their movement was so in sync and smooth not jerky at all, that perhaps they were attached to one large object.  After a couple minutes of moving away from us they simply vanished.

But I heard no truck or any noise at all, I had my back to the window but the whole apt. lite up very bright? A very strange penertating bright white light.

I ran out front and saw my dad just standing next to his car, door still open and just looking up. I watched him wondering then mom said &quot;don&apos;t you see it?&quot;  I looked around and there was a huge &quot;CIGAR&quot; shaped object just siting there above the tree line.  Not moving, in town, large cigar shaped object close enough to hit with a rock.  It disapeared, then reapeared on and off?  It was grey in color, it had port holes along the side kind of like egg shaped but you couldn&apos;t see in.  You got a very strong feeling that they were watching us.  Two other adults ran out as well over the noise that was made when mom first came in, everyone was quiet, speechless, just watching.  It tilted, it looked like sparks fell from the back (which is back?)It was visible then it would not be visible, this went on probably 10 mins. or so, just staring in awe and speechless.  Then it started to move, slowly toward the main st and toward Mazzio&apos;s Pizza across the street.  It tilted again, went invisible again, lit up and &quot;POOF&quot; it wss gone in a SE direction, so fast it just vanished when it left, or took off, no sounds or noise?

It was about 75 yards away from me and I would say it was about 50-75 yards above the ground.  I passed by some woods and the thing seemed to travel right over the tree tops and it traveled just as freely as I passed some fields.  It appeared to be lighted from within.  There were no visible external lights and it was slightly larger than a basketball in size when held at an arm&apos;s length.  I&apos;ve seen these spheres before, first time being in 1991 on my way home from work in the middle of the night.  Subsequent sightings took place while I lived in Florida and now I&apos;ve relocated back to upstate NY (my latest sighting).  After a few minutes, this sphere came close to my car as I drove and it kept pace with me.  It was as strange a sight just as the previous times. I&apos;ve made a few reports to this site before and I know that there really is something out there.
