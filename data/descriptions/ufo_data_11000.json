["A Triangle shape Reflection, appearing as watery glassI do not know what me and my son saw that evening. But it approached us from our left. Came across the highway. Crossed the hood of the truck and continued traveling to uor right. Before I describe this thing I must express the importance of our location. Hampton Tn is a small Appalacha town in the heart of the blue ridge Mtns very low populated. Where we were at it was grazing pastures and forrest. Even at this time of night there is not much traffic on the roads. What we saw was a reflection traveling on the ground. Triangle in shape, but this is the strange thing the reflection on the ground appeared glass like. It was sort of like in the superman movies wher the 3 super villians were taking away from krpton that thing that transported them. Very strange my son said we should report. I never would. Anyway here is this triangle reflection traveling on the ground cross over the hood and keeps going. So I got out to examine the area or to see if there was a logical answer for this there was none no house around to cause a reflection there are no trains in the area. The sky was clean. No helicopters in the air. It did not compare to a helicopter searchlight anyway because I know what they are like. Nothing if you could have seen this you would have said it appeared like watery glass.", "A yellow egg-shape object slowly decended behind a tree line west of my house.I was 8 or 9 at the time. I had gotten up to get a drink and when I came back to bed I saw a yellow egg-shaped object out my west window. It was slowly descending at about a 75 degree angle.  It passed behind a row of tall trees which were about 50 yards from our house. I could still see it through the trees and it looked as if it would land behind the horizon about half a mile away. Before it landed, I got really scare and hid under my covers and didn&apos;t see anymore..((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "White to yellow to orange light moving N or NW in the S. Wisconsin skyMy sister called me at 8:23 and said that her father in law in Belleville had seen something strange in the sky (west) and I should look outside my window.  I called my sister in law who lives in the same town as I do and went to her house to pick her up, arriving at 8:33.  We could see this bank of lights from her front porch, west, seemed to change (subtle) from white to yellow to orangish.  It was moving very slowly and seemed to be traveling north.  When I say &quot;bank of lights&quot; I mean horizontal and wide.  Comparing the size to a planet in the sky, it was about 6-8 planets of size, but maybe not quite as bright.  I can&apos;t say that I could necessarily count lights on it tho.  Just a bank of lights.  We got in my car and traveled toward New Glarus, watching it on the way.  We could see it up until we got over a high hill on the way to New Glarus just outside of Belleville, when we started to get down into the valley, we lost it and did not see it again.

Being an MP with the National Guard, I consider myself to be very attentive and aware of the unusual and out of the ordinary occurances within my view at all times. It was a very clear night, with light to no humidity, the moon was visable and 3/4 full. I noticed a semi-bright yellowish light hanging in the sky. It seemed to be stationary while comparing it with the moon which was about 3 feet away from the object.  We stared at it for quite sometime, about 25 to 30 minutes. During that time we noticed it move slowly to the left and remain stationary for a few minutes, then slowly to the right and remain stationary for a few minutes. It moved back and forth about 3 times, and on a straight horizontal path, no vertical movment at all. From my military experiance with roughly estimating distance to an object, I could tell it was no star, yet lower than an airplane would normaly be, and by movement, no airplane, helicopter or balloon of any type. And no known antenna towers in that direction of the Island. The low intensity and color of the light led me to beleive that it wasnt serving the purpose of a marker or for arial safty. The overall size of the light was about 3/8&apos;s of an inch when compared to my pinky finger at arms length.  For almost a two second time span, another light appeared to the left, as if it were turned up from a household dimmer switch, and was gone in an instant, the distance from the origonal light was roughly an inch, by perspective. My friend didnt notice the second light. The yellowish light was evenly illuminated, no bright or dim area, and no ring, or signs of any type of propulsion discharge or wake in its path. When I saw the second light come and go, I thaught they might be two baloonists and the second baloon was trying to gain altitude. Baloons are rare but not uncommon for the area. But the closeness of the two, and the consistent round ! shape an d duration of the second light ruled that out. After stareing at the unknown light for a while, and comming to no conclusions as of the source, other than that it wasnt going anywhere in a hurry, I told my friend of an occurance that happened many many years before, that involved the police from roughly 3 local countys giving pursuit of a slow moving object in the sky, which I beleive was first sighted and called in from a small single engine plane.  As for my background, I have four years of active military, and twelve years of National Guard, ten years as an MP with the Guard. For my friend of 4 years, he seems normal enough. We very seldom talk of UFO&apos;s or paranormal topics, as interesting as they may be.

Myself and another person was standing on the passenger side on the car facing East, with the other person standing on the drivers side of the car, faced West. We were out on the street, for approximatly 10 minutes.  I remember the sky being clear enough to see the stars and the approaching planes at near by Boeing Field.  As we were finishing up our conversation, the person on the drivers side of the car, looked up and pointed over our shoulders and said look.  We turned and saw a BRIGHT, ROUND, REDISH, ORANGE, UNFAMILIAR FLYING OBJECT, flying from West to East, fairly low.  It traveled in that direction for approx. a few seconds and then made a turn and started to travel in a NorthEastern direction.  It traveled N.E. for a few more seconds, we could clearly see it traveling across the sky, at that point I told the guys it was only a meteor falling from the sky, At that monment the craft made another sudden turn due North and increased speed and zipped away very, very fast.  One of the guys started running down the block to keep it in eyesight, but it faded out of view, as it flew away.  I made the comment that what ever it was, it could have easily have crossed the state within a minutes time, thats how fast it appeared to fly away. As an Ex-Navy Aviation Operations Yeoman, I&apos;ve seen various types of military Aircraft, including the F/A-18 and others.  For those planes to travel at their highest rate of speed, theres always an after blast/Sonic Boom.

My husband took the eldest son to the local shop, should have been away about 20 minutes. He did not return until about four hours later we were getting worried over the two of them.  Then he returned and we wanted to know where he had been, his reply was to the shop.  He did not realise how long he had been away.  Then my son started talking about where he had been, he described somemen and what I realised later was very much like the inside of a space ship.  He did say what the men had done but to be honest I cant remember that bit. This child was too young less than 3 years old at the time so he had no prior knowledge to draw from.  It has been on my mind ever since and I am glad that I have told you now at least I have shared the experience.  He was not harmed in any way but was always intelligent as a child.  Shortly after their return we saw an object in the sky it was a cigar shape at first but then it turned and was a cicular shape as you imagine a ufo really it turned and was gone in a flash.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

(can i say it another way???)  i noticed in the disc of the sun to the right side abd just lower than the centre of the sun, a long black object.  it was over a quarter of the suns radius and less than half.  it was slim and the feeling i got was that i saw it in profile.  ie.it was a disc shape on edge to me or cigar shaped...but not rounded like a cigar on the ends.  it tapered to the bottom like many of the famous disc shaped objects seen.  (i can&apos;t remember off hand any famous ones by name but the pics taken by the california highway worker on profile edge kind of do it justice.)  it was 8-10 times longer than high.  and tapered to the bottom, not evenly between bottom and top.  (can i say this in another way???) this was seen for about 15-20 minutes at the speed given before.  my feeling at the time was that it was way far away as it didn&apos;t move in relation to the sun.  this would mean a LARGE object way far away to not show any paralax in my moving observation.  or it was closer but moving at a relative speed between me and the sun but closer. frank edwards in his book &apos;FLYING SAUCERS: SERIOUS BUSINESS&apos; tells of an astronomer in mexico (book publ&apos;d in late &apos;60&apos;s &apos;70&apos;s) who saw streams of objects between him and the sun like i observed.  except i saw one... for some reason i didn&apos;t confirm with anyone else on the bus. i can write to you by snail mail with topographical maps so you can get coordinates on where exactly i was and a sketch of what i saw... i heard of y&apos;all on &apos;art bell&apos;  (where else?...) and thought it was the perfect place to tell...

As usual, I scanned the sky for lights, and saw the usual assortment of recognizable aircraft lights.  However, at my 1:00 position (approx. NW), I saw a group of three very white bright lights in a straight line, close enough to each other that my initial reaction was that they couldn&apos;t be separate aircraft.  They were also much lower than aircraft in the area typically fly.  As I continued west, I tried to gauge the object&apos;s motion relative to mine.  While I initially thought the object was travelling east, opposite me, it began a banking manouver which carried it perpendicularly across the highway directly in front of me, approximately 1/4 mile away, and only a couple of hundred feet up at most.  Though it was night, there was more than enough ambient lighting from the surrounding area, so as the object crossed my path while banked to it&apos;s right side I could see it&apos;s bottom, which was a black diamond shape, with three bright white lights across it.  There were no discernable wings - it was as though I was looking at a large, black kite.  Two of the lights were at opposite points of the diamond, with the third in the middle.  Since the object was banked over, the three lights were in a vertical line.  The object continued it&apos;s turn, then levelled out at treetop height and continued westbound towards the Hudson River, paralleling the highway but on the other side from me.  My exit came up and I pulled off, then watched until the object left my field of view. When I first observed the craft, I called my girlfriend at home (appox. 2 miles from my position) intending to ask her to go outside and look for the object.  When she answered I didn&apos;t have a chance to ask, as right away she started telling me that she was watching an object from the house.  We agreed that it was the same craft, and she was able to view it for a minute or two after it left my view.  She had initially noticed it through the living room window, due to it&apos;s bright, unusually configured lights and low altitude. Though I&apos;ve always believed that our planet is (and has been throughout history) visited by extraterrestrials, I&apos;ve never witnessed anything like this myself.  This area of the Hudson Valley is known for many sightings, particularly during the early 1980&apos;s.  Having spent five years in the Air Force with a keen interest and familiarity with most types of aircraft, I know that what I saw was not a conventional aircraft.  This was not an instance of ambigous/anomalous lights in the sky.  I saw a distinct shape to the object.  Furthermore, it&apos;s flight characteristics were unusual.  Not in the sense of speed or extreme manouverability, but more regarding it&apos;s flight path.  Even if, for arguements sake, it was a military aircraft of unconventional design (Stewart AFB is nearby), I can&apos;t understand why it would fly so low as it crossed over a heavily travelled interstate highway, then descend to treetop level and parallel the road... As soon as I got home I continued to search the sky for another glimpse, and turned on the scanners, all in vain.  The morning paper didn&apos;t carry any stories about it, but hopefully others saw it and will report their sighting(s).

At about 45-60 degrees from the horizon, on a very dark morning (prior to sunrise) I spotted a huge perfectly shaped rectangular object glowing with white light. It was startling since this is a rural area and their are no large buildings nor large lights of any kind even close to this area of Denmark. I pointed this object out to both the driver (a Dane) and another American in the back seat. As we continued to drive to work we all searched for expanations for what we were seeing, with no clue whatsoever. We observed this object for about 5-6 minutes at which time it seemed to collapse from both the top and bottom (long sides of the rectangle) while still maintaining a clearly defined shape, until it vanished. The Dane who was driving was just as flabergasted as we were at this sight and checked the local radio and television news shows, as well as newspapers for any reports, but their were none. We also noted at the time that the position of the moon made it impossible to make it any type of reflection or moonglow through the clouds. We also tracked the position of the moon the remainder of the week while travelling the same route to work, and each day it was not even remotely close to where we had seen this object.

I would say it was probably a half mile up in the sky and about a half mile away from where I witnessed it. This  &quot;object&quot; was moving so slow! If it were a plane, it would have fell from the sky! No planes fly this slow. I couldn&apos;t beleive it! Its lights were not blinking or rotating. They were solid red and stayed in the same posistion for the duration that I witnessed it. When I first saw it, It was just a red light in the sky that was slowly getting closer to me as time passed. As it got closer into view, I could easily make out its shape. It passed my view roughly a half mile from me. Last night was a chilly night with absolutely no wind at all. It was completely still outside except for the very faint sound of occasional traffic in the distance from the interstate. If it had any moving parts or a combustable engine on it...I would have heard it! With the angle that I had witnessed this (about 30 degrees), it was a solid object, and the diamond shape of it was very distinct. After it passed out of my view I ran outside to get another perspective while I still had the chance and was able to witness it again for about another 10 seconds as it silently passed out of my view for good. I do live in a city which has a lot of Military and flying aircraft which practice out of Oceana Naval Air Station which is is the general direction that this &quot;object&quot; was heading, but I see and hear these jets all the time as anyone who lives near me will say too. This was not a fighter jet! Nor was it a helicopter. Before I witnessed this &quot;object&quot;, I could hear plain as day other aircraft in the far distances which were miles away! This thing was within &quot;rifle range&quot; of me and wasn&apos;t making a sound. Every aircraft that I have ever seen in my lifetime has had at least one blinking (beacon) light on it, and/or at least one white light. What kind of &quot;craft&quot; flies around with 4 solid red lights on it, and no beacon light?! Lastly, and most certainly, I mentioned that this &quot;object&quot; was roughly travelling over the interstate highway...well the vehicles which were occasionally travelling in the same direction as this thing (east/southeast) were moving much faster in the same general direction than the &quot;object&quot;!

This sight was moving slightly from North to South as it descended, and I thought I was witnessing a plane crashing. Then to my astonishment, it stopped falling,stabilized [from the wobbling motion], and the [13] spurting tongues of orange flame I had observed, stopped licking out of their round-cornered, rectangular apertures, beginning to pulsate as colours changed to a hot electric blue-white light [behind the rectangular apertures,now].From this condition, the flame colours licked out again as orange coloured and returned to blue-white several times.When in the blue-white mode, where they ultimately remained, they always appeared to be behind the apertures, glowing calmly. All of this took place as I drove directly toward the thing&apos;s stationary position, later determined to be slightly South of the Conshohocken exit of the expressway.As I proceded closer to its location, the object could be seen to have a top side something like the tapering crown of a Mexican Sombrero, discernible by vertical windows suggesting that shape. These gave the appearance of back-lighted milk glass,with a steady non-kinetic light source, unlike the other lights aforedescribed. Those flame-lights were arranged around the lower edge of the object, ringing an apparently circular form at its bottom edge. Suddenly, as I approached more closely, the object took off at high speed, directly away from me, seemingly going from a standstill to perhaps 500 MPH, giving me the odd impression that it did not go through any intermediate speeds.At this point, I began to wonder if I indeed was seeing some new kind of plane going away with over a dozen engines, the rear of which I was observing.Then, without turning it came straight back to its former position, like a yo-yo returning to one&apos;s finger, and I knew this was no airplane! Still driving, by now I was almost under what I estimated to be its position, about 300-400 feet off the ground, at the exit area previously mentioned. Deciding to investigate further, I pulled onto the road shoulder when I estimated it was directly above me. At first, looking up, I saw nothing and thought it had somehow moved without my noticing it. Then I realized otherwise. It was a clear starry night and above me the sky was pure black for an area which I believe was 300-400 feet in diameter at the height I estimated for it. From beneath there was no trace of the perimeter flame illuminations, from which I concluded that their observed apertures were atop the bottom surface of what apparently was a gigantic discus-shaped object. The foregoing represent all of my observations. I exited the expressway at Coshohocken with the intention of stopping at the gas stations there to alert them to what was emplaced above them, but for some strange reason, I felt powerless to do as I had planned and felt directed to go straight home. When arriving there, I called The Norristown newspaper, The Philadelphia Inquirer and Willow Grove Naval Air Station to report this situation ,but was treated in all cases in a patronizing way as if I was to be more pitied than believed. After this, I took my wife and son with me to see this object, but By the time we arrived, it was no longer there,and they kidded me mercilessly on the way home . Nonetheless, I saw what I described to you and have no doubts whatsoever about it, since I had the luxury of observing this &quot;UFO&quot; continuously for 15 minutes, or more. My overall impression was that I had seen a craft whose propulsion engines were malfunctioning as it fell,that these engines were brought back to normal function when it stabilized, and that they were revved up and down for testing as it stayed in place and were then tested further with the out and back flight which appeared to me to cover approximately 5 miles from Conshohocken to King of Prussia ,PA and return.", "I saw 6 bright lights with blue triangular lights between them on a triagular shaped object hovering low in the sky.Driving west on Long Ridge Road, I witnessed a series of six bright white lights hovering in the sky.

San Jose.Here at work in San Jose on the 5th floor my coworker came over to my cubicle and told me to look out the window and check out this thing.  We looked out the window and nothing was there.  He hurried me to the otherside of the building and I saw what looked to be a black helium baloon slowly rising.  I told him that it was a black baloon that someone had lost.  He then said &quot;wait, just look at it&quot;.  I looked a few more seconds and realized that all of a sudden it was either much closer or it had expanded.  It was no longer a small looking baloon but an ablong egg-shaped ojbect floating end over end.  It appeared to be the size of a large van, not quite shaped like a cigar but not as round as an egg.  It was all black and possibly shiny on one side as it tumbled in the air or it was polished on all sides.  It tumbled more or less as if something in space out of control end over end.  It continued to rise and then accelerated rather fast and shortly disappeared heading south of San Jose while continuing to rise.  Within seconds it was gone.  There&apos;s absolutely no way it was a helicopter or another such aircraft.  It was positively all black, nothing protruding, and possibly changing shape.  The reason why I say possibly changing shape is because it was to me quite obvious that it was a round baloon.  Then all of a sudden it was much larger and elongated.

The flying objects flew in various formations first in circles then in a line at a 90degree angle going straight &amp; upwards, then all six objects went into a circular motion.After a while they form another formation by &quot;falling sideways&quot; at a  slant of 45 degrees with the the 1st from the top till the fifith objects moving and the sixth (bottom most) remaining stationary. After that they went back to a perpendicular position, evenly spacing themselves out.The scene was more &quot;entertaining&quot; than intimidating with all the 38 kids (most of them orphans &amp; some from poor or broken homes. Next, three of them formed a straight line and the remaining three formed a circle, then the three objects that formed a circle converged into one, appearing like a small letter &quot;i&quot;. Then all the 6 flying objects remained stationery prancing around in all kinds of formation emitting bright orange lights.I took some snapshots using the school&apos;s compact camera.As it is now &quot;festival holidays&quot; for the Chinese Lunar &quot;New Year&quot;, I am unable to develop the negatives. There are six teachers and 38 students here and all of us were standing in the school field to witness the phenomena.

I sat out for a few minutes, but decided to go in because of the cold MN temperatures.  On my way back into the house, i noticed a brightness coming from behind me.  I thought it may have been my neighbor&apos;s motion-activated floodlights, but when i turned around, the lights were off.  The neighbor to the east&apos;s horses were also riled up.  i coudl hear them running around and making noise.  When i brought my eyes to the sky, i saw two triangular shaped glowing objects.  there was definately light coming from them, but not from any specific source.  It was more as if the craft itself emitted the glow.  They zoomed southward across the sky, encircling each other, then zoomed  away further into the east.  They were not so much a color as they were a light.  But if there is any color they&apos;d be, i&apos;d say a silver, blueish color.  i can&apos;t say for sure how big they were, seeing as they were far away.  Definately bigger than any car or bus, though, i&apos;d say.  And maybe it was because i was so fixated on them, but for some reason, when i saw them, the cold air seemed to dissappear.", "Unidentified Silent Aircraft near Lemoore AirForce BaseA friend and I were traveling back from San Francisco on Friday, February 16, 2001 and on our trip we both saw something that was really weird... We were on the I-5 going south and we realized we had gone to far south of Fresno (where I live) when we hit the 198 going east/west.  Realizing our mistake we got on 198 heading east towards Hanford with the intention of transferring to the 99 Northbound in Hanford and heading back up to Fresno.  However, about halfway there (not far from the Lemoore Airbase, I found out) I saw something out the window that made me do a double take. I saw several pale &apos;twinkle&apos; lights like those seen on airplanes and helicopters, however they were all white (no red or blue or green) and there were several beams of pale light moving across the ground.  My very first impression was that there were 3 helicopters flying in very tight formation using spotlights to look for something....  my next thought was that maybe it was a crop duster or something doing some sort of night job... but after a few seconds I realized that neither of these were correct.... I pointed it out to  my friend (who was driving) as it was out his window (to the north) and I think maybe less than 100 feet off the ground... and it seemed to be moving very slowly and gracefully.... it then arced upward and turned back towards the freeway (coming south) that we were on and as it passed overhead I managed to see a really faint silhouette against the black night sky... I could barely make out an airplane shape with very long thin wings and large, ellipsoid shaped bulbs at the tips of both wings... and as it flew overhead there was absolutely no sound whatsoever...  it then performed a very graceful but tight turn and flew back over the freeway again (this time heading north) and as it flew over the field to our left I saw again 3 faint, silvery nimbus&apos;s of light (almost like searchlights) coming from what looked like the underside of the nose and the 2 ellipsoid shapes at the tip of the wings, and the light app! ared to be sweeping back and forth over the ground.  At this point I was really excited because I had never seen anything like it before. My friend told me to dig the camera out from the backseat and try and take pictures of it... so I dug around in the back really quickly and by the time I got it ready, the object had once again flown over us and was pacing us to the right (south of 198 heading east in the same direction as us) maybe a quarter of a mile out and a hundred or so feet off the ground...  I then attempted to take several pictures... but as the craft was completely dark and there was no real light reflections the only thing I could see were its steady blinking lights... So I tried to time it as best I could to try and capture a picture when the lights were actually on instead of off, but as I write this I don&apos;t know how they&apos;ve turned out...  However I&apos;m pretty sure its not a UFO but some sort of secret plane from the Lemoore Airbase... and I was wondering if I draw a picture of what I think I saw, do you know someone who might be able to tell me what I saw based upon its outline and its behavior...??  My friend thinks it was maybe an A-10 Tank-killer, because what he saw differs from what I saw by a little... however, I don&apos;t think this is correct because of the 3 lights and the fact that it made no sound at all... So anyhow, I am trying to find out if the plane is something common or if it is might be one of the top secret ones that you hear about (like the aurora)...((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness.  He seems to have ruled out most possible explanations for the sighting, and he apparently will speak with personnel from Lemoore Air Base in the near future.

I listened to this for approximately 10 minutes then decided to go outside to see if I could see anything.  I first looked at at sky in the front of my house and noticed alot of small aircraft flying (which is not unusual).  I then turned around to look behind the house and still did not notice any jets or anything that could be making such a loud roar.  But I did however notice that the stars looked very funny and continued to look thinking to myself that I had never seen them look quite that way before. They were red.  So, I then decided to turn back around and look in front again which is east, and as I did suddenly a big orange light appeared just above where I was standing.  Instantly I thought oh my gosh its a UFO. No sooner then I had that thought another big orange light appeared just to the right of the other. They were very big and just right there not far away. I did not see a spaceship just very big bright orange lights right above me that were stationary and possible some sort of beam.", "VT,Moretown-VERY BRIGHT greenish(?)

After walking along my property on the shoreline, I came to a road, which was once a highway, but now broken by the erosion.  I stood, looking in the dim light at the waves breaking and the driftwood being beaten on shore.  All of a sudden, I noticed a deep green glow.  I don&apos;t know exactly how it first caught my eye, but it became more and more apparent.  The intensity grew... and the deep green turned into an electric... or an increasing radiant green.  I was standing at North Cove of Willapa bay on SW Washington.  I was now looking into the entire 110 sq. mile bay.  The Hills at 2:30 AM were brightening and visible unlike anything I had ever seen in the daylight.  This light compelled me to look around.  I was wearing a baseball type hat.  Apparently, the brim of the hat kept me from seeing what I finally saw because I had to look.  Fifteen to twenty seconds into this electric green light intensifying experience, I finally looked up.  Through an opaque cloud cover, and over the moonlight, I saw a silver fireball.  (thinking, how could a silver fireball produce a green light?  But it was the way I recorded it.)  This object, from where I was standing, was as large as the moon, but moving downward from horizontal at about 15 degrees, and to the north (left to right)...  There was a period where I wasn&apos;t aware of any object, but saw some ground effect. Then there was the time I moved my attention to the object.  The total duration of the visual experience was around 20 seconds.  In retrospect, I&apos;d divide the time to half observing ground light, and the other half to observing the object.  I have seen magnesium burn before.  The ligh emmissions of this object were magnesium like.  It trailed at a slight angle, from where I looked, located half way between Seattle and Portland. It looked to be a long way off and moving very fast.  Then it went dark.  As I pondered in the instant what had happened, I turned from the edge of the road and began walking up it towards a building I owned, located some several hundred feet away.  About a minute and a half after I started walking, about the time I was ajacent the structure, there came a crash which nearly knocked me off my feet. It so happens that I tuned into Art Bell the night after and heard him ask if anyone had any information on a sighting in the NW.  Two men from Everett Washington called, stating they had been out on break in the middle of the night when they saw this flash in the sky. Now understand this.  It was a miserable winter night.  No one had any reason to be out.  I was only out because of extenuating circumstances dealing with erosion on my property. Calling in the same hour I saw it, local law enforcement called it &quot;some loud thunder&quot;. As I understand, subsequent to the experience, something hit the Gig Harbor area.  My personal feelings are that this thing came into the atmosphere around Portland, heading north/northwest.  Given the 150 mile covered in 20 seconds,  I&apos;d estimate it&apos;s speed between 25 and 30 thousand miles per hour.

I heard truckers on channel 19 on the CB saying things like &quot;What the *** is that?&quot;, &quot;Sh**, I know I haven&apos;t drank tonight, please someone tell me what the *** that thing is&quot;, &quot;that is no *** airplane&quot;, etc...channel 19 was running like a mad house with profanity. the lights went out at the truck stop at the same time it disappeared, and the trucks, all the trucks lost power too, all electronic equipment was shut off for approximately 5-10 seconds while the &quot;craft&quot; disappeared&quot;...the craft just shut off it&apos;s light the way it looked, but it was gone. After the lights came back on, we saw many helicopters in the skies surrounding the area which normally was not that heavy with aircraft traffic at that time of night.", "Large Mining UFO mining resourses on EarthWas at girls slumber party summer of 1967. Sleeping on the grass. All the girls except one stayed out with me, it got too cold for the rest so they retreated to the family room.  All I remeber was talking about all the stars, and how we are ants in an aquarian for others to watch. We decided to go into the house and get a drink. My companion and I looked out the window and spotted the savirical ship, it was gray metallinc in color, with a set of circular cube lights on top. The squares on the top were large and one blinked on and then the next. They were multiple colors. It gave the ship the appearence that it was spinning, but it was not. One light would go on and then the next in a sequence around the ship.  My friend and I went out on the porch to look at it.  I was amazed at how large it was.  I would have to guess about 3 football fields. Some of the other girls looked but freaked when they say it.  I stood on the porch and watched, when suddenly an extremely intense blue white light came from the center, bottom of the ship and hit the ground.  We all became frighted after that and hid in the house.  We told parents the next day, but no one believed us, we were only 14 at the time. We did report it to the airforce, and police, but no response.  The part that scared me the most was the small spheres of light that came to my window two summers after I had seen the UFO.  I knew they wanted me to come out, but I was so scarred I hid.  I have since ran into people that have similar experiences, especially the glowing balls outside there window that seem to becon one to come with it..I also remember knowing somehow that this ship was a minning ship and that it was minning quaritze crystals.  I remember telling my mom to buy all the quaritze she could find because it would be very valuable some day.  I also remember that there may have been missing time envoled, but I have never found anyone that could do regressive hypnosysis.

We were coming up on a stop sign, when out of the eastern sky came this huge fireball, it seemed to have come from nowhere, it fell to the ground in a wooded area.  As we passed by where it would have fell to, there was no lights or explosion, so we thought it could not have been a plane crash landing.

Somebody set up us the bomb. Take off every Zig.We were standing on the strip just south of the Stratosphere Tower on Las Vegas Blvd.  We looked up and saw a large, metallic object.  It had flashing lights which had a definite sequence to them. There were about 10 lights in all.  They alternated in their flashing sequence from right to left as best we could tell.  The UFO must have been 10000 feet or greater.  The visibility was clear.  It moved up and down and then side to side in an &quot;A&quot; type motion.  It changed altitudes quite rapidly and began moving in an &quot;Y&quot; pattern.  After a little hovering, it moved in a &quot;B&quot; pattern. Then back to &quot;A&quot;.  Then back to a &quot;B&quot; pattern.  It then moved like a &quot;T&quot;, before performing a &quot;U&quot; maneuver and then shooting off in the sky at a high rate of speed.

One incident was a firework display ona city beach the objects were observed by hundreds of people and hardly even commented on. They travelled slowly across the night sky, formed a triangle and then some manouvres then disappeared. They were also seen by my sister and many other people that we spoke to. Each time the behaviour was similar. The glowing golden objects travelled ina perfectly spaced file across the sky out over the sea. They would then manouver into traiangles and other shapes and then either disapear or rocket off at a great speed. On the local radio a man confessed to having released hundreds of orange garbage bag fire powered devices off at various localities. What a psycho - he must have spent a fortune and to what avail? I myself saw on separate occasions, examples of both types of objects. The pyro devices were erratic in behaviour and it was quite obvious to any viewer as to what they were as they flickered and drifted rising and falling. I saw the latter objects on the night of the lunar eclipse. The other orbs travelled in lines straight and at a constant speed not in any erratic fashion at all. We all think that the orbs were some kind of military test.

We tracked the movement of the sound with our heads, but saw nothing.  It passed by right in front of us without a visual blemish on the starlit sky.  Most unusual was the noise: Two noises actually.  One was the sound of a spinning rotor with a gentle swoosh of a ceiling fan, not a chopping or clapping helicopter-type noise.  The other, more subtle noise was that of polished metal grinding against metal with only slight friction.  But that was it, no sound of a engine, powerplant, propwash, or any sound usually associated with known aircraft. My friend and I were stunned, both of us had the same reaction to and recollection of the event.  We are both atheists, do not believe in ghosts, superstitions, or ET&apos;s.  I believe that we witnessed a man-made aircraft of unknown origin using unknown technology.

I looked to the sky to compare the many other stars on this clear night and this was about ten times the size of star and appeared to have the shape of a diamond. From my driveway the light or object was not blinking nor did it have any color distortion and seemed to be close in vicinity of my home. The moon was low and the object in perspective was seemingly above a rooftop. I wanted to verify if it had any movement so I gauged it next to a tree limb. It moved up and down slightly within seconds when I had it positioned in the tree.

It seemed to be unusually dark in this area of the overpass at Westpark &amp; Kirby (near the midsize electricity plant). It was larger than I previously thought and it seemed to move quite fast in front and away from me going west. At one point I thought I would lose it so I sped up eventually driving around 60 mph passing red lights. On Westpark underneath the 59 overpass I noticed a helicopter flying low coming from the south, going north, the light then dimmed, became hazy and barely visible when the helicopter passed. I pulled into a parking lot on Rice Street and Westpark, to observe the object. Once the low flying, low speed helicopter passed that area, the object dimmed and suddenly disappeared, I assumed it traveled at high rate of speed heading west which made it impossible to see.  This occurred less than a half mile from my home. Upon arriving home the object was no longer in the sky near the tree branch where I had first had seen it.

IIt moved accross the sky at too high a rate of speed to be one though. It came to a stop and hovered at what I would estimate to be between 3-8 thousand feet. it was a vertical shaft of white/yellow light with a red light shaped like an upside down horseshoe at the bottom. it pulsated and dimed. when bright it had a triangular shaped light near the top. it made no sound as it moved. it stayed in it&apos;s hover and sometimes turned, bobbed around and weaved. then i noticed further away another one with a similar shape and color pattern. at times these ufo&apos;s alighned themselves at the same angles as if in formation. they stayed like this for approximately 2 hours before i saw what i thought was some sort of helicopter or plane comeing to check them out. it turned out to be another craft that was more square in shape and seemed to sparkle or light up at a more rapid rate. this smaller craft seemed lower to the ground, maybe around 2-3 thousand feet. what was striking about all of this is that it was a fairly cloudy night, but when the ufo&apos;s were presant the clouds seemed to part the same way a boat makes a wake behind it. dogs in the neighborhood were howling as this was taking place. these ufo&apos;s could move in any direction and made no sound. the sky/clouds seemed to take on a reddish hue when they were lit. they would dim themselves then get bright again. they left after a few hours then came back at around 3-4am ...same cloud wake, same position in the sky...right before they left the one closest to me seemed to approach the other farther away then they dissapeared. it was the greatest thing i ever saw in my life and i will go to my grave believing that what i saw could not be of this earth.", "Strange light changing size &amp; making zig-zag movements.We were standing outside in our backyard observing the stars as it was a perfectly clear warm summers night. We were facing south, and in the background are hills and Mt Wainui and in the foreground are trees to our left and to our right. We noticed a point of light in the sky facing due south at about an angle of 55 degrees. It was the behaviour of this &apos;point of light&apos; that caught my eye. When I first observed it, it was about the size of the star Canopus. It was only seconds after this that it rapidly expanded in size and brightness to the size of about my fist held straight out in front of me and the suddenly shrunk rapidly back to a small point of light, smaller then what it was to begin with. It then proceeded to peform unbelievable maneuvers, climbing vertically and down again, turning at right angles and moving in a zig-zag fashion at incredible speeds as if intelligently controlled. It eventually disappeared moving at high speed in a SSE direction. I love observing the sky and have been stargazing for years so I can quite confidently say that it was not a plane, helicopter, weather balloon, satellite, planet, shooting star or meteorite. There is a flight path that passes over us from Wellington and a small aerodrome about a kilometer west of us so I&apos;m 100% sure it wasn&apos;t a plane, as all planes that pass over are easily identifiable.

I recall men, dressed in black, that used to take me out of my room at night while my parents slept.  They would perform tests on me and it was most always on my spinal cord.  If I tried to scream out and wake my parents, the dark doctors would leave before my father could find a trace of them.

The weather had a slight ground breeze and there was a slight haze in various areas of the skies due to airplane exhaust.  Other than that the view was well over 250 miles. I was sitting in the passenger seat and was commenting on the streaks of airplane contrails that were going east to west and vice-versa. I noticed a large 767 that was flying at about 40,000 ft going west to east just cross over and above a 737 going from east to west and was commenting about that also.  Then I noticed a larger than the 767 white object appearing to be stationary in the sky directly overhead.  I asked my wife to pull over and we observed the object for about 5 minutes as it slowly crawled across the sky at an estimated altitude of approx 50,000 to 60,000 ft.  It was not shining and was pure white.  It initially appeared to have small stubby like wings coming from the oval body but that was lost as the item was moving straight easterly from us. I noted the time of initial sighting @ 1105hrs and we were stopped by the side of the road for exactly 5 minutes watching the object.  We were stopped only 500 yards from the Prescott Airport (small planes only).  There is also a FAA VFR station approximately 10 miles NW of the airport.  There were a lot of commericial flights going east to west and vice-versa but those plane configurations were noticeable and identifiable.  I asked that we start driving North on Hwy 89 back to our homes at 1106 hrs and I watched the object as we progressed northward.  By the one mile mark past were we had stopped previously, the object not only had continued easterly but also had shifted to southernly view point.  That told me that the object was semi-stationary and since we were the ones moving that explained the object appearing to be more in the southern view. As we continued to drive north to our home, hoping to get a camera, the object was lost above one of the haze clouds from the lower flying aircraft.  I attempted to continue to track the projected course of the object but at approximately 1111 hrs I could no longer see any objects even in the clear patches.", "Little lights flew in circles next to black dots.

At first we thought it was the beginning of a storm but the flash occured again though this time it had beams of light that shot out like spotlights. The beams and light zipped thru the clouds and behind some trees. We followed to see if a small plane had come down. As we got closer we could see light illuminating thru the trees and we proceeded to exit the car. As we got out of the car the lights lifted and rose above the tree line directly in front of us and then above us. To our shock we saw a sphere like craft with white and red pulsating lights about the size of a garage. We could make out from the light beams designs in the metal. The craft paused above us then spun furiously and shot straight up into the clouds again and headed north. We could see the lights still in the clouds as it ascended and left into the distance. This was no military craft that we have ever seen before. But with living near an airforce base we chose to believe maybe it was something experimental. We took long stares at each other and were quiet on the way home.

I think it was watching me make Christmas cookies.", "Sighted a triangle object, dark moving at a tremendous speed, silently out of sight past the horizon in 5 seconds.Friday night at about 11:00 pm I saw the strangest thing while looking at the night sky. Looking straight up I saw a line of light in the sky that my first reaction was that Oh its a shooting star. But the light didn&apos;t fade out like a shooting star would and the light didn&apos;t move in a downward motion but in a horizontal movement across the sky. Then I realized I&apos;m looking at lit up side or a reflecting side or edge of an object. My next reaction was that I must be seeing an owl gliding across the night sky trying to rationalize this when I immediately realized this is no owl. I could make out the sides of a 3 sided object dark as the night sky itself but the sides were just barely visible. I felt that rather then looking at just a dark object, not lit up that I felt it was camouflaged to the night sky. I don&apos;t know how to explain that but that&apos;s a feeling that went through me. My reaction in a split second was &quot;how sneaky this thing is&quot;. I want to say it was not lit, it seemed as black and void as the night sky, but I was able to make out the 3 sides. I&apos;m not sure if it was reflections or actual lights very dim that shown its form, but I could make out its shape. No doubt though at what I was seeing even as quick as it was I was able to get a clear view and take it all in. 3 sided, like a guitar pick shape.When it passed in front of the stars the shape was also that much more easier to decern. Heading west to east. When it was out of sight I even thought to hold my hand out in the sky to try to judge the size it took up in the sky. When I held my hand out I would say that it was the size of half of my hand size. It was not a far off object I was looking at. Marine helicopters fly through this corridor daily heading for The Miramar Base, this object seemed to be moving at about that or  just above that height that the helicopters fly at. What that elevation is I dont know but that is the best way for me to judge what height in the sky the object seemed to be. Not a sound, and because there was no sound ! and it m oved at a tremendous speed my mind was searching for a different word then flying. It was one of those things where if you weren&apos;t looking in just the right spot at the right time you would never have seen it, it was so stealthy. I saw it from directly over my head and disappear past the mountains in the east 10 miles away in 5 seconds. Once it was out of sight I stood staring at the sky for another 15 minutes trying to understand what the heck could it have been and thinking perhaps I might see it again. The frustration of not being able to understand what could be that shape, that quiet, that dark and move at that rate of speed, made me not even want to think about it at all until I spoke to my wife about it the next day. I couldn&apos;t fit it into a box in my mind or relate it to anything Ive ever seen, and that can be frustrating. Do we have something that can move at night like this ? If we dont then someone does, there is NO doubt about that in my mind now. I&apos;m sending a little drawing of how it looked to me as I looked up at what I would guess was its underside. Side A is the edge I first noticed glimmering that I thought was a line of light in the sky that was a shooting star. Side B would be the side closest to me looking up and the front was the portion of the object that was at the head of it moving towards the east.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent, lucid in his description of the object he allegedly witnessed, and able to describe it precisely.

The object dipeed down, with very quick &amp; precise movements, it quickly moved from the left to the right, it made circular motions, and it changed direction. I could tell when it turned towards another direction, because i could see less of the yellow  band of light.

I did have a witness who saw the incident with me, but to date we are the only ones I know of. As we stood talking in the front yard of his Orange Park home one Fall evening, the sky was virtually clear with only a few clouds around (few and far between). I noticed something in the sky that at first came to my mind as two birds flying directly over his house reflecting the light from his front porch. I then realized first off that it was not birds, then, that it was not close enough to the house to be reflecting the light. The objects, themselves were no brighter than the stars around them and they left no discernable trail behind them. They flew side by side, then in a uniform move they crossed paths and continued on in the same direction (East to West) and in what seemed to be the same distance apart that they had been before they crossed paths. They continued on in this formation until they were out of sight over my friends rooftop. The whole incident took only a few seconds, but my mind raced to try to explain to my senses exactly what I was observing. To this day I am not at all sure what it was, but as I said my friend and I were the only ones to date to have seen the sight. I thought also in the few seconds of the occurence that it might be shooting stars but, they did not fade from view and the maneuvers were too precise and calculated.

It was much smaller now, very close to the horizion and I could see that it was moving very fast, it was not leaving a vapor trail but it was still glowing very bright. We were coming up on a thunderhead and our flight went to the left of it. The UFO went to the right of the thunderhead at 8:25 PM. When we got around it the UFO was gone and I never saw it again. At 8:30 PM another airliner passed about 2000 feet below us, this winged aircraft was plainly visible and not the same type of craft I had just witnessed.((NUFORC Note:  One of several sighting reports submitted by same source.

It was not like the &quot;monilith&quot; of 2001 but was more the size of a large N.Y.C. skyscraper. It had no features, but was quite obviously not a shadow of a crator and looked very unnatural. There were no reflections on it&apos;s surface. As the moon made it&apos;s way across the sky we checked to see if the object changed position. It did not- it was still on the moon and in the same place(we noted the position based on craters). My two witnesses were as unable as I to explain what we had seen. The next day, it was not there.", "Triangle and jet &apos;stuck&apos; behind cloud meet behind cloud and only jet emergesI was sitting in my room and I looked out my windows which faces east and I could see that it was a perfectly clear day apart from two clouds.  Both clouds were in the east and one was the apparent size of a thumb, the other half this size.  I also noticed that the vapour trail of a jet was stretching from roughly the SE to NW and its leading end was obscured by the smaller cloud.  It is always my natural reaction to watch, for a few seconds, the passing of a jet as it goes overhead but as yet this jet had not moved from behind the small cloud.  It should have taken a second or less for a jet to travel the apparent width of this tiny cloud.  After maybe ten seconds I was expecting to see burning pieces of jet fall from the sky as this was the only reason I could come up with as to why this jet had apparently stopped.  Time went by, maybe 20-30 secs, I can&apos;t remember the time scale that well because I was just astounded that the jet seemed to have stopped.  Then I saw what looked like a triangular object, an isoceles possibly moving in a smoothly curving path from a point which was many degrees above and to the right of this small cloud.  It&apos;s apparent size was 2 or 3 times that of a jet, its surface was not smooth but appeared to have details which were beyond my vision.  It had no vapour trail and it moved faster than a jet possibly twice the speed, it is hard to compare since it moved in a long arc.  At this point I was aware that something extremely mad was happening and that something weird was going to happen.  This object, which seemed to appear from nowhere was swooping its way towards this little cloud where a jet was apparently stuck.  Incidentally the jet was still &apos;stuck&apos; while this thing was making its way.  Obviously my heart was beating fast and my jaw was hanging and various expletives were repeating themselves in my head.  Anyway, as soon as the object disappeared behind this cloud, the plane popped out!  The object was gone and the jet continued on the same course indicated by it&apos;s pre! vious va pour trail i.e. SE to NW.  I am an amateur astronomer and I where glasses with weak lenses.  I have also seen other anomalous things when doing astronomy such as fast moving orange lights, which have also been reported by two others in the letters section of a UK astronomy magazine.

Subsequent investigaton shows cloud ceiling at 9,000 ft. with family estimating altitude of 5,000 feet, with closest approach 85 degrees almost overhead.  Viewed through binoculars by husband and wife, with 378 feet linear diameter field of view @1,000 yards(translating into approx. 7 degrees angular field).  Binocular field of view could not contain the entire triangular object.  That is, husband and wife could NOT see the entire object within the field of view of their binoculars.  Obviously, these witness estimates cannot pinpoint the exact altitude, dimensions, etc. of this object, BUT these are credible witnesses who are able to question their own perceptions.  Investigators on this case, having checked law enforcement, Iowa state climatologist, and FAA, are convinced that whatever was seen was, indeed, &quot;HUGE,&quot; and since we cannot easily explain it, it remains in the UFO category. ADDED TO INVESTIGATORS&apos; INTEREST IN THE AMES AREA, are reports of a neighbor to the above family having seen an unexplained aerial object BETWEEN/BESIDE their adjacent homes on a previous occasion. ALSO, the wife witness in the above case had a daytime sighting three years ago near the southwestern part of Ames (this is town of permanent population of around 30,000....student population at Iowa State University obviously swells the population considerably) PLUS, we have been contacted with abduction reports by several individuals in the Ames area - all witnesses thus far check out as highly educated, credible individuals with (as far as we can tell) their &quot;psychological&quot; feet on the ground, i.e. not wanting to over-conclude, but realizing that they&apos;ve been able to remain conscious at least part of the time during encounters involving UFOs. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT - only 7 miles from Ames in 1996, two crop formations were discovered, with plant and soil samples subsequently being submitted to Dr. W. C. Levengood&apos;s non-profit laboratory in Michigan, with lab results clearly showing anomalies associated with the formations. AS AN INVESTIGATOR, I NOTE THAT someone else from the Ames, Iowa area turned in a report to NUFORC recently, without leaving their name so that they could be contacted by MUFON investigators.

As a boy, I used to love to look at the night sky through my binoculars. Occasionally I would spot a satellite just after dark. Satellites were easily recognized by their steady, fast paced bright light. On this occasion, I spotted a satellite moving south to north in the eastern sky. When I trained my binoculars on the light, the magnification revealed that instead of one light, there were two, one following another. I watched for about ten to fifteen seconds as the two lights moved along the same path. Then, suddenly the rear light instantaneously changed direction and speed and faded to black as it zoomed off in an abrupt turn.  Through my binoculars looking toward the northeast, the two objects were moving from a two o&apos;clock position toward an eight o&apos;clock position. The rear obect then turned toward a one o&apos;clock position. It seemed to do so without any hesitation whatsoever. It was many years later that I realized that what I had seen might be a UFO following a terrestrial satellite.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We eventually noticed an amber colored light just to the west of the moon. At first we thought it was a star, but instead of twinkeling it sort of pulsated, also it appeared to be infront of the main haze of the atmosphere but behind the lower clouds as there were absolutely no other stars viewable. It seemed to stay approxamately the same distance from the moon and gave the faint impression of rotation. Neither of us had any binoculars of course so we simply sat and watched it. With the moon highlighting the clouds it was apparent which ones were more dense and which clouds were very thin. This is important because the light would appear through some of the thicker clouds but would disappear behind a mere wisp of cloud. The light also caught our attention because it seemed to be about twice the size of a star, it didn&apos;t move as fast a a plane, and it gave the impression of being oblong ( wider to the front, or the western side; than at the back, the eastern side). We saw it again tonight, same place,same time, same location in the sky; but tonight (06/07/01) it doesn&apos;t seem to pulsate as much and also it gives a stronger impression of rotation.

There were no other cars on the highway and it was a very clear night, when suddenly the interior of the truck light up with flickering fire light, we thought the trucks cube with all our supplies was on fire. The light source was on the passenger side (my side) just out of the corner of my eye, but when I looked the light was gone. We both saw the light, but didn&apos;t know where it came from. We were a little taken aback. Five minutes later the light came back on the same side as before, but it was much dimmer and again when we looked back in the mirrors the light disappeared, but it was the same flickering light and there was no other traffic on the road with us. We arrived at our destination and told others our story. It turned out that the same light flashed two others in a different car, the same night, but in their story it was much brighter and scared them so bad that they pulled over and camped the rest of the night.

All the spray and the tail were orangy yellow in colour. The truck was going about ninty kms and when I looked at it, it slowed right down and flew behind the truck. The window it was flying beside was open a crack and when it slowed down and went behind the truck the noise from the wind coming through the window dropped by half, and my headacke went away instantly.

It was about half a kilometre from him.  He pulled over to the side of the road and observed it.  It hovered above the trees.  Predominately red lights with blue and white also.  They did not flicker but were continueous.  He told me that it was about 200 feet long in length and approximately 50-80 feet in height.  He remarked to me about how he couldn&apos;t believe how big it was.  It was noiseless and there was no other actions other than the ones stated above.  He observed for about  half an hour.  The reason he knows this, he told me, was because he pulled into work at 5 minutes to 0700H.  He left before it did, so it is unknown how long it stayed. He didn&apos;t tell me at first, he relayed the story to my mother, whom told me.  I questioned him right away.  He has refused to speak to anyone about it for fear of ridicule.  He is afraid of being called &quot;crazy&quot;.  He did not speak of it for a couple years, self-doubt was obviously taking its toll on him.  A week ago I asked him about it again and he gave me more detail, with vigor.  Unbeknownst to him I am relaying to you his story. I am my fathers judge of character.

As we looked to the SW, I spotted what looked at first like a white balloon being carried upwards very rapidly. The cloud deck was at about 8,oooft and the object went above them to about 10,000ft and then hovered as if caught in an air pocket. Several other people thought it looked like a grocery type white bag, but there was a smaller piece of a white object that we saw traveling along with the larger &quot;bag&quot;. It looked unattached. After about 15 minutes of being &quot;motionless&quot; the objects started to climb higher until they were out of site to the SW. About 25 people around us saw and watched the objects climb. I&apos;ve been to many airshows over the years and never saw anything like this before - it definetly was not a balloon. I was monitoring the radio freqs of the airport, but nothing was mentioned about the object.((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome additional reports from other witnesses to this incident.  It does seem odd to us that a simple bag, containing either hot air or helium, would continue to rise so far in such a short period of time, rise above the clouds, and then continue to rise out of sight.

After observing the aircraft for about 15 seconds I saw two small round dull red lights, many hundreds of yards apart, appeared over the airplane at 45 degrees above the horizon. The two red lights moved perfectly in unison, first moving away from each other, then almost converging and finally travelling at their original spacing before disappearing near tree top level to the West. The two red lights had a unique deep dull red hue which did not change in color or intensity. The lights movements through the sky approximated the shape of an hour glass. No noise was heard from the lights. The two red lights were visible for 10 seconds.

She said &quot;Dad what is that? It&apos;s really shiny.&quot; I looked and couldn&apos;t see it at first, but she continued to talk about it and soon after I spotted it too. I pulled the car over and got a very good look at it. The object was square in shape from a frontal view, but thin from a side view. The front of the object, while square, contained 4 circular shapes within it (like 4 dinner plates placed side by side, two across, two down, to fill the square.)The front was &quot;chrome-like&quot; and extremely shiny. The back side of the object was black &amp; flat with no other markings. The object was on end and slowly spinning horizontally, so that to look at it while spinning was to see the shiny side of the square, then the thin, then the black side, and so on; a pattern of thick &amp; thins. While spinning, the object traveled North towards downtown, then made a turn to head West near Busch Creek. A guess to it&apos;s speed may be about a varying 10-25 miles an hour. A guess to it&apos;s height from the ground would be approx. 100-150 feet. The overall size estimate would be 5+ feet with the thinner side maybe 1 foot thick.

I am not the type who even proposes this could be a UFO.

On 5/28/2001 at 10:10PM CT in Schaumburg, IL I witnessed the following event while walking my dog in the office park where I work.   Visibility was moderate to good and the moon was clearly visible in the high SW sky.  I normally witness slow moving lights at least every other night which I generally assume are low orbiting satellites or other orbiting man made objects visible to the naked eye. This night proved to be no exception when I sited a slow moving light, which came into my visible horizon from the center of the constellation Orion on about a 15 degree arc westbound.  The slower then normal movement and higher than normal arc suggested a higher orbit to me.  The light was of the same power relative to the constellation, constant, clear and easily discernable.  After approximately 35 seconds the light was approximately 20 degrees past straight above me in my eastern horizon when a very fast moving light appeared overhead (I was lying on my back, looking up and slightly NE so &quot;overhead&quot; means S/SE).  This light crossed from my Southern horizon a few degrees east of due north to the first light in not more than 5 seconds. Its  speed initially startled me. This was too slow and deliberate and visible for too long to be falling debris or a meteorite.   Also, it was about twice as bright as the first light.  I took these facts to mean it was a very low altitude satellite.  My heart literally skipped a beat as the odds of catching two visible satellites crossing paths flashed in my mind.  Rather than simply cross paths, however, they met exactly.  The brighter, fast moving light was not visible after the intersection and the slower dimmer light seemed more slow and more dim and in fact disappeared within another 10 seconds.  While the first of these facts may be explained by the slow moving object exceeding my eastern horizon, it was at least 1/3 higher on that horizon when I lost site of it than in the Western horizon when I first sited it.  I see no simple explanation for the disappearance of the fast mover 20 degrees past directly overhead when I sited it at least 90 degrees in the Southern Horizon. I returned to the site today with a compass and took accurate readings from the very place I sat the night before (the grass was still pressed down).  The data above should be exact to within about 5 degrees.  The amazing fact is that I did not look at my watch.  A friend did call me when I just left the office on foot with my dog and the phone log read 9:45 on my friends phone.

Under ordinary circumstances, we would have assumed that a witness who reported such an event would be describing two satellites, which happened to be visible in proximity to one another.

That is why we all happened to be outside looking up at the sky.  About 10pm we saw a white light in the distant sky to the northeast and the object was moving from the north to the south or southwest.  It was very distant, you could tell it was very high and it was moving much faster than a plane.  Everyone was talking about it and I suggested that it might be a satellite as I heard they move faster than planes.  About that time we saw another one - this one seemed to be coming from east to west and then another from south to north and so on. They seem to be appearing one at a time from the black night sky - almost as if they were stars that had been stationary and then just started moving.  We would watch them until they travelled out of our sight.  We thought that was an awful lot of satellites. One in particular, as it travelled from north to south and then westward out of our line of vision, seemed to flare very brightly for a second and then go back to normal. Also there was one that changed direction and at one point seemed almost to fishtail, or swirl. We aren&apos;t trying to indicate we saw alien crafts - as we are sure it was probably satellites, but we&apos;re curious as to what it could be.  We felt to stupid to call the airport and ask if they had anything on their radar.

At about 8:40pm that Friday, I drove to a nearby gas station from my home to get a pack of cigarettes.  As I was driving back home I noticed a very large craft of some kind Flying relatively low in the sky.  It was about the size of an audio tape long wise at arms length.  I saw two lights at first thinking that is was two airplanes flying side by side in unison.  Then I realised it was one large object when I saw a small red light beside the far right light.  As the object went out of view behind some trees, I followed in my car for about a minute and caught a better look from the rear.  It was three lights in a line with the small red light just a bit lower to the right. As I watched the object trying to see if there was any discernable shape to it, I noticed that there was absolutely no noise coming from it.   I live in an area between Reagan National and Dulless International Airport and am familiar with the types of planes ad helecopters that fly in this area.  For any plane to have been that size in my field of view, it would have been making a recognizable deep rumble sound.  This object was higher up in the sky and was bigger that anything I have ever seen fly anywhere.  It seemed to glide though the sky heading south when it went out of view.  I was surprised that nobody else saw this in my area given its large population.

I read a report of a someone who saw something similar to what I have witnessed three different times in the French Quarter and the Central Business District of New Orleans.  The report I read said in 2/01, the witness only saw one black object slowly moving across the sky.  Every time I have seen these objects there were two in formation, casually crossing the sky, all three times I witnessed them at dusk.  They move very slowly in a direct path from NW to SE across the city.  The most dramatic sighting occured the first time...I was on my balcony, in the late afternoon, on St. Philip St. with my friend, when I noticed the objects moving across the sky.  At first I thought they might be birds flying from Lake Salvador to Pontchartrain, as there is always an increased amount of birds in the sky at nightfall.  I soon realized they weren&apos;t birds and I told my friend to check them out.  He got a little freaked out by them but we watched them slowly move across the sky.  About the time they  had reached the Eastern part of the city, and I estimate they were over or near Lake Ponchartrain, an incoming airliner apparantly swerved at the last minute to miss them, the sound of the jet&apos;s engines increasing as the plane veered to it&apos;s right and up to avoid the objects which just kept on their course.  We were pretty amazed at the whole thing. I have seen the objects twice since then, both times at sunset and both times they were flying on the same course over the city.  We have a lot of Military  bases near us in Mississippi and Florida, and we often get F-15s and even those warthog planes flying over.  I suspect it may be aircraft from a base because of the routine in flight pattern and time of day.  But whatever they are, they aren&apos;t using jet propulsion and they aren&apos;t prop-driven.

We had no idea what he was talking about so we joined him in the rock field. We saw what was definately beams of artificial light being shined in many directions at once much like a disco ball. The spots of light hit the steep slopes of the Eastern Sierra on our side of the valley and on the White/Inyo Mountains across the valley. We couldn&apos;t see the source of the lights because Crater Mountain was directly between our campsite and the light source. Crater Mountain was four miles south of our location, approximately.

We dismissed that idea since it wasn&apos;t moving, didn&apos;t have the shape of a bird and appeared to be way too large for its apparant distance from us. We also considered that perhaps something had fallen off an approaching aircraft. Once again we ruled that out since the object seemed to be above the approaching aircraft.

These lights from left to right where red, white and green in a triangurlar formation with the white light slightly above the other two, these lights did not flicker or fade or change colors and remained intact and did not devate from it&apos;s west south west course.  These lights where very very bright and stood out cleanlly on a bright and sunny day with no clouds in the area at all.  We looked at them for a short time maybe two mins and then each other, at that time we did not know what we saw, but as I looked around behind us I saw 4 high alltitude jets pursuing in the direction of the lights at a high rate of speed with enough alltitude to leave contrails behind them, they criss crossed the sky several times in an attempt to intercept the lights.  As the jets passed over head I remarked to my wife that what ever it was the naval air base at Brunswick Maine had scrambled jets to check it out, as I pointed them out to her she saw exactly what I saw, 4 jets trying to vecter an intercept course with the lights in the west south west sky.  We first noticed the lights some where between Portland and Kittery, The jets as far as we saw did not catch up to the lights. When we crossed the bridge at Kittery heading back into NH our view of the sky changed due to landscape in that area and could no longer see the jets nor the lights. I believe that the lights we saw was not any type of aircrft I&apos;ve ever seen and most certainlly had to have been seen by many motorist on I-95 So. as the traffic was moderate to heavy that day and it was so Bright that you would need to be blind not to see it, still to this day I&apos;ve heard of no reports of this sighting and have checked newspapers from NH and Maine from then till now. Also I believe that it was picked up on radar at Brunswick naval air base and the air p! ort at p ortland. My wife and I are of sound mind and very honest and creditable folks and have worked in the electronic warfare divisions of several firms for many years and have seen some unbelievable technologies being developed, but this was unlike any thing we had ever seen before.

Both were white in color and oval in shape. They were traveling in a west to east direction and at a very rapid speed, since they were out of sight within 10 seconds or less. The unuseual part of this sighting is that the very next day (04/29/01), I was on my roof with binoculars watching the commerical aircraft. To my astonishment two exact same objects came into my view. This was something that in all my years of sky watching I have never expierenced.

Both were flying flying side by side from the north west and turning to the east. The object on the right was steady, but the object of the left was moving form right to left and back to front of the other. As I mentioned, both were perfectly oval and white in color. On this same day I later went onto my roof with binoculars to follow air traffic of commerical flights that pass over my house going to Laguardia airport. While watching the sky I suddenly spotted which seemed to be the same objects I had noticed earlier that day. Both were oval and white in color, but this time both were fling side by side and steady. With my binoculars I can possitivly say they were both white and oval in same...no wings what so ever.", "The object moved at right angles.I was looking out my window at night. I was looking southwest (in the direction of WPAFB). I saw a brite light that moved slowly in vertical and horizontal directions. It would move vertically, then stop and remain stationary for a few moments, then move horizontally, and stop, and it repeated that cycle a number of times. Then, in an instant, it disappeared by accelerating extremely quickly. It must have taken it less than .1-.2 of a second to disappear. A few points I&apos;d like to make. First, when it was moving slowly and turning at what appeared bo be exact right angles, and starting and stopping, it did not appear to accelerate. This is what initially caught my eye. In other words, it moved without accelerating; it moved at a precise and steady speed and motion. Second, when it finally did &apos;take off&apos; into the sky and disappear, it DID seem to accelerate, but at a phenomenal rate. Years later I was teaching in Taiwan. We had a discussion in class about UFOs. I asked my students if any of them had ever seen one. After a period of silence, one young man shared his story of having seen a UFO in Taiwan, I believe it was in the early or mid 80&apos;s. As he described what he had seen, I got goose bumps. He described exactly what I had seen in Ohio years ago. His description included elements such as turning at right angles, moving and stopping, then taking off ... it was uncanny. He was describing exactly what I had seen. Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

PD))Formation of three silent lights traveling in a large perfectly unison traingle as if all apart of one single objectWas staring south upward at the sky watching shooting stars + meteors when suddenly I noticed that a perfect triangular formation of three bright seeming &quot;stars&quot; were moving in unison  southward at a very steady pace like an airplane, only completely silent,  and descending in elevation. Being that I live in a second floor condo and the light formation that was incredibly large (as far as the point to point distance of each of these lights at each corner of the triangle object were) , and very bright, -it quickly disappeared from my balcony view... so I ran downstairs and to the back of my building into open space, but the object had already disappeared in less than a minute from when I had originally spotted it. I&apos;ve seen satelites before and this was much much too large to be a sattelite of any kind. I also checked to make sure the ISS was not scheduled to make any orbits over the Denver area this eve.Dear Ms. ((deleted)),Thank you very much for the interesting report!We would like to know what the apparent size of each of the three lights was, relative, for example, to the size of a star, please.Also, are you certain that they were traveling due south, or could the formation have been moving to the southeast, perhaps?Finally, how did the objects disappear from your sighting, please?  Did they go over the horizon and disappear from sight, suddenly, or what??Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!  We think we know what you saw tonight, but the answers to our questions above will help us reach some kind of tentative conclusion.Cordially,Peter Davenport((RESPONSE))Dear Mr. Davenport: Thankyou for contacting me. In regards to the question of the triangle form I saw this eve 05/13/01 @ aprox 10:30 pm mtn time. Yes, it did appear to be moving slightly South/eastwardly. Basically what I saw was three points of light in a perfect triangular form. I saw no object within these three points , albeit the perfect unison movement of the lights together and the steady pace they traveled at suggested the three corner lights that formed the perfect triangle were the corners of an object I simply could not see with my naked eye.  Each of these three  lights were no bigger than the star dots one sees with their naked eye when staring up at the night sky, however the vast distance between each point was tremendous, much larger than any sattelite  or spaceshuttle could be and the brightness of each dot of &quot;seeming&quot; star light was comparable to the shine reflect of a planet being viewed in the night sky with little more than a pair of binnoculars. The departure from my sight was due as follows: As it moved away in its south eastward direction-  The roof of my balcony blocked my view.. by the time I raced downstairs and made my way to the back of my condo into open space it was already gone. However, please note: That although to my naked eye it appeared to move at a steady pace (much like one sees an airplane in the night sky moving at a steady pace),... It took me aprox only 60 seconds or less to reach that open space in the back of my condo. Now, Considering the apparant largeness of this triangular formation, for it to have disappeared from view altogether or be out of my eyes range in this short period of time, I can only imagine it was in fact traveling at a much greater speed than my eyes originally perceived.  I read some of the reports at the sightings web site about a ?stealth blimp?.. in the shape of an enormous triangle and am currently surfing around the web to see if I can dig up some info on it to see if it perhaps was due to fly over the Denver area this eve...  Albeit, if you have any ideas on what this particular object was.. I do hope you might email me back when you get a chance to let me know. After reading some of the other recent reports filed, apparently others in this area of the west have seen similar triangle point objects as well, that have yet to be explained.Thanks,  ((name deleted))((END FIRST RESPONSE))((SECOND RESPONSE))Dear Mr. Davenport: In my follow up web investigation for info about my 5/13/01 unexplained ighting, I learned that according to skunk works at Lockeed, reported in an article by ((author deleted)) @ ((publication deleted)) site:  http:((URL deleted)) What I saw fits the perfect description given for the Stealth Blimp, which apparently has the ability to elude radar and be virtually invisible to the eye in the night sky - so that all one sees are three triangle blips of seeming star light. It is reported that this blimp is also aprox 1,000 feet long! However, apparently the project is top secret so the public is not allowed to know when it makes its test runs or operations or where.

After a few minutes there was a rumble out side his window and the lights and noise went away. After that all the Dogs started howling. I got up to yell at my dogs but my son did not tell me till the next day. Now my son is very scared of the dark. He has to sleep with the lights on now. He told me that he don&apos;t want the lights out because he thinks something will come for him but he can&apos;t say what.", "craft made no noise and leveled and lowered into field.craft was hoving in one spot, tilted alittle. you could see antennea on the tips on both sides, from the  lights from Big Flats made details easier to see. On the top part there were white lights, they almost looked like little windows. and on the bottom  the was colored light rotating around  the circumferences, or they were flickering off and on giving the impression that they were rotating. the craft leveled off and dropped down into a back field. There was no noise at all.  MY girlfriend and I started to go up to check it out and changed our minds. We were at the top of Hickock Rd in the town of Corning, looking toward the electric station in Big Flats and the Corning Elmira airport is approx 5-10 miles away from where we were.", "Object seen 3-14-01 changing shape and size in Northeast OhioObject appeared to have 2 small detached red flashing lights directly above and below. Both &quot;lights&quot; weaved and pitched and acted as they were attached by long springs. The object itself was an undefined oval glow of light which I witnessed changing in size and shape several times. Usualy increasing in size tenfold. It would appear to stop while changing, turning a bright blue/white light. I would guess the altitude of the object to be under 600ft. traveling in a zig-zag motion from the north and heading south.", "Perfectly shaped triangle of stars, extremely fast moving, two stars circling each other.We saw a triangle of 3 stars (perfectly shaped triangle) that was stationary when we first noticed it.  Within about 10 seconds, it started moving across the sky still in perfect triangle shape, then suddenly, two stars began circling each other very rapidly, while the triangle shape moved extremely fast across the sky until out of sight.  There were 4 of us who witnessed this event and we were all stunned at what we saw.", "Bright intermittent pulsing light, horizon to horizon, no sound, maybe orbital or very high object, craft, not airplane?Late sunday night, 11:30 pm - June 10th 2001, I was doing a little stargazing with binoculars. I was sorta waiting for the light clouds to go away, really just relaxing then I got a big 8 foot table out my wife had out at a garage sale the day before, got my other two sets of binocs out, and decided to stay a while.  Anyway, this started at 11:30, I had been outside about 1 and a half hours.  A bright light, I will say white-I am red and green color-blind a little, flashed or pulsed or lit-up or whatever to my right, south mostly and a tiny bit west-- I am lying flat down feet pointed directly east.  Pretty damn bright, I think I saw it light up with my eyes closed or maybe partially open, dont really know.  I thought I had missed one of those bright meteorite deally-bobbers.  Approx 5-15 seconds later, now fully alert, a second flash, not really a flash more like a long flash lit up the same area , about like a street light at 2 or three blocks.  I could now see it was moving almost directly north, a tiny bit east.  I pointed my binocs at it and watched it pulse, light up, all the way across the sky, about 30 seconds, maybe 40 seconds, through the binocs until it went as far as I could see to the horizon.  There was no sound,  it looked at first like a aircraft landing light but I really think it was up a lot higher,  like maybe a satellite reflecting sunlight while spinning, but I have probably watched hundreds and hundreds of satellites or space junk or whatever, and they never pulse light like this.  The pulses were not evenly spaced, they were anywhere from 8 to 12 seconds apart, they were pretty bright, and this was a little hard to follow with 10x50 binocs because the light pulses were timed so far apart and not evenly spaced. It disappeared completly between light pulses.  It was about like tracking a satellite across the sky, had to have been visible to a huge area on the ground, About 2 to 6 minutes after this, a satellite went over from west to east, all the other satellites were going north to south or south to north-cant remember now. Never saw anything like this before, pretty wierd, you would agree if you had seen it. I remembered the west-east satellite for reference and checked all my times with the clock in the kitchen. I dont believe aliens were taking pictures but when I went back inside, I made sure all the doors were locked.... I will take my video camera out with me tonite in case it was a re-occuring type thing.", "Small disk in a blizzard totally unaffectedWe were driving south on the interstate in a raging blizzard in a full size 4x4 truck and at 40-50 m.p.h. we were having a very difficult time due to the wind and limited visibility.  We were north of Butte in an area called Elk Park.  We were being very quiet so my co-worker could concentrate on his driving.  While we both watched the road a metallic disc approximately 18 inches across came at us head-on at about 25 m.p.h and about fifteen feet off of the ground and smoothly passed right over us.  This object was completely unaffected by the weather.  My co-worker started shouting and asked if I saw that.  I asked him to describe what he had seen and he descibed the same thing I had saw.  He had never had any interest in this subject and I had always held an objetive curiosity on the subject and had never seen an object such as this.  A friend of my wife&apos;s had descibed a similiar object in the same area on the previous Thanksgiving Eve while on a Bus trip from Boulder to Butte.  She was the only person on the bus.  When she pointed it out the Bus driver stopped the bus and they both observed it for several minutes. I have a good understanding of science and aircraft and nothing I know of created by man could have moved the way this object did.  It was absolutely unaffected by the weather and was moving much too slow to generate any kind of lift.  I was also told by a very credible older friend that several years ago he had seen a strange object in the same area and it followed him all the way to Butte.  Since I hunt this area frequently myself I will keep a sharper lookout in this area.  I do not find it a coincidence that all three situations took place in bad winter weather, there was no traffic around, there were two witnesses each time and all took place in the same park. Sorry I don&apos;t have anything more substantial.((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC has received a number of reports of UFO&apos;s witnessed during inclement weather.

Your show alerted us that reports were coming in concerning lights just south of the San Diego border. I walked outside not really thinking I would see anything. Boy was I wrong! About 100 or more star sized nonflashing lights were moving in a loose formation across the sky from north to south. It was totally incredible! An armada of UFOs. I got out my big fujinon 10x70 binoculars and watched them move all the way across the horizon. I could see no detail even with the fujinons. They were so high up they must each have been huge to be so bright when viewed from ground level. This was a major display that I think was more shocking than the phoenix lights. Again let me repeat, over 100 star sized solid white lights moving together in formation across the background starfield. They were not stars. You must investigate this.

I was outside with my friend ((name deleted)), skygazing like I have done for years, I am an avid astronomy buff. I know all of the things that should be in the sky, why and all of that. Tonight I saw something in the sky that I cannot explain, and when I think of all the possible things it could have been, the closest thing I can envision is a formation of Air Force jets. We were skygazing all over the sky, but when I first saw the formation, it was in the south/ south east.   It slowly moved from the S/SE to the North then vanished out of sight.  I quickly asked my friend if he saw it as well, and he looked and said what the hell is that ((name deleted))?  I said I have no idea, standing there with my eyes wide. My first reaction was that it was a seagull being lit up by the street lights and we could see the belly of it. But then i realized it was not, due to the fact that this was WAY too high to be any bird. Or was it? I quickly took the binoculars we were using to tour the city sky and focused on the formation. to my surprise, it looked the same as it did with my naked eye. These were 10X50 binocs, and I cannot explain why i did not see any more detail. Now this is where it gets tricky, because it was either a very large object, or perhaps dozens of small objects flying in formation. they were all a solid red color, but *very* faint. My friend thought they changed color to a dull orange, but I could not see that. They did not blink, it was just a steady, *very* dull red of basically dots moving across the sky VERY high up. Have you ever seen a sattelite from earth when it passes overhead? Well, it looked like that, a steady light, but not white, red, and much duller than a sattelite. I only wish I had my telescope out. I was SO mad later on for not bringing it out. When we could not see them anymore, my friend wanted to go do something else, but I said wait- listen. Do you hear anything? He said no. I heard nothing the ENTIRE time, and I know what a plane sounds like even that high up. It was dead quiet, no sounds after they passed over head, nothing. It was very errie in fact. I in my 10 years of being an amature astronomer, have never seen anything like this in the sky, and nothing I know of in space can produce this, and nothing I know of in terms of aircraft can produce this to my knowledge.  And I know alot about space and the sky. The weather was crystal clear, with great seeing and no humidity. A cold front passed by about 2 hours before the event, and when I thought about it I wondered if I saw my first &apos; ball lightning&apos; but the stories I have heard about ball lightning none of them say it can last this long, nor be this high. I do not know what else to say. I never expected to post to this website, I only started to come here to read the reports people post and try to think what they could have been in the &apos;real world&apos; , like a certian star out that night or something. etc. I wish I could find out what it was in the sky, it confused me. It scared me frankly, cause nothing I have ever learned prepared me for this. This is the first time I saw something in the sky that I could not explain right away since I was a child, and learning in school. Well, here is the report, as quickly as I can write it. Sorry for the typos, I am so tired. :)  Oh wait I just remembered, as always, there was tons of air traffic in the NYC metro area, planes going to kennedy, newark, etc. I am used to their patterns and they were flying the same patterns when this was going on to my knowledge. But I was looking at the formation the most. :)", "Fast moving cluster of erratic white lights spotted over western NC.A cluster of 5 white lights followed by one singular white light,each similar in brightness to the brightest stars. They moved as a group from East toward West. They did not move in straight lines but did move in an irregular or sporatic nature. There was NO sound! Not during nor after they passed from view.

It passed almost directly over me &amp; continued in a straight westward line until the trees obscured it from view.  The light was like a motorcycle headlight - single, not double as an airplane&apos;s.  There was no accompanying jet noise or airplane motor noise - only a soft after&quot;hum&quot; - like a furnace running, or wind through trees.  This craft did not have red and green lights.  I saw 4 distinct lights arranged in a diamond shape (or a triangle with a tail).  There was also the suggestion of a few smaller lights around the back of the craft.  The front and rear lights were cream colored, while the side lights were amber and chartreuse.  It was travelling rapidly - from initial sighting to the point where I lost it in the trees took less than 30 seconds and the approximate distance I would estimate to be 3/4 mile.  The sky around my farm usually has many moving lights - all attached to regular aircraft.  The traveling speed of this craft astonished me, making me realize that it was not one of the &quot;regulars&quot;.

PD))", "Was this demise of object sighted in Seattle?At 6:20 pm on March 13, 2001 as I was driving home from work just before dusk and topped a hill facing west I saw a white something dropping fast from high in the sky in the west. At first thought it dropped straight down but after consulting a map that showed my route veered slightly north I realize the craft did, also. At first it was a shape like a flat bottomed cone (tall popcorn bucket- elongated thimble, maybe) with larger part at the top, it had very sharp edges visible and at times while dropping there was an indication of fold or line the length of it from top to bottom (as if rotation presented different view to me). It was very bright white against the palest blue sky. As the highway I was on turned north, I took a side road to the west heading toward the still dropping object, in hopes of keeping it in sight and getting a better look, wondering where it might land assuming it was very large space debris, perhaps even from Mir that might be breaking up already. When I stopped my car I watched it drop to just above the top of tree line about 75 feet ahead of me. At that time while I remained stationary, the object seemed to hesitate and the bottom lifted pointing north. It moved across the sky (18&quot; at extended arm length) to the north and appeared to stop. There was no sound, scents or other noted effects. I watched a few moments as it seemed to just stay suspended there. This discounted my idea of space debris and I assumed I would be able to check NASA sites to discover what it was. It didn&apos;t seem to be in danger of crashing. I turned and went back out to the highway headed north and when I cleared line of woods to my left I saw what I believe to be the same object that had traveled a bit further north than I had. (As it was out of my sight for a period, I can not be absolutely positive it was the same object.) I parked my car across from cleared pasture area (less than 1/2 mile north of first stop) to take more pictures. The object was then seen as a rather vertical jelly bean (cigar) shaped bright yellow &quot;glow&quot; sitting barely above tree line in the west less than a quarter mile away. I took another picture and as I watched it seemed to ignite as if exploding and began to ascend. At this point I feel sure it was on fire. The top (front) blazing was bulged out like smushed ice cream cone as it seemed to meet resistence. The back tapered only gradually. This was intense fiery orange, black, yellow, red colors. As it rose, I looked to two guys a hundred feet north on the highway working on their truck and realized they hadn&apos;t noticed it. I pulled my car up and just said look. One of these guys immediately said, &quot;Thats it! That&apos;s that space station.&quot; We watched it turn back overhead toward the east and discussed things we knew about Mir coming down for a couple of minutes before the object appeared to burn out. At that time it continued overhead east as a pattern of black debris in various geometic shapes from front to length of previous burning tail. Still all this time no sound or odor of fire. Help had come for the stalled truck and I needed to move my car so I went on toward home, assuming an explanation would be all over the news. After about 3 miles I turned on a highway headed east and looked back with clear view of the burnup area and could see nothing. There were no images of the object in my pictures! Only the treeline! And needless to say, nothing on the news to explain it!((NUFORC Note:  This reported sighting occurred approximately 1 hour and 35 minutes before the earliest sighting NUFORC has on file, which occurred over Henderson, NV.

I live on the coastline, so the craft were coming in from over the ocean. No idea of altitude, but high enough where I could not see any detail on the craft. All craft appeared to be exactly the same. The craft gave off a faint whitish glow (a slight cast of yellow), just enought to make them visible. The craft were in perfect separation. After passing overhead, three of the craft broke off and changed heading to approx. 070. The other three maintained course for approx. 1-2 seconds, then joined up on the first three. Perfect separation was maintained at all times. No sound was heard. The craft dissappeared several seconds later, still headed approx. 070. At first I thought they were birds, then jets, since I used to fly jets in the service (A-4&apos;s). What got me was the sudden brake off movement of the first three, with no roll movement observed when they changed course. They seemed to simply &quot;translate&quot; over, for want of a better word. Also the speed seemed very high, and the separation was too perfect. I have seen many flight demonstration teams, but nothing like that. Flying that type of perfect formation would be very difficult for a military jet. Also, some sort of roll movement is required to change heading that quickly.

A plane flew underneath the  craft and as it went under it looked like red lights appeared on it as if it were a warning. Then the craft started moving slowly at first gaining speed toward the right and then it hovered in one spot for about 5 min. Then a small star shaped object branched off of it and started flying straight up and around as if it were in orbit with the earth but still in the atmosphere. The star shaped light disappeared and we continued to watch the other object and it started moving further and further away then it disappeared.

I saw what appeared to be a meteorite because it made a pronounced streak as it entered the atmosphere.  A moment later, a very small object appeared in my sight.  At the same time this object came into view I heard a sound from it.  The sound was of a very high frequency--a very high pitch unlike I had ever heard before.  But the sound was only heard when it first appeared and then ceased to make any sound.  The object then moved from the east to the west quite swiftly.  It moved in a zig-zag like fashion across the sky directly overhead to the western horizon and then disappeared.

When two of my friends wanted to go jump on the trampoline, they left the tent and I was leaving trying to make my friend stay in as a joke, When I saw a bright Blue light blink, so I turned around and my two friends were looking up so I looked up to,when I saw a big floating circular disc not to far above us. Then I saw a cone come down from the ship. I knew it was a UFO. Then The cone went back up in the ship. Then it flew away to fast to see. After that we were standing there shocked for like 3-5 minutes. After we stoped standing there we were all scared. Then we dicided to still sleep in the tent. Even know I kinda didn&apos;t want to. When we were in the tent talking about what happend we saw the bright blue light blink again. We were all to scared to look. We all still talk about it to this day. We know for a fact that it wasn&apos;t an airplane because it blinked different then a airplane, and it just was floating there in the air for about a minute. So we definetley knew that it was a UFO.

THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE.", "7 UFOs flying in a train formation seen in Northfield MN, 1991I have created a Flash animation of this experience: http://www.((URL deleted))  In 1991 I was a senior at St. Olaf college in Northfield,MN. The following was witnessed by me, and at least 4 of my friends. The event occured in April or perhaps May of 1991. I was dark but it hadn&apos;t been dark very long. I&apos;d guess it was 9:00. A group of us were in my friends apartment (Lincoln Parkway apartments) when one of my friends called us out to the second story balcony of the apartment. &quot;hey guys check this out.. are these UFO&apos;s or something?&quot; We went out of the desk and there were several lights about 40-45 degrees above the horizon (from our perspective).. These lights were moving fairly slowly in our general direction.. as them moved closes they seemed to be following each other, one after the other.. I would call it a &quot;string&quot; of lights..there were 7 or maybe 8 of them. I&apos;m almost certain that these lights were moving independantly of each other and were not part of a single, huge object. The lights were a deep, amber red. I&apos;m fairly certain the red lights were on continually and were bright. In addition, each &quot;craft&quot; also had what I remember to be several strobes blinking in a repeating, irregular, odd pattern not like the once every 3 second strobes of an airplane. the repeating strobe pattern (of maybe seven individual blinks) that each craft had repeated I would guess every second or so. I got the impression that these lights were fairly close to us.. and the size of each was maybe the size of a small plane. (20 feet diameter each?) I didn&apos;t notice any sounds from these lights. I actually got the cordless phone and called my roomate (who was in my apartment in the next building) and told him to go out on the balcony and look at what we were seeing.. I asked him what he thought they were and he said &quot;I don&apos;t know, a train??&quot; which was obviously not the case because trains don&apos;t fly, and these things were definitely in the air. But the lights were &quot;train like&quot; with one following the other  blinking their weird lights.  The distance between these lights in this string was not far. They seems to be much closer together than what I would think to be a safe distance. A couple years later I noticed a formation of helicopters flying, one after the other, and I took note that the distance between the helicopters was much farther apart than the lights that we say. Actually, I do remember that the noise of a train going by on nearby track was audible at the time. this may have also been what caused my friend to give &quot;train&quot; as an explaination. If there were any sound of the craft, the train noise may have gotten in the way of us hearing anything). But had it been 6 Cesnas that close, I&apos;m certain I would have heard the engines. Still watching the lights, I called the police on the phone I was holding. the woman who answered said &quot;Oh, you know what those are? they&apos;re ultralight aircraft&quot;. This I doubted. I had seen ultralight aircraft in the area before. But never to my knowledge at night, and never flying in formation. The crazy blinking pattern of these lights was unlike anything I had seen on any airplane before.  Seeing one of these things would have been curious, but It&apos;s possible that I may have just dismissed it as a plane that had odd lights but I doubt it. These lights were weird, and there were 6 or seven of them! Interestingly, the police-woman I was talking to told me that in a neary by town (Fairbault) there had been a newspaper story of some UFO sightings a week or so previous to the night I was talking to her. (more about this later). The lights continued closer and closer to us and seemed to get lower. Slowly, the lights drifted past us to our left and from our perspective they disappeared along the tree line. After the initial string of lights disappeard to our left, 3-5 minutes past and then we looked up and saw another single craft appear in the some location in the sky that the initial group appeared. It moves slowly along, following the path that the other lights took. I seem to remember this one being slightly different. I believe it was smaller, but perhaps it wasn&apos;t. It had similar red lights and blinking strobes. The entire sighting lasted about 8 minutes. I later regretted not getting out of the building and going out in the field past the trees to see if I could continue to see the lights, but to be honest, I was scared.  The next day I called the Fairbault newspaper and asked about the article that had been printed. The reporter verified that he had in fact written an article that discussed a couple of sightings in that area. I believe he mentioned that someone had seen a strange light shining a beam down or something like that. He also mentioned that a local farmer farmer had apparantly also had a sighting around the same time as us. This farmer had had sightings in years past and even had experienced cattle mutilations. The reported took my name and we talked about him possibly writing a new story talking about our sightings, but I didn&apos;t pursue it and neither did he so nothing ever happened. I also called the FAA and not surprisingly they weren&apos;t helpful. The 1997 &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; reminded me somewhat of what we saw, how the lights appeared in a row. But the lights in that video seemed white, not red, and didn&apos;t appear to be moving.  The lights we saw were much closer to each other (and to us) than the lights in the Phoenix videos that were widely shown. I know this report lacks certain important information (exact time, date) but I&apos;ve done the best I can. What I do know is that these were definitely, without question, intelligently controlled craft, not balls of light way off in the distance.  These lights were close and sharp and had it been daylight, I&apos;m certain I could describe the shape of these craft, but it was just dark enough that we could only see the lights of the craft, not the shape of the crafts they were attached to. If these craft were man made, they were unlike anything any of the five of us ever recall seeing before or since. This string of lights was moving roughly in an east to west path.

I drove down 3 different roads so that I could see it from different angles.  It looked the same from all 3 locations.  It was a round ball of light, and it didn&apos;t move. I continued to drive home; I was hoping that it would still be there when I got home so that I could show my husband, but after about 15-20minutes, I saw the ball of light disappear, some red streaks of light shoot out from the top and bottom of it , and then it shot straight up into the sky until I could no longer see it.

This person was a member of an elite, secret, military airplane crash team in the 1940&apos;s. The team investigated several airplane crashes. Then, about 6 months before the Roswell event, this crash team was ordered to race by land to a crash scene in a mountain wilderness area. The team had to force hike into the crash site.  The hike consumed the better part of 11/2 days since it was extremely difficult to find the crash site. Once discovered, it was quickly obvious that something had slammed into the top side of the mountain, and %100 exploded into thousands of palm sized pieces which were strewn all over the forest floor. My witness picked up a sample and conducted simple field tests on the strange object. The tests defied the known laws of engineering and physics.((NUFORC Note:  Original report Description follows:1940&apos;s secret, elite military crash team member  reveals  another UFO crash  event  months  before  RoswellMy witness is a former crew chief who in the 1940&apos;s was in charge of a team that  repaired military fighter airplane engines at a famous military airbase. The crew specialized in fast engine repair. My witness was also a member of a secret military airplane crash team. This elite crash team was always on alert to speed to a disaster either by air of ground. The team was composed of civilians, enlisted men and officers. My witness became experienced in airplane crashes. He knew what to expect, what to look for, what to do upon arrival at a crash scene. At this particular crash, it was quite obvious that the craft had slammed into the side of a forested mountain and blew up into thousands of small objects scattered over a large area. Field tests revealed startling results. A shroud of secrecy settled. After that came Roswell.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; location is unknown.  We have spoken with the individual who submitted the report, and he seems to us to be serious-minded.  We have requested that he attempt to establish the exact date, if that is possible.  We have assigned an arbitrary date here, in order that the report will be sorted to the 1940&apos;s era.  We suspect that the alleged event occurred after 1941, since it seems unlikely to us that the U. S. military would have had a &quot;secret military airplane crash team&quot; before the outbreak of the Second World War.

Let me explain further of my sighting. My friend and I were sitting and talking in front of his home on a warm June (Sunday) night. We both were talking on how are day went and mind you we were never under the influence of any kind of narcotic or alcohol for that mater. Both of us are in the status of the upper middle class society (at least I am uper middle class).Well, so we both sat talking when we heard an &quot;intense whistling and displacemnet of air&quot;. These sounds are not foreign to us, for we both heard them at least 10 other times the last year and a half. After hearing these &quot;intense whistling and displacements of air&quot; all was quiet again (except the loud planes from O&apos;Hare airport). Sitting proceeding with our conversations I saw an intense bright object in the shape of a circle floating in the western sky.At first I thought it was a visible star/planet but this was much more intense in lighting. It was flying northbound, but as it &quot;hovered&quot; north it gradually faded until nothing of it was visible. A few minutes later we heard the &quot;intense whistling displacement of air&quot; seemingly right above of where we sat. My friend has a street light/lamp in front of his home that has always shone (at night) as long as we both could remember, which suddenly turned off and we were imersed in darkness. At this point both of us were quite scared and I had to go. Wanting my friends company on the way home, we heard the same &quot;intense whistling and dispplacement of air&quot; above us. When we arrived at my house, which is only down the block, my friend needed me to drive him back home. Granted, he only had to walk about a block to go home but that is to show how sacred my friend was. Indeed, I too was quite affriad so after I dropped my friend off and parked my car I ran inside my home in utter terror.((NUFORC Note:  Given that the witnesses apparently have experienced the same phenomenon on many occasions in the recent past, it makes us wonder whether they are hearing the vortex turbulence generated by the wings of aircraft passing low overhead.

It would move in one direction then quickly moved in another in a split second. It was traveling upward. Its quick movements would happen often.  I remembered about my binoculars and looked through to see what shape it was. It was a shinny light that appeared to be rotating quickly.  I saw material around the bright light, but could not make out what it was.  At one moment an airplane passed by, and it appeared to be traveling about that fast but not quite.  At some moments it completely stopped and did nothing, then moved again. I don&apos;t know exactly how far up in the sky it was.

I don&apos;t recall any words being exchanged, just all of us staring at the sky, slightly from south to north.  The UFO was circular with a yellowish color, about the size of a full moon and was completely silent.  I could not make out any surface details.  The object seemed to be just a circular light.  It flew westward until it disappeared from sight, appearing to fly over Calexico, California, which is a border town next to Mexicali.  The object was not moving too fast.  Also, there was 2 or three (I can&apos;t remember) jet airplanes &quot;tailing&quot; it. The sighting was so spectacular that we kept checking the television &amp; radio for any mention of the event, but we never caught any mention of it.  Strangely, we were not in an isolated part of the city and still none of the neigbors mentioned anything.  It was summer and lots of people were usually outdoors.  I guess we became hesitant to mention it to others since we were just kids (I was around 10 years old &amp; the oldest of my cousins only about 3 years older).  My cousins still remember the event.

In case my wife or a child doesn&apos;t understand the call, and refuses, please try again.  I&apos;m at home evenings. My wife and two of my children saw the object as much as I did, but my wife is not a native speaker, while my children remember the incident but very little about it.  We were sitting in the back yard.  The sky was clear, except a small cloud formation in the north.  The object flew in a straight line from north to south, at low altitude, apparently, and it was absolutely silent.  I&apos;m hard of hearing, but wife and kids said that it made no sound that they could detect.  What we actually saw was four large luminous disks, all the same size, with an appearance similar to fluorescent lamps behind circular plastic shields.  They were quite bright but not dazzling.  Each was a good deal larger than the full moon.  They were facing downward.  They were in a formation as if they were in the same positions as the engines on a 4-engine airplane with a somewhat swept-back wing, and the distance from the leftmost disk to the rightmost was about the distance from tip of thumb to tip of little finger if the hand is held at arm&apos;s length with fingers spread as much as possible.  We did not see a wing, body, or anything other than the disks, and I figured this was because we didn&apos;t have the time or presence of mind to see them, but I saw two of the disks shift slightly and quickly relative to each other - wife and kids said later that they didn&apos;t see that.  This &quot;airplane&quot; flew at a go! od clip from north to south, about what I&apos;d expect of a 4-engine airplane at that altitude; I should say, &quot;all deliberate speed.&quot;  There were no navigation lights, landing lights, or anything of that nature.  I am sure it wasn&apos;t a blimp or dirigible, and I can&apos;t see it being a glider, since I have trouble believing that a glider could fly with large disks under its wings, and I&apos;d think such a stunt would be extremely dangerous at night, even if it could fly.

Regardless, I felt dizzy because it appeared that the &quot;stars&quot; were moving. Kind of like when you lay back and watch the clouds move and get disorientated. I realized, however, by watching other stars that the objects were indeed moving. I basically freaked out. From the distance that they appeared to be away the objects had to be MILES apart. Possibly 10 miles each? I would have to ask someone who is an expert on it. They moved slowly, from the distance we were seeing, and in an arc. Certainly NOTHING man made could make the arc shape movement at that height and with such an abnormal movement. They didn not go in a perfect arc. Rather the formation somewhat lumbered along. I didn&apos;t notice and cannot say for sure that the object was not a whole oject rather than a formation. I was to excited to pay attention if it blocked out stars as it moved. It didn&apos;t appear that it did. It was an arc overall but no apparent path that they were going. Everyone watched it in amazement. The formation was not an even sided  triangular.

After examining the object for a few moments it hadn&apos;t changed position at all and made me start to wonder. Out of curiosity I went inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars to see what is was expecting to have just been over reacting. What I saw through the binoculars appeared to be some sort off-white/tan colored object that was sphereical/disc in shape. After studying it for a few minutes it seemed to rotate around on its horizontal axis exposing its full shape. It was a round object that appeared to be composed of an outer ring surrounding a central sphere/disc type object. Unfortunatly my binoculars wern&apos;t powerfull enough to make out the patterns on the central part of the object clearly, but there was obviously some sort of design/patterns in the central portion. It only alluminated that one color but had a orange light/orb that would come from it, move around a bit, then go back. After looking at this go on for approx 10 minutes I went inside and grabbed my digital camera and took pictures of it. Unfortunatly my camera doesnt have a zoom feature but the light/object is clearly seen in the pictures and if magnified the shape is noticable. After 30 minutes of observing this object to the west I noticed a second object to the south, orange in color and further away. It seemed to bare a resemblence in shape as the one to the west but I couldn&apos;t see it as well. I studied the object to the west from dark till sun rise (Approx 2 hours.) even after all the stars in the sky had gone the object was still very visable. Finally the sun came up in the west blinding any attept to continue looking at the object. In one of my photos the object isn&apos;t where it was and a second grey disc type object is in veiw, much closer. Although I never saw it while I was outside. After some research and photo enhancment it bares some resemblense to a water spot that the camera had poss! ibly con trasted out. I still dont 100% agree with this possibility due to the fact most of the water spots that become visable through enhancment are oval in shape and barely visable. This object is a perfect circle. I wasn&apos;t expecting to see what I did but now I&apos;m changed from being open minded about ufo&apos;s to beleiving, as I&apos;ve seen one with my own eye&apos;s.

The intensity of the lights never changed but they didn&apos;t glow like normal lights. They were dull and there was no glare. They were edging each other out much like race cars down the final stretch but still maintained more or less a close V-shape and appeared to glide rather than fly as they passed overhead at about my 1 o&apos;clock position.

(There&apos;s really not all that much to describe about Scappoose other than the fact that it, like my hometown, Astoria, sits alongside the Columbia River.)  Just out of town, in the sky, I noticed a very bright yellow/white light descending -- straight down and northerly.  I pulled my truck off to the side of the highway so that I could get a better look at it.  My first thought was that it was a meteorite and I was concerned that, because of its speed, size and direction, it was going to hit the Pacific Ocean!  As it got closer, I noticed it wasn&apos;t as far away as I had originally thought, so, ever more curious, I got back on the road.  Then it went behind a hill with large pine trees -- or so I thought.  Assuming it was going beyond the horizon, rather than IN the trees, I figured it was just a (REALLY BIG) shooting star and the &ldquo;show was over.&rdquo;  But as I neared the hill, I saw that it had &quot;morphed&quot; into an actual &quot;ship.&quot;  Bright lights -- ((colors temporarily deleted until investigation is completed)) -- began blinking within the trees and the craft rose straight up out of the trees.  I pulled the car over again, in disbelief, and watched it for a few seconds. It began moving as though it were going to cross the highway, so I got back on the road after two cars drove by.  The craft, wider than the 4-lane highway and approximately 10 feet above the telephone wires (50 feet up), flew directly over the cars.  Both cars&rsquo; brake lights came on, but neither stopped!  I sped up, and as it crossed the highway, I anxiously looked for a road to turn down.  I turned east onto a small road, crossed the RR tracks and sped up, all the while keeping my eyes on the craft, which I could see through the trees.  It was now heading south at approximately 20-25 miles per hour. (I want to note that these lights -- ((colors deleted)) -- were blinking very brightly and in an interesting rhythm, but there was no reflection on the actual craft.  Though it was nearly invisible, the best way to describe its shape would be to say ((deleted)), based on the blinking light pattern.  More importantly,  I was able to make out this shape in two previous sightings several months ago in Astoria.  I&rsquo;m quite certain that this May 12 sighting was the same kind of craft my partner and I have witnessed {she, three times, once with photos; and myself, twice}, based on the light patterns.  They&rsquo;re very distinctive.) I got out of my truck and watched as the craft stopped and hovered above ((deleted)).  It was approximately 1/10 mile east of me, and 50 feet up. After a few seconds, the lights ((deleted)). There was no sound or movement.  Strangely aware that they knew I was watching, I became frightened, and, legs shaking, got back in the truck, where my usually very active dog was sitting quietly staring in the direction of the craft, and turned west for the highway.  I drove about 20 feet, then stopped when, through my side window, simultaneously, a car pulled up behind me and the craft ((deleted)) -- lights on.  I jumped out of the truck and pointed, yelling, &ldquo;UFO!&rdquo;  The ((deleted--people))), got out of their car as well and stood staring at it as the lights became very active -- fast and bright -- and it zoomed off to the ((direction deleted)) (maybe 3 miles?).  It stayed in the same location there -- far up in the sky.  We were all understandably excited, yelling, &ldquo;UFO!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Can you believe this?&rdquo;  The man said, &ldquo;I was in the ((government)) for years and that was no plane!  It wasn&rsquo;t a helicopter either -- I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like that!&rdquo;  He said they had just driven past the location of the craft where I saw it hovering, but hadn&rsquo;t seen it. Directly below it was, as he said, &ldquo;A big herd of cattle.&rdquo; Just then, with the original craft in a stationary position in the distant east sky (lights still blinking), another very bright white light appeared from the southeast and flew very fast in a northwesterly direction.  I said, &ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s that?!&rdquo;  The man said, &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ve sent a plane out to check it out.&rdquo;  I replied, &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a military base around here, is there?&rdquo;  As I said it, he yelled, &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t no plane!&rdquo;  I turned to see it that it had stopped abruptly behind a cloud.  Lights flashed and reflected in the cloud, and it shot straight up, with a trail of light behind it, and disappeared. The show was over.  Without even thinking to get their names or give them mine, we got in our cars and drove off.

Our location was about 10 miles SE of downtown Nashville, TN, at the Starwood Amphitheatre.  The time was 19:45.  Because of the angle of the sun and the height of the &quot;speck&quot;, my first guess was that we were seeing a low-orbit satellite.  It was tracking WNW at an altitude of at least 100,000 feet. We had two sets of binoculars with us, so I watched it with 10x50&apos;s while my wife watched it with 8x35&apos;s.  It resembled a lollipop, of all things, with the round sphere brightly reflecting the sunlight and the &quot;stick&quot; end clearly rotating around its axis once every 4-5 seconds.  This was all pretty cool -- I had never been able to see one so clearly before. And then a strange thing happened: it appeared to &quot;explode&quot;.  Right before our eyes, we watched this object, still tracking to the West, split up into several pieces.  The largest chunk emitted something like a cluster of BB&apos;s, in other words, where there was one object before, now there were two or more smaller objects and an array of tiny pieces, each reflecting the sunlight perfectly, fanning out toward the South.  The fan of BB&apos;s and the main object(s) continued tracking together, but gradually increased the distance between themselves.   A third piece moved rapidly away from the main group, at a faster velocity than the BB&apos;s, toward the SE. My first thoughts were that we had just witnessed some space junk disintegrating on re-entry, but the speed didn&apos;t seem excessive, and the movement of the third piece didn&apos;t seem to jive with the general motion of the main body.  The total elapsed time of viewing this thing before it was obscured by clouds was about 5 minutes.

It was 9:50pm.  As I reached the area adjacent to West Seattle, I spotted a light in the sky, which at first I took for an aircraft inbound to Boeing Field or Seatac Intl. Airport.  However, after less than a minute, I looked up again and noticed that the light had not moved and that I, rather, was moving toward this light which hovered midair above the neighborhood on the East side of the highway, approximately 70 to 100 feet up.  As I drove past the object, I looked at it through my sunroof and wondered if it was a helicopter.  I noticed the counter-clockwise cycling strobes of white lights tracing the pattern of a diamond under the craft while two or more other white lights glowed without flashing.  Moments later, I saw a second identical object on the same side of the highway less than 200 feet North of the original one.  As I scanned the skyline, I realized that two more identical stationary craft were hovering above the downtown area at approximately the same height.  After an accidental detour due to the distraction, at the James Avenue exit, I returned to the highway and proceeded toward the University District where I saw two more on my right (East) and another on my left which was moving.  I watched the moving object, which passed above me NW to SE about 100 feet up.  After it passed out of my field of vision, I watched another hovering, stationary craft with bright blue and red blinking lights remeniscent of a police light bar.  At this point I decided to pull over and get out of my vehicle when the next one came into view.  As I drove on, I did not witness any others.

The traffic had stopped and I directed my full attention to what I was observing and noticed that although that it was stationary it was spinning. I couldn&apos;t determine the color of the object as the sun was casting a orange/red color upon it.

It was a fireball that left a tail, perhaps only as an after image. The object seemed large and moved out of the east sky going west into the treeline in front of Spectacle Lake in Bay Mills Township, Michigan. It was incredibly fast. It&apos;s not unusual for me to wake up between 3 and 4 in the morning, but I don&apos;t usually pull the blinds aside to look out the window. For a few seconds,  I kept looking looking to see if there would be more, but there wasn&apos;t, so I lay back down and looked at the clock; it was 3:33 a.m. It was impossible to see where it went down, if it did, because of the treeline across the street in a very rural area. Behind the treeline there is a small lake, Spectacle Lake, and behind the lake there is a very large ridge called Mission Hill. Fireball sightings are common here. It is said they are looking out for us. Also, it is common for women to wake up between 3 and 4 in the morning.

I couldn&apos;t sleep so I was watching TV. We have sliding glass doors along side of the TV. I noticed something Bright through the sliding glass door. It was Reddish orange and very bright. The entire object was not this color just the edges all the way around. We live near the lake in Elizabethtown Ky. This lake had a problem and they drained most of the water out of it. The Dam is repaired now but the water level is not up to normal level yet. This Bright Light appeared to be over the lake near the dam.  It stayed at that location for a long time with out moving. I thought it might be a Helicopter from Fort Knox. While this object was over the lake a Helicopter came by, I thought sure he would have seen the bright light from the object but he never changed his direction. She said she could hear the Helicopter but never heard any sound from the other object. We are located on the flight path for The Helicopters from the Louisville hospitals to Hardin Memorial Hospital our local hospital. She said aer a while the bright light started moving easterly which brought it closer to me. It was moving very slow over the tree tops and when it was located over the First Presbyterian Church, which is about a half block away I could see it very good. (It could have been farther away then half a block but she could not tell.) It was not a Helicopter and it was not an Airplane. I moved to a kitchen window where I could see better and it looked like a big arrow pointing up. She said it stayed in this position the entire time she seen it. It was lit up all the way around the outside edge and it was easy to see it&apos;s shape. Enclosed is a drawing of what it looked like. As it started getting out of my view, I went up stairs and watched until I could not see it any longer. We do not have any windows on the east side of our house.

Here is my story: On the morning of January 31, 2001, as I was about to leave for work, something caught my attention in the sky that didn&apos;t look like anything that I was familiar with. As I observed for a few moments I realized it was definitely nothing conventional, so I ran back in the house, grabbed my Sony camcorder, and took an amazing video of several strange objects. There were two actual sightings that morning. The first sighting was of a single object that appeared circular with a highly reflective surface or blinking light, and possible rotation. Estimated altitude was above 10,000 feet. The object was in motion from west to east most of the time and blinking or reflecting sunlight at intervals, but did stop momentarily at one point, changed direction in a slow pace, hovered for several minutes, and then changed direction once again gaining altitude where it eventually disappeared behind a cloud. The second sighting occurred about 10 minutes after the first sighting ended. This sighting was of two different looking objects moving in tandem from north to south at a slow pace and appeared to have originated in the same general area of the sky where I lost sight of the first object. These objects appeared higher in altitude, possibly 20,000 feet or higher. The two objects were different in color from each other. Leading object was white with gray accents and some noteable structure, and the trailing object appeared black in color with a tinge of white reflection. At one point the leading object moves up and over the top of the trailing object and takes a position just behind it. After about 5 minutes I lose sight of them in the glare of the morning sun. After reviewing the tape I decided that it needed further study, so I sent a copy to Tom King for his expert opinion. His findings including stills and downloadable video clips of my footage can be accessed from his Skynet web site at www.ufovideo.com Later I sent a copy to Chris Miller of www.ufofootage.com. He was able to generate some great enhanced stills and video clips from the raw footage. One interesting characteristic of the first object that Chris discovered was a powerful light source emitting from the object. Only by slowing the footage down and viewing it frame by frame can you see a distinct blue to red color pattern of this light. I recently received a letter from Jeff Sainio of MUFON with results of his analysis of my video. His findings were inconclusive as he was unable to determine in any capacity what the objects are or are not. My story as well Chris Miller&apos;s comments and pictures on it can be viewed at: http://home1.gte.net/res0cs5f/ufo-1/ufo-1.htm((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC rarely allows either names or URL addresses to appear in this portion of a report on our website, but we will make an exception in this case.

The night was clear and the road was deserted except for me and a car about 20 meters behind me. Suddenly the sky was filled with a bright light, I braked hard from my surpize and looked up. I saw two round objects which seemed quite large flying VERY slowly (one slightly behind the other). They made no sound.What amased me was how slowly they flew and the amount of light they made. The &quot;flying objects&quot; were travelling from east to west.

I had driven east on Sepulveda Blvd and turned north onto Madrona (Prairie Ave), traveling north. As I was passing Del Amo Fashion Mall, I casually glanced up at the sky and saw what I first thought was the exhaust trail of a jet plane. I was going to dismiss it but it looked kind of odd. It was white and kind of short and stubby looking, like the plane had just turned on the exhaust.  The shape reminded me of the forked tail of a bird.  The thing that was most unusual was that it appeared to be at an angle that looked like the &quot;jet&quot; was diving.  This was an angle of about 60 degrees or more from the horizion.  It was sighted to my left, northwest of where I was driving. I thought it was somewhere near LAX Airport or over the ocean near the airport. Because of that angle, I began to keep my eye on it because it looked like something that was crash-diving.  I thought that it may be a meteor or space junk re-entering the atmosphere but it did not appear to move.  The trail did not get any longer and it did not dissapate.  It did appear that the two tails were merging into one. At this time I looked at my clock and the time was 7:55 PM PDT.  When I noticed that this &quot;exhaust cloud&quot; had not moved I paid closer attention because it did not act like a jet or anything leaving an exhaust trail behind.  Then at about 8:00 the exhaust cloud appeared to move!  At first I thought it was an optical illusion since I was still driving so I closed my eyes quickly and then looked back at it and it was moving!  The whole &quot;cloud&quot; had began to move! What I thought was the leading end (pointing downward) started to arch around, pulling the whole &quot;cloud&quot; with it into a horizontal line!  As it moved it began to glow and changed colors from white to a  bright orange-white line that then remained stationary in the sky glowing orange-white.  At this point I came to a stop light where there were cars ahead of me that cau! sed the view to be obscured.  When we started to move again, this &quot;line&quot;  was still horizontal to the ground but it also seemed to be lower in the sky than before.  Unfortunately as I moved toward Hawthorne CA, the houses and trees were more dense so it was more difficult to see this object.  I continued to sight it until I reached the area of Marine Ave and Prairie Ave where it was then obscured by trees and buildings.  I stopped at my home for less than 5 minutes and then tried to spot it again as I drove toward the 105 freeway but I could no longer see the object.  I don&apos;t know how it moved away or if it did but it was no longer visible.", "It was one Saturday night at the state park in Huntsville TX. It was about 1:45am I just look at my watch and told my wife I was going to bed. We had a guest over from the next camp site, sitting and talking with us. When thru an opening in the clouds came two saucer shaped objects very fast, then they suddenly stopped and hovered over the lake.the three of us were in shock to say the least. They made no sound like an engine would, but a slight hum was all we heard.they were about 75 yards away from us and about 30 feet above the water. one of the craft emitted a very bright beam of white light into the water. I flashed my Q-Beam at them just for a second it seamed then a bright like from the second craft shot towards us at the dock.

I did not know who to report this to until I found this website and thought it important to report it even at this late date.  What I am not confused about, or my two sons, is what we saw.  We saw one night just before dark between the dates May 19 and May 27 2000, approximately May 23 a very strange circular light traveling in the sky at approximately 3000 ft. altitude, from east northeast to west southwest.  This light appeared diffused, but was obviously at a low level altitude.  The light was mostly white to pink in color and very odd.  Having been raised one mile from an airport and an Air National Gaurd airbase, as well as a father with 40 years aircraft mechanic experience and myself as a aircraft mechanic in the airforce, I have seen most every imaginable aircraft known to man.  This craft, or light, was obviously a UFO.  The sky in the backdrop was near dusk and virtualy cloudless.  The flight path that this was on carried it directly overhead.  As it approached I noticed there was no sound whatsoever.  Being alarmed by this I sent my youngest boy running in the house to retrieve a disposable camera that unfortunatly was in my vehicle at my wifes work.  As my child went to retrieve camera my other son and I continued to keep our eyes trained on said craft.  It continued its path diligently without variance.  I followed it with my eyes as far as I could until it dissapeared.  When it dissapeared I immediately went to the middle of the street looking up and down searching for someone else who seen this.  Unfortunately, there was no one.  I will conclude by saying this:  This was a UFO.  Not only to me, but to anyone who would have saw it on this earth.  Also, having lived in this town for 38 years I have learned the flight paths of aircraft in this area.  In my three years living at this house I have never seen an airplane, helicopter, durigable, or any o! ther cra ft fly in this direction.  Especially at that altitude.  For the last year I have dilligently watched the sky looking for a craft flying this direction.  To no avail.  But I gotta tell ya, the no noise thing to this day gives me goosebumps.

PD))", "Multiple, star-shaped, dim yellow lights in straight lineI saw something unusual very early in the morning on October 19, 1995. I was out back at about 1:00 am, just looking at the stars with my binoculars. There were some light clouds to the south but no moon, so it was fairly dark and quite a few stars were visible, at least for this area. (I live in Colorado Springs, CO, and city lights tend to block the stars.) I was browsing in the area about 5&ordm; north of Capella (about 50&ordm; above the horizon), when some lights came right through my field of view. There were about seven or eight distinct lights, all the same color, a dim yellow. They were shaped like four-pointed stars, all in the same orientation, but not point-to-point. They were in almost a straight line formation, with the line perpendicular to their direction of travel. Two or three of them near the ends were behind the line. They were quite close together, but not in what looked like a normal flight formation--just a group. They were traveling in a straight line, and fairly quickly. My first thought was that some low-flying object had crossed my field of view and was very out of focus, so I quickly tried to focus on the object, but discovered that it was in fact already in focus, and that the lights were really shaped like that. Also, I have very high-quality binoculars, and when lights are out of focus, they don&apos;t become star-shaped, they become blurry dots. Just to confirm this, I studied some real airplanes and stars later, adjusting the focus to both extremes. I could not make them look anything like the lights I saw. Furthermore, when I looked at them naked-eye, I could still see the star-shape. The lights traveled from the northeast to the south-southwest, passing almost directly overhead. They traversed about 90&ordm; in about ten seconds, keeping a constant speed, as far as I could tell. Their formation changed slightly; I believe they moved a little closer together, with the ones behind the main line moving a little toward the middle of the line. It&apos;s possible, of course, that the apparent change in the formation was just a change in the perspective as they passed, but my impression at the time was that their positions relative to each other did change slightly. I would guess they were no higher than an airliner&apos;s cruising altitude, and probably quite a bit lower. I may have the impression they were lower because I could see the shape of the lights (not just pinpoints of light like an airplane), and because they traversed the sky so quickly. If they were higher, they would have been huge and extremely fast. This is possible, of course, but my impression was they were somewhat lower in altitude. On the other hand, I never heard any noise, and if they were a normal aircraft traveling at a normal altitude, I would surely have heard the engines. As they passed overhead, I had to momentarily look down while I turned to face them. Since I knew what to look for and about where they would be in the sky, I found them again naked eye without any trouble. But I realized that they were faint enough that if I had not seen them through the binoculars first, I doubt I would have ever noticed them naked eye. While looking at them naked eye, the line of their formation was about the width of a finger tip at arms length. In trying to figure out what they might have been, I&apos;ve been trying to eliminate possibilities. I do not believe the light could have been reflected from the sun or earth, because the object or objects were almost directly overhead in the middle of the night. They would have been in Earth&apos;s shadow. The moon did not come up for a few more hours, so I don&apos;t think they could have been reflecting light from it. It seems they were generating their own light somehow. (Admittedly, though, I may not understand the relative positions of the sun, the moon, and the Earth well enough for these assumptions to be correct.) The lights did not appear to be exhaust from rocket engines because of the star-shape and the fact that they did not leave an exhaust trail. They also left no contrail, even though an airplane that flew over just a couple minutes later left a contrail that could be seen for several minutes. I could not see any vehicle or structure connecting the lights. They looked like separate objects. I did not, however, think to look for stars passing between them. The pattern and color of their lights was clearly not that of a conventional aircraft such as an airplane or helicopter (no wingtip lights, the wrong color, and not blinking). Also, they moved too quickly to be an aircraft, unless it was quite low. If it was that low, I would have been able to both hear it and make out its shape. I don&apos;t believe it could have been multiple aircraft, first because of the pattern of lights, and nobody but a precision flying team could have been that close together. If it had been a precision flying team, I also would have heard their engines. If they were high enough so I could not hear their engines, they would have been a much smaller formation, and the lights would have been pinpoints, not star-shaped. It was clearly not either a meteor or satellite. If it was a military craft (which we see a lot of around here), it was not heading toward any of the local military installations. In fact, if it was any conventional aircraft, it was not following any of the usual flight patterns we see here. In short, I have not been able to think of any conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon that this could have been.

The size of the craft was around 40 feet in diameter hovering about 200 feet above the house. It was emitting a loud, distorted noise that could have been music. It was spinning slightly and moving at about 25-35 mph. It was saucer shaped and had various lights around the vehicle. The time was around 3 to 5 o&apos;clock in the day. After staring in awe for around 10 seconds, I ran to  the front porch thinking where I could find a camera inside. I decided that I would miss the opportunity to see the craft again and therefore turned to watch the craft float off into the distance. My Mother, Brother, and I all stared at each other in bewilderment. My conclusion after all these years is that the research on the 1965 &apos;Abrocar&apos; experiment in Nevada was not cancelled. From my research, the hovering vehicle was manufactured in somewhere in Nevada and flown and tested in an air force base in Canada.

It was late evening - early morning on the night of March 31-April 1, 1966. (This is a date I will always remember) A friend of mine and I had picked up another friend from work who worked the afternoon shift at an auto plant and were returning to the driver of the vehicles home in Dearborn, Michigan.  I was 19 at the time. My two friends were 17 and 24. We were heading north on Monroe street.  We had just drove past Outer Drive when I had a very strange feeling. About a block past Outer Drive, Monroe makes about a 45% turn to the left. It is just past that point when we all spotted a &quot;Space Craft&quot; hovering over a Public swimming pool/playground located at an elementary school off to our left.  I use the word Space Craft, because it was NOT a UFO as we saw it VERY clear.  It was about 200 feet from us at about 50-75 feet in the air. We saw it so clear that we could see the partitions that seperated the crafts lit up windows.  It was boomerang shaped with a row of large bright white windows. It was about 75 feet wide.  The craft had a red glowing light on it underside with smaller lights on it left and right side. It made no sounds.  The only unusual sounds were a static noise on the radio in the car we were in when we were near the craft. As we stopped to watch it, my friend who was driving, blinked the cars head lights at it.  This is when it started to move slowly. The rest of the details of that night are not clear except that I remember we followed it (were led by it) for about 10 minutes and that it seemed to land it a wooded area West of Telegraph road at an area that was then known as Crowley Park. This is when the rest of the nights becomes cloudy in my memory...until sometime after when we went running into a all night Hamburger diner on Telegraph Road.  There were two persons in the diner that also saw the craft as it was flying away from the area. All three of us had (and I still do) a lump in our ear lobe after the encounter.  I have not seen the other two that were with me in several years, so I can not say if they still have the lump or not.  I have been haunted by VERY BAD dreams and odd things happening to me from that night on.  It was just recently that I remembered another encounter some seven or eight years later with a HUGE craft. All the details of that encounter are slim in my mind. I hope to some day be hypnotised to bring all of the memories out...and to have the lump under my ear lobe removed and studied.", "ufo over mountians,two men went missingIN Nov on 1972 my mom, was home with my two older sisters and older brother.

She told some people what she saw. but they didnt think it had anything to do with it. about week later around midnight the dogs started barking again trying to jump the fence again, towards the mountian. This time she stayed inside and looked for the light again.She saw the light again dropping behind the mountian. she stayed at the widow to see if she could see the come up again. about 20 mins later the light came up ,and took off towards the west. the next day my dad came home from work..he hauled stuff for a living. she told him what he saw and about the men missing.And how she thought it was a ufo.He laughed at her.But a few days later they went into town and read in the paper the men was found at their camp,with some kind of gliter stuff on their colths.and didnt know where they have been.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I arose from the sofa to slip back to bed when a bright reddish orange triangle shaped object caught my attention in the night sky.  The blinds were open on the patio door and the bright light was first visible in the top upper left corner of the door as the bright object became descending toward me.  At first I thought it was a falling airplane but realized it was a UFO.  My glasses were in the bedroom so I turned and started yelling, &quot;There&apos;s something in the sky!&quot;  My husband and I met in the bedroom door and I told him to look out the patio door as I groped around in the dark for my glasses.  When I got back to the den, my granddaughter was on her knees in the playpen looking out the door where my husband was also standing and looking.  The blinds over the double windows on the left wall were also open (we lived in a rural area with few trees and no outside lights).  Through those windows, this huge object, changing colors, making a droning noise, was rolling about 30 ft off the ground and apx 20 ft from the house.  It was spectacular!  I thought it was crashing.  The shape of the object had changed from triangular to cylindrical but was all ablur with the changing colored lights and the rolling motion.  It went directly behind our house and three small white planes enterred it from different directions, very fast like bees.  As it cleared the small hill behind our property, it shot a bright green star at us that got larger as it came closer then seemed to just fade out.  We marveled over the event for a few minutes, and surprisingly enough, went back to bed and to sleep (including the baby) and didn&apos;t mention it again for approximately forty hours. This was reported in the Dallas Morning News on December 10, 1990, as a Soviet booster rocket plunging to earth.  However, their archived story is somewhat different from the story that was actually printed in the newspaper. We witnessed the event in Canton, Texas which is fifty-five miles east of Dallas.

At 21:24 I noticed a small, bright, diffuse disc in the sky over the ocean seaward of a point of land up the coast from us.  I estimated its elevation with my hand, finding that the disc was just over the tip of my middle finger when my outstretched hand was held vertically at arm&apos;s length with the heel ofthe palm placed on the sealevel horizon: roughly 18 cm at 60 cm distance, or ~.3 radian or ~17-18 degrees.The disc was circular, quite bright and pearly white, with no trace of color that we could see. I&apos;d estimate its total brightness as equal to Venus at its brightest; the sky was still fairly light, and no starswere visible.  The object was definitely extended rather than point-like.  At a guess, it was three resolution-units across: perhaps 6 arc minutes, or a small but significant fraction of the width of the fullmoon.  No internal detail was noticeable, but there seemed to be some limb darkening.Thinking that the object might be a balloon (many years ago I saw a Skyhook balloon just before sunset, and the appearance was somewhat similar), I stood against a light pole and observed its position relative to another pole.  No movement was perceptible over a period of a few minutes.  We then approached a Spanish family sitting on a bench on the promenade and asked if they knew what the object was.  They didn&apos;t, but said that they had been watching it for a while and it hadn&apos;t seemed to move. (Nobody around seemed to be more than mildly curious about the object)We watched for a few more minutes until approximately 21:35, during which time the object didn&apos;t move or change appearance, and then returned to our room in the Melia. I got my compass from the suitcase, went onto the balcony, and tried to locate the object. By that time, 21:42, at the approximate location of the object (as estimated from its azimuth relative to the point of land mentioned above and elevation measured by the hand-at-arms-length method) there was a bright star-like object redder, fainter, and more point-like than the object we had been watching.  The magnetic bearing read off the compass (which was likely affected to some extent by the steel structure of the hotel) was due east to within a couple of degrees.  My wife, who was helping me make this measurement, was doubtful that the object I was sighting on was the one seen earlier, due to its considerably different appearance.((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as a former technical intelligence analyst.

I took off the clips and it was white with what looked like a corona.  It was very far up and/or very small.  I looked around and no one was looking up so I followed it about 20 degrees across the sky.  I looked around again and when I found it again there was two.

I was probably about 11 years old at the time. We were in Bandon, OR, visiting my grandparents, probably during summer vacation. It was probably not before 1978 and not after 1984. At the time there was an empty field behind (SW of) the house where my father and I were laying on a blanket watching a meteor shower, probably the Perseids, so it probably occurred on the night of August 11 or 12. It was perhaps an hour or two after sunset, around 10:00PM PDT. I think there was no moon, so I&apos;m guessing that the year was 1980 based on star charts. It was breezy, and there were some low clouds to the S and SE, but most of the rest of the sky was clear. No precipitation. We saw what appeared to be a searchlight turn on, illuminating the clouds to the S, between 15 and 30 degrees above the horizon. No beam was visible. The illumination was moving N toward us, following a smooth arc toward the W. By the time the light reached the edge of the clouds it had slowed down slightly and was travelling approximately W. This was about 3 or 4 seconds after I had first noticed it. It was somewhere between 50 and 70 degrees above the horizon. At this point I was surprised (and very frightened!) to see a featureless glowing white disk emerge from the clouds. Apparently the clouds had been illuminated by this disk flying through or slightly above them, rather than by a ground-based searchlight. Not sure how high it was. The light had appeared slightly fuzzy as it moved through the clouds, but against the clear sky it was a definite disk with sharply defined edges. Not quite as bright as the full moon, and slightly smaller than two moons side by side. It looked solid (opaque). It continued on its smooth arc and flew off toward the SW, gaining speed and diminishing in brightness. The elapsed time from when it emerged from the clouds until it was no longer visible was about 2 or 3 seconds. We jumped up, hurried indoors and told our other family members about it. I was too scared to go outside again. There was no sound, no blinking. I don&apos;t recall any other air traffic in the area. There was nothing in the local paper the next day. I considered reporting it to MUFON at the time, but didn&apos;t, since we had no photos. Now I wish I had at least written it down because it&apos;s hard to remember details that long ago. Now my father only remembers &quot;seeing something strange&quot; that we were both &quot;pretty excited about.&quot; I remember more detail than he does, maybe because I was so scared and because I considered reporting it and thought about how I would describe it.

I am an engineering drafter of 24 years. Observer #2: My close friend who was a waitress, and the driver of the vehicle we were in during this event. While traveling East on the Ventura fwy (hwy 101), our car approached the halfway point between Winnetka Blvd &amp; Tampa Blvd (this would be at Corbin Ave) when the event began. As the passenger in the front seat, I had been facing to my left (North) while speaking with my friend. At this point near Cornin Ave, I took brief notice of an intense, red light in the far corner of my left eye. I assumed for a split second that a helicopters nav light was responsible for the bright glow. What initially drew my attention was the low altitude of the objects flight path(approx 90-120ft): By looking level thru the drivers side windows, the object was clearly visible. I looked away momentarily as I was in conversation, but returning my stare almost immediately. &quot;It&quot; was travelling East, slightly faster than traffic (65mph) and was moving parallel to the fwy trafic. With my attention now sharply focused on the object in question, we could see that 5 (five) objects were clearly in a flight formation: a straight, level line extending perpendicular to the fwy structure, and only about 200-300ft from the fwy. The objects were identical in every describable aspect,... and all were sparkling (not flaming) beautiful red spheres. The spheres were approx 30ft in diameter, and approx 120ft center-to-center. Not only were background urban features visible between spheres, but very subtle, yet distinct vertical variations of the altitude of individual spherical entities confirmed that they were indeed not (physically observable) conjoined entities. During this entire event, at no point did the entities appear to deviate from the estimated altitude/speed/direction/distance: Making for an exceptional viewpoint for us, for the duration. Beyond the point being perpendicular to my vehicle (&amp; while the entities briefly appeared as a singularity) and where &quot;individuals&quot; were clearly visible again, something radical in their orientation to one another developed rapidly. Each of the outermost two spheres began, simultaneously, to close the gap between its nearest neighbor in flight: encroaching on the sphere next to it!: I feared some sort of accident and/or crash. However, there were no visible cautionary measures taken by the two spheres apparently being jeopardized. In fact, the moving two entities simply continued on their collision course, to eventually meld with the neighboring spheres: All of which now totalled three! Very soon afterwards (only seconds), the outermost pair of entities embarked on the same course of action as their previously described counterparts,... and melded with the central spherical figure, and with the same methodical ease! Only one entity existed now. Note: At no point did any sphere, individual or combined or &quot;transitional&quot;, exhibit any deviation from the original observed color/shape/speed/altitude/direction. Within a few moments, our &quot;companion&quot; sphere (now approx 1/4mi ahead of us) quite casually split into two distinct entities,... and similarly, each of the new pair divided themselves, now formimg a group of four individuals. This talley was not observed to change. It appeared as though the unusual &quot;transformations&quot; within this event transpired over approx one minute. Since &quot;they&quot; had been travelling slightly faster than traffic, the theatrics of combining &amp; dividing had ceased when the group of spheres was approx 1/2-3/4mi ahead of my vehicle. By their brightness, this new group of four spheres was clearly visible up to approx 2mi away. The pitch of the fwy eventually severed our line-of-sight view. We were left astonished. It seems evident that my friend &amp; I were in perfect position to view the intelligent flight management display of either directly or remotely operated craft,... or simply that of &quot;Light Beings&quot; or pure consiousness. I am to this day, grateful for that night. This was my 8th sighting, and the 2nd for my friend, who also saw her first one with me approx 6mo earlier.

It was moving at a very high rate of speed with only one light to be seen from the ground and one other light underneath which pulsed intermittantly. I have watched the skies for many years because I am an aircraft enthusiast, but I have no doubt that this was no man-made aircraft simply due to the high rate of speed that it traveled at. It didn&apos;t zig-zag or anything, but it cleared the length of the sky in under 2 minutes. I would estimate it&apos;s altitude at 10,000 feet. This object made no sound which also leads me to believe that it was not a man-made craft.", "page not availablecraft about 2K feet altitude, very bright forward light and three in a triangle. the very bright (white)light just to the rear of the smaller forward light.

Partying with my friends at Daddy Rocks (nightclub). I went to get some fresh air up on the top floor outdoor deck. I see about 30 spectators (including 3 security doormen) lookin&apos; to the sky, claping and screaming in joy. I look up and see, what seems to be flying stars. I instantly know there not stars becuase the way they are moving. There where lots (probably around a hundred all together). I would see some moving as a group (like 5 or 6) ,but not in Unisen, all where traveling at there own speed and direction. they would fly in one direction then pause in one spot then dart off in the oppisite direction. They would fly up then down and zig zag across the sky. I seen some fly in real close to each other, pause next to each other, then dart of in different directions. There was huge lights at this club that shot up in the sky (around 8 lights formed in a circle) that would go left to right, right to left. When these lights went to the right hand side of the sky (where most of the UFO&apos;s where) the UFO&apos;s would get brighter and more active (almost like it was putting on a show for us). At one point about 8-10? UFO&apos;s joined in what seemed a sloppy circle in the sky, paused for a brief couple seconds, then they all darted off in there own direction. (kind of like a childs drawing of the sun. They took off like the lines around the circle). I seen a few that seemed like they where goin so fast towards each other like they where goin to crash, but they went right by each other (real close). After about a half hour of seeing this, I went into the club and tried gettin all my friends to come out and see what I seen, there first reaction was that I was high or drunk and was seeing things, after getting up on the deck though they relized I wasn&apos;t seeing things. They too seen what appeared to be UFO&apos;s.

It was very loud and i thought it was coming from the sky so i looked up and i saw a bright flash of light. It was so intense that i turned away and i remember the sensation of falling.The next thing i knew i was opening my eyes to find the light from the street lamps shining on me.

First the apparent movement was to the west, but a few minutes later when the lights reappeared they stayed on and moved to the east. We also noticed several blinking white pinpoints of light in the general area of the larger orange lights. These appeared as twinkling stars, except that they did not appear to be stationary, actually they were more random in their position. The Orange lights at their largest might have been about half the diameter of a dime held out at arms length. I estimate our distance from the objects to be about 1.5 - 2 miles. we watched from our car out on some country roads. We saw them from two close locations (about 50 yards appart), and got out of the car and watched them both times.

While we were filming the moon, I saw a large dull red object with a tail go through the sky. It appeared to fall from the moon, then it did a turn and headed in a southerly direction .  As much as we tried to capture it on film we didn&apos;t, by the time my husband was pointing the camera in the right direction it was gone. Some strange things happened during this time frame.  All  of the neighborhood dogs were barking and even the two cows that live next door were &quot;mooing&quot;. When we re-wound the tape to see if we caught the object that I saw, a low range, pulsating noise came through on the video that we did NOT hear audibly while filming. It went from soft to  very load and appeared as if it was coming towards us then it sounded as though it  went right through us!  It got very soft going away from us , then it disappeared. It was the oddest noise, kind of like something pulsating under water with a slight&quot; swishing in water&quot; sound too.  My husband said that it sounded like an ultrasound of an unborn baby, you know that swishing pulsing muffled sound. Anyway, the dogs and the cows all calmed down  right after this occurrence as well. My husband and I looked at one another and said, &quot;what the heck was that?&quot; and we both asked each other,&quot; did you hear that at all while we were filming&quot; ? My husband thought that something was wrong with the camera, so we filmed more stuff and it worked beautifully. Neither one of us heard anything except the normal background noises, you know, cars and of course the dogs and the cows.  We live out in a rural area on a one acre parcel. Most of the local houses are on acreage and the dogs don&apos;t bark unless someone or something has caught their attention. As for the cows, they  don&apos;t make any noise at night ever, that we can remember.  We are wondering if this  was a sound that we could NOT hear but the animals were hearing !  The animals all appeared agitated as well as uneasy.  FYI, we live in an area a little east of Mc Cord Air force base and Fort Lewis army base.

Minor spelling changes, made at request of witness.  PD))HUGE circular object which hovered over the North Brunswick, NJ intersection of Route 1 and Route 130 in the late 1970&apos;s or early 1980I was driving  home from Woodbridge New Jersey going south on Route 1.  From a distance away I could see something up ahead that I had never seen before.  I traveled that road every day. That particular day I stayed later for a meeting.  As I came upon the circle which connects Route 1 and Route 130 in North Bruswick, there was a HUGH circular craft hovering over the circle. It was HUGH, the size of a city block.  It made no sound, just hovered.  It had colorful lights on the bottom.  I pulled alongside the highway near what use to be the NJ Boys Scouts Headquarter and just sat and gawked at it.  Many people had parked along the highway to observe.  I left before it did.  I wanted to rush home to bring back a family member to see it but no one believed me when I told them about it.  I never went back.  Since that date I make it a point of watching the Discovery channel or History channel or whatever show has to do with UFO&apos;s in the hope that I&apos;ll see a story about that incident but I never have.

In my report, please correct HUGH to HUGE and in the description of the craft, you might want to replace the CIRCLE description with the word DISK.

I suspect the incident may have gained some publicity in local papers, but that is only a guess.There is a celebrated case in which a strange craft allegedly fired a &quot;beam of light&quot; and shattered a window in a building in Bergen County (??), NJ, but I do not remember the date.  It allegedly occurred in a building that was located somewhere near where Meadow Lands Sports Stadium currently sits.Also, if you can ever &quot;reconstruct&quot; the date of your sighting, please let us know.  We know from experience that people often can come within a week or month, if they sit and think about what they were doing at the time, why they were driving, what car they had or what clothing they were wearing, etc..  In addition, fuel receipts, cancelled checks, credit card entries, etc., are all very helpful in this respect.Thank you for taking the time to share the sighting with our Center!Cordially,Peter Davenport((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))For the sake of argument, use tHe 4/79 date.  I would like to see my report entered into the database just because it  may spark the interest of one of the other people that  was also parked along the highway.  That person may end up having a more accurate fix on the exact date.  Believe me I have tried to reconstruct that day in my mind for what seems like an eternity.  I know the date is a vital link.  Normally, I have a good memory but for some reason that exact date escapes me.  I presume you have already read the report I submitted.  Isn&apos;t that why you just contacted me?     I know this is really going to top off the cake but the closest picture I have ever come across which resembles what I saw is one fleeting moment of a spaceship in the movie &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;  Not the aircraft where they communicate back and forth with sounds but earlier in the picture. If I could get a picture of the craft used in that movie, I could pinpoint exactly what I saw looked like.  The one in the movie didn&apos;t stay on the screen for long but when I saw it, I almost jumped out of my skin.

During the annual Blue Angels Show at Pensacola Beach, I wittnessed a Chrome Sphere hovering over the Santa Rosa Sound, (the body of water the separates Gulf breeze from Pensacola Beach). At the time I was working at the beach as a lifeguard so I had seen the Blue Angels show all week as they practiced. On the final show, (a Saturday), the sky was clear and the beach was crowded. I had &quot;Dune Duty&quot;, which meant that I was to stand on a tall sand dune next to our &quot;shack&quot; in case I had to administer first aid to someone. Now, I&apos;m faceing south, as is the airshow guests as the Blue Angels are flying over the Gulf of Mexico at Pensacola Beach. So keep in mind that people are not generally going to be looking behind them to Santa Rosa Sound to the North. Seeing the Angels all week made me notice that they were &quot;off a bit&apos; this day. Their Friday show was much cleaner than today. The Diamond formation looked sloppy and other details were picked up by me and the other guards. In the middle of the show the Angels anouncer stated that the show would be delayed because someone was in their airspace. I followed one of the jets with my eye as it broke from the diamond and he went out over &quot;the sound&quot;. I was now faceing North. Then I saw a glint and it was a chrome sphere hovering over &quot;the sound.&quot; The F-18 closed on it and came right at the sphere, in a blur the Sphere was gone. It seemed to &quot;disapear&quot;, but I saw a blur above where it was and think that it must of climbed rapidly in the direction of the blur. Later that day on the evening news, a F-16 was reported to have crashed in a neighborhood in Pensacola. That Neighborhood where the crash occured is close to Escambia Bay. The only thing that separates Escambia Bay from Santa Rosa Sound, is a thin Penensula known as Gulf Breeze. I remember thinking that the F-16 crash, the UFO and the stoppage of the Blue Angels Show, were connected. (an airshow stoppage which I&apos;ve never seen growing up in Pensacola and having seen the Angels several times). As far as I know I am the only witness. This sighting had the potential for 1000s of witnesses. But I have never heard anyone with a story like this. I may have been the only wittness. I don&apos;t have the exact date correct. But I know it was the Blue Angels show at pensacola beach in 1996.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will attempt to confirm the date, which should not be too difficult, given that the date of Blue Angel performances is published.  Also, the date of the F-16 crash should be easy to establish from newspaper records.  If anyone can help with the exact date, we would be grateful.

It was a cloudy night , so we thought there was no way that we would see anything.  The were no stars, the moon was barely visable, but one of the UFO&apos;s was in the same area as the night before, however with the fog, or clouds, we did not get a good look.  This is no joke.

PD))Small, clear, blinking object seen in northern WyomingI was going to college in Sheridan, WY and going to my parents house in Buffalo on the weekends to do laundry, get mail, get food, visit, etc.  I arrived at their house at about 10:30 p.m. on a Friday night.  My parents were gone camping and their neighbors to the right were on vacation, across the street were on vacation and the house to the left was empty, so the neighborbood was unusually dark and quiet.  I brought my clothes in the house and some other luggage through the back door, which is seldom used, because I wanted to a have a cigarrette on the back deck.  I brought everything through the back door and sat on the couch and turned the televsion on.  I sat their for a couple of minutes flipping through the channels when I realized that I was going to have a smoke.  I jumped up and quickly walked to back door which has a window beside it that faces the living room I was sitting in.  I opened the door, stepped out onto the deck, turned to my left, and saw something hovering about three feet away from me, apparently looking in the window.  It was a small, clear, long and thin object.  It kind of looked like a beaker with a yellow light in the center that had a steady, rythmic yellow flash and didn&apos;t make a sound.  When I saw it and it had seen me, it floated away from the window and a little closer to me.  I wanted to reach out and grab it, but I was a little scared.  Plus it kind of looked like it may be hot or even sharp or anything that could cause sever pain.  I hovered there and kind of checked me out for about 15 to 20 seconds, then slowly flew toward a large pine tree in our neighbors yard.  It looked like it was trying to hide from me behind the tree, but I could still see it&apos;s steadily blinking yellowish light through the branches.  Every once in a while it would come out from behind the tree a little ways, see me, then hide back behind the branches.  After a minute or so, it slowly rose into the sky.  It went higher and higher until I lost sight of it what seemed like about a mile up in ! the sky. After I stood and looked closer, I could see a yellow light flashing way the hell up in the sky and I thought it might be an airplane.  After a few seconds, however, it flew across the sky very, very fast, hovered up there for a while, then slowly lowered itself until it was on the other side of the neighbors house, exactly where they had window facing South.  After about 10 seconds, I saw it again hovering just over the neighbors house, then it slowly floated back off into the neighborhood and disappeared.  I went inside shut the windows, locked the doors and didn&apos;t leave until the next morning when I went up the mountain to tell my parents what I had seen.", "A large circular flying object with flashing lights on it.Well the lights seemed to crackle and caught my attention. I went to the window and they flashed but flashed longer than a plane. It was HUGE, on elight on each side. They flashed simultaneously and flashed many colours like orange, green, blue, red and pink. I don&apos;t know how to describe that it wasn&apos;t a plane but let me assure you IT WASN&apos;T. It moved at a fair speed though a bit slower than a plane i should think. Afterwards i heard this &quot;wooshing&quot; sound, I think there were magnetic effects as it sounds weird but my sister was sick and she&apos;s often sick at full moons i think due to the magnetic effects", "It was a bright,orangish,circular light that slowly and silently traveled east in the sky.My husband and I were coming home after visiting some friends, shortly after midnight. When we got e on the highway I looked out the window and saw what appeared to be the space station.

Then I realized that despite all that,it was too late to be the station. The station always sets around ten o&apos;clock, it was now after tweleve.

That&apos;s when I noticed a very bright yellowish light shining through the trees; the light it emitted shone on my pool cover.  Admittedly, the light was obscured because of the trees so I don&apos;t know the true shape.  The light was fairly close to the left of the moon, as it faces the earth.  I do not know if what I saw was a planet or a star and I&apos;m hoping someone can let me know if that is the case.

Was generally stationary but would move a few degrees left or right. Called for wife and daughter. Daughter ran back in scared,(16 year old). Soon noticed a second object, same as the first maybe 30 degrees East of first. First object moved quickly East, then settled back to stationary. Scanned more and saw two more, much more distant and in upper sky than first two. One of them moved towards the other, then settled into stationary. They then would fade, then come back later to near the same position. Got neighbors across the street, one is a deputy sheriff and observed from their yard. Discovered two more, one on horrizon, one in directly overhead position. Overhead object looked massive, lights were constant white, but it bobbed like the rest. Western most object disappeared, but came back a short time later. An aircraft passed the overhead object, only a blind pilot would not have seen this. Sparse, very thin clouds moved in, objects were far above clouds. Was able to tell that the objects were massive in size, especially the directly overhead one by the clouds and stars. Could clearly see the movements by putting an object in line with a roofline or tree limb. All of the objects were to the North and West of me with the exception of the more overhead object. This is in the direction of the Shreveport metro area. I viewed for 3 hours and finally went to bed. I made repeated attempts to call ufo hotlines with no success. I wanted to call the sheriff&apos;s dept. but my wife protested. I did have a deputy as a witness, so just as well. I tried to film, but my camcorder wouldn&apos;t pick the light up. I will look again tonight. I have lived here for 20 years and have seen nothing like this in my life.

As I stepped off the porch in the back yard I looked back, over the roof of my house, to the West. There I first saw the bright orange light. It was due west when I first caught sight of it.  There were a number of trees blocking my view, yet I could see that it traveled at a very high rate of speed.  It moved quite a bit faster than any plane I had ever seen.  I would say it took about 5 seconds to travel from where I first saw it to the west until it disappeared from my view to the North.  I would say it was around 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon.  There was no sound nor was there any trail of sparks. It appeared to travel straight and level. I wrote down notes about the sighting the next day. I didn&apos;t know what to do about it at the time.

A group of engineers and scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory went to Big Bear Lake for a weekend trip. We had an 8 inch Celestron telescope with a 25 mm eyepiece. We were at a campground west of the lake on a rise. We viewed small aircraft landing at the airport, east of the lake. The sun was behind us and near setting as we watched. The aircraft were landing from south to north, or right to left. With the telescope we could make out the N numbers on the planes. I noticed a few clouds, but the sky was generally clear. The aircraft seemed to be landing in front of a stationary object at some distance to the east. The object was below ten degrees above the horizon. Perhaps four or five planes landed in front of this object, which could have been miles further away. Two other people viewed the object. The object was a long cigar shape. While watching, the object suddenly changed attitude, like a disk tipping and the &quot;cigar&quot; appearance became an oval. It then moved away from us and was gone in under a few seconds. It made the impression of a thin metallic disk, seen in profile as a cigar while stationary, and then being seen more rounded as it tipped away from us. There was no sound, lights, exhaust or other features. There were no lenticular clouds in the area or evidence of inversion layers.

As any one who has ever seen a U.F.O. can relate, I had kind of an empty feeling after my sightings. I could not tell you for sure what I had seen, only that it was truly an object that was flying and unidentifiable. The experience has never been explained to my saisfaction. The first time I saw something was in about 1979-80 the time was (pretty late I&apos;d say 10pm) in Huntington Beach Calif. A group of friends and I had just come out of my parents second floor apartment, my buddy Brad saw it first; he had looked up to see the incessantly bothersome Police Helicopter that circles Orange County. This helicopter has a spotlight that it shines on criminals and the like, any way it tends to get a person&apos;s attention. We saw Brad looking up so we looked up, behind the copter, much higher in the sky was a grouping of bright white lights they were so white bright they were emitting a prism effect. They were in a triangular grouping not a formation, it seemed like one craft.  There were very high clouds that night and the light for this craft was reflecting off the clouds. We all were looking up at this thing as it stood still in the sky! Then we called my folks out of the house and even the neighbor came out see what was going on. So it was not just me, there was 7 people that witnessed this craft. Now the weird part; this thing started moving across the sky very slow, then it would stop. We realized the police officers in the copter might also have been seeing this. They were trying to get the spot light to shine up, I do not think the spot light was meant to go up. However, they were trying to do it. This thing started moving again then made ninety degree turns! It even went backwards once. We got a good look for almost 10 minutes. The lights were intense, it was nothing natural, and it was not a jet. The light sparkled all colors, a very beautiful site. Then it started moving one direction a little quicker, and then it accelerated across the sky so fast it vanished, this really happened! Right over the city yet, not out in the desert like you think. We talked about it over the years, we were no dummies it was not a plane or a Vandenberg launch (seen many of those) this was a craft, truly a Unidenfied Flying Object.

No other lights were noticed in between the other white lights. These lights were very high up, probably much higher than any air plains that fly over and the three white lights were the same size as many other stars, as well as being as bright as many other stars. The reason it caught our eye was the formation the three white lights were flying in and they remained in that position flying at a steady pace overhead towards south Jersey. There was also no sound, it was very quite. The sky was very clear. While quietely watching the triangle of three lights fly over head in a straight line a sudden scurry of birds flew out of the trees behind us very quickly. I always thought it was unusual for many birds to want to fly in the dark especially in an area without much light around. After about 12 - 16 seconds of watching the flight pattern, we watched as the one front light went out (disappeared) quickly, which then the second white light then went out about a second after the first one and then the third light went out, dissappeared, after the second one, until there were no more lights to be witnessed. It was&apos;nt that the object had flown way out of our sight and slowly faded out, rather it had not flown that far off before the lights started to go out one by one. I did not have my camera equipment with me on this night. Now a days my camera equipment goes every where with me. We had never seen an air craft with lights like this do this sort of thing. It had also seemed that this craft had to of been very high up because of the size of the lights and could not get an idea of speed. After we calmed down and discussed what was unsual with this object compared to an air craft/ air plane we finally headed home.

I got a friend of mine to take a look and he also thought this was very strange. We drove to downtown towards the college, didn&apos;t see anything. Took a right turn on a side street and I spotted it flying over buildings (I was not driving) like it was trying to race with us for about 40 seconds. All of a sudden it was gone, so I told my friend to pull over and park. We walked to the next street over which is Telegraph. Their were a few people standing at a bus stop.

We got a late start, and did most of the driving well after dark. We passed through Moab, Utah and continued South. I had never been passed Moab, and was surprised when we started passing through some hills on a small two lane highway that was surrounded on both sides of the road by Lodgepole Pines.

We both sat speachless at a dead stop in the road, and watched as the three still lights started to rotate as if it were one. They rotated round and round for a few seconds and then all of the sudden the three lights shot off in the three oppisite directions that each of the &quot;points&quot; of the triangle were pointing towards. That was it... we sat in the middle of the dark desolate highway for a few moments trying to make sense of it. Our third friend asleep in the back never realized what went on while he slept in a car in the middle of the desert.

I was about 5 miles from the toll booth and it took about 5 minutes for the object to intersect my truck at the zenith (toll both). I paid my toll, went down about 1/2 mile and pulled off to the shoulder of the road. It was very, very low and the far left light had a single red strobe. My wife got out and we measured this object with our outstretched arms. It was very huge and covered the distance of about 5 normal sized human hands. Almost like looking at a 747 a couple of hundred feet above the tarmac at an airport. This object made no engine noise. No turbines, no prop, no nothing. To be honest, I was completely amazed at the lack of engine noise. This object was triangle-shaped. Similar to a boomarang but with well-defined sharp corners. We stood there about 2 minutes as it slowly drifted a couple more degrees southest and while still directly above us; accelerating and gaining altitude rapidly past the horizon in about 15 seconds. By the time we were able to get the camera and snap a picture it was too far away to get anything of use on the film. Needless to say, I was disappointed.

About 20 degrees up in the sky, over the horizon of the west side of Budd Inlet, a very bright white light held steady and very slowly moved up into the sky over a period of 45 minutes and then dissapeared behind the clouds. At first we thought it was a very bright star or a planet, but then it moved, and we realized it was at least 4 times as big and bright as the biggest star or satellite we had ever seen. When we viewed it in the binoculaurs, it appeared that there was a bright white &quot;electric&quot; ring buzzing around a greyish object. Interestingly, the object was just above the Fort Lewis base near Tacoma, where we can see bright flashes and feel the ground rumble whenever they test artillery - sometimes as late as 12 midnight. This may have been an experimental military aircraft, given it&apos;s location, but whatever it was, it was unlike anything we had seen before and certainly gave us all the chills.((NUFORC Note:  We have received no other reports of this incident that we are aware of.

The light did not move and I could not imagion what it could be. After watching it for two to three minutes it suddenly decreased in intensity to about one tenth of its origional brilliance and remained at that level as I watched it for another several minutes. At this point I was getting very cold and went back in to bed (to sleepin bag). The next year, late in the Spring, I walked to the ridge which has a large clearing in front of it from logging.

The size was massive and as the lights spun around, they emitted a white flame with orange red smoke.  Some cars on the freeway pulled over but I was too mesmerized and stunned. They were slow moving and were visable for at least 3 minutes.  After they had passed, I drove through a magenta fog for approximately 1 mile.

That evening looking out the kitchen door window, checking as a security measure before retiring I looked up and over towards Grayslake and just above the power lines I notice two rather large glowing objects in a stationary position.  I looked at my watch for a moment, unbelieving what I saw, it was about 2 minutes before midnight.  I quickly looked again and they were still there in the exact position in which I first spotted them.  I was awestruck and was waiting for movement, but it never occurred for about 5 minutes.  Then suddenly, the one on my left, and a little lower then the other one suddenly started moving away towards the West until I lost sight of it.

This movement on my part took no more than 1-2  minutes.  As I returned the object was still there, and as I raised the binoculars up it started moving westward, just as the other one had done earlier.  Unfortunately by the time I got the binoculars focused, it was completely gone. The objects were observed as rather large lights, but they had a oblong symmetrical shape and while watching, I had the sensation that something zoomed past my window just above the roof of my house.

He got the camera and started taking pictures.  I got on the phone and called the news station and they said I was the only call they had received and that they would check into it.  The lights were Very bright.  Three across. Kind of an orangish color.  They were situated for above the &apos;Mandalay bay&apos; hotel (that is where they looked like they were from our view) they seemed to tilt a little bit. Then one by one the lights slowly faded until they were gone.  A little while later (about 15 min.) they were back but farther towards the mountains (more towards the Stratosphere) They were in more of a chevron v.  Same thing happened but this time I called a couple of people to look and the only one to answer was my sister-in-law, but from her home she couldn&apos;t see anything.  I called another news station and the guy just laughed.  I told him we had pictures but all he said was he would check it out.", "Fireball Sighted by Child in the NorthwestI am reporting this for my nine-year-old daughter who calmly relayed this information to me the following morning. I would like to note that we do not discuss UFO topics with her, and therefore I seriously doubt that she would have dreamed this up on her own, infact I was struck by the amount of information and details that she related to me. We are guessing the time to be around 10:00 PM; she had been lying in her bed looking out the window when she saw a bright ball of fire streaking across the sky.  She said the round object was very bright with orange and red colored flames or sparks coming off the back of it, and moving very fast, faster than an airplane, and made no sound. From her description, the direction seemed to be east to west.", "possible explanation for strange sights around Nellis AFB 3/30/01This eeally doesn&apos;t qualify so much as a UFO report as a possible explanation for a report filed a couple of days ago by someone in las vegas. I used to live about 2 miles south of nellis AFB (foe about ten years) and saw large night maneuvers such as he described...with as many as thirty aircraft, and supporting aircraft such as refuelers, AWACS type aircraft, and cargo planes taking off at late evening hours and returning a short time later. Of course, some of these instances may be simply explained as one group of pilots leaving for their homes, and another group timed to arrive shortly thereafter. I have also witnessed the &quot;winking lights&quot; scenario described, though only once and it was here in the Pahrump valley, anout fifteen years ago. I saw a similar glowing ball of orangeish light, above the mountain range that sperates Pahrump valley from Death Valley area, it pulsed a total of three times that I witnessed, and in those pulses it appeared to travel some twenty or so miles northward . I saw NO chase airxraft as the other gentlrman described, and had two witnesses with me. I at first argued that it must have been a series of beacons on radio relay towers or something, but there are no towers along that range. No sound, ball was about the size of a pencil eraser on end at arms length. It would start as an amber dim glow, increasing in intensity over about five seconds, then flash out and reappear some five miles uprange. Whew! All of that said, I only have one more thought to add before I tell about my sighting. Because of the job Ihave, I have occasion to drive seventy miles at night five nights a week, and have noticed that lights can easily be seen thirty miles or so most of the time, and aircraft lights approaching MCCarran can be easily seen 50 miles away. You would never hear them, but you would see them, and a more inexperienced viewer might feel they are much closer, and therefor should make noise. Also, I have seen flares dropped by evading aircraft, and the orange lights are NOT at all the same, flares slowly fall to earth, start brightly and then dim. Now to my sighting. Its about 9 PM, I am in a hurry to get inside to watch something on TV, and as I walk westward to my door, I hear a low throb in the air. There is a small helicopter service that sometimes flys at night here, and the air-rescue helicopters from Vegas, each with their distinct sounds, and it was neither. Sometimes jets heading to MCCarran will throttle back over the Pahrump valley and the change in pitch as it bounces of the mountain ranges, and its strange, so I pause for a moment in the dark, scanning the clear night sky for any unusual movements. About thirty seconds later a pair of red flashing lights appear over the range of mountains directly to my Northwest, the foot of the range is two miles from my home, and I beleive that the lights were two of the black helicopters stationed out at Nellis, you can usually see them at the extreme North end of the airstrip if you drive LVBL North to the Speedway racetrack. Anyway, these are the two prop jobs, which fits with my recollection of the sounds from Nellis when I lived there. The two lights followed the ridge of the mountain Northwest and at one point flew below the ridgeline, obscuring them from view and masking their sound almost completely. Since the Nellis training grounds lie mainly NE of the Pahrump valley, I can only guess what they were doing flying along the NW range of PV, unless it had some thing to do with sneaking into the training area by flying low and entering from the west instead of the south or southeast, as much traffic does. Well, that is all I have to say, and I am not a debunker or anything, but I have lived near airbases since I was 8 years old. I&apos;m 40 now, and worked nights for the last six years. The report from Las Vegas seems to be a description of night manuevers, with planes chasing the Agressor aircraft, and larger planes supplying intel to the pilots, whose jobs are much more dangerous at night in a dogfight situation. The flashes could be flares, and the excersise could probably be seen if it was held in the southern end of the Nellis range and the subject lived on the side of &quot;sunrise&quot;(frenchman?) mountain, say near the intersection of Lake Mead and Hollywood, which affords an excellent view at night of Nellis AFB airstrip and views some forty miles northward. I would also guess that my helicopters were involved in a similar night action, perhaps practicing recovering a pilot downed at night. Sorry to go on so long, I just thought it would be fair to give a litlle explanation of the manuevers around Nellis AFB, since a lot of people would think military air traffic at night as strange, but at Nellis, its fairly commonplace!((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the contibutor&apos;s assessment of lights in the night sky.  They can be very difficult to identify positively.  PD))", "I have never seen any thing like it!I was on the gateway clipper ship, River Belle, when I saw this small Black speck come down from the sky and it went down like it was going to hit some trees but it made like a u turn back up!", "Possible Explanation for 9/29/1999 Lawrence, KS SightingIn your reported sightings database for Kansas there is a sighting in Lawrence, KS for 9/29/1999 at 21:37 PM (reported on 9/30/1999, with note as date changed from 2000) of a triangular craft flying over 23rd street near Checkers grocery store. My girlfriend and I saw something very similar last night (5/10/2001, at roughly 11:35 PM) from the Checkers parking lot that was definitely a jet aircraft (I think a commercial airliner). The aircraft was very low in the sky (larger than a quarter at arms length) and moving from the SW to the NE. It was moving rapidly relative to an observer on the ground, though not especially fast relative to another conventional aircraft in the sky, and due to the darkness of the sky and lighting pattern on the aircraft when viewed directly underneath it had a vague boomerang or triangular shape. However, as I was standing outside and could concentrate on watching the object (unlike the person who reported the 1999 sighting, who was driving in his car), I could barely make out an aircraft body and tail section bisecting the boomerang. The craft looked very strange when I first noticed it, as it had two unblinking(?) white lights (one on each wing) roughly 2/3 to 3/4 of the way back on each wing (measured from the body to the tip of the wing) and a single unblinking(?) red light on the body between the wings (thus the apparent V shape), but as before once I stared at it awhile I could make out the body of the aircraft. I heard no sound when it flew overhead, though as there was a thunderstorm some distance to the north (thus significant winds at the jet&amp;#8217;s altitude) that&amp;#8217;s not surprising. The jet was in sight for about 30 seconds or so (very rough time estimate). Lawrence is in the flight path of several commercial airlines stopping at MCI (Kansas City International) airport and has been for the past several years (as early as 1996 my friends and I used to sit out on the patio with cigarettes and beer and, to pass the evening hours, played a game where we would see who could see each jet first as it flew overhead from SW to NE). Between 8:00 PM and midnight dozens of jets cross over the town from SW to NE, though not usually at such a low altitude. I suspect that what the man and his wife saw on 9/29/1999 was a low altitude jet on approach to MCI.", "Mass sighting of a shiny metallic sphereThe event occured when I was a child.  I came out of my home with my mother to visit my aunt up the street.  As we stepped out of the house, we noticed right away in the north sky (direction we were walking towards) a static shiny metallic silver sphere.  It was a clear, sunny day so that this object seemed out of place and as a result there were lots of people on the street pointing and gazing at this object.  My mother and I did not stop walking, and on the way to my aunt&apos;s house, my mother ran into a friend, who was also looking at this strange object.  He happened to have a pair of binoculars, and my mother took a look, and so did I.  No more details of the object could be discerned through the binoculars, though it seemed to give certain off colours as light reflected off it, kind of like a disco ball.  Now, after a half hour of looking at this seemingly still object, we went over to my aunt&apos;s house.  We walked back home later on that night, and the object was no longer visible.  I had been thinking about this object all day and later on that night we saw a news report on it on TV.  Apparently the same object had been and filmed not only in my home city of Valparaiso, but also in Santiago, Punta Arenas, Buenos Aires and other cities and towns in Chile and Argentina all within one day.  They showed clip of the object, which looked the same as the one I had witnessed.  It was said on the news that it was not a weather balloon as many that had seen the object suspected, and that it had been witnessed by thousands of people.  Nothing else was made of this event, and I never heard of it again.  Even though I was a child at the time, I can still remember the object looming in the north sky, and I&apos;m sure that it could not have been explained by any natural phenomenon.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

One night seceral of us Airmen had dragged a keg of beer out in the middle of the desert to party and blow off a little steam.  As you can imagine not much else to do there.  About 2AM i was getting tired and wanted to go back to the dorm and go to sleep.  The Friend that had given me a ride wanted to stay.  Since the base was only about 3 or 4 miles away i decided to walk.  It was December so it was cold.  I was wearing a military parka so I didn&apos;t see that as a big deal.  About a mile and a half from where we had been partying i started to get very cold and was shaking.  I kneeled down to gather some body heat. The next thing I know is that I am waking up with a man on top of me with a gun stuck between my eyes.  He was the owner of a home I had gotten into.  He did not know me and all the windows and doors to his home were locked, there were no signs of a forced entry.  He also had a German Sheperd in his yard that was completely fenced, that would have chewed me up had I tried to enter.  He held me at gun point while his wife called the Police.  When the Police arrived they simply drove me to the base and left me with my Base Commander.  The home owner had found me sleeping on his couch in his living room.  I had a pillow under my head and a blanket over me.  I nor the home owner knew each other and niether one of us had any idea how I got in his home.  The house that I woke up in would not have been the first home that I would have come to, far from it.  I noticed that I had a slight cut on my stomach that was very deep but there was no sign of blood and it healed within days.  My Base Commander was lost for words, and since I was his administrative asst. he knew me very well.  This was not something that I would do.  In later talking to some of my buddy&apos;s that had stayed at the site where we were partying they indicated that about an hour after I had left to walk back to the base they did notice some strange lights coming from the other side of the hill in the spot where I remembered just kneeling down to gather body heat. I had been drinking beer that night but was now drunk.  I have never found out what exactly happened to me that night and nobody in the small town of Indian Springs, Nevada ever came forward with any kind of explanation.  I remember having another incident when I was a child but thats for another time.", "Stationary light that changed from yellow to green to red and was hovering below the clouds.I saw one craft to the Southwest that was hovering and moving back and forth.  Another was to the Northwest and was stationary.  The approximate altitude was 5000-10,000 feet.  Both had lights that changed from yellow to green to red very rapidly and both were below the clouds.", "I was on the wheel of a 38&apos; cabin cruiser with two friends on a cruise down Boston Harbor at about 2100 hrs. The harbor reflected the light of the city&apos;s buildings and visibility was very clear. We were close to, but past, Logan airport.  I happened to look up in the sky and was really surprised to see a large object I would estimate at approximately 60-80 feet in circumference with a band of large square light panels undulating around its perimeter. Their circulation was in a wave like motion. I watched it as I also scanned the water for any impediments in it. I tried to figure out what the object was. I determined it was unlikely to be advertising as there was no message. The colors in the squares were yellow, red, blue, green.  I wondered whether it was something being held aloft by a helicopter as the object was not fast moving (about 20 miles per hour)but their was no noise associated with the object. I commented to my guests, &quot;Look at that, I will bet that is in the paper tomorrow.&quot; They looked at the object without comment because they could not figure out what it was. I had recently soloed as a pilot. I had attended the 82nd Airborne Division Intelligence course. I spent 13 consecutive nights in combat watching the night sky in Korea.

I was taking my dog out before I turned in for the night. I live approximately six miles from town so it is quite dark at night. I sat down on my porch waiting for my dog, the porch is orientated to the due West. My eye caught something moving and at first assumed it was an airplane or helicopter. It was not moving &apos;right&apos; for a plane and then thought it must be a helicopter at a high hover. It was slowing drifting and then changed color. It was then that I was curious, it was not a plane, why then would it have wing lights that are different colored? I called my for wife to see it and she was not very impressed. It was nothing spectacular. An aircraft was then flying nearly over me at this time and I used it to attempt to judge the distance and altitude of the light. I judged it to be approximately 20 to 25 miles west of me and at 5000 feet above the ground. During the time I observed the light it changed colors several times, at times appearing red, white or blue/white.When it changed colors it blended, it just did not change as if one side was one color and another side was another color. It never moved quickly or any higher or closer. My wife observed it for approximately 5 minutes and then called my Father in law to watch it with me. He watched it with me for another 10 minutes. He said that he observed another two lights to the south that resembled the first. I then called the County Sheriff and asked if they had had any other calls. The Deputy I spoke to then went to the roof and attempted to observe it as well. I know nothing of his observations or lack of. At 0010 hrs the light darkened to a dark red and descended out of site slowly and I did not observe it again.

I have ridden in Pavelows, Pavehawks, Ch-53&apos;s, British High Pro Ch-47&apos;s, and other conventional types of aircrafts and I have never seen anything like this. I can not explain what I saw.

White bottom, with an alternately blinking white light on the front and rear. As it passed over my windshield from N to S, I rolled down my window for a better look. All I could see was the bottom, and this thing looked like I said- a flying canoe, with the 2 blinking lights. In fact, this thing was so cheezy looking I laughed out loud. It looked like a really piss-poor carnival gimic. The lights looked like 60-watt light bulbs, nothing even remotely resembling modern avionic marker lights- no red or green.And with a strong wind out of the W, this thing was low enough that I could see that it had no wings, and appeared to be unaffected by the wind- no wobbling like small aircraft do with a strong side-wind blowing.

REPORT:  I had just leashed-up my dog and headed out our back door to take her for her nightly walk around the neighborhood when I noticed a very strange &quot;glow&quot; of red in the night sky.  This &quot;glow&quot; was pure red and looked somewhat like what was described in the movie &quot;A Fire in the Sky.&quot;  I know that sounds silly, but the glow spanned for quite a distance on the horizon.  Its strength and color intrigued me.  It appeared to move somewhat, but was mainly stationary.  There were many dogs howling/barking within the neighborhood at the time.

I know that it was there at least through when my husband got back from walking the dog.  -I decided not to walk the dog after I saw the glow!

The triangle would remain a triangle but two of the objects would get closer while the third would get further away. Then their triangle would get smaller. All the while the larger object remained to the left of the triangle. I called my wife out to see this. She brought out her camera and we took a couple of pictures.

The rain had stopped at this point in time and in distance of my travel by car, and suddenly: I was &apos;compelled&apos; to look up to the due NNW (330 degrees) whereupon a &apos;classical&apos; UFO of a dull, silvery shade of color dropped straight down from 11 o&apos;clock high to 9 o&apos;clock high and loomed in-place for only a few seconds--just long enough for me to see it, then it whisked away in a straight line to the due NNW at incredable speed. There was no &apos;contrail,&apos; nor &apos;tail&apos; of smoke/vapor of any sort. The &apos;UFO&apos; appeared &apos;exactly&apos; as the image videotaped by me on June 11, 1995, as a &apos;freeze-frame&apos; can be seen at: http://((URL deleted)).org This was a delightfully, awesome sighting--as I did feel compelled to look up--right at it--then it zipped away . . . I affirm that the above is true and a correct accounting of this stated sighting. ((name deleted.

PD", "brilliant, flashing, point of white light, travelling at unexpected anglesI enjoy watching the stars from my home as the sky is regularly dark enough to observe magnitude five, sometimes better.  The evening of the event I had just returned home, noticed the clear, moonless sky with only a slight haze that reduced visibilty approaching the horizon, and decided to spend some time seeing what I could see.  I shut off all the lights on my property but one that was blocked from my view by a tree, other than that the nearest light source was from my neighbors over 200 yards away.  As my eyes were somewhat adjusted to the dark by my drive home I was able to see that even through the haze lower in the sky magnitude four stars were still visible, except to the south where the glare of Syracuse blocks all but the brightest.  Scanning the sky for the usual satellite pass (I&apos;m a great fan of Heavens Above &amp; J-Pass) or even better the elusive meteor I caught a flash in my peripheral vision.  Knowing well that it was probably too late to see the display I turned in the direction of the flash (northeast) looking for any trace of a faint afterglow of the shooting star.  To my surprise in direct and clear view, three more flashes, points of light, brilliant, white, each about a second in duration, travelling on a path from low in the North to high in the East, each at a different angle.  At the time the lights seemed to rotate as though what I was seeing was actually sunlight shining off a highly reflective spinning satellite, or it may just have been twinkle do to the atmosphere.  The event was only a matter of seconds.  This was like nothing I have ever seen and over the years I&apos;ve seen alot. (hundreds of satellites &amp; meteors, aurora, fireballs, and even a re-entry!)  Continuing to watch the sky for about fifteen minutes for something to help me realize what this was turned up nothing, no &quot;flying star&quot; of a satellite, no regular red, white, green pulse of an aircraft, no jet noise.  I did not realize immediately because of an ubstructed view but the lights occurred in the constellation Cy! gnus, sp ecifically in the triangle described by Gamma Cygni, Delta Cygni, and Deneb.  The lights (I would equal to the shine of the ISS on a good pass) were much brighter than these stars as well as nearby Vega.  I have checked the mentioned Web sites and found satellites in the general wide area of the lights, but I do not believe that is what I saw. (no fade in/out of a satellite)  I am skeptical of UFOs but not ETIs, so here are some wild theories based on what I saw:  a bird or bat flying in and out of the shine of the one floodlight I left on; a satellite boosting to higher orbit; shooting stars entering head on in my direction.  I find it hard to believe any of these.", "Silent light moving fast and low across the sky.The craft appeared to be a teardrop shape or possibly two spheres.  One larger toward the front and one smaller directly behind it.  It was moving very fast and heading west/southwest.  It made no noise, and appeared out of nowhere and disappeared just as fast.  It was moving horizontaly over the trees (high over the trees) and was in front of the clouds.  I couldn&apos;t tell if it appeared and then disappeared, or whether the lights came on and then went off again (which would hide it from view in the night sky).  It was not a spot light or an airplane.  A spotlight would change in distance as it tracked across the clouds, and the beam would be visible and could be tracked to it&apos;s source.  It had no running lights like a plane would, and as I stated earlier, it was silent.  I live near and work at Paine Field, so I see planes come and go all day long, and this was something completely different.  I believe it was one craft, but might possibly have been two, assuming they could travel VERY close together.", "Two disc/round objects were observed by 4 people Saturday April 14 4:30pm for approx. 10 minutes in Tempe AZSaturday afternoon clear blue skies(no chemtrails) we were facing east and we witnessed a disc/round object directly above us for about 7-10 minutes. This object moved towards the north and eventually out of site. Right before I lost site of this object someone else pointed out another object where we originally saw the first object. We witnessed the second object for 1-3 minutes. These objects are so small it is diffeicult to estimate the altitude.

They were directly overhead at the time of the sighting. The path they took appeared to be slow with variations in speed and slight changes in direction. The distance between the objects is hard to estimate but appeared to be quite far. The altitude for each may have been different as well as one appeared to be easier to see than the others. The objects appeared to be lights that never blinked or changed in brightness. The weather conditions were very good for this day -- clear skys, very little haze.

Anyway, we got closer, and it was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my whole life.  We saw a UFO.  I screamed for my mom to pull over, because it was getting lower and lower and I wanted to see it.  She pulled into a driveway, and we were in awe gazing out the window.  Being in such amazement, I stumbled out of the car, my family screaming in fright.  I was directly under this thing.  It was a huge oval shaped craft about 20 feet above my head.  Lights went around it, different colors.  They blinked.  I heard nothing.  It just sat there, over my head as if to let me look at it.  I saw a small square in the bottom, like a door.  The dimensions were hard to tell, I was only 16 at the time.  I do remember though, there was definetly not enough room for an adult to stand up in there.  I was so dumbfounded, as I had always read about UFO&apos;s but never really believed.  There I was, a young small town girl, seeing what was the most amazing thing in my life.

I could not tell its speed as I was doing about 75 mph, but it did not appear to be moving fast if at all. As I passed under it, the body seemed to appear much like that of a blimp or fat cigar.

The most unusual thing was the body; it was glittering gold and the surface looked like fish scales.", "Five-Sided Craft Spotted in CharlottesvilleI was walking my dog at approximately 8:30PM when I looked up to check out the stars.  Almost directly above me there was some type of aircraft.  From almost directly underneath, it had five rounded sides, with a light at each of the five points.  It was a bit like a pentagon, but rounded enough to say that it was round - with five distinct edges.  The lights were yellowish in color and not very bright.  The craft was low to the ground compared to the air traffic that we typically see in our area. There were intermittent clouds in the area, and the craft was moving slowly.  It was moving in pretty much a straight line to the east/northeast.  There was a large cloud in it&apos;s flight path, and as it disappeared behind the cloud, I stood there to watch it come out the other side.  Given it&apos;s speed and the size of the cloud, I expected to see it come out the other side relatively quickly.  When it did not, I looked around, and saw the craft now moving in a south/southeast direction, looking like it made a 90 degree turn when it was hidden by the cloud. I could not make out the color of the craft since it was night, but the lights were yellowish and they lit the craft enough to make the five sides clearly visible.

I am not sure of dates and times. Especially the times. It could be much later. Past midnight. Helicopters have flown over our house at night, on a pretty regular basis, as there are National Guard helicopters at the airport in Decatur. However, over the past few months (I do not know the dates) the house has been shaken quite violently, 3 times. I&apos;d assumed it was helicopters that had, for some reason, started flying lower than usual. (Which I&apos;m assuming is a no-no over residential areas, though I didn&apos;t call anyone to complain.) The first extra-loud fly-over (late February or early March) lasted several minutes. The windows rattled for quite some time (more than one but perhaps not 2 full minutes) before the &quot;helicopter&quot; was heard. I didn&apos;t even think &quot;helicopter&quot; until it was over. I cannot actually say that these loud ones are helicopters because of all the extra noise. i.e. I know what a helicopter sounds like as I hear them quite often but the extra noise of the house shaking was so loud that I couldn&apos;t swear it was a helicopter that flew over. There have been 2 others, a couple of weeks apart. And the time between when the windows begin to rattle and the source of the vibration is heard is very short. That first one was strange because the house shook and simply kept shaking for no apparent reason.

I had my friend stop the car and turn around to get a better look.  We both looked at each other and mentioned that it definitely was NOT a plane.  It wasn&apos;t really &quot;flying&quot; but more like hovering at a slow pace.  We couldnt really see the object well itself because it was dark, but the lights helped to outline it.  It looked to be triangular, with lights on each point.  Not like a plane would be with lights on the wingspan and tail but more like a stealth bomber would look like.  (I suppose it could have been a stealth bomber aside from the odd location it was in and its slow hovering.)  We watched it untill it dissapeared behind some tall trees and we went home.  I know that helicopters can hover...but I am 100% sure that it was not a helicopter. My friend and I told our friends about what we saw and it was nother really more than a weird story, little thought about afterwards.  Untill around two weeks later, two of my other friends told me that they saw the same object that I had described.  They said that they saw a triangular shaped object hovering abnormally low at about the same time of night (2-3am) and at the exactly same location!  They drove closer to the object for a few minutes observing it more.  As they drove home they said that the object was following them.  They said that they&apos;d drive for awhile, look up, and the object wasnt far from behind them.  Although it prob wasnt actually &quot;following&quot; them more than it was just travelling in their general direction. These were the only two sightings of this UFO that I know of.  They occured in about a two week inveral in August of 2000.  I have no idea of the exact dates.  I thought it was definitely strange that two different groups saw the same thing, at the same time of day, at the same location.  I don&apos;t know how credible the story is since the only sightings that I know of were by me and friends of mine.  Maybe other pople saw it too, but i have no way of knowing.  All I know is that I myself, or my friends weren&apos;t lying or extending the truth.  I forgot to mention that the object wasn&apos;t making any noise either that I could hear.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was heading northbound on I-82, about 5 miles outside of Selah, WA in Yakima County.  The lights were too large to be from a plane, and they were not moving at all.  They appeared to be up too high to be attached to the ground.  These lights were pretty close together which also ruled out the possiblity of them being planes as well.  They were stationary the entire time that I saw them.  The color was a white-yellow color; very similar to normal car headlights.  I did not notice any particular shape that these lights formed. They were very brigt for about 2 minutes, and one by one they began to fade out without moving during this process.  After a few seconds from the time they began fading, they were completely gone.  I know that the other cars on I-82 at this location and time couldn&apos;t have missed noticing these lights.  They were much too bright, and were basically in the middle of nowhere.", "Silver Orb traveling very slowly across skyAt about 1430 hrs on 5/29/01 I observed a sphere shaped object traveling very slowly(this is what caught my eye) north to south at about 5000 feet.  I work outside and being an avid ufo buff I watch the skies as much as possible.  I watched the object for about 5 minutes until it went behind some clouds and I lost it.  The interesting thing is that while watching the object a commercial plane flew right under or close by it.  Due to my angle of vision I could not tell how close. The object was silver in color and a little smaller than the size of a pinky nail at arms length. Also, a I watched the object there seemed to be a haze or unfocusable area around it.  No sound, and no light.", "We watched the craft and an alien for 15 minutes.I&amp;#8217;ve been reluctant to tell the story because I would have a hard time believing it if I heard it from someone else. Here it goes: It was the summer of 99. We were on a remote rural area in eastern Venezuela. It was about one month after we arrived in the area and on a very clear and moonless night. While my friends stayed inside the house having dinner I came out to get something out of the truck, it was very dark and I had to use a flashlight to go outside. While I walked to the truck I noticed that there was a light coming from above, I immediately looked up and saw a round shape object about 200ft wide hovering right on top of the house. It made no sound. I could tell that is was circular because it was covering the stars that were very visible that night. It had a reddish light in the meddle. I immediately called my friends out and we all watched amazed at the craft. One of the girls in the group turned a flash light on and started to make signals to toward the UFO while some others panicked and ran inside, about 10 minutes later the light in the middle became a beam of light that landed right on top of the house, and then a human shaped being floated up and down the beam and seemed to be looking at us, it was impossible to see any details like mouth, nose, etc. because the light was engulfing it, it was also impossible to tell what color it was (it looked dark gray).  After a few minutes it slowly left. The next day we drove in the direction where we thought it had gone and we took a few people from the nearby town so they could guide us trough the very rough terrain. We finally found a large round area where all the grass had died, it wasn&apos;t burned, and it was just flat on the ground and dead.", "Three dark grey saucers in the air hovering.I was outside my house quite late when I saw a flash in the sky.

They made no noise.", "how can something that looks like a falling &quot;star&quot;, -stop and change direction instantly?It was a cold november night with bright skies and a lot of stars. We were on a military exercise out in the mountains in Sweden. I stood looking up at the stars while fetching some water out of a lake. Suddenly i saw what i first thought was a falling star. Then came another one. My friends saw it too but they said it must be a satelite (they can be seen this time of year when they pass the skies). But, the next moment i saw two moore, and they started to &quot;chase&quot; each other... They looked like stars (same size, same bright light) but they were moving so fast! It was very strange to see the &quot;stars&quot; first flying at this speed, and then stop(!!?) and change direction and start again with same speed instantly. The &quot;stars&quot; were also flying in circles, continuing chasing each other. They must have been flying at a very high altitude since they were so small. No human vessle och aircraft can fly so fast, so high and change directions like that! That is for sure!!! The experience lasted for at least 4 minutes before they suddenly dissapeared. I can not find any theoretical explanation on this.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Approximately 3am eastern time we observed a light in the sky appearing brighter than a star. We immediately observed rapid movement of the object. The movements were sporadic, sometimes circular and others straight shooting in one direction instantly changing to another direction.

I guess I was a little surprised and didn&apos;t think to move at first but, in a second or two, ran around the rail and into the yard to see if I could catch another look and I couldn&apos;t spot it. I was hesitant to report the sighting because it was such a short one and I had recently watched a program about triangular objects possibly being the stealth blimp (I thought I might just be seeing things). I am usure of the exact night and didn&apos;t have any plans of posting this, but I had been to your sight before and as an after thought decided I would check out the sightings and see if there were any recent ones in Oklahoma.

It was perfectly quiet and still outside and I scanned the sky as I always do for UFOs and I have done so the past nine years with no results until today. I was facing northeast, then looked up and just overhead and to my right I saw a lumious spheroid shape, moderately bright, white and yellowish-tinged, passing in a straight line from the Santa Barbara Channel in the southeast, to the northeast towards Bakersfield. It travelled in what seemed to be a course crossing directly over the southern end of town. At first I had to eliminate other possibilities: airplane, satellite, meteorite, space station, etc. I felt that it was too low to be in space and it was silent, so it couldn&apos;t be a plane of any kind. Also the light itself was too round and uniform in shape, and too yellowish in luminescence, from the point when it was over my right shoulder to the time I watched it disappear over the horizon of the mountains. A conventional space vehicle or satellite would show bright white and gradually either brighten or dim out as it crossed the terminator. This did neither. This thing was just too big and yellow anyway and did not change much in luminosity. It was just too big to be either a marker light or a landing light of any kind and it was not on any established airways. I estimate that it was at somewhere around 30,000 feet give or take a few thousand and the light was easily the size of an airliner. I also rule out any natural phenomena such as meteors. There was no flaming tail and no streaking. It was just not that fast either. It cruised along at a fairly brisk pace which I would estimate at a up to 300 hundred miles per hour. But it was high enough for me to watch it for at least two minutes. I noticed no fluctuations in its course, but it did seem to fluctuate in speed and altitude slightly. I am extremely careful about such things and this is my first report in nine years of sky-w! atching. I feel I have a good sense of such objects from being a private pilot and having spent four years in the Air Force. I have never seen anything like it in my life.

The form changed from what would appear to be an oval or sphere into something resembling at times a cross.  The object also changed luminescence, at times opaque and bright then dark, almost invisible. At the time it did not appear to be a correlation between the shape changes and the changes in luminescence.  The speed appeared constant, meaning not accelerating or deccelerating, however the shape changes may have effected this.

All i will say as yesterday in the Wilmington, DE area i was laying outside my pool. Staring into the sky for no apparent reason other then to look at the clouds that were passing by. The clouds had covered the sun. I was staring into the sun area as i had sunglasses on. I stared for about 10 minutes up at the clouds not looking for UFOs blah blah. I live right near Philadelphia airport and have seen many airplanes etc and hear engines all the time. This, this was different, I couldnt believe my eyes. There amongst the clouds was a circular shape. 5 inches in diameter at least 12000 feet in the air. The clouds were high yesterday the ones that we had. There was no airport takeoffs or landings at the time i saw this object. Is kind of wierd but for about 10 minutes there was no jet engines nothing. In the clouds i could see the circular shadow of an object curving toward the thicker clouds. I started pointing up to the sky, my fiance was next to me as well as about 10-12 other people. I couldnt say anything i just pointed in awe. The clouds were thicker toward the philly area and that was when it took off into the thicker clouds. No engine noise no nothing. I know what i saw. Be it a ufo or hi tech govt vehicle is was nothing of this planet in my honest opinion. I dont know what it was but i do know it had perfect symetrical form from where i was laying it was about 5 inches in diameter it had to be at least 10000 feet in the air, as the clouds were super hi yesterday. And that is my story. Next thing i know i couldnt stop thinking of it all day. I have no photographs i have no video only my words to describe it. Believe or dont i dont really care.

PD))One evening in the summer of 1978 my boyfriend&apos;s mother was giving me a ride to a store about 9:30 at night, as the store closed at ten. We were traveling from Lake Elsinore to Perris on highway 74. From certain areas on Highway 74 you can see the jets at March Air Force Base take off and leave. When I had a home right on the highway(Meadowbrook) we would watch the jets take off and land all night.  The roar from the jets was thunderous.  On this night we were at that area where March Air Force Base was very clear to us, and suddenly my boyfriend&apos;s mom, Mary, says &quot;Do you see what I see&quot;  and I really did.  There it was as real as the chair that I am sitting on, It was saucer(disc)shaped, with red, yellow, blue, and green lights in the windows, which circled the craft. The windows looked like they were lit from the inside, and they were flashing,interchanging lights.  The craft was hovering in front of one of the AIR FORCE JETS, staying in front of it, moving back and forth in front of the jets window, for as long as we could see it. It was the most amazing sight that I have ever seen. I know that the jet pilot saw it also.  And not to mention the people at the base.  It is just amazing to me that no one else reported it.  The third amazing thing is the fact that I saw an identical craft six years later.  I was watching the 1984 CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE LOS ANGELES OLYMPIC GAMES when to my surprize they landed an UFO in the Los Angeles COLESEUM.  And it was identical to the craft that I saw at March Air Force Base six years earlier.  You can imagine the questions that fill my head.  Who built the craft at the Olympics?  Where did they store it?  Did they ever test run it?  What is it capable of?   I personally think that they modeled the craft after sightings, rather than that being the same craft, because the one I saw could maintain its position in front of a jet as it was taking off, or landing. I&apos;m not sure which it was doing, coming or going, but I could tell the UFO seemed to be taunting the jet. ! No trai l or sound could be heard, except for the jet sounds.  From where we were positioned we could not see any beings inside the craft. I wish the pilots,like the one in the jet that night in 1978, would begin to speak about what they have seen.

I always look out the window, and this case was no different. I travel a lot with my job, and I have never seen anything like this before, or sense. As I was looking out the window, a very bright light appeared, even with our Northwest airline, and about 1/4 mile away, to the north. At first, I did not know what to think. It was circular, and bright white, and if I had to guess, it looked to be about 50 feet diameter. I began to wonder more about it when it kept pace with the jet, and then it suddenly slowed or stopped, as we kept going. It then came imediately back even with us, and closer, and I then could see the most brilliant, flourescent, pink light around the bright white light, and then a very brilliant, flourescent purple l! ight around the most outer area. the only round part was the white center. The pink and purple were surrounding the sides, and this made it appear to be football shaped, but with deffinate edges, and that is why I call it diamond shape. This whole thing lasted about 45 seconds. The craft made a few sudden direction changes, and then left very fast and was gone.

I had a CCD camera attached to the main instrument and I snapped a 2 second exposure which shows streaking objects moving against a background of still stars. The pattern did not appear to be a solid object since the area between the moving stars showed background starts.  The appearance was that of 3 satellites flying in formation.

This report is being told in all honesty, and even though these two events happened long ago, they have stuck fresh in mind to this day. Here is the report I had given to another organization not too long ago. I was asked in the reporting form to describe the lights if I had seen any, and that is where I started my report at: &quot;There were many round lights and they were all green. They were not blinding and could make out the pattern of the lights as well as the shapes of the lights very well. Object seemed to be round by the way the lights were set up. Green lights were round in shape and the center row seemed to go around the object. Also remember there were more or just one more light near the top of the center row and one near the bottom of the center row of lights.&quot; The next question in the report form I was filling out, asked to give as much information about the sighting as possible: &quot;It was a close sighting and lights were seen well. Object was just below the tops of the trees and behind one set of tree line. I was driving home on a road at night where there are at times very little traffic, sometimes no traffic late at night. A road where there are woods on both sides (Alot pine trees) and not many homes built. I think these woods that go along this long stretch of road (which is Rt. 539) are reserved by the McGuire Air Force Base, since they usually have trucks (hummers, etc) travel to and from these dirt roads that come off of this particular road. It was around the time of 1:30 to 2:15 a.m., was so long ago, do not remember the exact time. I was traveling north on Rt. 539. As I came around one bend I noticed a green light to the left side of the road in the woods near the tops of the trees that were closest to the road, up ahead of me. When I got closer, I slowed down to a crawl, while looking upwards towards the top of the tree line, I eventually stopped the car and rolled down the window. I stared at it in puzzlement. I could see the tree branches silhouetted in front of the many green lights of the round object. This is where the most shock kicked in. After I had stopped the car and was looking at it, I started to realize that this object was actually getting lower and was &apos;very slowly&apos; moving downwards behind the set of trees. I was directly across from the object that was lowering from behind the set of trees. Panic set in and I said to myself **** ****!! Please excuse the language, but it could not be helped. And I slammed my foot onto the gas pedal to leave as quick as possible, I could not drive well, my arms and whole body were shaking. As I was making my way down the road away from where the object was, I looked in my drivers side door mirror, and I saw car headlights coming from around the bend, just before where I was stopped at, and also saw that the object with green lights was no longer there. I did not see the lights any where. Sorry this is so long. And I kept this and another event to myself for so long because I did not know there were so many others seeing u.f.o&apos;s until years later when I started to read up about so many other events that others had witnessed. Never knew of all of the ufo sightings by others until I got a computer and was able to read up on sightings information. This is being told in absolute truth. (I did some searching on the about.com website on ufo sightings for in my state, and found a report posted by another lady who seemed to have seen the same object with all green lights at night in 1996.) 2 years later on another night, the same &apos;exact&apos; object with green lights appeared again in June. In the same area but not in the exact spot, maybe 1 mile further from the first time. This time I was going to head on over to a friends house, I took the same road but heading north this time on rt. 539, but for some reason I decided that maybe I&apos;d go visit my friend another time, and decided to turn off onto another back road to &apos;turn around&apos;. Well this weird feeling came over me, I don&apos;t know why, (I&apos;m in amazement as I write this still now.) As I was slowing down on this other road to get ready to make my u-turn which has no street lights on it, I looked into my passengers side door mirror (I usually had this mirror turned up a little to keep any car&apos;s headlights that were behind me from shining into my eyes), I almost had me heart failure, I caught a glimps of green lights, this time higher in the night sky and the moon was almost full this night. I slowed down on the road and turned my head back to quickly look through the back window of the truck I was driving and was able to see this object better. The object was again stationary in one spot maybe 2 tree lengths up above the tree line. This object and the moon were not that far apart, but also not real close to each other, I remember seeing the moon to the right as I was looking above the trees and the object with green lights farther to the left. Once again, I was the only one on these roads at the time. This time I was thinking &quot;Oh my God, Oh my God, I don&apos;t believe this!&quot; and &quot;It&apos;s back again!!&quot;, and of course panic set in again, and I quickly pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to make a quick u-turn to go back to the road I had come off of. Which means I was turning around to head some what towards the object, because it was the only way I knew of to get back home. Again, I had slammed on the gas pedal after I made the sharp u-turn and was driving quickly. After I made the u-turn in panic, I got myself to look up (to the left side now, above the trees), and saw no green object, only saw the moon. A second after looking again and not seeing the object I saw car headlights up ahead coming from the road I was heading back to get onto. I made it back home and said to myself, &apos;why when I&apos;m on that road and that thing has to show up are there no other cars around, but when another car was coming around the object would disappear or it&apos;s lights would go out...&apos; I did&apos;nt take that road again for a long time, I changed my route. I would also like to ad, that both times that the object was seen, it was motionless in the sky, completely still, except for the first time where it seemed to start lowering after it was remaining still. There also was no sound whats so ever. Today I am now a professional photographer, I do alot of nature photography, but I wish I was then and wish I had a camera on me during these two events. I would prefer being contacted through email if questions and a follow up were needed, but would consider being contacted by phone as well, even though I would&apos;nt have an easy time at all discussing these two events.", "Electric Blue Half dome with possible alient encounter.My son&apos;s interest in this phenomenon rekindled my memory of the incident (which was reported to UFORIC the day after the event). I was around 15 at the time.  My friends and I were camping out in my backyard which is adjacent to a golf course.  As I lay in the tent (my friends were hanging out in the front yard...Hey..I was tired), I noticed a bright electric blue light coming from the golf course area.  Opening the tent, I noticed an object resembling a half dome with a small protusion coming from the top of the dome.  It was oriented like a half moon in a verticle position rather than flat/horizonal.  There also appeared to be a base to the dome, cylindical in shape, attached to the flat side of the dome.  Its diameter was less than that of the dome and was, perhaps, a 1/16 of the overall size of the object (which I estimate was maybe 40-60 ft in diameter). The object moved from east to west over the fairway when I lost site of it at the far end o the fairway. A few minutes later, my friends joined me in the tent and I asked them if they saw it.  They hadn&apos;t as the were in the front yard and their view was obstructed (they also weren&apos;t paying attention). We all went to sleep. Around 02:00, I remember awakening to relieve myself.  As I climbed out of the tent, I noticed a faint blue glow from the west.  Then, the beam from my flashlight struck something no more than about 20 feet away.  Took me a second to realize I was staring at a person or being.  It stood about 5 feet tall and motionless about 20 feet away just on the other side of a small hedge.  Skin was grayish in color and the eyes were a burnt yellow color.  If it were clothed, it must have been close to the same color as the being. I stood staring at this being for maybe another 10 seconds absolutely stunned.  It then seemed to dive on the ground and I didn&apos;t see it get up again.  Thinking my friends were playing a joke, I went to check on them.  They were all asleep in their sleeping bags. I immediately awakened them, and we all got out of the tent, but we did not see the being again. In the morning, we went to see where the faint blue light was coming from.  Not far from my home, there is another golf course that also had an old abandoned iron quarry.  This quarry was, maybe 500 yards from my house.  In the grass of the old quarry, we found evidence that something had flattened the grass and weeds in the old quarry.  I don&apos;t recall seeing any indentations (like from landing gear), but the long grass had definitely been packed down in a circular shape. Back in my yard, we noticed something else as well.  Where I said that the being dove on the ground, there was a rough outline of a person in the grass...browned grass when the surrounding grass was green.  The grass was also packed down, slightly, as if something had been there. I told my father what I had seen and he called, I believe, UFORIC.  They dispatched an investigator who took my story, a few photographs of the area, and radiation measurements of where I said the being dove on the ground.  He also used some sort of visual dosimeter as well.  The investigator told us that there were elevated radiation levels in the area of question.  He did not go to where I believe was the landing site. After filing my report, I never heard from the investigator again and pretty much put the event out of my until recently when my oldest son took an interest in &quot;aliens&quot; and asked me if I ever saw one (or even a spaceship).  I&apos;m not even sure UFORIC still exists.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I can only estimate that it was in the mid to late 1980&apos;s since this happened so long ago.  There was a full moon setting as the sun was rising.  While stopped at a red light I commented to my roommate that the moon appeared to have a &quot;crack&quot; cut out in the bottom of the moon.  Since the moon was nearing the horizon, I assumed that the visual appearance was caused by a telephone pole or something that we could not see.  After the street light turned green we continued on our way and I really did not think about it untill a couple of minutes later I glanced over and saw that the crack was still there, only bigger now, about 1/4 across the diameter of the moon.  This time I was driving and the horizon was moving along but the notch remained.  We kept watching as we were driving and could see the crack growing.  We really did not know what was happening and thought the moon was splitting in two before our very eyes.  We pulled over in a spot where we had a good view and watched to see what was happening.  (We figured if the moon was really breaking up, why bother going to work because we were probably all going to die?)  We watched as the crack literally went all the way to the top of the moon and gave the appearance of a moon spit into two halves!  We sat waiting for the earth to be destroyed or something, but then the &quot;crack&quot; drifted to the right of the moon and off of the surface entirely after about 10 minutes.  When we got to work and explained why we were late, everyone thought we were crazy of course except for one other guy who also saw the event.  I called the newspaper and TV stations but they thought I was crazy too.  The only explanation I can imagine is that somewhere on the earths surface, a rocket was being launched into space and the exhaust trail cast a shadow on the moon.  Is this possible?  Or do you have any other similar repor! ts as th is in your database?  I know the moon did not split in half that day, but I am not making up what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was watching it for about a minute--it seemed to be a bit wobbly when finally after 45 seconds after I watched it, it then burst in to two smaller objects of the same size.

It&apos;s hard to estimate size but I would guess 200 Ft. in diameter and at less than 2000 Ft. altitude.  It had rectangular &quot;windows&quot; on the outer circumference which glowed with a red-orange light as the craft slowly revolved.  I don&apos;t recall anything about the actual shape other than it was round. I think I was so transfixed by the lights that I never tried to make out anything else.  Or perhaps it was just such a dark night that the outline couldn&apos;t be seen.  I don&apos;t really know.  The craft moved slowly toward the far end of the base.  There were probably hundreds of trainees looking out the barrick windows.  As I stood there dumbstruck a base security truck pulled up to the gate I was guarding and ordered me to get it open and fast.  I did so even though my orders were that no one, not even the C.O.  was to be allowed to use that gate.

PD))Broad daylight sighting of enormous craft outside of Scottsdale Arizona May 13, 1995 around 2:00pm by husband and wife for about 20 minI awoke this morning 4/10/01 with a vivid yet hazy recollection of an event that happened back in 1995.  The memory itself is strong and undeniable yet when I try to concentrate on the event, I can recall it only as through a veil of mist.  On the day in question, however, the weather was perfectly clear.  A beasutiful blue desert sky.  I cannot begin to remember what first caught my attention, but I do recall the gist of the conversation I had with my wife.  &quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot;  &quot;I can&apos;t beleive it could be anything else&quot; &quot;It&apos;s so huge&quot; for about twenty minutes we observed a huge silvery grey craft.  I first remembered it as being Large and round but throughout the day I remember the round craft as being one type along with two others that joined the much larger craft which I now seem to remember as being somewhat angular.  As for its&apos; shape, I cannot find the words to describe how immense it was.  It moved fairly slowly for the time we observed it.  I do not recall how it came to leave our sight. As for the other objects I beleive I saw, there were some large round ones, and two types of smaller ones.  Had I seen the smaller ones by themselves, I do not beleive I would have described them as small but in relations ship to the large craft, they seemed somewhat diminutive.  I am overwhelmed by my memory of the large craft.  My wife remembers the large craft as being oval. This does not fit my recollection.  Nor does she recall any other smaller craft.  What puzzles me most, I think, is that we did not talk about this event for any length of time after it happened.  It seemed so, &quot;Matter of fact&quot; It seems to me that an event such as this would have been &quot;life changing&quot; but strangely enough this has not been the case.  I spent some time this evening searching the web to see if anyone else witnessed what we saw on or around the same period of time with no luck.  Perhaps it was some foggy dream of my own creation I say to myself, yet when I asked my wife if she recalled anything, she quickly was able to verify a similar sequence of events.  Our details do not seem to coincide, but the overwhelming memory of the event, for me, precludes any immediate need for corraboration(sp?)

In Sept. ? of 1994 I drove into town to pick-up my daughter, age 6 yrs., and her friend, age 9 yrs. from school. It was 3:00 PM. We drove to &quot;Red Mule&quot; for ice-cream, then went straight to the friend of my daughter&apos;s home to await her mother, and my wife who were shopping in &quot;Batesville&quot; 35 miles distant. The girls played in the front yard and I remained in the truck. At approximatly 3:30 PM. A &quot;B2&quot; stealth bomber approached my vehicle at a right angle, and would fly directly over my truck. I hurriedly left the truck for an unobstructed view. This was a first and only phisical view of the B2. It was real low, real slow, real large, real black, and almost noiseless. Imagine my thrill as it lazily passed over me. I turned as it went over, and called the girls to look-up. They did, as they lined to my left. At this time,the B2 was maybe a hundred yards past. Then, the corner of my right eye picked-up the site of a &quot;silver/metalic disc hurtling down crossways, right to left at about 45 degrees. It looked as though it would contact the &quot;B2&quot;. In seemingly nothing-flat, the &quot;disc&quot; which appeared completely circular on its path downward suddenly flattened in a manuever and positioned itself directly over the canopy section (rearward probably of the windscreen)and at once was in perfect sinc with the direction, and knot-speed of the B2.My daughter&apos;s friend exclaimed loudly...AND WHAT IS THAT? I answered, DO YOU SEE THAT? She said YEA! as did my daughter. My mouth was dry, and my neck-hair bristled, or crawled. I was totally confused and riveted to this event. The &quot;disc&quot; in reality only hovered over the stealth for maybe 4 or 5 seconds and I strained to take it all in. The sky was 3D clear blue, and the sun was behind me, and to my left. The stealth was now directly moving straight away from us and suddenly there was a blinding yellowish/white fuzzy flash and the &quot;disc&quot; ! hurtled away at a withering rate of accelleration, and at a level on par with the &quot;B2&quot; and at a 20 to 30 degrees &quot;port&quot; angle to the &quot;B2&quot;s dead reckoning. Several more seconds elapsed before I thought to &quot;count&quot;. I then counted about 5 seconds and the &quot;disc was gone into and beyond the horizon. I switched my stare back to the stealth and to my amazement, it had not pursued,nor altered its heading, nor differentiated in its rate of velocity. As I have so stated; the &quot;disc&quot; was of a silver/metalic nature. I had it in my vision extremely clear. There were no portals of any kind. There were no discernable seams,nor rivits although at that distance of probably five hundred feet or more down the road; these features might&apos;nt be visible to the naked eye. There were no lights, nor markings that I could discern. In short, nothing but the superb showing of the silver/metalic skin, and the shape. It was circular, flat bottomed, with a curved, or arched topside and sloping gently towards the bottom edge, yet extending slightly past then curving tightly downward, and inward,and straightening to the bottom edge. End of story. Beginning of mystery. There is a MUFON chapter somewhere near Batesville, Ark. ? A lady doctor fields the calls. I contacted her after my daughter&apos;s friends mother took the MUFON contact number from a T.V. U.F.O. show several weeks after our encounter. I related this same account to her, and she advised me that this was a remarkable event that did not occur often. I no longer have her number. As we talked, she advised me that there would in several weeks time be an international mufon gathering in Silver Springs, Ark. I however did not attend, but maybe you have heard of it, or possibly attended. Let me know if you are able to confirm this with any other information. Thankyou.

I &apos;ve believed in UFOs since I was a little kid.  I follow the press, internet, web sites and all other publications about UFOs.  My hobby is watching the skies on clear nights when all the stars are out there.  Last night was one of those nights and I was at the rooftop of our building smoking one last cigarette before going to bed and watching the skies as usual.  Suddenly something filled my thoughts.  I felt it with all my nerves.  I said to myself &quot;something&apos;s about to happen&quot;.  I started watching with a higher attention and at first I saw two shooting stars. For some reason I knew that the show wasn&apos;t over yet and I kept looking.  Then it happened appr. 5 mins later and it happened right in front of my eyes.

People who don&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s (actually I think they&apos;re way to scared to accept their existance)laugh at others who believe and even see them.

There were four of us sleeping out at a duck pond waiting for dawn to arrive when approximately 2:00 am there was a strange light overhead. All of us witnessed this light in the sky that appeared approximatly 1 mile above us. As we watched the light it began to come closer and closer, within 2 minutes the small light began to descend above the pond. the closer it got the brighter it became. Within seconds, the light (craft) had desended to approximately 100 yards over the pond. THE ENTIRE AREA SURROUNDING THE POND APPROXIMATLY ONE HALF MILE WAS DAYLIGHT. The craft sat there for maybe 2 minutes then began to ascend. In a minutes notice, it was gone. We all know what we saw, that was 34 years ago. This is a real life story that happened 34 years ago. The following day I called the New York State Police to see if there were any other reports from other witnesses, and they replied that they had a report that the NASA had issued a statement that a reflection from the moon had created this phenomom, and it had affectd WESTERN NEW YORK.

This was not suprising, as a small airport is a few miles north.  I soon realized that the roaring was intensifing, rather than diminishing.  Looking out the west window of my family room, I saw three bright, blue-white strobe lights at about 40 degrees in the overcast sky.  The lights were arranged in a flattened triangle, with the two base lights about 10 degrees apart, the one apex light three digrees to the left and two degrees high.  If you connected the lights, it would have made a simple ship profile, with the bow to the left, the water line below. The lower to lights strobed simultanesouly, and when dark, the upper light strobed.  The rythem of the strobing would correspond to a normal resting heart beat of about 72 beats per minute.  These lights were stationary.  I opened the window and distinctly heard the great roaring sound emminating from their direction.  Using 7X35 binoculars, I could not make out any shape or outline, as the area between the lights blended in with the night sky.  The lights looked like typical aircraft strobes, but about twice as bright.  My wife also saw and heard this phenomenom. I observed the lights move, in unision, extremely slowly to the west  I watched for about 12 minutes before they dissapeared behind distant roof tops.  Just before this happened, the lights seemed to rotate slowly towards the north. I called the local radar tower and the tower at Cleveland Hopkins airport.  Neither had any craft on their radar in my vacinity, nor had there been.  I called the FAA the next morning to inquire about the same, and the woman there stated she had received a similar report from Huron, Ohio.  There, a man claimed the roaring had broken some windows.  Huron is due west of here.  Another friend living in Chagrin Falls Ohio, slightly south east of here, claimed to have seen and heard something similar the same night, glimpsing it through the tree tops surrounding his home.

My experience began as I left a friend&apos;s house early one morning.  I drove to the end of his driveway, stopping to look each way.  The road, Pekin, is dark and deserted, with scattered homes and small farms on each side.  As I looked to my left, a line of brightly colored lights rose above the treetops 100 yards away and stopped in mid air. There were six lights, flashing on and off similar to a moving sign, or what you might see on a tiny portion of the Goodyear blimp.  They flashed red, green and white as they moved, from left to right.  I rolled down my window, expecting sound, but there was none.  Extending my arm out the window, and using my left index finger as a gauge, I noted that the line of lights were as long as my finger, from tip to palm, and that they were about half the thickness of the finger in diameter.  Puzzled, and not really sure what I was seeing, I just turned left as I always did, going east on Pekin.  As I started down the road, the lights moved to their left and crossed over the road from my right just as I passed under them.  I remember looking up through my windshield to see them, then they dissapeared behind trees as I drove on. A half mile down the road, there is a stop sign for Sperry road, where I would turn right.  I wondered what the blimp was doing out here so late, it&apos;s too rural for the blimp, so what was it?  I was now approaching the stop sign, and that&apos;s when I saw the lights come back from my left and stoped, hovering over the road at the same altitude directly in front of me and out about 200 feet.  I had the impression &quot;it&quot; expected me to continue through the stop sign and towards it.  My hair stood on end when I realized what these lights were, and I quickly turned right and sped off as fast as I could.  Looking left, I saw the lights were pacing my car at the same speed, at which point I became very frightened, shouting &quot;Not tonight, not tonight!&quot; Within a mile of that intersection, I lost sight of the lights, continuing on to Mayfield road, where I stopped and go out to look back.  In the distance, at least a mile back, I could see the lights hovering, still flashing their colors, at about 600 feet, I would guess.  Since then, I have interviewed four differnt persons of different ages, from 13 to 65, who have seen this craft in the same area.

It was approximately 00:30 on a summer evening in 1982.  We were heading south on Rte 495.  There was a normal amount of light traffic for this area and time of evening.  We both saw an unusual light in the sky, far off.  It was obviously not a star (too large and too yellow) and not a street or highway lamp (we could see others) and it was moving towards us.  I believe it was in the sky on the driver&apos;s side of the car.  It was not alarming, but continued observation for several minutes piqued our curiosity, because it was clearly moving, becoming larger in our sight.  It was kind of a feeling like, &quot;what the hell *is* that?&quot; I remember that we reached a point of wanting to stop the car and observe it for a while.  It moved to a position where it was too high over us for me to see and I began looking for an exit to get off the highway so we observe.  My friend, during this time, had been craning his neck to look up through the windshield to keep track of the thing.  Finally, he leaned way out of the window and looked over the car.  He was in this position when I took the next exit, which I believe took us to a little-traveled portion of Rte 110.  I heard him exclaiming like, &quot;whoah!&quot; out the window.  Almost immediately, I stopped the car on the side of the road and we got out.  I remember that it was extraordinarily, strangely quiet -- I mean, no other cars, no activity evident in the nearby houses.  I looked up, and the thing was right above us.  I&apos;m bad a judging size and distance, but it was an enormous platform-looking thing to me with lights (I don&apos;t remember the color or if there was any flashing) on the bottom, mainly around the perimeter, I think -- I vaguely remember seeing the edges as darker than the light-polluted sky.  Because it was a good 200 to 600 feet up (I really don&apos;t know), the rest of it was dark, and the sky was dark, I got the impression, from the lights, that it was rectangular, although my friend later said t! hat he t hought it was diamond shaped.  Anyway, the thing appeared to be immense, like the size of a football field, or maybe 75% of that, I don&apos;t know.  A feeling of shocklike amazement hit me immediately, because something like this simply was not in my experience, which may help explain why I couldn&apos;t judge its size or height in better than the general terms given.  I felt transfixed (not by any outside force, but by surprise and emotion).  I glanced around, expecting to see cars stopped on the road and people hanging out of every window, gazing in awe and perhaps panicking at the sight of this thing, but there was no one, no disturbance whatsoever, no cars passing on the nearby tressel.  The object made no sound at all.  I remember standing there, staring up at it with my friend, just staring for another ten or twenty seconds, and it started to move away from us, just a bit, slowly -- then suddenly it accelerrated at an alarming speed (I don&apos;t know if it was an &quot;impossible&quot; speed, but it was not like anything I&apos;d ever seen), I mean, it just zipped away.  We seemed to be able to continue to observe it as an indistinct light, as we had seen it at first, for a while, but then it was gone.  We were left stunned.  One of the most amazing parts of the experience was that I felt no real desire to speak to anyone about it the next day or thereafter.  My friend told me he had felt the same.  Even now, when I mention it, feeling that I had told so-and-so about it before, long ago, they say I didn&apos;t.  It&apos;s a bit weird.  My friend and I discussed it only once or twice thereafter -- this is how I found out that he thought it was diamond shaped, while I had thought it was rectangular.  He concurred with my &quot;football-field-sized&quot; description, to my recollection.  Very, very strange.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like it since, and I am unaware of other UFO reports like it.  I have no doubt that it happened, though.  I have never used drugs, by the way, and have never in my life been drunk.

This area is about 150 miles south of the U.S. - Mexico border.  While there in early evening of 25 April 2001, he saw a bright object moving steadily south over the Sea of Cortez, about 30 degrees above the eastern horizon.  It was his impression that it was reflecting the sun, which had just set.  He grabbed the binoculars he keeps handy for watching animal life and saw in front of the bright reflection what appeared to be a cylindrical nose.  When asked if he could see any other structural detail, he said: &quot;Although the object appeared to be reflecting the sun, the sky was too dark to see any other detail.  If it had had wings, I doubt I could have seen them.&quot;  He was quite certain the object was no more than 500 - 1000 feet up, much lower than the aircraft which fly over that area.  He will not estimate his distance from the object.  But at 30 degrees elevation, trigonometry gives distance to the object as twice its height above eye level, or 1000 - 2000 feet.  He heard no sound whatsoever and saw no trail.  Sighting duration from first appearance as the object came out of shadows until it reentered them again on its southward linear path was about two minutes.  Weather was clear, calm, beautiful, and about 70 Fahrenheit. Mr. ((deleted)) was not a UFO believer previously but is unable to relate this object to any previously-seen aerial objects and concludes it was some kind of UFO.  Because of the low altitude, he rejects an earth-satellite explanation.  Moreover, the object would have been moving in an unusual, polar orbit.", "The four red lights that buzzed Nellis A.F.B. &amp;&amp; The one Orange one that played catAt about 8:30pm Thursday @ Lamb Blvd. &amp; Carey Ave. in Las Vegas, NV. I had gone to the phone @ a convienence store and while on the phone to a friend, I was looking to the N.W. when I noticed four red light&apos;s in the sky, they were pulsing and moving toward&apos;s me and stopped above Nellis Air Stip, then the one on the right left the staggered line formation and dipped down below the others,( the centers were white but the pulses were red flashes ), and strobed brighter than the other&apos;s as it manuvered around below the others from right to left, then it hovered for a few second&apos;s flashing brighter in intensity then proceded on its course to my left and circled around back up to the others and they all proceded to move away to the N.W.N then northerly and out of sight. These red lights were not like a planes red light because they were at least 10 times brighter and the one that was manuvering around was at least 20 times brighter because I could compare them to planes in the sky above L.V., and I didn&apos;t notice any sound coming from the direction of the objects, then all of a sudden Nellis A.F.B. came alive with sound, jet engines roar filled the air and it was constant, then planes started taking off one after the other, I counted between 10 and 12 in the first wave and they climbed upward fast to about 12,000 to 15,000 feet and leveled off and they proceded toward the direction the UFO&apos;s had gone. The first wave made a scurmish line roughly five miles long from left to right above the mountain range of the Nellis test site range and they seemed to me to be hearding or escorting the objects out of the area and it seemed also that they were looking for them and blocking them from the test site area. While the first wave was busy several more waves of planes took off in groupes of 4 and 6 and this lasted for a good 10 minutes and I stsrted to loose count but I estimated between 30 and 40 planes had taken off in that time and the last wave of planes to take off were the big airliner size and I counted 5 of th! em and a t this time I noticed another large plane coming in to nellis from the east at about 15,000 feet and it eventually headed off to the N.W. also but was just above the flight path of the fighters that were taking off. I continued to watch the planes that were still flying around above the test range to the north of me and all of a sudden out of thin air amist planes there appeared a white orange light object and the planes in the immediate area changed there courses toward the object and then it flashed a bright orange and winked out and re-appeared in a new place in the sky in the same area and all the planes changed there courses again and the object winked out again and re-appeared in another spot like it was playing its version of cat and mouse and it did this atleast four times that I saw &apos;cause I grabbed my binocularsto see if I could Identify these Objects for myself then it winked out brightly one last time and was gone and the planes cicled around for a few more seconds and then headed north. This second sighting occured @ about 8:45pm p.s.t. I watched for another 15 minutes then went to the phone to report the sighting I had just witnessedfirst hand. After talking to Mr. Davenport I was a little taken aback by his disbelief as to the number of planes I witnessed taking off from N.A.F.B., it was as though he thought the number of planes was excessive, but he wasn&apos;t here and I was, so after I hung up with Mr. Davenport I went staight home,for I was about 45 seconds from home and started to write down what I saw as per Mr. davenport&apos;s instruction&apos;s and then I heard the plkanes coming back in to land, so I stopped writing and went outside and started counting the number of planes that were coming into land and I counted &quot;38&quot; fighter&apos;s and &quot;6&quot; big airliner size type military planes and with my binoculars I was able to distinguish &quot;9&quot; different types of planes of the fighter&apos;s and big planes and they kept coming in until 10:35pm (pst) and the big planes landed last and one was a propeller type and they! finishe d landing by 11pm and I finished this report at 11:42pm (pst).((NUFORC Note:  Source of this report is anonymous, but apparently is the same person who telephoned our hotline about this alleged event.

He was busy staring at the light in the sky. It was moving, in sort of what seemed like circles, very fast. It first looked like a spotlight coming up from the ground, but it could because the clouds were low and you would be able to see the beam.

I have never reported anything of such before, mainly because I do my own research, but this needed to be heard. Two of us were in a car driving up a road from where I live, and we saw what first appeared to be a helicopter flying very low, the person with me even remarked that it was in fact one, but it was only a few feet above the trees, no more and no less. The altitude of this craft was amazingly low, and when I finally caught it with my own eyes, it had a triangular shape to it I could not find any evidence of blades on the craft. Now, of the one thing I am certain...it was not any type of helicopter mainly for two reasons. First, it made no sound, and second there would be some type of physical activity in that general area of the craft for it being that low in altitude. (Mainly, the wind velocity causing branches to sway, etc...) After seeing the craft, it seemed to have had a &apos;sense&apos; of something and it finally darted back behind the trees (Tall pines). It did not take us more than 3 seconds to drive to where we could see behind the trees and into full sky view where any normal object would clearly be in view. It was gone...there was nothing. From going back to the &apos;site&apos; I have not found anything, all I know is that I consider this one of the greatest sightings I have seen myself in quite a while. Certainly, I have not witnessed one that close. Broad daylight made it that much more spectacular. There was not a cloud in the sky, and you could see the metallic sheen of the craft. It truly was fascinating...And my eyes will be open to maybe capturing the image of it soon, if in fact it does show again.", "white light with smaller yellow light that streaks out of itAt Hart Mountain in S.

On the extruding side, it had small green lights on each end, but i have been familiar with only red ones on a plane, but never in pairs.

Another wierd thing about the craft, was that it was hoovering, not as much flying. It was late, neither one of us were drastically tired, intoxicated, nor had any drugs in our bodies and are truthfull behind what we saw.

There was no sound associated with them. They crossed the sky in less than one minute. They were not aircraft as they had no strobe lights or colored lights. I first thought that perhaps it was a satillite until the trailing one moved closer to the leading one. I have always beleived that there are too many sightings for UFO&apos;s not to exist. I have never seen anything like this before. Usually I can explain what I saw. Usually it turns out to be an aircraft or what I would assume is a satillite.

We were facing North at around 23.15 hrs when suddenly we saw an object in the sky right above our heads. It was as huge as as an aeroplane as normally viewed from the ground. We do not know when it actually appeared in the sky before we saw it. The object was brown in colour, moving gently and steadily across the sky from south to north. It seemed like it was sailing in the sky. There was no sound or lights emanating from it. What was clearly visible was that it had a honeycomb like structure (as if it was made up of many similar cell like components). It was almost T-shaped with a long tail. The horizontal of the &apos;T&apos; formed the front of the object. There was a haze around it. It seemed to be surrounded by some form of energy field or flux which looked like the object was in a fluid like state. The whole object and the surrounding flux was shimmering as it sailed past (the shimmering was similar to the view one gets when looking at something through the gases emanting from the exhaust of an aircraft just before take of or when one looks at the horizon on a hot day). Within about 5 secs from when we first saw it, the object suddenly faded out of view as if went into an invisible mode. The size of the object was the same visually when it faded away as when we first saw. It did not diminish in size. My friend and I then sat down to explore all possible explanations for the phenomenon and when we were convinced that it was a alien craft, we decided to call the office of the city&apos;s largest daily on the night of Monday, 14th May to inform them about the sighting. They were least interested in the sighting. We immediately sat down to record all that we could remember about the sighting. I have tried my best to give a graphic representation of the sighting. The .jpg file shows what the object looked like. In the gif animation I have tried to show the shimering nature. The flash file shows how it looked as it sailed past and how it faded away right before our eyes. Also enclosed is a map of Bangalore city and its location in the Southern India. What was really surprisng was on the morning of 15th May, the dailies all over India carried news articles about this strange mysterious ape like creature with robotic features that was sighted in Delhi. This creature has apparently attacked and injured more than hundred people over the last few days. (The first of these attacks started on April 8th, 2001 at Ghaziabad, India). Though none of the victims have been fatally wounded, there have been two deaths reported where one the victims reportedly jumped off the building while trying to escape the creature and the other, a pregnant woman tripped on the stairs and sustained fatal injuries on her head in the fall. All other victims carry abrasions on their hands, face and legs. Some have even commplained of their toes being bitten off. Reports of the appearance and capabilities of the creature vary slightly from person to person. Some have reported that the creature can jump to great heights when chased. It has been able to move at phenomnal speeds. There are also reports that simultaneous attacks have occurred at different places giving rise to the suspicion that there may be more than one of its kind around. The lastest sighting of the creature as of May 22nd, 2001 is that it has been spooted in the sate of Rajasthan to the west of India. The police initally suspected aliens but for some reason known only to them the stopped giving those versions and went on to propound other theories. I am very sure that there is a connection between the our sighting and what is happening at Delhi. That is why we have taken pains to carefully reconstruct the sighting in as detailed a manner as possible.

I was looking at them for at least 30 seconds.

I have seen planes in this area before, but usually they are high and just passing over from St. Louis to Kansas City. This night, this plane looked &quot;odd&quot;. It had two bright lights on the front and no blinking lights.  I stopped the truck and turned the engine off but I was a little too far away to get a good look.  I figured it was a (regular) plane.  The next night, Friday, at just about the same time, it was the same route, only with a slight variation which put me closer to the path of this &quot;plane&quot;. Once again I stopped the truck and turned off the engine.  I watched as it flew almost overhead.  I thought, that&apos;s odd, it looked triangular, it had three whitish lights on each tip, but I was still thinking it was a plane, and then I saw the red light in the center of the triangle, it appeared larger than the white ones and I also noticed smaller lights which seemed to be closer to the body of the craft, so that the others seemed to protrude. Then it hit me that this might not be a conventional aircraft! It traveled a path, each night, from northwest, making an arc just about the 122 mile marker on highway 70 and then heading southwest. Northwest direction would be the direction that Whiteman AFB is and the home of the Stealth.  It wouldnt surprise me to find out that this was a Stealth aircraft. I did call Whiteman and spoke with the airflight control, who told me they didnt know what the underside of the Stealth looked like at night. So no info there.. Nor were they aware of any flights at those times, but...? I assured them I wasnt a spy, of course if I were I would all ready know all this!

While waiting, I ran inside to get my mother, but she dismissed me as a child making up a story and did not care to come see for herself.  I ran back to the fence where my younger brothers were getting bored and had given up on waiting to see it.

We both noticed a bright white light moving slowly from left to right circling a large hill.  We thought that it was a ranger plane and drove on without interest until we noticed that it seemed to be following us.  We could see it sometimes in front and sometimes behind us.  By this time we were driving from 40 to 50 MPH, depending upon the curvature of the road, trying to keep the opject in sight.  Thinking of the height of a broadcast antenna, the object may have been 1000 feet above ground and seemed to be the size of a small fingernail held at arms length.  We also noticed that the FM car radio was being affected by unusual static.  After several minutes of driving during which I either increased or decreased speed trying to view the object better, it finally veered off toward a large empty field and stopped at what looked to be only a few yards off the ground.  I stopped my car and asked my friend to get out with me.  My friend, a large, burly &quot;country boy&quot; at first would not leave the car, but later consented to do so.  We observed the object for several minutes until we noticed that it was moving.  We watched in awe as this object slowly soared into the air moving upward at a 45 degree angle.  It looked like a &quot;chevron&quot; or &quot;boomerang&quot;, with the pointed edge at the front.  The two ends were both squared off, not pointed or rounded.  We saw four bluish-white lights on each leading edge.  The object moved slowly, perhaps 20-25 MPH and was possibly 250 feet above the ground and about 500 feet away.  At that height and distance I probably could have obscured most of the object with my open palm held at arms length.  We could clearly see the outline of the main body of the object, which was dark, against the night sky (the moon was almost full), and it was absolutely plain that there was nothing between the two sides of the &quot;chevron&quot; - so we could clearly tell that it was not an airplane.  The object made a steady humming sound, not a droning or cyclic sound, like a generator. The sound was not very loud - my friend and I talked as it passed by us - and the sound faded as the object became more distant from us.  The object moved across the road to a distance of several hundred yards where again it looked like only a single light as when we first noticed it, and stopped.  My friend and I got back in the car and moved forward on the road trying to keep the object in sight.  The object began to move and gain altitude and once again a sort of chase resumed, where the object would be either in front of or behind us as we tried to keep pace with it.  The object suddenly stopped at an altitude of perhaps 500 feet, and we stopped directly below it, watching it from inside the car.  The object remained motionless for about 3-4 minutes, and then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared.  Since that occurance I have retired from a career in the military, where I was exposed to all types of airborne craft.  I have never seen or heard any type of jet, plane, or helicopter that even remotely resembles what I observed that night.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Let me say this also, everytime the item stopped moving, it would appear to be white, then before moving would start pulsing red, while moving it would remain red. All movements appeared to have instant top speed to instant stop, except for a few times were it would start at what I would estimate half speed.

I saw it on Sunday evening (May 6th) at about 9:30!  I went outside as I do every night to &quot;check out&quot; the sky. I sat down and looked across the valley having a wide range of sky to view.....then, I looked straight up! That&apos;s when movement of something caught my eye slightly  toward the left (south) of me. 2 huge lights were moving south toward San Francisco away from me! I thought, &quot;Gee, I didn&apos;t know planes had tail lights like that! Gee, that plane is awfully low!  Hey! absolutely NO sound!&quot;    By now I am very interested!!!!!!  I tried so hard to make this a plane! Yet, no red or blue lights blinking, I couldn&apos;t make out the wings either! During the week I have watched the full moon change size as it rises. I would say the size of the moon at about 70 degrees-maybe 60 degrees- above its horizon, is the size of  each of the 2 lights/portals on this craft! That&apos;s pretty big!  (I was expecting portals to be about the size of cruise ships portals.) It was difficult to see the body of the craft as it seemed to match the sky. The moon was not up far enough to cast any light on it. I did have the impression the area of the lights was oval and I felt that the outer edges of the circular lights marked the outer edge of the craft. I felt the lights/portals were in the lower &frac12; of the height of the craft.. I could be wrong here...... I also had the impression that the height of it was long. And, above the light section the craft started to get narrow. Maybe my eye caught this, I don&apos;t know how I know this. The Height: Now, I am not good at judging heights in the dark, but I will do my best here. I am 700 feet up from the valley floor, oak trees in question are about 60ft. tall, and the branches reach out to about 45 feet. The area I viewed the craft in was: (with one eye shut)one hand from wrist to fingers plus the length of my another hand&apos;s fingers. The width of the craft where the portal area was: (with one eye shut)4 palm knuckles across. My guess is that the craft was 1000 feet above me, making the craft large. If the craft was up higher than that, this was a huge craft! Hard to tell for the lights were SO large. When I first went outside apparently the craft was going right over my head! When I noticed it, the craft bottom had already passed me. The brightness of the lights/portals dulled everything else about the craft as well as no moon shining on it. No light was emitted outward from these lights/portals, it was all internal lighting. I had no missing time. During the long 6 to 10 seconds of viewing it and afterward, I felt calm, happy. There was like a gentleness to the craft. What a treat this was for me!!", "We observed an object that appeared metalic and reflected light in the sky over Tempe, AzWhile getting ready for morning jog, we noticed luminescent and unnatural looking object in the South East Sky at about 50 degrees.

It took less that a minute for the light to cross the entire sky and out of our sight.  We were all pretty confused as to what it could have been and tried explaining it, but everything we could come up with didn&apos;t seem to fit.  It moved at a constant speed, it didn&apos;t fade in and out or flicker, which a meteor would do, and moved far too fast to be a sattelite.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Ufo&apos;s play tag with each other.At 10:30 pm on the 26th of november 1997 My feionce alerted me to a very bright diamond shaped object sitting just above the horizion. On a overcast but still night. After watching the object for a minute or two i went to get my video camera. We went outside and started to film the object, almost imeadietly as i started to film the object slowly started to more to my right until it dissapeared behind a hill in the distance. We both look ed at each other and thought it was a bit weird but proceeded back inside. At that point an object in almost the same position as the first one. A large object was sitting on the horizion with a smaller object aproaching from it&apos;s right side (my left side) passed right by the bigger object and stopped and then flared up to the same size as the the other object. Big! at that point they started to fly towards each other passing by each other, one of the objects stopped where the first one was sitting and the other object moved behind the hill and out of sight. The other object remained in position for minutes before leaving in the same direction as the previous two objects. As was stated in the video by my feionce and I we where surprised at what we had just witnessed. At that point out of the corner of my eye i saw an object coming towards us i called to ((name deleted)) and said look up and we saw what looked like two balls of light with a strobing red light flying right by us with no noise and no definable features apart from being two balls of light. No wings no tail no blinking and more importantly no noise. the object was low in the sky, infact so low that it passed behind a tree a about 25-30ft tall about 20 metres in front of me. As it passed by us and went in front of us it was a mirror image of itself. In other words no visable change just two balls of light with a strobing red light going from left to right. We lost sight of the object about two or so kilometers away going behind trees. at that point i think we both knew we were watching something we had never seen before. Around five os so minutes later a large oval shaped orange glowing light appeared on the horizion right where we had lost the object behind the trees, low in the sky but clearly visable the object stayed still for minutes when all of a sudden a small object seemed to fly write up into the bright oval object.The bright object then changed shape into two white lights seperated by a small gap but with no red light this time and was approached by another similar looking object which flew past and a minute or two later both objects seemed to fade out and were no longer visable. The time now was around 11.30pm 1 hour later. Quite a long exhibition what ever it was! The next day i telephoned Air services Australia the official people who monitor aircraft movement into and out of Sydney. Their Response was that there was only one plane in the area at the time a 747 which flew past the area at 10.30pm and into Sydney (Mascot) and asked if i wanted to persue the matter further at the time i was a little nervous and so no but i would like to no what it could have been. Their response was after a minute or so on hold was that &quot;it could have been police helicopters or rescue helicopters&quot;. Well if this is true then i am convinced we would have heard them as we had one pass almost directly overhead at no more than 100 feet. the UFO Society of Austrailia has also looked at my tape as well as an astronomer at Sydney Observerty, Channel seven news here in Sydney not to mention my family and friends are all of the same opinion we have seen and video taped ufo&apos;s. They cannot at this time be identified. I would be only to happy to show you this and other footage i have and let you make your on mind up. However as i live in Australia we only have vhs. Can you view a tape of this format. Also i would like to add that we also observed and taped other objects in the imediate area of that first sighting for a period of three months with other eyewitness accounts.

To the south east at the point of a bright star, there was one very bright object moving south to north. I thought it was a satellite, but it disappeared after a 5 inch movement across the ski and on a clear evening. A few seconds later the same or another burst came on the same path and disapeared.((NUFORC Note:  The description is not inconsistent, we observe, with a tumbling satellite, or rocket booster, but it should have continued to be visible as it moved to the north, I.e. &quot;toward&quot; the sun, which would have been shining over the north-northwest horizon at this time of night.

They had no formation, as we watched they sped up and slowed down passing each other. However they all seemed to be going the same speed. They never caught up to or passed the large craft in front. They traveled full view from the southeast sky and traveled to the north. After they had traveled about 15 miles they where still in view till they went behind a mountain. Weirdest thing I have ever seen... never experience something this weird before.", "Small yellow light following jetlinerMy home is in north central Phoenix, along the approach pattern for aircraft landing at the local airport. (sky harbor) I am familiar with most types of aircraft (civilian and military) and can usually identify them quickly, due to their low altitude. (about 5000 feet)  Most of the aircraft are Boeing 737&apos;s, moving from due east to due west flying the approach to Sky Harbor, though there are a few Air Bus 300&apos;s, Boeing 757&apos;s, and MD-80&apos;s. On Tuesday evening (3/27/01) at about 9:30 pm I was standing in my backyard. There were a few aircraft in the approach pattern, I would say one every 3 to 5 minutes. As I looked to the south I noticed an aircraft (looked like a Boeing 757) moving from south west, to northeast, passing just east of my position. I then noticed a very small, dim yellow light which seemed to be following the 757 about one and a half plane lengths behind. As the jet got closer (to me) the light began a slow arc to the northwest, executing a turn of roughly 90 degrees. If I had to estimate the size of the light, I would say it was less than 10 feet in diameter, based on its proximity to the aircraft. The strangest thing of all was the way in which the light moved. It was like a fish swimming. It continued on a northwest course and just &quot;blinked out&quot; after about 10 seconds", "was it a slient stacker looking to land?On this date my wife and I were in the process of moving to the country. I had to run to our new place to take a few things over while she and my daughter atayed home. I was taking in the woods around us and looking at the field across the road. I heard a sound which was soft and different from other noises which a person would hear in this area. The sound seem to increase slowly and I was trying to see where it would be coming from and light appeared from no where. I was wondering if it was a air craft of some kind searching with a spotlight. When the sound was over head I seen these two shape triangle shape images or craft whichever it should be moving very slow. I was alarmed and there was no phone to call anyone because our new phone wasn&apos;t hooked up yet. Well, I was afraid and did not know what to do. Go to the car and get out of the area ? well I went inside on the trailer and watch there where color lights also red, light blue and a off white dusty light which was scanning the ground across the road. It seemed forever but as soon as they started to desend they quickly went. It looked like a burst of energy but the sound was soft but a tone louder. I did not report it to any offical because of being made a fool out of. I do not drink, I do not do drugs and do not smoke. I know what I saw and that will never leave me.", "A large red glowing &quot;plasma cloud&quot; appeared over the woods, then at least 11 smaller white circular objects were seen.I was 14 years old, and attending a boarding school on a small hill in the &quot;sticks&quot; of western Massachusetts, located close to the town of Chicopee.  It was a Saturday night; I and my best friend/classmate had begged off attending a slide show in the cafeteria, and were in our respective dorm rooms, studying.  Around 9:00, my friend was banging on my door and babbling in hysterics.  I let her in, and heard what I thought was an April fools joke about seeing a flying saucer.  I finally agreed to go to her room (which faced the back lawns and woods between the school and Chicopee) and look out the window.  There was nothing there but the woods and dark.  I was in the middle of saying &quot;there&apos;s no such thing as flying saucers&quot;, when a very large red glowing (like glowing plasma) &quot;cloud&quot; appeared over the trees at the edge of the woods.  Now I was hysterically laughing and babbling and pointing at this thing, while it descended slowly into the woods.  Once it had &quot;settled&quot;, we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  But that was only the beginning - a few moments later, we saw white saucer-like objects flying at very high speeds and at unbelievable angles.  They seemed to be able to go from about 1/2 mile to 3 miles away in an instant!  At one time during this incident, we counted as many as 11 objects in the air at once.  Their movement seemed to be centered very close to, or right over Chicopee, although it was hard to tell because of the tremendous distances they covered so quickly.  We never saw any of the objects again, although there were rumors in our dormitory that several girls had seen strange things in the sky.  It was very hush-hush; nobody wanted to be labelled a &quot;kook&quot;.  Understandably, my friend asked me never to discuss the incident.  It does take a bit of courage to report something this bizarre.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Suddenly one of the stars became bigger and brighter. At first I thought it was a plane on approach to Ferihegy, Budapest airport. They often turn the &quot;headlamps&quot; on when over our part of the North of Budapest. However there was no noise and the &quot;lamp&quot; was very, very bright. It was also very big. I estimate about the size of a finger tip with arm outstretched. Furthermore it never moved for about 10 to 15 seconds. Then the light faded back to a small star size over a period of about 10 seconds and moved north and disappeared after another 10 seconds. The move to the north was only about two hand widths before it vanished. I thought it could have been an aircraft turning away from me. But aircraft with landing lamps do not turn that quickly. There was no noise and no other aircraft lamps (strobe, etc). I have watched other aircraft this evening and when they are near (about 2 miles) I can see the other lamps and the &quot;headlamps&quot; are not anywhere near the size or the brightness of the unidentified flying object. Here I speak literally rather than emotionally. Another thought was of a meteorite. But meteorites move quickly. This was stationery and then moved to one side after fading. Very strange. Any thoughts?", "Unusual movement pattern of bright light with  an aura at times.I&apos;m not sure what we&apos;re seeing.  We saw the same thing 1 week ago except on Saturday night instead of Sunday night, although both were at the same time of night.

It is far away when we see it, so we don&apos;t know where it is actually flying over. We also see light flashes of red and green.  It is almost like an aura at times with light reflecting in color around it.  Sometimes it looks like it is going out, and then we see it light up again.  It gradually moves off until out of sight, but continues to have the unusual movement pattern.

I got permission from him to go out and take some photographs.  I took about 12 to 14 snap shots of the area.  I was annoyed when none of the pictures turned out.

This was seen at night around the time of 1:30 - 2:15 a.m.   There were many round lights and they were all green. Not blinding and could make out the pattern of the lights as well as the shapes of the lights very well. Object seemed to be round by the way the lights were set up. Green lights were round in shape and the center rows seemed to go around the object. Also remember there was more or just one more light near the top of the center row and one at the bottom of the center row of lights. A very close sighting and lights were seen clearly. Object was just below tops of trees and behind one set of tree line. I was driving home on a road at night where there are at times very little to no traffic. A road where there are woods on both sides and not many homes built. I think these woods that go along this long stretch of road (I think which is 538 or 539) are reserved by the McGuire Air Force Base, since they occasionaly have trucks travel to and from these dirt roads that come off of this particular road. It was around the time of 1:30 to 2:15 a.m., was so long ago, do not remember the exact time. As I came around one bend I noticed a green light to the left side of the road in the woods near the tops of the trees that were closest to the road, up ahead of me. I started thinking to myself as I was driving closer &quot;who would be playing with something this late at night like that&quot; or &quot;when did this light source get built and put up here&quot;... When I got closer, I slowed down to a crawl, while looking upwards towards the top of the tree line, I eventually stopped the car and rolled down the window. I stared at it in puzzlement. I could see the tree branches silhouetted in front of the many green lights of the round object. This is where the most shock kicked in. After I had stopped and was looking at it.... I just started to realize that something was&apos;nt right and started to realize that this object was actually getting lower and was &apos;very&apos; slowly moving downwards behind the set of trees. I was directly across from the object that was lowering from behind the set of trees. There was &apos;no&apos; sound that could be heard from the object, and I was pretty close to the object. Panic set in and I said a few words out loud, which I won&apos;t write here. And I slammed my foot onto the gas pedal to leave as quick as possible, I could not drive well, my arms and whole body was shaking. As I was making my way down the road away from where the object was, I looked in my drivers side door mirror, and I saw car headlights coming from around the bend, just before where I was stopped at, and also saw that the object with green lights was no longer there. I did not see the lights any where. Sorry this is so long. And I kept this and another event to myself because I did not know there were so many others seeing u.f.o&apos;s until years later when I started to read up about so many other events that others had witnessed. Never knew of it much until I got a computer and was able to read up on information. I would also like to add that I am in excellent mental health, high IQ, never had done drugs, nor alcohol, nor have ever had hallucinations, and I was not tired that night. This is being told in absolute truth. And would be nice to know if any others had spotted this green lit up object in that area as well. 2 years later on another night, the same &apos;exact&apos; object with green lights appeared again I think in June. In the same area but not in the exact spot, maybe 1 mile further from the first time. This time I was going to head on over to a friends house, I took the same road, but for some reason while driving there I decided that maybe I&apos;d go visit my friend another time, and decided to turn off onto another back road to turn around.  Well this weird feeling came over me, I don&apos;t know why, (I&apos;m in amazement as I write this still now.) As I was slowing down on this other road which has no street lights on it, I looked into my passengers side door mirror, I almost had me heart failure, I caught a glimps of green lights this time much higher in the night sky and the moon was almost fool this night. The object was again stationary in one spot maybe 2 tree lengths up above the tree line. This object and the moon were not that far apart, I remember seeing the moon to the right as I was looking above the trees and the green lit up object farther to the left. Once again, I was the only one on these two roads at the time. This time I was thinking &quot;Oh my God, Oh my God, I don&apos;t believe this&quot; and &quot;It&apos;s back again&quot;, with some curse words, and of course panic set in again, and I quickly pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to make a quick u-turn to go back to the road I had come off of. Which means I was turning around to head some what towards the object, because it was the only way I knew of to get back home. Again, I had slammed on the gas after I made the sharp u-turn and was driving quickly. After I made the u-turn in panic, I got myself to look up (to the left side now, above the trees), and saw no green object, only saw the moon. A second after looking again and not seeing the object I saw car headlights up ahead coming from the road I was heading back to get onto.  I made it back home, and said to myself, why when I&apos;m on that road and that thing has to show up are there no other cars around, but when ! another car was coming around the object would disappear or it&apos;s lights would go out... I did&apos;nt take that road again for a long time, I changed my route. These days, I am now a professional photographer, but I wish I was then and wish I had a camera on me.

The sky was clear and we were traveling in a westward direction. The object was at about the &quot;11:00&quot; position in a south west direction from our position. Because of my interest and background in Ufology I tend to pay a little more attention to things in the sky then the average individual. I naturally assumed this was a plane ascending from the Sacramento airporrt, and was at such an angle that I could not see it&apos;s wings. As we drove for a few blocks the object seemed to hang in the air, which again I assumed that we didn&apos;t notice it&apos;s movement because &quot;we&quot; were moving. At that point we made a left turn, proceeding south and the object was now directly in front of us at about the 11:00 position.Being that we had traveled a good distance I and were a a different angle to the object, we should have seen the wings at that point. Having no reference point, I&apos;m going to guess the size of this thing as that of a commercial aircraft as that&apos; what I thought it was in the first place. It was a very shiny metalic and all one color, and cylindrical in shape. Well now as one might imagine, I became very excited, and pulled over to get a good look at this thing. When I did so, my vision was obstructed from some trees, so I got out of the vehicle and walked to the other side of the trees until I had that portion of the sky back in my field of view. The object was gone. Based on the rate of speed this object was traveling, and the length of time we had it in our field of view, if it was a conventional aircraft, we should have still been able to see it. So in conclusion this object was only out of our sight for a few seconds, and would have had to move at an incredible speed to be out of our field of view.

There was a large ,bright oval shape light on what appeared to be the frount of the object and several other lights forming what appeared to be a triangular shape craft. In the center of the object was a red light, none of the lights flashed.As I stated the object was very large but made little sound. However, the sound it did make was that of a soft humming.It wasnt untill the object was overhead that I/we heard a sound .It seemed to be grey or black in color,moving rather slowly for we were able to view it for about three min.It appeared to have a haze around it, prehaps due to the brightness of the frount light.

In fact it was the first night we were to stay here. Anyway, driving east I look out the passenger side window right beside me while my wife was driving and looking forward. I glanced up slightly and saw a huge bright light flying only a kilometer or so over the tree line. At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on but there is no airport near by. At closer investigation I saw that the brightest of the lights was in front of the craft and there were two more at the rear making a triangle shape. There was a blinking light directly at the bottom. While it was still a good distance from us I noticed a small light of some sort fall from underneath this thing.  As it came closer I thought about pointing it out to my wife. Just as I thought of telling her I heard her ask &quot;What is that?&quot; We slowed down and looked at it for several seconds as it lowered and finally became less illuminated. I could see clearly the side of the craft. It had what looked like windows wrapped around what I call the hull. Just when most of it was visible it lit up again very quickly and disappeared with a bright flash of light. No sooner than we saw this my wife started to almost scream when we saw two more directly in front of us. They all looked identical to the first one. Again I saw a light (almost looked like a meteorite) fall from the bottom of one of the other crafts. One all of a sudden appeared and went straight down in the east. We were speechless. We finally talked about it when we got to the apartment building only a mile from where we witnessed all of this.

My window looks to the west.  Sunset had occured and I had noticed the pink clouds low on the horizon shortly before the event.  It was approx. 7:10 or 7:15 and both my cat and I saw two firey objects streak acorss the upper portion of the window (which would probably be about 70-90 degress from the horizon.

They were both yellow-orange in color, and appeared to leave a trail or had a trail as the streaked acorss our line of vision.  They were moving fast in a horizontal movement, slightly rising.  They were almost parallel with each other, possibly one slighty postioned behind the first.

The object appeared to be moving in an easterly direction while I was moving north in a ((type of vehicle deleted)) vehicle. It is because of my job that I am reluctant to make this report at all. My area of patrol is a 24 square mile region that borders the Pennsylvania-Ohio line and is located approximately 15 miles east of the Youngstown, Ohio Airport and  Air Force Reserve Base. I am familiar with most of the types of planes, helicopters,  and dirigibles that fly in and around this area. The object I saw on this particular day was a silver color that was definitely more intense than any of the planes I usually see. The object was circular in shape and had no visible wings. Because I was in a moving vehicle travelling at a speed of 45 miles per hour, I could not estimate the speed of the object as it moved in an easterly direction. I can only guess its size and distance from me as 1 to 2 miles  and the approximate size of a quarter held at arms length. I attempted to pull off the roadway to get a better visual and maybe a still photo, but as I slowed down the object accelerated upward at a tremendous speed and was gone in an instant. The weather was sunny and the sky was exceptionally clear this day with few clouds. The reason that this is so notable is because this area is usually shrouded in cloud coverage known as the Great Lakes Effect, relative to the clouds that form over the Great Lakes Region and move in a southeasterly direction through Ohio and Pennsylvania. It has been 1 week since that sighting and I have not heard any other reports regarding the object on that day.

As I approached town, I noticed that these lights were coming from the grocery store parking lot area. It was a stationary object so even though it was about 2 miles to town it was still there when I arrived. I saw a dark triangle shape against the sky with the 3 lights coming from each side of the point witch was pointed towards the ground. I was curious, still thinking that this could be a hot air balloon or something else. I was the only car which turned into the parking lot. I thought this in itself was amazing since the road had alot of traffic that night. Was I the only one who saw this?. I pulled my car directly under the craft, which was only slightly above the parking lot light. It was a dark color maybe black, metalic with slight bumps arranged in possible adhesion or rivet type patterns. The shape was clearly up-side down pyramidal and about 50-60 feet from top corner to top corner. It was centered over 4 parking lot lights and I wondered if it was gathering energy from them also. It made no sound.(I turned off my car, and listened carefully between the waves of cars on the road). Another car pulled up, a grey Toyota Celica with 2 young men inside. they roled down their window and were looking at the craft with the biggest eyes I&apos;ve ever seen. Their mouths were hanging open and I could see their tongues. I waved at them and the craft began to rotate on axis. The men burned rubber out of there and squealed tires again acelerating onto the road. I decided that my car was a safer vantage point at this time and hoped it would start. It did and I backed up about 50ft. The craft then headed towards the grocery store. It looked like it would run into the sign and roof. When the point of the craft got within 15-20 ft of the store, the craft lifted about 5 foot and cleared the store top. I should metion that it didn&apos;t make any sound, the lights had rotate! d from p ointing west to pointing south and it was only traviling at a speed of about 5MPH. Against the night sky I could see the flat top clearly. A few months later a co-worker was talking about the UFO that crossed the road in front of her. She said that she and others stopped their vehicles on highway 34 towards Greeley and just watched this up-side down pyamid thing cross the road. She said that it was still moving at about 5MPH. Her sighting lasted about 15-20minutes as she saw the lights before it crossed the road.((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not specify whether the time was am or pm, but we presume it was a nighttime sighting.

The fireball was changing with reds, oranges, and yellows moveing about and actually looked as if it was on-fire. From my prospective, it changed from the size of a golf ball to totally engulfing my whole line of sight. It only took about 2 seconds for it to descend to me and it was not a direct path, but instead slightly arcing. Startled, I looked at my cousin who also seemed surprised. We briefly discussed the occurrence with great excitement, as children do, and ran back to the house.

Any legitimate suggestions would be appreciated.", "Hovering saucerThis event took place quite a while ago; I was only 4 or 5 years old I haven&apos;t tried to make any report of it. Knowing by now my memory of the event will not be totally accurate I have not wished to report it. However, the memory of something very out of the ordinary remains and particular parts of the memory remain clearly as if it only happened yesterday. I remember even to this day what I was doing just before the event and I remember my dog had been with me at the time that I was sitting outside my house in my yard. I don&apos;t remember seeing the object come closer to me, so that I can&apos;t verify that for its been too long. However, I remember seeing the object either a little higher or a little lower than the telephone line than runs through my backyard and wasn&apos;t more than 150 yards in distance from where I had been sitting when I remember seeing it. This object was a classic saucer shape. It still seems like it just suddenly appeared and I remember being unsure of what it was I was seeing. My parents didn&apos;t allow me to see scary movies, in fact I had no idea what a &quot;UFO&quot; was until I picked up a book in the school library at 6 or 7 years old, recognizing the picture on the front -- suddenly realizing I had seen that same thing. I remember the object hovering over the yard in the far corner, and the noise I heard is what I remember the most...a drowning repetitive sound that never changed in pitch. The moment I felt fear struck me when this object unknown to me at the time to what it could possibly be, overtook me when the lights from the object fell to the ground, like a spotlight. I can&apos;t say for sure what colors they were except that I believe it was possibly 3 colors, either red, white, and green, or red white, and blue. I&apos;m not even sure anymore how those colors actually formed on the ground other than it formed a circle below the object. My instinct even at that young of age took over, and I ran (luckily my door wasn&apos;t very far from where I had been sitting) straight into the house with my dog ! right be hind me. My Mom recounts the incident, still remembering me coming inside screaming and saying there was something in the sky. She says my dog was very upset and spooked, and acted like she was nervous. When my Mom went to look outside to see what I could have been possibly talking about, it had disappeared without a trace. My Mom also says she remembers me mentioning the noise and she questioned me, asking if it was a helicopter. I told her no, and described the noise to her. She remembers me walking out in the yard to show her where I had seen it -- in approximately the corner of my yard. For many years now I have tried to tell myself that if I saw anything it had to be something the military made. However I have never gotten over that feeling of complete fear when those lights hit the ground...as if whatever was in that object, knew I was there. I am a student of psychology, I know that the mind recreates memories, however there are three things I know I couldn&apos;t have make up -- the fear I felt -- that sound I heard and the fact it hovered without any wobbling. Recently, I have begun to accept my memory of the event and have done some research and that is why now I can share it with someone who might find the report useful in some way. I&apos;m not afraid that someone might think I was crazy, because I pondered the thought myself for many years and truthfully at one time I preferred that thought over the thought of it really being something unknown.", "sat down on deck behehind house. looking east i saw a military plane ( ABOUT 50,000 FT)  heading south. i see them often. this time something approached it from behind and overtook it at an amazing speed. i thought it was the space shuttle because i knew it was to land today. there was no exhaust flume, so i assumed that it was our shuttle. i called my wife outside to look. she did so and was also amazed at the speed. it left our view seconds later. i went inside and went online to nasa. the nasa sight stated that the shuttle had touched down at 9:10 this morning. hello!! what was that??", "tringular shaped object hovering while making a droning type noise. disappeared very quickly.triangle shaped object was hovering directly above us.eggshell to grayish in color.it wasnt smooth on the bottom as we could see what i recall as being seams in its structure similiar to a aircraft. it made a electrical type of droning noise.we looked away from it very briefly at which time i remember that the dronong sound stopped.when we looked back where the object had been we saw that it was gone.we attempted to relocate it with negative results.i remember it as being a clear summer day and that our vision was not impaired by low cloud coverage.", "Gigantic white teardrop plunges into Cayuga Lake, Ithaca, NY in late July, 2000.While in the process of moving and packing a truck, I glanced up (in a direction NNW from my location) and saw a huge white teardrop shaped object plunge earthward (it appeared to plunge into Cayuga Lake) in a split-second.

Date os sighting was 30MR01.  PD)) I was working at my PC. The window was cracked open and I heard an approaching car and looked out the window to see if someone was coming down our driveway. We have a gravel driveway that leads to a country road. The driveway is approx 1/4 mile long. It was about 9:20 p.m. or so...I was not aware of the time at that point. As I looked out the window and saw the car was headed to another house by the main road, I noticed lights in the sky. They appeared to be those of a plane initially, but there was NO noise at any time! There were yellow lights and red lights and I was startled because it seemed to be flying at a very low altitude. It appeared to be coming head on rather than across the sky. It was located on the other side of the road, off the road, back towards the woods, near the tree tops. I understand that they were coming from the East. I continued to watch and then called my husband as I left the office to go outside for a better view. I couldn&apos;t get the words out because I had to sneeze and by the time my husband got to the front porch it had disappeared. I told him to wait as I was going to get the video camera as I felt &quot;something was very different about this plane and it would be back.&quot;  Only a few minutes passed and I returned to the front porch and I would guess it was around 9:25 or so. The rest is recorded on the video tape. I would say that in retrospect, that the so called quick movements made by the aircraft as perceived by me, probably resulted from my zooming in and out. I used the night vision mode. The camera is a Sony Digital 8 , Model DCR-TRV310.  There is quite a bit of air traffic in this area, BUT we can hear the planes without any difficulty whatsoever. That is what is very odd about this, unless the objects were so far away that we couldn&apos;t hear them. It was cloudy that evening and you could not see the stars with the exception of the one I recorded close to the moon. I am assuming that was a star. The &quot;planes&quot; seemed to appear from the woods in the East. At the beginning of the video there are two...which my husband  reasons are planes. They are traveling at different altitudes from south to north the best I can tell. My last shot of the event films an object going the other way, from north to south, back towards the woods.  (To be continued)Multitude of extremely fast flashing lights in a small area of the sky.Part II of report After reviewing the video several times in different modes, I might accept someone telling me that these are planes. But in order to do that, I want to video tape again, during the evening on a clear night and compare the two.  I find it very difficult however, for anyone to come up with any explanation for the visual display of rapid-fire light activity (similar to a seventies psychedelic rock concert) in such a small airspace. I find it difficult to believe that FAA would allow planes to fly so close to the ground and/or allow the number of planes (as represented by the flashing lights) we saw in such close proximity to one another. To take this further, IF you view the tape in frame by fame mode, you can actually see the smaller objects moving from one point to another, at such a speed and in directions that defy what I, with no knowledge of physics, know as possible. It is difficult to see initially, but the parts are noted with my commentary (which I hope you will ignore!) about &quot;twinkle, twinkle little stars&quot; and then later, with &quot;they are like mosquitoes.&quot;  There are frame views of the objects that show two round lights and also parts that show how the objects appear to be turning 360 degrees on an imaginary axis, then close up (like a clam) and move. On the frame by frame close ups, they look like a diamond shaped object. In one of the views , unless this is all my imagination or camera foolery, the object looks like it rotates, gets very dark on one side with a finite line showing a very dark underside and starts to collapse before heading to another location. Today I shot some more video of the area in daylight. Hopefully that may help in orientation of the landscape. Perhaps I am making more of this that what is actually there. But it is something I have never seen before. Also, I guess it could be tricks played by the camera and the way it films light? I have no idea. Would appreciate hearing what you think after viewing the copy of the tape.  Rather than emitting objects, which I did not see, I felt by movements that this was some type of exercise or manuevers and the object went back (not all) into another object? I know....CRAZY! End of Report((NUFORC Note:  We received the lengthy video tape on 16AP01, and we have looked at it several times.  We agree with the witness that the lights &quot;strobe,&quot; and we agree that they move in the night sky.  However, although we cannot be certain yet, our suspicion is that she may have been video taping aircraft in the distance.  We will investigate a bit more, but the strobing patterns are not inconsistent with aircraft, or perhaps helicopters.

As he was elevating towards the sky, I did not notice anything in the sky other than my dog. I was obviously very upset and freaked out that my dog has just floated into the air, actually,he scared me. As I was rushing awayy from the scene, Three giant triangular shaped very flat looking objects with three very large roaming white spotlights appeared out of the sky, almost out of nowhere, with absolutely no noise. All of a sudden all of the lights on all three of the objects concentrated on one area of the ground, and a very large hissing noise came from out of the craft. At this point I started to run back towards my house and wasn&apos;t looking back. As I turned a corner to get out of that area, I noticed an orangy glow coming from an area in the trees, there directly in that glow were several people, humans standing looking like they were on some type of anestesia or something,(these people did not look familiar to me) Then suddenly, a very skinny silvery shiny, person started moving around these people with a bluish metallic wand and was passing it over each person like a metal detector, once he finished, the orangr glow, the people, and he being, floated towards the crafts.((NUFORC Note:  We will request corroborating reports from the other witnesses, who reportedly were under the effectof the &quot;bluish metallic wand.&quot;   PD))", "Light appearing in the north and flying south in the Phoenix sky.The object I saw was flying south at a very high speed. I first saw it was an airplane but this one was flying very high and did not have the red blinking lights all airplanes have and there was no noise coming from it. When it disapeared into the clouds there was an additional flash of light about ten times bigger than the object. This flash did not come from the object itself. This flash of light looked like one of those spotlights they use for promotions but it was not fully round and it flashed for about 2 seconds. All I want to know is if somebody else in Tempe, Chandler, or Scotsdale saw the same thing. As I said, it flew south so people in the Casa Grande, Arizona area would have to have seen the same thing.", "It was starting to get cloudy, but I had a fairly large area of clear sky. I was at work, and stepped outside. I looked up into the sky, Their was all these big lights, like they might be craft of some kind. They wer staggered out, but in a perfect formation. They were slowly moving South to North. I watched for about 4 minutes, they didn&apos;t chage directions, but stayed in a formation. No sounds were heard. Then the clouds moved in, and I could only see them in the breaks of the clouds for about 2 minutes. Then the clouds took over completely. It was fantastic, but chilling, too. No mention about them on news or the papers. A friend had called me to go out and check the site outside, he was in Santee, California. The object kinda look like giant stars, with a slight flickering.", "Strange lights in the small town of HartsgrveIt was the summer of &apos;98, just after my senior year of high school.  Me and my friend had just gotten back to his house on Ireland Road near route 86 in Hartsgrove from an evening out with some friends.  Instead of turning in for the night we decided to shoot the breeze for a while because the weather was so nice.  So after a while of sitting in my car talking we noticed a strange light in the east sky.  It seemed to be off in the horizon moving steadily closer and higher into the sky.  It was such an odd looking light, it was so bright but it&apos;s light seemed so artificial so unlike that of a star.  That is what initially got us out of  my car to go investigate what we were seeing.  As we watched we noticed that it seemed to be moving about the sky in small figure eight configurations all the time while changing the intensity of it&apos;s light. After a while of watching the strange light do the same thing over and over again we lost interst and went back to talking.  Then about twenty minutes later in the north sky we noticed a weird looking craft in the sky, it was a rather wide looking object that made no noise, was pitch black in appearance, and only had three lights on it (one red light on each end and a blue light right in the center of it.)  If it was an airplane it was one neither of us had ever seen before.  About ten minutes later there was a huge flash of white light down the center of the sky and the aircraft that was on our left side (south) was now on the right of us.  Other than the fog that had rolled in just before the flash of light it was a perfectly clear night.  So to say the least we were pretty freaked out. Now this is the really freaky part of our night.  We were still in my friend&apos;s front yard talking about the weird stuff that was going on, not thinking too much into the events that had all happened within an hour and a half.  Like I said we were in his front yard just talking, we were facing towards each other, and I was looking at the ground kicking at some dandelions.  All of a sudden the ground got brighter like someone was shining a spotlight at us.  When I looked up over my left shoulder into the south sky I saw a perfectly round, perfectly white light floating down out of the sky right at us without giving off a single sound.  It was so bright I had to shield my eyes as I tried to look at it.  I was so stunned all I could do was yell, &quot;What the hell is that?!&quot; to my friend.  As I got to &quot;hell&quot; the ball of light stopped on a dime not more than forty feet away from us and immediatly shrunk in size, hovered for a brief second, and shot straight up into the sky with such amazing speed.  We watched it as it traveled among the stars until we lost track of it because it was moving so fast and blended in so well with the stars.  It was at that time that I turned to my friend and said, &quot;I think it&apos;s time I go home and go to bed  now.&quot;  And that&apos;s it, that was my one of a few strange sightings in Hartsgrove township.", "Many bright lightsWe were on our way home from Burlington,Vt.We were just coming into Ferrisburg,and we noticed a bright light in the sky.

Sort of and the whole underneath was full of little lights and then noticed a few blue&amp; red lights blinking also. then it took off not fast but it headed toward Burlington, VT. It had a jet type sound to it.", "Not so much an object as a close encounter, he told me my mission.It was late at night, I&apos;d say around ten &apos;till midnight, and I was walking through the woods.  I know that sounds crazy, but I never had anything to fear and always preferred the night over the day.  I probably should have reported this years ago, but everyone I told thought I was crazy.  I had stopped to take a breather and was watching a strange shaped aircraft that I assumed to be an experimental craft of the military.  It must&apos;ve taken it some time to get there, but I next remember seeing a saucer shaped object hovering over the trees across the clearing from me.  I could see beings that looked like children with big heads peering through the windows at me.  I wanted to run, but I felt a hand on my shoulder.  I spun around to face a little man with big black eyes and grey skin, I think people call them the Grays.  I was paralized with fear, but he said words in a language that I could understand.  He told me that I have to find the others.  He said that they would be able to answer a simple question that we are born with the knowledge of:  Who are the sisters?

She is a teacher and I am an engineer.  When I can get out of the Big City (San Diego) I like to look up into the night sky.  This night was cloudless, visability excellent.  We were taking a leisurely walk when I looked up right at an amorphous, semi-transparent cloud-like light area (not lighted but lighter than the background sky) moving towards us at about 70 degrees in the southern sky.  My first thought was that it was a flock of light-colored birds flying at night and I called it to the attention of my girlfriend.  It became quickly obvious to both of us it wasn&apos;t birds.  You could see the stars through it.  It varied in its lightness throughout its area (maybe two thumbwidths roundish at arms length), like a group of thin clouds moving together.  It wasn&apos;t an object or objects.  It was amorphous.  In the course of about 4 seconds it moved to roughly 70 degrees north (total about 40 degrees) and faded from view.  Estimated height 500-1000 feet, speed maybe 200 mph.  As this was taking place my mind was trying to put this in a compartment of the known and it completely failed.  My girlfriend&apos;s response was kind of like &quot;Well that was interesting.&quot;  My response was more like &quot;What the heck did we just see?  That makes no sense.  What the heck did we just see?&quot;  To reiterate, it was calm, warm, and completely cloudless that night.", "LARGE OBJECT SEEN HOVERING OVER TREESWe were on or way back from a fishing trip and pulled off ((deleted)).

The next thing we remember we were geting back in the car. We all took a vote and said that we would not report it to the local polic because of what happen some years ago when we had a big ufo flap and the person who reported it was hounded and put down in public.", "Matt black triangleI just wanted to report having seen a black triangular shaped craft back in the 1970&apos;s.  My sister and I saw this one evening while I was baby sitting her when my parents where working that evening.  I&apos;m a bit worried because I reported this when we saw it, and was warned off saying anything else about the event.  Being quite young I of course followed orders - I was somewhat scared of these people.  However, I recently moved elsewhere in the UK and in this area there was a UFO flap during January -March.  I saw a couple of the light shows recently, and called the local coastal radar station to ask what these low flying lights might be, and through the phone call had a visit from the MOD. It seems I&apos;m on file even after all this time, and I do not like the idea of being considered public property by certain government departments. I wouldn&apos;t mind so much if I had led an unusual or eventful life, but I&apos;m just a middle aged house wife who seems to have a file with the government? We were sat in the living room of my mothers home which has windows over looking both the rear and front gardens.  I&apos;m sure of the time because we had just finished watching a TV program that finished at 8.30.  My sister saw a strange light in the back that she described as like a glittering ball of light a bit bigger than a tennis ball.  She saw this in our neighbours garden and it seemed to be hopping around the plants and hedges.  (I got the full description after the event I am about to relate.) My sister told me she&apos;d seen something odd in our neighbours garden, and she thought that perhaps his hedge was on fire.  I got up to go to the window to take a closer look, and i couldn&apos;t see what she had seen, but as we stood together a huge cluster of lights descended from the sky towards us. The lights were a blue/green in colour and looked like a cross section of a craft.  The lights came towards us a tremendous speed. We ran from the house thinking some kind of aircraft was about to crash on us, and as we stood on the front path wondering why we were still alive a black triangular shaped craft covered in a multitude of different coloured lights flew slowy over us.  If there had been enough room for it to land I&apos;m sure it would have done.  In the meantime a commercial aircraft heading towards Manchester International Airport came into view and the craft took off after it and seemed to be playing tag with it all the way to the airprort.", "I sighted a disc shaped object hovering above the trees in a residential area of southwest Los Angeles in early 1970My sighting took place in the Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw area of Los Angeles in February of 1970.  While traveling north on LaBrea Avenue, coming down the hill toward Coliseum Ave, I saw very bright lights, resembling lights in a stadium, but they appeared to be too high up to be from a stadium (there was no stadium in that area.) These lights seemed odd so the driver of the car decided to investigate.  We went in their direction into a residential area that was on the north west side of Rodeo Rd and LaBrea Avenue. I&apos;m not possitive of the exact location because I was new to Los Angeles at that time and didn&apos;t know the area well.  I did, however, know LaBrea and Rodeo Rd intersection. When we approached the area that seemed to be the source of the lights we traveled down a residential street that had a &quot;T&quot; intersection.  As we approached this intersection, and turned right, our car headlights turned toward a very large object hovering above the tree tops and electric wire poles. As our lights turned toward this object, it flashed two lights back at us as if signaling back in response to our headlights shining toward it.  This object was at the corner of this intersection and was large enough to cover the full width of the street as well as part of the house nearest that corner.  We immediately drove under it, which enabled me to see the bottom. The bottom was a light color that appeared to be either sand color or a light beige and it had the appearance of a wheel with a hub and spokes radiating from it, so my assumption is that it was disc shaped.  These &quot;spokes&quot; appeared to be dimensional rather than painted and at the center was a light that was red when we passed under.  I couldn&apos;t determine the actual shape of the top because it was very dark outside, and I couldn&apos;t see the outline due to the bright lights that flashed back at us. I assumed that the lights were on the front of the vehicle but cannot say if there were other lights. This object made absolutely no sound and was completely motionless when we encountered it. We drove under it, pulled over to the side of the street just beyond it, at which time the driver of the car became hysterical because she recoginzed it to be a UFO. I wanted to get out to have a better look but the passenger side of the door was jammed due to a previous accident and wouldn&apos;t open. I could not get the driver to move to let me out. By the time she pulled herself together, started the car engine and made a U-turn to head back in the direction of the UFO, it was gone.  It made no sound when it moved off.  I don&apos;t know whether it moved sideways or straight up but it must have taken off at a fast speed because the whole episode seemed to be very brief.  When we reached the corner where it had been hovering, I tried to look in the sky and spot it.  I did see lights in the far distance, west of our location, and at the time I assumed these lights could have been the object.  In retrospect I cannot say for certain.  It may have moved sidways, up or it may have vanished.  I don&apos;t know. About a week or two after this event, while returning home from evening school in downtown Los Angeles, I was a passenger riding on the Santa Monica Freeway, heading west of downtown.  Needless to say, I was watching the skys trying to see this object again.  I did see a bright stationary light in the sky, to the left of the freeway in the area of Normandie or Western Avenue and south of the freeway.  As I looked at it, wondering if this was the same UFO, the light &quot;winked out.&quot;  It was like someone turning off a light and then there was nothing. The day after my initial sighting, the driver of the car and I called several places, including Goodyear just to confirm it was not a blimp we had seen, although we knew it wasn&apos;t. Also, it was not a helicopter, as you can hear them a mile away. Goodyear confirmed that no blimps had been in the air at all because of the wind conditions. The car driver called an office of the Air Force and was told they knew nothing.  Upon making further calls she was told this was a vehicle being tested by Hughes Aircraft, and that the neighborhood had been notified. This was 1970 and to my knowledge we had no vehicles that were shaped like this or that could perform in this manner.  To date, we still don&apos;t unless they are really more secret than some of the black projects.  I got a pretty good look at the bottom side of this UFO as we drove under and there were no wings or apendages that I could see and it was totally silent and motionless until it moved away from the area.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Jettisoned star-like object falls, hovers, moves laterallyMy brother and I were joking about a star in the northern sky (low on horizon) since it was coming at us (and how it better be a star or we&apos;re in trouble).  Gradually, lights consistent with airplane were clearly seen, so no big deal.  Then what can only be described as an object of some type was jettisoned from the &quot;plane&quot; and floated downward for approx 5 seconds. There was a very clear light trail as it fell and my first thought was that the plane had jettisoned garbage (etc.)...until the falling object stopped, hoevered a moment, then moved laterally for another 5 or seconds and then halted. We had been out with my brother&apos;s son earlier with his new telescope and there were very few stars at that time to view (clear night, half moon).  When I left the house, there were more visible stars, but still few on the northern horizon.  I do know there was only one star clearly visible in the area where the plane was flying prior to the object falling.  After that object had taken up position, there were now two stars in the sky. My brother is a former LtJG with the Navy and pulled out binoculars to observe the plane before it peeled off.  His comment: &apos;I don&apos;t recognize the light patterns on the plane&apos; although he has been out for a seven years and things likely have changed. I have no idea how to characterize what we saw, though my first guess is that this is not a UFO per se but a surveillance device of some type.  Time issue: from the time the object dropped, it was about 15 seconds before the plane crossed near us (not directly overhead, but reasonably close).", "glowing red lights speeding across the skyMy husband and I were standing outside looking at stars and sattelites. We were talking when all of a sudden we saw a weird looking light in the sky. It was a soft glowing orangish red color. It was moving very fast and made no noise at all. We aren&apos;t sure if it was just one or if there was two of them as there was one light behind the other. It was very strange to say the least!! I know that I have never seen anything like that before in my life and I have always enjoyed watching the stars.", "Driving back to Los Angeles from Las Vegas at 1:20 am, I looked over to my left to admire the stars, and noticed a bright, white light, the size of a third of the moon. The light very quickly dropped down to about 500 yards (estimating from the desert floor), and suddenly disappeared. The sighting lasted about three seconds.", "Disk, super fast, very low, completely silent.At this time i was between 17/18 years old and living with my parents. My best friend was staying over for the night. Him and i went out at around 3am to go swimming at the club house swimming pool. (Yes it was closed, but we would jump the fence and swim anyway...i paid dues for the right to swim so i was going to do it when i wished.) As we came about two hundred yeards for the pool fence, we saw a large streak of light go across the sky, similar to a comet type firework. The color was green, like green flames, so we though someone shot a firework of some sort that did not make any kind of report. (Report as in sound) (I am not saying this is related to the craft to come, however a link is possible, even though i cannot say that there is in fact a link between them.) I do not know how long my best friend and i had been swimming before leaving, i would estimate an hour. We were talking in detail about many things like friends do, and we decided to stay outside until we had finished talking. My parents room was right above mine, and talking in a normal voice is easily heard from their room. So, we sat on my car in the drive way and continued our convercation. Now, i began to notice what i thought was a street light being obstructed by something else out of my peripheral vision. Like trees blowing and disrupting the light. However, i took note that there was no wind blowing, and so not enough to move any tree branches. So then i started looking to see what it was that was blocking the light at times. When i began to focus on the light, i then realize it was not a street light to begin with....and the source of this light was moving. (Coming at us.) I will not post my exact words, i said something to the effect of, &quot;What is the world is that?&quot; My best friend and i walked to the middle of the drive way to get under this objects flight path, or as close as we could guesstimate. It was at this point we got an idea of how fast this object was moving. I have no frame of reference, so i cannot tell you how fast it was moving. I have never been to an air show and have not seen a fighter jet make a low level, high speed pass. This craft was flying about 100 feet off the ground. As it came closer, i noticed the light source was a large tube coming from the bottom of the craft, and it was a clear tube. The light itself was amber in color, and it illuminated the bottom of the craft. The tube was about one third the size of the bottom of the craft, and the tube was located in the center. The illumination was not a brilliant light, it was dull, just like what you would expect from a street light at a distance in the color amber. You could clearly see the tube as being clear, and the light contained with it. I have no idea what material the craft was made of, other than to say it looked dark from the illumination of the amber light. I saw nothing but the tube and what it illuminated because the tube was my main focus. I could not take my eyes off of it. It was moving at a very fast rate, and from the time we took real notice and moved up the drive way all took about one minute. This craft made no audible sound....not even a whisper. And the craft was about the size of...i am having trouble relating its size.....if you were to cross two streched limousines . (make a cross of them) As it went over us and past my house, my best friend and i ran to the back of my house and up the balcony in the back to watch it for as long as we could before it went out of sight. When i first realized it was a craft, a craft i believed to be alien, my first impulse was to run back to my car and jump under it. Hey i am not ashamed to admit it scared me. During the whole encounter, neither friend nor myself spoke a word after we saw what the craft was. Both of us were in shock, and we did not speak for around 5 minutes after the craft had been gone. When we went into my house, we both took note that it was 5:50am. The pool was only about a 10 minute walk away. I do not claim anything happend other than what i just reported. I do not believe anything other than that happend. I cannot account for that large time loss, although as i said, i do not know how long we were swimming, nor do i know how long we talked on my car. The green streak was moving from the North West heading South East. The craft was moving east to west. I do not know if they were connected as said before, but i do not deny the possibility.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Odd lights in the night sky", "We were playing football and something attracted my eye when I saw the football in the air there was a circle flying object in the sky.It wasn&apos;t the shape of any identified object.It was as round as a nickel.We watched it for about 15 seconds and it flew of right through a cloud leaving a trail of smoke.", "Didn&apos;t see it while aboard ship.  When had film processed an object appeared that was not noticed.  I am attaching it.  Nobody on the ship at the time said anything about seeing any flying objects.  To be honest, it looks like an ancient wine bottle found in the Mediterranean.  It does not appear to be a flaw on the negative and the frames beside it do hot have the object.((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to view a copy of the photograph.  PD))", "Dim, fast-moving, rapidly-changing formation startles Bay Area satellite observer.At 9:09 p.m. PDT May 6, 2001 during late twilight, I was standing on the roof of my apartment building concentrating on an area of the sky just south of the constellation Leo awaiting the appearance of a satellite (Cosmos 1943 Rocket, U.S. Spacecom number 19120), which was scheduled to (and did) appear in this area at 9:11 p.m. (Observation of low Earth orbit satellites is an occasional pasttime of mine; I use a satellite tracking program to predict visible satellite passes.) About 5-degrees south of the star Regulus (or at about 207-degrees true, 55-degrees elevation), my attention was diverted by a dim formation of what I think was five points of white (or starlight-like) light moving east to west. I estimate the brightness of each light to be about magnitude 3.0, only slightly brighter than the dimmest stars visible in our local sky at the time. Apparent size of the formation was approximately 1/2-degree, or the size of the full moon. The shape of the formation was initially diamond-shaped but did not remain constant -- the distances between the lights changed rapidly and the overall shape changed to more of a square or trapezoidal shape. There seemed to be a fifth light which may have been ziz-zagging behind the other four. As I stepped out from behind the wall I was using to block nearby streetlights, the lights quickly pulled into line with each other, and distictly resembled a V-formation as viewed from behind and slightly below (i.e. a nearly-horizontal &quot;V&quot;). The formation faded in the southwest sky (about 240-degrees true) at an elevation of about 30 degrees, appearing to recede into the distance. The formation covered about 30 degrees of the sky in about ten seconds and traversed an arc, the formation&apos;s bearing smoothly shifing from west to southwest. (I consulted sky maps after the fact for azimuth/elevation estimates.) The dimness of the objects, combined with their speed and my own perplexity while observing them, make exact recollection of their maneuvers imprecise. During the observation! , I was preoccupied with comprehending what I was seeing. My first thought was high-altitude aircraft or missiles, but the lights&apos; maneuverability ruled that out. About midway through the observation, I thought that the lights took on a slightly ruddy color, and I considered the fact that I was seeing a formation of birds reflecting the orange sodium vapor streetights of the city. I tried to make out flapping wings or some type of form but could not -- to move that quickly across the sky and relative to one another, birds would have to be fairly low and, given the brightness of the sky (residual twilight, urban light pollution and full moon), I should have been able to make out silhouettes. I am a radio broadcast engineer by trade with a lifelong interest in science and astronomy. I have seen many things in the sky (yes, I&apos;ve even seen the insect-eating UFOs in Excalibur&apos;s spotlight in Vegas), but nothing I could not identify. I don&apos;t know what I saw tonight, but that may be due to the short observation time and faintness of the objects. I am submitting this report in the event that it corroborates other reports.((NUFORC Note:  I believe we spoke briefly with this witness.  We found him to be highly credible, as his written report seems to suggest, as well.  PD))", "I was sitting in my garden talking to my fathers body guard.It was dark enough to see all the stars.I noticed that one star was moving about the speed of an airplane when you see it from the ground.But I&apos;m positive it was no plane because the light was exactly the size of all the stars aroud it.Later that night I told my father about it,who suggested it could be a satlight.But I can&apos;t say for sure that he was right.", "While driving home from ((deleted)) house, a friend of mine (deleted) and I saw a very white bright point of light up in the sky, and we thought maybe we were looking at MIR&apos;s re-entery into the atmosphere. As we got closer, we realized that it was comming towards us, and had what appeared to be blinking lights on the side. As we got closer to it and it to us, it became apparent that it was either close to the ground or very large, and had I believe 8 lights on it, 7 on the front in the chevron formation, and an 8th white blinking light in the back, located two inches(from my vantage point directly below it) from the frontmost light in the front. The front lights were varius sizes of cirlcles ranging from medium to large, with a red light at the &quot;nose&quot; of the object. The size of the circles were in no apparent order, but were symetrical in placement, i.e. a medium was across from a medium, and a large light was across from a large light. Once the object moved over the road, it slowed down to a nearly complete stop and shot out what looked like a faint spot light on the shoulder of the road at an angle of about 45 degrees from either the center or one side of the chevron. After the spotlight went out, it sped up, crossed the road diagonaly, and contined to move away from us towards the house at a fairly quick clip. At this point I called ((dleeted)) to tell him to get outside and see if he could get a look at what we had just driven under. I was on the phone with ((deleted)), who had answered ((deleted)) phone, for about a half of a minute when I looked out  the window and spotted another object, this time shaped like what I would call a classic saucer, only fairly  then what is normally reported.. like a sort of cigar, but more saucer shapped. It was moving over a field in the distance, complete with blinking lights that formed the saucer shape. It stopped over the field, sat there for about 5 seconds, then moved about three inches into what I presume was a different field, and stopped again, this time for about three seconds. Then continued its course in the same direction as the first object we had seen. My friend thinks that it was a helipcopter, but I havent seen helicopters with that many lights on it.. there may have been 6-7 lights on it, that appeared small from where we were. Also, from the distance that it seemed to be at, it must have been a very large helicopter, as it was about the size of a Altoid from where we were sitting on the road (we had pulled into a shoulder at this point to watch the object over the field). I was already extreemly excited over the first sighting, but this second one sent me over the top. I was yelling into the phone, &quot;oh my god what the hell is that, theres another one out there, look at that thing ((deleted))! Do you see it? Is that a helicopter? Jesus man its stopped!&quot; Then, as it sped away, I said something like, &quot;Holy *&amp;^@! Holy *&amp;^@! Christ man look at it!&quot; At this point I heard ((deleted)) say to ((deleted)), who must have been in the room with him, &quot;Damn man it sounds like ((deleted)) is flipping out, do you see anything?&quot; Shortly thereafter the object disipeared behin the treeline and we continued home. I couldnt shut up about it, while ((deleted)) didnt say much. I kept asking him if he had seen &quot;that first one&quot; shoot out the spotlight, and he would say yea, he thought so. PLEASE get back to me, I am dying to know if anyone else saw these things and reported them.", "It had been my habit before I opened my place of business each morning to do my early morning fishing. This one particular morning I had just finished my  fishing it was time to leave. As I walked up the stairway of the seawall I noticed a group of people looking upward. I glanced up and saw this huge Cigar shaped craft it apparently had come in off the gulf of Mexico. The size I estimated to be approximately 300 ft long. It was extremely low I estimated it to be no higher than 150 ft. It had no windows made no noise no apparent means of propulsion no type of emission.  It moved very slowly. One of the people in the crowd nudged me and said &quot;Am I seeing what I think I am seeing?&quot; After which I replied yes you are. This craft moved about a block away made its own cloud and disappeared. The weather was a perfectl;y clear day. In the next few days I did not see anything in the news media.

It looked like pictures of comets I have seen. The head of the light was large in the sky, comparing it with stars that night. The light seemed to appear out of nowhere and fell down in a 90 degree arc into the mountains, or east of the mountains(Swan Mountains, just sounth of the Flathead, Lake county borders.) Two of us saw it and were in complete awe. I expected there to be a jolt when it hit(if it hit ground); but, there was no jolt. One observer works in the conservation field and the other is currently a stay at home mom.

The veiw from where we observed this light is unobstructed for about 800 meters. The weather had been raining off and on all day and though the rain had stopped at the time of sighting the sky was still heavy with cloud leading me to believe that the craft was at a low altitude but there was no sound to be heard.

PD))1963 sighting of beautiful objects in southeast Mississippi , worth readingThese objects were seen on a beautiful crystal clear night (with no moon as I recall it). A friend of mine and our dates were &quot;parked&quot; in the country side just to the southeast of our home town in southeast Mississippi. We were facing roughly northeast.  I happened to be looking at the horizon when the first object ascended into view. It was followed by two additional objects of the same apparent shape, size, and color. They appeared dark red when I first saw them, much as the moon does as it first starts to rise. They were in a lazy J formation and flew from northeast to southwest with their closet point at about 2 oclock . As they ascended up from the horizon their color brightened. At their closet point they appeared oval in shape. The outside rim of each object was the purest gold color you can imagine. Think of a simple gold wedding band lit from within. They were gradually brighter toward the center, with the very center being their brightest point. The center was bright white. twinkling like a very large and bright star. They appeared to be three seperate objects. They would black out stars as they flew, and you could see stars between them at the same time. They were silent. I heard no sound. One of the most interesting aspects of this experience was what you felt as you looked at these objects. A feeling of peace and serenity . Strange as it may sound, there was a level of awareness as you looked at the objects. Mutual awareness. Another outstanding charecteristic was the light they emmitted. It was intense but had no glare. It was like you were looking through polorized glasses. It is hard to judge size. If I had to guess i would say that they were at least 50 to 100 feet in diameter. They appeared to be about 80% the size of the full moon in the night sky. As they passed 2:00 oclcck they object that formed the bottom tip of the J suddenly changed directions and flew to the west. They all flew out of sight on those same directions.", "Looking out at the night sky I caught out of my peripheral vision a streaking pastel green shooting star.My best friend and myself were walking home from the movie theater back to my house, which was about two blocks away. We always used to cut behind the old Kmart that went out of business to get home, when my buddy says to wait up that he needs to stop and tie his shoe. So we stopped and he went over to the loading ramp and started to tie his shoes and I just stared up at the night sky looking northward I could see the local TV stations antenna tower. Still looking out that way I caught out of my peripheral vision a streaking pastel green shooting star.  But as I focused in I could make out an out line it was football shaped and the object pulsed red, green, and blue (all pastel in color) up and down the length of the object in controlled rhythm. The object was traveling west to east as I yell over to my best friend to look up. We were only able to see it for a few moments as it was traveling at an awesome rate of speed, as it dipped below the trees and house line. We were dumbfounded by what we saw. I went home and immediately drew a picture of what I saw. But that was not the end of my story. I went to school the next day to my electrical trades class and low and behold the was my teacher drawing on the white board the exact object I had seen the night before.  But not only was there the same drawing I had but in a story board fashion there were other drawings of it hovering with the same pulsing red, blue and green pastel lights, but another one next to it that included a star shaped little ball. I showed my teacher my picture and we talked about what each of us had seen.  He saw everything I saw but from his house he could see the object level off hover for a bit, then spit out the object that looked like a floating star.  He then went on to say the floating ball moved around the other object then he said it kinda exploded into about 20 to 30 tiny objects that speed off into as many directions.  Then the main original object sped off at an even faster speed straight up into the night&apos;s sky. I still have the picture I drew that night and that night is as fresh in my mind now as it was happening so many years ago. I will never forget the pulsating pastel red, green, and blue football shaped object.

Two youngsters were in the back seat, one was seated up front. It was approximately 10:20pm, we were just leaving the recording studio, which is located in the back yard of a private resident.  I pulled my car forward and was about to make a U-turn when I saw a large object moving slowly South, in the sky, just over a large tree.  It had one light on the belly of the craft, which illuminated the bottom.  It appeared to be a light gray metallic color.  The shape of the craft appeared to be triangular, however, we could not see the top.  It was in close proximity though, because we could clearly see the color, and a metallic reflection from the light. I stopped the car and pointed out this low flying craft to my students.  We all thought it was a military vessel because of how big it was, and, we were about fifteen miles away from McClullan Air Force Base. However, one of my students commented on how slowly it was moving.  It appeared as though it was just hovering, because it moved so slowly.  I shut off the motor of my car and rolled down my window.  This is when my students became agitated.  There was no sound whatsoever.  Then the craft went beneath the tree line quite suddenly. My students became very nervous and asked me to re-start the car and begin our trip home.  The car started fine.  We all continued to gaze at the large tree as I cirlcled the car in the opposite direction.  It was when I stopped gazing, and put my eyes back on the road that I heard my students cry out, for the craft had re-appeared and was moving much faster now.  I stopped the car to watch.  It was indeed moving faster, and in the same direction. One of the kids started to cry, and become almost hysterical, yelling out  &quot;Go, Go!&quot;.  I turned my eyes back to the raod and hit the trottle.  All three cried out again, almost shrieking, because the craft had shot straight up in the sky and disappeared.  I did not see this however, but by the pale faces of the kids, and the tears welling up in one child&apos;s eyes, I didn&apos;t doubt for a moment what had happened. The kids begged me to drive faster to get home, all the while, keeping a fixed eye out the back window. I am not an expert, nor amateur in military or commercial craft, and neither are the kids.  It could have very well been something that could have been identified.  But, for a craft to suddenly move straight up and disappear seems brow raising. What is also interesting, is that the kids have not spoken a word of this to any of their friends.  I asked why, they stated that it scares them too much to talk about it.  Well, I suppose you can blame that on too much tv and movie influence, I just don&apos;t know. All I do know, is what we all saw that night, and how frightened the kids were...yes, I was a bit nervous myself.  I know the kids and I won&apos;t forget this experience either. I personally would like to know what it was.  If this sounds like a common craft, I would like to be told what it is, so I can tell the kids.", "A silver sphere zooming in circles and then disappearingI was standing outside the parking lot of my neighborhood pool and saw birds in the sky acting weird.  Then when I looked closely enough at about 300 yards away I was a silver sphere. The sphere went straight up out of a cloud went around in circles and then disappeared. I was walking away and looked back up and it started going in circles, went behind a cloud, and came back up only to disappear again!!!

It was dusk, though I was able to clearly make out the craft as it flew overhead. As I looked closer, I noted that the white balls were attached to the bottom of a chevron shaped glider type craft. It made no noise that I could discern. It seemed somewhat low to the ground and was silent. It was not brightly illuminated. We observed it for approximately 25-30 seconds... p.s.

Out to the west I saw what appeared to be a large bird which I assumed at first to be a soaring eagle.  I watched it glide for a few seconds before deciding it must be a guy hang gliding.  It was below the skyline of the mountains.  It was to the west of our home.  What I assumed to be a hang glider because of its shape and proximity to the mountains was earth-toned, brown, beige and white.  However, these colors seem inadequate in describing the colors I saw at first.  As I continued to watch what then appeared to be a hang glider swoop side to side dipping and circling it then began to spin and rise flopping end over end. Then, trying to make sense of what I was seeing, thought it was a large piece of debri being blown around by the wind because its movement was so irratic.  I watched as it rose higher and became smaller,about the size of a large star. It then stopped for maybe 2 seconds.  Then it traveled at a high rate of speed to the west, it stopped and traveled at a high rate of speed to the east.  Its shape had changed to round and white or silver.  I then saw 3 more what now appeared to be orb like spheres or balls the size of large stars darting back and forth in incredible directions and formation.  These objects where perfectly round and appeared to be silver metallic as they reflected or shimmered a little light.  I watched these 4 continue to interact until they were the size of pin heads and then no longer visible.  It was a perfectly calm day with beautiful blue clear skies and no wind.  I was left very excited, awed and wowed.  The total time elapsed from when I first  noticed this object was approzimately 2 minuted maybe longer.  The size of the object was aproximately 1/3 to 1/4 the size of a full moon and became smaller the higher it rose.  I called my wife on her cell phone during my siting so when I get my cell phone bill I will know the exact time and length of my siting.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we believe he is exceptionally credible.

Since the move, I&apos;ve had to make a 45min drive down I85 to get to exit 19B in Anderson S.C. to get to Tri-County Technical College in Pendleton S.C. in the morning. While driving past exit 35 on 85 I noticed an extremely bright object over the tree line. It was like a pinprick of blueish white light. Just by the objects appearance I was able to decern it was not any type of conventional aircraft. If it was a passenger jet really far away, then its lights were way too bright, If it wasn&apos;t very far away then it had no discernable shape and it hovered motionless in the air. From what I saw I think it was pretty far away though. One noticable event that happened was that the light blurred for one moment then returned to its normal brightness. When I say blurred I don&apos;t mean it looked as if it was obscurred or anything like that. It sort of fizzled. The thought immeadiatly came to my mind that it seemed almost pixilated like a distortion on a crappy computer monitor. I was on the interstate so I quickly got to a point where my vision was obscurred by the trees and I lost it completely.", "Cloaking craft, Invisible to the sight but can be see in specific conditionsI have been very interested in the discovery of UFO since I was a child..  Many years ago I had some buddies show me some video tape of this thing they call THE METHOD..  It was a way to catch UFO on video or on film..  If you recall, When there is a eclips of the sun.. THere are many reports of sighting especially in souther America.. This was the principle of my friends way of spotting UFOs in the sky..  You stand in the shadow of a roof or building not looking derectly at the sun but around the corona of it.   You will obiviously see insects flying by but if you focus your eyes way up.. at about the hight of a commercial jet, there are things you can only see when they are lit up by a reflection of the sun..  I have been a witness to this many times..  Seeing pear necklace shaped objectes, chess piece objects and sphere shaped objects..  One time I saw this object that look as if it was spining. After it was way past the brightness of the sun I tracked it moving across the San Fernando Valley.  it was the same color of the sky, and if i didnt spot its reflection, ther would be no way of seeing it with the naked eye..  I have shared this method with many friends..  I am not the originator of this principle, and do not want to be sued by who ever discovered it..  So, the other night I was on the balcony of my apartment building..  It was late at night, about midnight..  There was a marine layer coming it from the south, and a fog of some sort coming from the north..  The night sky was not that clear above but getting overcast..  You could see some stars above but not much on either side of the sky.. I was only out there a min when I saw what seemed like when you see a grocery bag in the sky when there is a wind kicking up, but it was not windy..  It was the same color of the cloudy sky on both sides of the sky.. It made no sound..  And it traveled from east to west across the sky..  Very low.  Aout 500 feet I would say..  I thought it might be a balloon from a car dealership around here, but it was no! t perfec tly round like a balloon..  I cannot say how big it was,  Maybe the size of a small car.. or as large as a 747 jet..  It was spinning and seemed to cloak itself with it seroudings..  I was only able to see it when it when though the clear area of the sky, and I was able to track it, but then it stopped..  I got very scared and went inside..  After that I herd a helecopter go by in the same derection..  Has there been any new sevalance craft that the US, or and other countries might be looking at us??  I would think, or has this been something of a UFO origen??  I do not do drugs or drink..  I am very interested in finding more info about this type of craft, that can acually cloak itself with its surrondings..

When I turned to look up, it was not the smoke from my cigarette.  Right above tree top level, hovering directly across the street was a triangle shaped UFO .  I live in front of a subdivision and the triangle was at the entrance to the subdivision.  It did have smoke around it some and it started make a very loud noise like it was in trouble.  It hovered there quite some time.  I walked out into the yard and stood by my fence.  I could see directly underneath it then.  It had 4 lights that seemed to be in each corner of the triangle.  I know that sounds strange but standing underneath it, the triangle seemed to have four corners.  Like it was triangular on top and square underneath.

Please take the time to read it completely. It&apos;s honest and true. Almost 16 years ago (11/20/1985) while on route to a Professional Photography Seminar in Indiana, another Professional Photographer and I witnessed something that I still can&apos;t explain to this day. Let me go into detail. We were traveling south on Interstate 43 at approximately 4:15 a.m. near Cedar Grove, Wisconsin (approximately 39 miles north of Milwaukee). I remember making a comment about how black and crystal clear the sky is. I am an amateur astronomer and you tend to notice details about the sky such as (where the moon is, sunrise time, constellations, meteors, etc.). My partner, who was driving, let out a yell (and a few choice words) and told me to look at that thing. I said what thing? He told me to look east toward Lake Michigan. I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes. We both saw a greenish glowing orb east toward Lake Michigan. We pulled over quickly on the gravel shoulder of I-43. I looked at my watch and it was now 4:18 a.m. We both got out of the car and just stared at the object. The orb or whatever it was, appeared east from our location at an angle of approximately 45 degrees off the eastern horizon. It was impossible to judge distance given that we had nothing to reference it to (the area is extremely dark with few lights.) We were approx. 2 miles west of Lake Michigan. The size of the object was difficult to ascertain given the lack of reference. I, however, did a simple comparison that gave me some sort of repeatable ratio to the object. I held my arm straight out fully extended toward the object and made a tight fist to reference the size of my fist to the object. The object was almost the same size as my closed fist at arm&apos;s length. The time that the object remained at this size was about four minutes. During this period of time, the orb didn&apos;t seem to move or change in brightness or color. It remained clearly round and had a definite diffused greenish glow to it. After this period of time (approximately 4 minutes), the object did a strange thing. The object began to i! ncrease rapidly in size I did my extended arm test again and this time the object was about the size of an open hand with the fingers fully extended. (At this time, I think we both felt a sense of fear at what we were seeing.) I can only estimate that the object stayed at this size for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. After this time period (approximately 8 minutes from first seeing the object), the object began to decrease in size and became as before, about the size of a closed fist at arm&apos;s length. At about this time, my partner grabbed his camera, and fired off a few frames of film. (Unfortunately, he had only daylight portrait film loaded) Because of the low ISO rating, the film was not sensitive enough to record low light without a tripod and long exposure. The next thing that happened was even stranger. While we both observed the object, it seemed to expand outwardly and de-materialize right in front of our eyes. We both observed the object a total of about (10 Minutes) including the time when we saw it de-materialize. The time according to my watch was now 4:30 AM. I know how crazy this probably sounds to you, but as God as my witness, this event is true. We had to be in Indiana at a Professional Seminar by 8:30 AM so we had to continue on our journey. The following day after the sighting, I called The Center For UFO Studies in Chicago. I have to admit I felt awkward and a bit uneasy calling in about a subject such as this. The man who talked to me was pleasant and asked a lot of questions (such as directions, time, location, clouds, etc.). I answered carefully and honestly as best I could. When I had finished describing what we had seen, he told me that the Center For UFO Studies &quot;had received three separate reports from three commercial airline pilots who had apparently seen something east of my location at approximately the same time and date.&quot;   He; however, wouldn&apos;t go into detail. I don&apos;t use drugs; never have, and never will. I only have an occasional alcoholic beverage. I have a clean record and have never been in trouble with the law. I have never had any mental problems. What I have said is 100% true and honest. Before this sighting, I would have laughed at people who claim to see UFO&apos;s. I no longer laugh at this subject. Many rational people have observed unexplainable things in our skies. I, frankly, don&apos;t know what we saw that early morning almost 16 years ago. I do know it was not a normal occurrence or imagination. One important thing we did the next day was to make a tape recording with all the information and details still fresh in our minds. I also made several duplicate tapes and have distributed them. I know this sounds paranoid; however, at the time we took this event very seriously.

Then each light spread away from the others, weaving in and out from each other in highly coordinated maneuvering, each moving at the same speed but from different directions.  In this last configuration, the 12 lights were all zipping around a contained oval diameter, but the startling aspect to the movements was the highly coordinated maneuvering between the objects.  The entire system slowly moved north and perhaps upward until it was too far away to see. Witness #2 (this writer) saw the formation only at this latter stage, when the 12 burnt-amber lights were simultaneously zipping around the ovoid shape but each one coming from a different direction and going to a different location about this black ovoid shape.  All 12 lights stopped momentarily before again zipping around in different directions and not in sequence, but all around this black shape. This was done repeatedly for about two minutes.  The movements were fast, including very fast but rounded turns -- no zig-zagging. Mike Castrada, chief of the Public Affairs Office at Nellis Air Force Base, told me he has no report of this, which he would not have if it were classified, but he &quot;wishes he were there&quot; and that if Project Blue Book were still open, this report would probably be a case they would put into it. Castrada said that it appears we were looking at the Western part of the Nellis Test Range. Castrada said that &quot;various FAA and Air Force radars control all that air space -- about 12,000 square miles -- from 3000 ft. about the North Las Vegas Airport to infinity, and all the way to the Utah border.&quot; Castrada said that Special Forces was there on an exercise but only from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.  He said that if they were flying at night, they wouldn&apos;t have their lights on because that would defeat the purpose.  He said Special Forces might have had perhaps four but not 10 to 12 planes. Witness #3 viewed the object thhe same length of time as Witness #1 but has not yet been interviewed in detail.", "4 spheres apeared from nowhere and left at high speed.four bright obgects moving at high speeds and comming to a sudden stop. appeared to be following a lead craft which appeared pulsating blue. circling over a housing estate in Bury lancashire. over the dickybird estate.Then eccselerated to the north at a unbelivable high speed about 5 mins later, hellicopters appered with search lights but they had gone.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report is anonymous.

I noticed a red glow out of my passenger window.  We were a little bit out of Cloudcroft, NM and it was about 11:00 pm.  There was a red glow that appeared to coming from behind a mountain and covered a good portion of the sky.  I kind of looked like there was a big forest fire.  We pulled over once then drove a little more to get a better view and pulled over again.  The red was more intense in one area and seemed to lighten out, the further it went out to the edges.  There were also white beams of light the shot very high into the sky, almost to the point where they were over my head.  They beams were not extremely bright but stretched a ways into the sky.  There was also a time where there was 3 or 4 beams and then to the right of these, a could more appeared.  They just started appearing in succession from left to right. Every once in a while they would fade away they in a while they would come back again.  They never moved across the sky though, they would appear in different places but they were always stationary.  Another weird thing was that when their were about 4 or so in a row, they were all space the same distane apart.  Then after a little while, the red was gone but the beams of light were still there.  There were two other cars pulled over at the same spot that we were but I didn&apos;t talk to them so I don&apos;t know if they were looking at the light or not.  But we couldn&apos;t have been the only ones to see this, it was hard to miss if you just looked in that direction at the sky.  There are nothing but a few very small towns in that area, and I have never seen any type of spot light that can make a beam of light like the ones that we saw  It is the wierdest thing that I have ever seen.  I regret that we had no video camera or anything with us.  Well, I guess that is it, it happened about 4 hours ago, and I had to document it somewhere.((NUFORC Note:  Many reports of this phenomenon from Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Arizona, and Texas.

(http://www.((URL deleted)).com) They appeared from an estimated aerial distance of not more than 3 kilometers across my bedroom window. From a distance, it could be ignored and thought of as the sunlight bouncing-off from a huge mirror. The glare has intermittently defeated my focus on the subject, and certain exposure adjustments were necessary. The degree of physiological damage it left me is very minor though - like swollen gums and slight fatigue. I shall feature more pictures  in the coming days.  In the meantime, we may consider this apparition as a heavenly sign to ponder on, this Holy Week.  Whatever that is, only your heart and soul would know.((NUFORC Note:  We received image, but although it is bright, in our opinion, it is ambiguous.

It didn&apos;t simply wink off, nor did it seem to fly away, it just seemed to shut off as one would see when quickly turning off a light using a dimmer switch.

I thought that I would open the small upstairs bathroom window which faces West and see if I could spot what was going on. I stuck my head out the window for about 3 minutes or so, looked around, and then I suddenly saw one fairly large orange light which was illuminated for about 2 seconds, then went out. Imediately after that, a second one appeared closely to the left of it (from my view) and repeated the same thing. You could still see a dim halo of the first one, so it seemed as though the lights were paired together. The object/s were dead silent and completely stationary in the sky. I would have estimated that they were 5-10 miles away.  I yelled to my wife and son so they could hopefully witness this. We watched out the window for another 10 minutes or so and didn&apos;t see a thing. My son became quite frightened because he knew I was not kidding. The jets seemed to be continually cirlcling around overhead while this was happening, almost as if they too were trying to identify the objects. For about another half hour we could still hear the jets, so I thought I would look again. This time I chose to open and look out my son&apos;s bedroom window which also faces west. Now it is about 10:35, and this time a total of four large orange lights had flashed and went out in about a 3-4 second duration. I yelled for my wife and son once again, and only my wife was able to witness a second sequence of flashing orange lights. This time it appeared to be two pairs of lights equally spaced between one another. We were all quite excited about this and contemplated notifying the local police to see if anyone else had witnessed this. Shortly after the second sighting, the sounds of the jets suspiciously went away. Hopefully someone else out there witnessed this and can file their report. It shure was strange but fantastic.", "Boomerang UFO sits on barnThis report was made by ISUR.  I would like to add additional info. that was not listed.  When first seeing the moving lights(several in the trees next to barn about 100ft away from me) I thought it was helicopters, but there was no sound. After opening the gate, I looked up the balls of light morphasized into a boomerang shaped craft and was sitting on top of my barn with wings overlapping both sides of the barn(150 ft wide)and just 15 ft above my head.  It was of unusual texture, almost like a shark, did not reflect light and was boomerang in shape. I was not afraid at all. The really strange part of the story was after opening the gate for my husband to drive in.(He always waits for me to close gate and get back in the car)This time he drove right passed me and did not stop. Somehow I got to the entrance of the barn before he did and was there when he got out of the car.(I can not get this point off of my mind and I wonder if we were abducted) There did seem to be some time lapse of 30 to 45 minutes.   We both watched the UFO disappear over the barn. It seemed to go invisable and we could see stars through it. Over a year later we were informed by ISUR that a neighbor(in his seventies) had seen so many lights over and around our barn that he had bought a Video Camero in hopes of video taping the lights.  This makes over 5 people other that my husband and myself that had seen ufo type objects over our farm. The following is the case study by ISUR At approx. 11:30 pm on a weekday evening during the first week of March 1997 (*there is some uncertainty as to the exact day), Mr. and Mrs. Doe (pseudonyms) were returning to their home, located east of the city of Canton, in unincorporated Cherokee County GA. The Does run a horse farm, utilizing a large industrial-type building (which they call a&quot;barn&quot;) located some 200-300 feet off the highway. As they got up to the fence gate at the end of the driveway, Mrs. Doe noticed a large, lighted object up above and to the right, above some very tall pine trees. From the car, both witnesses then observed the object begin to descend, moving toward a position above their barn, in a series of jerky, stop-and-go motions. Mrs.Doe got out of the car to open the gate, and both continued to observe the object while Mr. Doe pulled the car forward to the front of the barn. The witnesses state that the object was hovering only a slight distance (perhaps 10-20 feet) above the barn. Meanwhile, Mrs. Doe walked forward to a point at the corner of the building, where she could clearly see the object directly above her. About the time Mr. Doe got out of the car, the object vanished. The two are not sure whether the disappearance was by &quot;blinking off like a lightbulb&quot; (Mr. Doe&apos; impression), or by near-instantaneous acceleration and flying away (Mrs. Doe&apos;s impression). Total time of the sighting was estimated, with difficulty, as 3-5 minutes. The object was described as triangular or boomerang-shaped, and very dark, &quot;darker than shadow,&quot; &quot;darker than black.&quot; There was one &quot;dull red&quot; light at each (side) end of the object, while the other corner was unlit. It appeared to be as wide as the building (approximately 120 feet). Mr. Doe said that the area between the &quot;arms&quot; of the &quot;V&quot; was difficult to see and may have been either solid (making it a triangle) or not really filled in (making it more like a boomerang shape). Finally, even though the farm houses about 50 horses as well as geese, cats and dogs, both witnesses noted a total, complete silence throughout the event, a silence the witnesses felt was very strange. Mrs. Doe states that she was not going to report the sighting until a property developer working on a nearby parcel of land came to her home, introduced himself, and said that some men working for him had seen a football-field-sized object above the Doe&apos;s property. After the encounter described here, Mrs. Doe then found ISUR&apos;s website. An onsite interview and walk-through was conducted by ISUR investigator  and myself on 6/12/97. The two witness&apos; accounts matched up well, although not perfectly, which does not support the idea of a preplanned deception. Mr. Doe could not verify his wife&apos;s first impression of a more-lighted object when she initially saw it, although he says that from the drivers&apos; seat he was not in position to see it well. Driving onto the driveway at a later time, I judged that this makes sense; and also, I noted that the driveway lacks enough angle to put a car&apos;s headlights up enough to have struck an object hovering above the barn, so there is no logical discrepancy there. Mr. Doe is an amateur astronomer and states that he is very familiar with the night sky, and had recently spent considerable time viewing comet Hale-Bopp.((NUFORC Note:  &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Doe&quot; appear to be pseudonyms.  PD", "very low slow flying, very strange sounding craft near DCBurtonsville is located between Baltimore and Washington DC about 3 miles west of 95. At approximately 1:15 am we noticed a very low and slow flying object approaching from the south.  It sounded very strange emitting an low electric humming sound changing in pitch.  As is approached the sound increased in intensity but was then also accompanied by a jet engine sound. Not a jet engine in flight, but a jet engine idling. As the first approached we noticed a second craft in the distance coming from the same direction.  The first craft passed almost directly overhead and was probably less then 500 feet off the ground and flying slower then 100 mph, probably slower! Slower then any aircraft i&apos;ve ever seen.  I&apos;ve lived near an airport all my life so i know what planes and helicopters look like.  This didn&apos;t fit either description.  I saw 4 or 5 whitesh yellowish lights. Some of the lights appeared to be spinning to me,  but my friend could not recall them spinning.  The lights looked like standard aircraft lights, but the position of these lights on the craft looked strange. I could not make out the shape of the craft.  Though the most noticable thing about it was the strange noise it was making and it seemed to float across the sky rather then fly. After the first craft flew overhead, a second followed about 30 to 45 seconds behind. On this craft we could only see 1 light of the same white yellowish color.  It too was flying very slow and directly overhead in the same direction.  Though i don&apos;t think it was making the same strange hum the first object was.  It sounded like a jet but was flying way too slow.  And it did not sound like a helicopter. No strange electric or magnetic effects were objerved.  My guess is its probably ours, a craft which still uses conventional jet engines while also having some anti-gravitic technology integrated in. Could this account for the jet-engine sound and the strange loud humming noise?", "Clear view of a &quot;flying saucer&quot;.On the night in question, I was on the back deck of my house testing a new telescope mirror on the nearly full moon. I noticed a bright yellow light about a third the size of the moon travelling west to east (overhead) and apparently decending at a steep angle. The color was exactly that of a yellow traffic light, i.e. sodium yellow. There were four red lights, like navigation lights, around the rim; one on the forward side, one at the trailing side and one on the left and right. They were flashing on and off in a clockwise sequence as seen from below. As it decended toward the east it grew larger and disapeared over the roof of my house. I ran through the house, grabbing 7x50 binoculars as I went. Out on the front porch, I steadied the binoculars on the porch railing and looked at the craft, now at tree-top height and no more than a quarter of a mile away. My view-angle was no more than 5 degrees upward. The yellow light was clearly emenating from the bottom of the craft, which was flat and a bit inset. The craft was well-lit by the nearly full moon in very clear weather and appeared smooth and metallic, like new magnesium or aluminum but not polished. No seams or fasteners were visible. The over-all shape was that of a saucer with a dome on top. Over-all diameter appeared to be between 10 and 15 meters, with the dome taking up a third of that. the dome was flat on top and radiused smoothly into the sides, which were flat in cross-section, and had four keystone-shaped windows that I could see from my viewing angle. The sides of the top dome were smoothly radiused into the body of the craft, which curved continuously downward, and rapidly decreased in radius at the edge, curving under to the bottom. There was no haziness at all, and appeared as solid and real as a Cessna 172 flying along. Speed was maybe 50 kph. The interior appeared lit like an office at night, white and bright. No persons were visible, but a white column was in the center of the interior and took up perhaps a quarter to a third of the diameter of the dome, extending (apparently) floor-to-ceiling, and this could have blocked my view of someone on the forward side of the dome. Or it could have been flying on autopilot. Anyone with the technology to build one of these things would be capable of building an autonomous autopilot.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Then verified by &quot;C&quot; &amp; &quot;B&quot; well above sloped rooftops of houses next street south, moving horizontally just above power lines. The lack of visible wings and lack of any vapor trail behind object was most notible; one observor speculated it may be a rocket of some sort, but no exhaust was seen and no sounds were heard. The object passed behind broad Vapor trails created by passenger aircraft moving in opposite direction. As we talked and walked westward toward my garage, it became easier to lose sight of object as it slowly receeded into the southwestern sky into haze and partial overcast.  No wings or rudder structures or emanations noted by any of us. It moved much faster than the occasional Goodyear Blimp often seen in this area, and any lighter than air craft we&apos;ve seen is shaped like fat cigar, with markings or running lights which this shiny object never displayed. We are hoping to see a report on this sighting on the 11 pm news, but still skeptical.  It was suggested this object could be a large satellite in orbit, but even the ISS should not appear so large from this latitude.", "Just a lightI went out onto my back porch to smoke a cigarette after SportsCenter, I was just looking to the NW when a light started to appear like a flashlight having a cover of some type being pulled up from in front of it, the bottom? of the light appeared first. It got about as bright as a streetlight, and at first I though that was what it was.  It was to low and silent to be an aircraft. As I kept watching it it seemed to sort of slowly and almost imperceptibly bob, for a couple moments I was wondering if it was me rather than the light that was moving, then it moved to my left behind some trees and I lost sight of it. It was just the one light, like a streetlight no craft that I saw. I am a college student and fulltime cook and have never seen anything tnat I would call a UFO before.", "Multi-colerd well defined beam or flashMy fiancee and I were sitting in our 1 story apartment in Augusta GA when the following occured. We were in our living room with the tv on and a light on, the room was bright. We had covered our window months ago with a thick black-out curtain because we wanted the room dark because we both had a habit of sleeping in our recliners and liked it dark in the morning so we could stay asleep. This curtain was closed when, while we watched tv, we both turned to the left toward the window at the same time and saw an intense flash of light that seemed to be white/yellow and then turned blue. This light did not illuminate the room but was defined with clear edges on the curtain. Imagine someone cutting on a 500000 candlepower ligt and pressing it firmly to the window. This all happened in an instant and we turned to each other and said &quot;did you see that?&quot; Something had made us turn toward the window at the same time. WEIRD My theory is that some et was&quot;reading&quot;us with the flash. Who knows.", "My girlfriend and I were on our way to her gradnmother&apos;s house and I saw something in the corner of my eye. So we stoped to get a better look. The object  was moving extremly slooooow over a building about 1 mile away. At first we thought it was a plane or helicopter, then we realized that if it were either one, we would of heard the sound of the engine or the spinning of the copter blades. Another thing that we noticed was the size of this thing. It was &quot;HUGE&quot;. because at that distance, it covered the roof tops of a few buildings. The best estimate we can give, is that it was probably the lenght of two football feilds, but we may be a little off. Anyway after 6 minutes or so, we heard a loud sound approchaing from behind us, when we looked up there were four airforce or army jets heading the the direction of the craft. When the jets got closer to the craft, it moved away slowly and faded out of site and It was a pretty clear night. no clouds in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  We don&apos;t know what it was the witnesses observed, but we would want to rule out a blimp as the first step in any investigation.

The first shows a contrail, but we have no way of knowing whether it was generated by the &quot;Aurora&quot; aircraft.  It may be nothing more than a normal contrail that has taken on a &quot;buttermilk&quot; appearance, which often happens in a slightly turbulent atmosphere.  Also, the second photo does appear to show two amorphous &quot;blobs,&quot; that appear to be somewhat triangular in shape.  Our computer monitor does not allow us to identify them, however.  We doubt that an Aurora aircraft would fly in formation with another, although that is a guess.  Also, if they were flying as low as the photo suggests they would be, they would be very loud to anyone on the ground, and they would be difficult to miss.  Our assumptions are predicated on the larger assumption that the &quot;Auora&quot; aircraft actually exists.

Between 10 and 10:30 p.m., I stepped outside of our tipi and approached a friend of my father&apos;s to chat.  Suddenly, I spotted off toward the east a large blue light that hovered still for a few minutes not moving.  Before I knew what had happened, I saw it drop like a stone to the earth in a straight downward motion.  There was no accompanying sound.

I watched it for several minutes and the light dimmed and continued for several seconds and then the light was completely gone.  It was just to the north of being overhead of me and there was no cloud cover at all.  The only explanation I can think of is if maybe S.A.C. in Omaha was flying a Stealh bomber or fighter.

Vaguely aware that the rumbling noise was louder and vibrating the house.  My wife was helping our youngest son with his homework.  They were on the 2nd floor.  My wife called me on the phone and said I should come up and figure out what was making noise. By the time I came up stairs the noise suddenly stopped.  My 15 yr old daughter came out of her bedroom where she had just turned out the lights to go to bed.  The noise was so loud that she thought she would look our her window.  She said Holy S**t I think I just saw a meteor.  She described a light as big as a basket ball twice the heighth of trees flash accross the sky.  As soon as she saw the light the noice stopped abruptly. My wife&apos;s ears were hurting because of the loud noise.  She had the sensation that it was passing slowly over our house from a SW to NE direction. The next day I talked to several neighbors who all reported hearing the loud sound. One of our neighbors looked out the door and didn&apos;t see anything but said the sound was deafening and frightened her shaking the whole house.  Another neighbor said she went all the way out to her drive way and looked up in the sky (clear night) and saw no lights but couldn&apos;t figure out what was making such a loud noise (like a squadron of jumbo jets.)  Two weeks later I talked to a friend about the noise and him and his wife said they heard something just like I described on that same night.  My friend lives about 5 miles SW of where I live.

When it was 9:00pm, I turned to the nightly WGN Chicago news program (courtesy of a cable channel; I&apos;m in TN). I had decided to watch it because I wanted to see if they were going to follow up on a report they&apos;d had the night before. Some minutes into the news cast, they began to do the weather. Before I go any further, there&apos;s something I need to explain so you can understand what I&apos;m talking about. I have a lot of time on my hands, I guess you could say, and for about the last year or so I&apos;ve been taping (with a VCR) those shots I suppose most news casts have where during the weather the screen switches to some live view of the city. I&apos;ve been doing this all this time in hopes of catching something strange on tape. And Wednesday night, after a year or so of waiting, it finally paid off! So, when that sort of shot came on, I was taping it. And within seconds, I was shocked to see what I&apos;d been waiting for all this time: a bright streak of light shot across the upper middle part of the screen and went BEHIND some buildings in the background, going INCREDIBLY fast. MUCH MUCH MUCH faster than ANY jet could go! So fast that I was only able to get a good look at it when moments later I went downstairs and used the other VCR to slow the tape down to a minimum. When it wasn&apos;t on slow motion, this is what it looked like: almost identical in appearance to a common shooting star, kind of streak-ish, but it was very different in that ITS DIRECTION MADE A HUGE CURVE!!! I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes. It (or another one) would also appear again a few seconds later, this time shooting up from the lower right hand corner of the screen and zooming just as quickly to the upper left! (AGAIN, THIS/THESE WAS NOT A SHOOTING STAR!!!) Upon playing it like I said in slow motion, it was also noticed that a third streak could easily be seen (you couldn&apos;t miss it!) coming into the picture just as the camera finally went back to the newscasters. Needless to say, I HAVE THE TAPE and I&apos;ll always keep it. I don&apos;t remember the exact time, but it was around 9:20pm CST. The streaks were a bright yellowish-white in color.

Three or four times as fast as a jet plane and at an altitude (guessing) of maybe 20 to 25,000 ft., it was going south.  Then at that speed, it made a 180 degree turn within 3 seconds, still leaving a trail.  Then about 5 seconds after it turned it disappeared.  I kept looking for about a minute or so and saw the object again, (no trail) going west then east then west again, all in a span of ten or fifteen seconds, then disappered.", "Three globular lights in a tight triangular formation passed east to west at low altitudeAn old report for the record.  This sighting took place a long time ago, but I remember it very clearly.  I&amp;#8217;m estimating the date by the age I believe I was at the time (16) and by the month we always vacationed.  Weekapaug is a small town on the south shore of Rhode Island.  There are a series of large tidal ponds along this shore that are connected to the ocean by channels about 100&apos; wide.  The Weekapaug channel has stone jetties on either side that stick out about 100&apos; from the beach.   On this night I was sitting on the tip of the eastern wall at about 10:30pm looking at stars.  The sky was clear overhead, but there was a heavy mist over the water to an altitude of about 30&apos;.  As I sat there facing the sea, and due south, I noticed three dim, translucent, globular lights move by from east to west in a tight triangle formation.  The light was a pale white.  I&apos;d estimate the speed at 50mph, the altitude at 75 to 100 feet above the water and the distance from me between 100 and 200 yards.  I watched them from about 160 degrees to about 225 degrees at which point they faded in the mist. My first thought was that they were the lights from a car&apos;s headlights hitting thicker fog out over the water, but the following observations seen to conflict with that theory. 1) The lights were well defined.  Each one looked like a frosted globe light you might see in front of someone&apos;s house, only a little more translucent and defused.  I don&apos;t know whether the lights were that way by nature or if the mist was defusing the light.  2) There were three lights that held the exact pattern, which was one light in the lead with the other two trailing at an equal distance.  3) The lights maintained a straight course and steady speed.  If they were the projection of car lights, the car would have to be making a tight turn to move the beams left to right so fast.  In such a scenario, you would expect the lights to either swing in an arc around the source, or, if they were shining on the straight edge of a fog bank just offshore, to diffuse and move away faster as the source beams swung to an orientation more parallel to the surface they were shining on.  These lights maintained a distinct shape and straight course, a very steady speed and perspective that changed in what seemed an appropriate way for an object traveling in a straight line.  In other words, as the object moved away, the two rear lights became more face-on to me than they were when it was straight out.  4) The closest a car could have been was about 200 yards behind me and the beams would have had to come right over me.  I looked around very quickly, but saw no car, nor did I see any sign of beams passing by.  Afterwards, I tried to identify a spot where a car could have made such a turn while maintaining line-of-sight with the full range in which I saw these lights and I couldn&apos;t ID such a spot. The lights struck me as a source themselves and not a reflection, and although the lights were diffused I had the distinct impression they were 3-dimensional.  I&apos;ve thought about whether they might have been from a boat passing by, but there was no sound with these lights and it was a quiet night.  Several of the points above seem to conflict with this theory as well, not to mention the speed.  They definitely were not the promotional spots that you often see in the night sky.  If they were something other than projections, they could have been three independent lights in a tight formation, or part of one craft.  I&apos;d estimate the apparent size of each of them at about the size of a thumbnail at arms length.  I would not go so far as to say these lights were extraterrestrial, but for me they were certainly UFO&apos;s in the sense that I have been unable to associate them with a rational explanation despite years of trying. Also, knew a guy who was swimming on Weekapaug&apos;s Inn Beach late one afternoon in the summer of 1978 and swears he saw a &quot;flying saucer&quot; come in off the water, fly straight overhead at a relatively low altitude and proceed inland.  That&apos;s all I know of that sighting. I was 16 at the time of my sighting and was not on drugs or drinking.  I was into astronomy at the time and enjoyed stargazing, hence my reason for being out on the dark tip of the jetty at night away from distracting lights.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The object which was viewd from underneath, was described as a large solidly outlined diamond shaped object which made a humming sound as it passed over. At each corner, there was a dim white non-blinking light. In the bottom center of the object, was a flat red non-blinking light.

It was ovalish and one end was slightly tilted up.  The thing had a metalic, band through the middle with atleast 3, round, bright windows that did not seem to orbit the craft.  It was very bright but did not seem to light up and trees around it.  The ball of light was bright yellow, with long rays of light coming off of it, like the Rising Sun in the Japanese flag. The metalic band was silver/white, and was slightly brighter then the yellow.  The windows were even brighter and may have been spot lights, they were yellow also.

They were kind of unusual, in that they were large, opaque forms that looked like the kind in Maxfield Parrish paintings. Our office is on highway 43, which looks out in a North Easterly direction (Mt. Hood is East of where we are). I looked at the very dark cloud behind the shopping center across the street, and noticed what looked like a huge swarm of birds slowly hovering around in a kind of slow, corkscrew pattern. I watched for 30 seconds or so, and called for a couple of office mates to come see the swarm. Two co-workers came out, and I asked them what they thought we were looking at. We sort of decided that we were looking at 100 or so golden spheres. They moved in the way flocks of birds do in relation to each other (though even more so the way embers from a fire slowly waft skyward.) There appeared to be no visible wings, and they made no particular sound, so only nearby traffic could be heard. The orbs sort of drifted, corkscrew-like, up and down the column-like concentration of orbs that hovered around the &quot;center&quot; of the group. The sun was very bright, and not blocked, and the rays fully hit the spheres, making it hard to discern what they actually were. The sun made the cloud behind the orbs particularly dark and smokey-looking, and one could not see through it. This event lasted about 10 minutes, until all the orbs had drifted into cloud cover, and as cloud cover moved over them. Since we couldn&apos;t get a photo, I have tried to re-create what I saw in Photoshop. Though I can&apos;t produce the intensity of light coming from the sun (right corner of the picture) nor can I accurately reproduce the cloud formations, this &quot;painting&quot; pretty much re-creates what we saw. The sky was bright blue, and these huge cloud banks were moving rather swiftly across the sky. The dark clouds had that weird greenish-grey tinge that they get when a tornado is coming (or threatening.) Everything was very brightly lit, as on a cloudless summer day. It was hard to tell exactly how many spheres we were looking at, since it was bright, and all the orbs were drifting around each other. I don&apos;t know if this was reported in the media, or even if anyone else saw this grouping. I would love to know if someone else so the orbs actually doing something, or know where they went next.((NUFORC Note:  An illustration was included with the report.  The cluster of small objects, in our opinion, is reminiscent of a swarm of flying insects.  However, how the flight of insects could be mistaken for the flight of a flock of birds is not clear to us.  We may include the illustration here, and the reader can make his/her own decision on the matter.  No other reports from the Portland for this incident.

As we got closer to Marana and allowing for my directional change of roadway we were made aware that it began moving (floating if you will)liesurely to the West and between Marana and the Tucson Mts. just west of I-10. As we approached the exit off I-10 into Marana (Greir Rd) I decided to exit to get a better view. We traveled west for 4 miles and met a dead end, exited our auto and watched it speeding up considerably and entered the distant cloud cover probably some fifty plus miles away.

As I turned rapidly to follow the path visually, it seemed to alter its course approx 10 degrees ( this was not an arc correction but almost a bent angle) My brain could not accept what my eyes had just seen.

As I was getting out of bed to get her something to drink, I heard what seemed like a strong gust of wind banging the shutters against the house very loudly. As I approached the window to see if it had been raining, a light of some sort, so blinding, appeared out of the darkness. The windows then violently thrashed open and I went completely paralyzed. All I could hear was what sounded like a thousand sirens ringing and my wife screaming in the background. All of a sudden I began to levitate. My wife had also been paralyzed and was floating, in midair right next to me. I cant remember what happened from that point on but when I came to, I found me and my wife outside, in the middle of our yard. When I looked over at my wife I could see she wsas screaming but I couldn&apos;t hear anything coming out. All of a sudden there was a complete silence, and let me tell you, I remember to this day that I have never heard a silence as silent as it was at that moment. Next thing we knew we were transported by a beam of light into what seemed like complete darkness. I couldn&apos;t see my wife, I couldn&apos;t feel my body, and I didn&apos;t know wether I was floating or strapped down. But I could feel this pressure, this invsible force, that was compressing my lungs to the point where I couldn&apos;t even breathe another breath. When I tried to scream, nothing came out, I didn&apos;t even know if I was breathing anymore. I began to hear my wife gasping for air and once I could hear her, the pressure got stronger and I tried to take a deep breath but inhaled nothing but some sort of fluid that filled my lungs so much I could feel my skin burning as if it was tearing off my body. It was then I began to hear my wife screaming the most awful, horrifying screams and I could do nothing for her. I began to weep as a sharp pain engulfed my entire body. It almost felt as if someone carved from the bottom of my legs through my spine, and up! my body with a dull knife. I have never felt pain so terrible in all my life. I passed out for what seemed like eternity. As I regained consciousness, I&apos;m sure I saw my wife standing in front of me, and it seemed like she was reaching to embrace me, but when I tried to reach out for her, it felt like I had been thrown back and slammed into a brick wall which turned out to be the ground in my yard. I looked over and saw my wife laying next to me motionless. All the pain was gone and I looked over again to see my wife turning. I got up as if I was never even touched or moved or thrown around. I went over to help my wife up, and as I saw the expression on her face, everything inside of me burst  because I knew that they had taken her from me forever. My wife died that night and to this day everyone believes that she passed in her sleep because the coroner could find no trace of injury and no sign of trauma that could have caused her to die.

It was at night, around 9:30 pm, and I was driving me and my boyfriend to a Bowling Alley in the neighboring town of Wyandotte.There were railroad tracks we had to cross, but a train was on the track, so I waited there in the distance for the train to end. My car was parked perpendicular to the train,normally,the cars would be facing the train, but since I saw it coming before I reached the tracks,I just stopped at the  street corner before the tracks.There was an empty field directly across from me, so I could watch the train go by over my left shoulder. We each commented on how long this train was.Then suddenly we saw 3 bright white lights following the train in the same direction as it was heading.We thought they were helicopters,but quick movements and darting about made us suspicion they were something else.It was as if these &quot;lights&quot; were playing a game of chicken with the train. We watched in awe when just as suddenly, 2 of the lights sharply turned upwards at a right angle and disappeared in a matter of seconds.Then only one light was left, which continued to follow above the train, turn, then loop back and forth.This last &quot;light&quot; was flying much lower now, and we could see that it was not a helicopter.Imagine our shock, when this &quot;light&quot; seemed to discover my car, all alone, waiting by the roadside.It stopped following the train, and promptly flew over to the field which my car was facing.It was hovering so low, we were able to get a perfect look at the &quot;light&quot;, which wasn&apos;t just a light, but a triangular shaped craft,dull silver in color.It sat in the air silently as we stared in amazement. None of the weeds in the field even moved.It was silent and almost perfectly flat.We were frantically searching for an engine, a cockpit window, or anything that would make sense and make it recognizable, but nothing could be found.Whatever was piloting this craft could not be seen.In front, which was facing us, was the bright white light we had seen chasing the train.On the other 2 points of the triangle,there were red lights,as if tailights on a car.This is where my sighting gets unusual.My boyfriend suggested I flash my headlights at this craft.Being directly across from me and approximately", "I was in the presence of an &quot;aluminum&quot; looking triangle &quot;aircraft&quot; that was very loud, moved very smoothly and ws flying very low .At 7:30 pm on the 4th of July, it was still very light - I was in my back yard and heard a very loud, low &quot;jet aircraft&quot; sound.

I&apos;m driving up to interview him tomorrow and trying to get a copy of tape made by Carteret Lt. of police.From:   ((names and addresses deleted)) Hello: I have to report this since it occurred at approximately 12:45 AM July   15th  2001, over the town of Carteret, New Jersey.  I am an Orthodox Ukrainian priest -- and my son (who is a funeral director was going out on a death call) gets in touch with me via his cell phone at about 12:40 and tells me I need to get dressed quickly and come outside.  He was just getting ready to get on to the New Jersey turnpike when he saw a huge collection of lights numbering about 30 over the town of Carteret, and, specifically over the &quot;Carteret Shoprite Shopping Center.&quot;  I immediately put on a pair of shorts and slippers and went outside.  By this time, my son was standing in front of the rectory (which is aside of the church) and was pointing to the series of lights moving in an easterly direction towards Staten Island.  The Lights were arrayed in a series of triangular forms, but I only counted 13 or 14 lights.  I say 13 or 14 because I was so taken by them that I didn&apos;t want to take my eyes off of them to count them twice.  The entire group of lights was moving from right to left (east) and totally in unison.  As they were moving, a light would &quot;drop&quot; a &quot;new&quot; light from it (less intense than itself) and the &quot;new&quot; light would fade away.  Immediately after that, the light that just &quot;dropped&quot; the new light would also fade out.  This happened about five times as the collection of lights continued to move.  As the entire sequence of lights continued to move behind the buildings to my immediate left, I had to move to our parking lot to see them and as I did, I began to lose sight of the group of lights until there was only one light and then none at all!  This was the strangest phenomenon I have ever seen.  I estimate that the lights were no more than 3-4000 feet above the town.  I am a private pilot, so I have a little idea of height and some sense of distance in the sky.  These lights made absolutely no noise and moved with such precision that they resembled a huge craft, yet I get the sense that they were individual lights and not one large craft.  They definitely were not a meteor shower as a neighbor of mine neither yelled to me nor were they stars moving.  They were a &quot;calculated&quot; series of high intensity lights moving in a specific direction.  At this point, I can only call them UFO&apos;s and that they definitely were.  I only wish I knew what they were doing here?  If anyone else saw them or can explain their purpose, I certainly would be interested in hearing about it.  Thank you.  Rt. Rev.

It bore no resemblance to any aircraft, meteor or satelite that I had ever seen.

I yelled when I saw it and my daughter camr running out, but the object had already disappeared over the horizon,far faster than any helicopter could do it.

I am an 18 year old college student who never saw UFOs before or thought much about them. The sky was blue and there were few clouds at the time. The circle of the sun was completely behind the slant of the roof and only the corona of the sun was visible to me. Around the corona, I saw from 7 to 11 white lights. Some were hovering and about 3 were darting quickly and suddenly in random directions. After a few minutes, they drifted away. They seemed to go behind the roof so I could not see them anymore. I saw them between the roof and trees that were nearby. They were so close to the sun that I suppose I would not have looked up unless the circle of the sun was hidden by the roof and did not hurt my eyes. The lights were a steady white which stood out among the blue of the sky. They reminded me of diamonds (such as a diamond with a silver background) that were sparkling. The lights were not well defined to be a particular shape but I think they were circular. They were unlike anything I&apos;ve seen before. When I heard the next day that other sightings had occurred in New Jersey, I felt I should report what I had seen. These UFOs were in no particular formation and did not blink.((NUFORC Note:  We have not received any other reports from this area of New Jersey for this time period.

Tonight, I had gone over to a friends&apos; house with some other people intending to spend the night just laying around with sleeping bags in her backyard talking and just having a good time. It is an extremely clear night tonight. Very beautiful with all the stars showing. We checked out a couple falling stars until one thing seriously caught our attention. We just saw this dim light flare up suddenly in the sky. We all thought it was a meteorite that seemed to be heading for us and it gave us a quick scare. It dimmed again and we saw it fly slowly away and then suddenly jet off at an intense speed and then stop practically on a dime. It freaked me out the most because last year, on Victoria Day I believe, I had taken my girlfriend on a canoe ride late at night. It was an equally clear night and we sat in the canoe gazing at the stars. We had been drifting for some time when we&apos;d seen a craft in the air jet from one side of the sky to the other at a blinding speed and then stop immediately. We were spooked but ignored it for awhile.Then we realized it was doing it again and once stopped and sort of shimmered back and forth. It was weird. We started to panic a bit but tried not to look at it. Then when we thought it had left my girlfriend told me to look in between two bright stars in the sky. No more than a mile away there seemed to be a cylindar shaped object just stopped dead in the sky. It seemed to be watching us. We heard no noise. We just saw a grayish object dimly lit near the bottom sort of spinning in the sky. It looked like just what you&apos;d see on those UFO specials on TLC. We had not been drinking that night and I am a devout Christian who will swear by these words. It gives me the creeps to think about but it doesn&apos;t terrify me. I think it&apos;s probably just some top secret government experiment. Who knows. Oh, and if you&apos;d like to know my mental capacity. I&apos;m a second year college student. Thank you.", "It was quiet and was blue then red then blue again.I was with 3 of my friends when I saw a blue light moving very very slowly.

I then noticed that it was moving much to slow to be an airplane. I thought maybe a helicopter thats when it flew off. When i say it flew off i don&apos;t just mean that it flew away into the curviture of the night sky ,i mean that it went up and out into space very, very fast,almost instintaniously from its spot low in the sky to the stars. Now i am definately not a expert in aviation but for a plane to pause then almost leap into space and disappear into the darkness of space at that speed is impossible. It went straight up and out.

There were no other lights surrounding the object; there were CLEARLY no standard regulation aircraft beacons, strobes, or wingtip red/green lights, and the object made no discernable sound. If an aircraft, it was certainly not an ordinary one. OBJECT 2: Approx 1 minute after disappearance of object 1, same type amber light appeared in same location and began same northward track. Approximately thirty seconds after appearing, object flashed very brightly white -- looking similar to a very bright set of aircraft landing ligts -- approximately a half dozen times in rapid succession -- then continued on same original course. When object was to our east-northeast, a tiny deep red point of light appeared below the object and proceeded downward to disappear in the treetops below. Some comments were that it looked like someone dropping a flare. OBJECT 3:  After object 2 had &quot;dropped its flare&quot; and was tracking off  to the northeast, another amber light of the same type appeared in the north. It too performed the same flashing of bright white lights. And, it also &quot;dropped flares&quot; -- three times -- before disappearing in the southeast. OBJECT 4: Four to five minutes after the disappearance of object 3, as the crowd was abuzz with discussion of that we had seen, one more amber light -- this one somewhat dimmer that the first three -- appeared in the south-southwest. This one had an additional feature the others had lacked; two  blue-green pinpoint lights which appeared to be circling the amber light. The entire complex slowly tracked westward toward the tree line, while seeming to bounce and weave in an unpredictable manner. The complex eventually disappeared into the trees, then reappeared on other side of trees several minutes later, still bouncing and weaving. This persisted for several more minutes until a muffled &quot;popping&quot; sound was heard, the amber light disappeared, another deep red point light dropped toward the ground, and one of the blue-green point lights rapidly accelerated off to the northwest and disappeared. The remaining blue-green point light remained in the same general location, bouncing and weaving back and forth within the space of a few degrees of arc, for another 90 minutes or so, at which time the reporter departed the scene for the evening. notes: This was reporter&apos;s first ever personal sighting of a UFO.

The spherical light was very bright with a kind of glow or aura around it and not pure white but instead greenish-white. The light was steady with no other flashing lights visible.

They could have been windows but were too far distant to really confirm.  When I looked at them with just my normal eyesight they were very bright in the sky, and with the binnoculars I could distinquish the strands of lights on the side of the object.

Later I wrote Isaac Asimov of this and he replied that &quot;Stars are too far away to show motion I do not know what you saw, but it wasm&apos;t atsrs. Then I wrote David O. Woodbury, author of &quot;The Glass Giant of Palomar&quot; (Dodd, Mead), 1963), and he replied, saying that I  saw Venus.

I glanced up to see a large bright white light moving very fast.  The brightness was much greater than an Iridium flare or the ISS at a very high intrinsic brightness.  The speed of this object was so much greater than any conventional aircraft or orbiting satellite.  I said, &quot;look up! look up!&quot;, and everyone did to see the object continue in a straight line completely over the horizon. The object travelled from NW to ESE, and was visible for about 10 seconds.  When the object was directly overhead near 90 degree azimuth, it changed into a phosphorus-like green color, and amber &quot;sparks&quot; appeared to emit from the object, along with a slight, short-lived vapor trail.  The object maintained its incredible speed and straight direction.  The object never broke apart, no sounds were heard, so subsequent sonic boom.  The object should have been visible over east-central Alabama and west-central Georgia as it continued its course. The eight adults who were present discussed the object for a while.  We decided that if the object were a meteor, then it would have disintegrated to some degree while visible to us.

Behind the crows, passed a &apos;dirty&apos; white light. Light was cigar shaped and appeared to be some distance away [estimate 2-3 miles] at approx 20 degrees above the horizon. Weather was mostly clear with some low morning haze rapidly burning off. Light was first seen to the ESE and traveled noiselessly in a straight line at a constant altitude to the SW. As it traveled, the light seemed to elongate and contract slightly. Sun was at the wrong angle to be causing that much reflection. Light was &apos;dirty&apos; or muted white not shiny as if relected off of metal. Without taking my eyes off the light, I shouted for a co-worker to come to the door. Before she arrived the light emitted [ejected a better word] a second object. Second object looked exactly like a star at night. Compared to the large light it was just a pinpoint of bright light. 2d object left the first to the rear or in the opposite direction from the flight path of large light. Small lights path was initially approx 45 degrees downward but arcing horizontally and flattening out before I lost sight of it in the treetops across the road. 2d objects rate of speed was very much greater than the large light&apos;s speed. Large light did not seem to pause or slow as it ejected 2d light. Co-worker arrived, I pointed out large light and she said &quot;What in the world is that&quot; Light shortly disappeared in the haze to the south southwest without ever changing direction or altitude. Hard to estimate size, speed or distance to light as there were no distinguishing features to judge scale. Guessing 2-3 miles distant at 5-10,000 feet altitude. At that distance, the size of the light would have been approx the same as an commercial passenger jet fuselage but had it been a jet I would have heard it at that distance. Very possible it could have been more distant thus larger, higher and faster. Estimate speed at 1000+ mph but this would be very dependent on actual distance from me to object. Would simply classify speed as &quot;rapid&quot;.

The object was cylinderical in shape and changed to oval as it moved.  We noticed a bright glowing orange/gold color not present in other aircraft in the viscinity at the time.  There were several aircraft in the area at the time, inbound to O&apos;Hare from our west/southwest position, and outbound and heading west from Midway at our east position.  All jet aircraft in the area were a darker silouette, that the vehicle in question ( with landing lights, anti-collision lights and flying a specific pattern.)  The object did not appear to have any wings or tail stabilizer and at once I thought that it looked like the slender silouette of an MD-80.  But all at once it changed shape to oval and stopped!  Right there about 7,500 to 10,000 feet, appearing to watch the commercial traffic!  To add to the mystery, we noticed an eastbound twin-engine aircraft crusing at at least 35,000 feet and for a brief moment, the object blocked our view to to the contrail of the eastbound crusing aircraft.

This is off of Highway 97.  I am a 17 year old male and my friend is an 18 year old male.  We were sitting on the dock of the lake and at about 10:30 PM, I noticed up in the SSE part of the sky a bright flash and a Orange fireball appeared about 1/12 the size of a full moon.  The fireball lasted about 10 seconds while leaving a small trail of orange and a orange haze around it.  My friend noticed it about 5 seconds after I had.  It then changed just in to an extremely bright star looking craft and zigzagged and swerved for about another 30 seconds or so until it disappeared over the horizon.  The craft didn&apos;t seem to have any sort of pattern to its flight path.  It went north and just was flying erratically.  I have seen 2 other sightings in hte past.  Neither where the craft actually entered the atmosphere.  There is no way that this could of been any sort of spacerock.  The object entering the atmosphere was too big and it was moving after it went through the atmosphere.  To my knowledge this could not have been any sorty of human made craft because after going through the atmosphere it wasn&apos;t flying straight.  Also I don&apos;t know why an human made craft would enter our atmosphere, or leave it over Oregon, because there is no aerospace base nearby.", "TWO DISTINCT STARS THE FRONT STAR SHOWN A BEAM FORWARD ACROSS THE SKY.VERY CLEAR OUT PLEASE CONTACT ME ASAP THANK YOU.At approx. 3:53 am, I saw over my head two bright &quot;stars&quot; about 2 inches apart.

The first of the two &quot;stars&quot; was emitting a bright light towards the horizon. It made no noticeable noise. This sighting was made at Barnum Lake, near Thunder Bay, Ontario on Sunday morning, on July 22, 2001.

We were following one piece going from south to north at either 10:45 or 11:45 in a campground a mile or so upstream from the power plant in Huntington Creek canyon in Central Utah. Suddenly, two pieces caught our eyes that looked about a mile or so apart from each other, but were both going the same speed from west to east.They traveled the same speed as the other stuff we see.

Also, instant 90 degree turning ability.There were 2 groupings of 4 orange lights that within each grouping would cross over one another. It appeared to be a cyclic pattern, but once they were closer to being over head, there was the same pattern of movement over and over. It took only 30 seconds or so for the crafts (or whatever) to go from one horizon to the other. As they got further away, and closer to the opposite horizon, they took an immediate 90 degree turn, without slowing and rapidly sped out of viewable sight. My brother and I witnessed this. We could make out no &quot;craft&quot; only the lights. The odd part about this was that they were no more than 300 to 400 yards above us. Another interesting observatyion that my brother brought to light was the fact that there were no clouds in the sky before we noticed these objects. Upon reeling from what we had both just witnessed, we realized that there were now thick clouds on the original horizon, and fog was now moving in . Very wierd. I do not think that this is anything more han coincidence, but thought I would state the fact.

Despite their low altitude, no sound was heard.  They were also moving very fast.  They circled the area before disappearing behind trees.  Their white lights were blinking, each with its own frequency that differed slightly from the other two.  When compared to a plane, these three white lights were reported as being much much brighter and moving much faster.  They were also following a path that was not similar to the usual flight pattern of airplanes in the area.  The observer is usually a UFO skeptic who would rather not dwell on the subject, but he was slightly riled up and excited by this sighting.  He repeatedly made the comment that &quot;that definitely was not an airplane&quot; and also said, &quot;I know that was not a weather balloon.&quot;  It was clear from that reference that he was rethinking his thoughts on UFO&apos;s and aliens.  He also said that he had felt like he was being drawn outside to look for the lights after he lost sight of them.  Having known the observer for many years, I was surprised by his level of intrigue and fascination.  I would say that he might now be a believer, even though he has always been one of the more skeptical people I know.  The observer and I went out the next night at the same time and in the same location, a rural neighborhood, to watch for any strange lights, but none were seen.", "When I was six, my mom and I witnessed a large glowing orb that flew alongside our car.It was the summer of, I believe, 1970; I was six years old. My mother and I were driving home to Lidgerwood, in southeast ND, from Fargo.  We were driving down state highway 46.  I looked out the passenger window into a field and saw a large glowing light, moving silently throught the field, pacing the car.  I asked, &quot;Mom, what&apos;s that?&quot; At such a young age, I was merely curious, completely unafraid.  I had no idea what a UFO was.  When my mother looked over at the field and saw the object, she was visibly frightened, and punched the accelerator of the car.  I remember looking at the speedometer and noticing we were driving 85 m.ph., which confused me.  Seeing my mother frightened began to make me feel a bit scared, too, and I kept looking at this glowing object as it stayed with us, approximately 100 yards into the field.  As I was so young, and all of this is a bit foggy in my memory, I can only give rough estimates.  I would say that the object was perhaps 50-60 feet long, it was difficult to see how wide it was.  It glowed brightly, and made no sound.  After a bit, i seem to have fallen asleep, I really can&apos;t remember how it all ended.  All I know is that we arrived home safely, and whenever I have asked my mother about the incident, she is reluctant to talk about the sighting, usually dismissing it as swamp gas.  As an adult looking back at what I saw, I find it hard to believe that we witnessed swamp gas glwong and pacing our car at 85 m.p.h.  Somebody regress me!!!!

It happened some time between 11:45pm and 12:15am.  A beautiful starry night and myself and 3 others were star gazing with a telescope.  For some reason, the telescope would not focus too well, so mainly we were chatting and looking up at the beautiful stars.  We were all taking particular interest in an especially bright star that we were trying to decide whether or not was Venus. It was in the southern sky. So, just below and to the left of what we thought was Venus, a light appeared, much like that of a star.  Didn&apos;t think too much of it, the sky was full of them after all.  Then, quite suddenly this &quot;star&quot; burst a brilliant bright &apos;hot&apos; light. We all squinted, it was that powerfully bright of an explosion.  So, of course we were all shouting out, &quot;Look, look! What was that!!?&quot; We all stared intently. It remained in the same spot for a few seconds as it slowly faded back to it&apos;s original brightness. Then, it began to very purposefully move westward.  One witness said, &quot;Look, there&apos;s another one!&quot; This one was of the same brightness (not the explosive bright, but now the average star brightness) as the first one now. This second light was moving towards the first, they were meeting up.  They melded together, then shot upwards into the sky and vanished. I&apos;ll never forget seeing this.  Someone suggested that the explosion was perhaps a revving of an engine, like a turbo or something.  I have honestly tried to dissect this, and think what logically it might be, but it was not a falling star(s), nor was it an asteroid, meteor, plane, helicopter. It was amazingly fast.   That they completely changed course was amazing too.

Even though it was fairly late (around 1AM) there are always a good number of cars on the road at that time.  I was driving when my friend, who was sitting in the passenger seat, pointed to a beam of light that was pointing straight down at the highway in front of us. At first I thought it was a helicopter shining a spotlight down, but later I would realize that I was wrong.  The light, which was coming from what seemed to be 100-200ft from above the highway, started drifting off to the right.  In 1-2 minutes, the highway turned and we realized that the light was flying directly over the highway.  Just then, the beam turned off and from where it was shining from, a blue light appeared and sped away at an incredible speed over the horizon. About two seconds after the light sped off, another large bright blue light shot down from what seemed to be outer space to the area that the origional light went to. As we continued along the highway, about five miles down the road we noticed that off to our right, several miles away (in the general viscinity of where the lights earlier flew to), several blue and red balls of light were flying around each other at odd velocities and manuvering like no aircraft we had ever seen.  At this point we figured we would get the best view if we got out of the car to look.  The four of us stood and observed the manuvering craft for a few minutes before all but one blue one flew away over the horizon.  The remaining craft, we realized, was flying towards us!  All four of us began to get nervous about this strange event but we couldn&apos;t turn away.  Slowly, the craft flew directly over us, silently, at an unknown altitude.  This gave us the opportunity to see, by the orientation of 9 blue lights on it&apos;s leading edge that were flickering like strobe lights, that it was v shaped.  It continued on at this speed until we couldn&apos;t see it anymore. We were glad a beam didn&apos;t shine on us when it passed directly over us!((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date may be approximate.

Perfect 90 degree banks at incredible speed!!!During my days at college, my roomates and i decided to visit, the ((deleted)) temple in moundsville, wv. following an old dirt road through the woods leading us there, i noticed a strange hum coming from outside the car. I pulled over to a place where the dirt road ran beside a small crick. The sky was perfectly clear, and EVERY star was visible. We were at a particular opening in the woods, were you could see a good bit of the sky. At about 10:30 pm I noticed the humming was coming from the sky, and looking up, I saw 5 distinguishable crafts approx. 1,000 ft in the air, i&apos;m not the best judger of distance when it comes to te sky. 1 hovering motionless in the center of the sky, and the other four were flying around it at astonishing speeds. The intriging part about them was, the fact that they were circling the center craft and banking immaculate 90 degree turns without slowing down. I noticed a slight visual disruption directly behind the 4 crafts, as if staring through gasoline fumes where your vision is distorted by waves of exhaust. The crafts appeared to be triangular shaped, distinguished by 3 blue lights at each point, and one larger and brighter white light in the center. They appeared to be holding their position the entire time were there, as if they were spying, or maybe waiting for something. We decided to leave because we all had class early next morning and it was an hour and a half drive back to the school. As we were leaving, headed down this old dirt road barely large enough for a single car, which also I might add, is lucky to be traveled twice a day; we were forced off the road and into the grass by 3 large oncoming vehicles. The first, an undercover state police explorer - as it appeared to be, and the other two were a camoflauged military hummer, and a large transport van also in camo. The van had 2 large sattelite dishes on it and more antennaes than i could count. Go figure/?? If theres anyone else out there, that may have seen the same spectacle in the sky near moundsville around that time, please let me know your out there. I&apos;ve made an interesting hypothesis about the humming coming from the sky. Have you ever hit a tuning fork or a cymbal from a drum set and placed it extremely close to your ear, and heard the low level hum that the sound waves radiate? It&apos;s almost unearthlike, and that is the EXACT sound I heard! I believe that this particular craft uses sound wave generation to either induce motion as in forward or reverse, OR, just as a means of hovering. Sound is measured in decibles, which is basically described sound pressure level. PRESSURE is the key, i believe they can force themselfs in any direction by controlled bursts of sound waves or magnetic waves. The government cannot keep a lid on this any longer, as long as everybody knows whats goin on. Then we&apos;ll all know who was directly involved in it for quite some time now; and you probably hear their excuse being: &quot;We didn&apos;t want to create a widespread panic...&quot; Sure what would happen if everybody suddenly realized there IS other life in the galaxy?? People would revolt against society, taxes wouldn&apos;t be paid, people wouldn&apos;t go to work, THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN&apos;T MAKE ANY MONEY ON YOU!!!! And more importantly; They would no longer be top dogs; let alone even be able to try to cover anything else up.

We saw it decend slowly down from a star..and then take a slant upward to the right...as we were going home from Sulpher Springs toward Commerce, Tx...(we had passed the point of the railroad tracks on the way home before the event occured) .. As it took the slant upward..it appeard to increase in speed and disappear for a short 1 or 2 seconds and then reappear at a higher altitude. then it went across the sky following the same length of the road we were on...and i fear that even though it was high up in the air...that we can only see it as a dot of light (redish,whitish, and bluish...i don&apos;t know if the colors were rotating or what but it appeared to show those colors ) I felt that it (the craft ) had taken pictures of us ..or at least knows that we viewed it.

I could see the full outline of the object, which made no sound whatsoever.  The object appeared to be illuminess of a dark red colour.  In the centre of the triangle there was a rectangular shaped object with rounded corners which shone a bright white.  The configuration of my skylight is rectangular (4&apos;X2&apos;) facing east/west.  The object flew in an east to west direction.  The object flew very slowly, approximately 5 seconds went by before it flew out of my sight.  There were no flashing lights (like an airplane). The size of the object was rather large and it flew not that far off the ground, lower than an jet airplane and a little higher than say a cessna.  With an outstretched arm,  thumb and index finger touching each other (size of Can $2.00 coin) it would have filled that space.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length over the telephone with this witness, and found her to be an exceptionally serious-minded witness.

In appearance, it looked like a meteor or light reflecting off of a missile or the fusilage of a shiny airliner. In this first object, there was a bright light at the front, and two smaller lights very close in a line behind (in reference to its direction of travel), which made it appear to be the tail of a meteor (but they did not change in relationship to the front light, so I&apos;ve pretty much ruled that out). The lights were nearly the same color as the yellowish-red type of street light (high pressure sodium, I believe). There was no sound, nor was there a vapor trail. The object traveled in a mostly west &amp; slightly south direction. When the object reached approximately south-southwest of my house, the 3 lights appeared to move closer together, until you could only see 1 light. This 1 light appeared to grow *at least* 4 times brighter than the 3 lights combined. It stayed bright for a period of time, maybe 10-15 seconds, then it dimmed to the brightness of the original light (the one in front without the 2 behind). It continued to move in the same mostly west, slightly south, direction until it faded out of sight (presumably from going further away). Just before the first object faded out completely, my dad looked at the spot where it appeared, just below the moon, &amp; saw another object. This second object was *identical* in appearance &amp; motion, including having the 3 lights combine into one, grow bright, &amp; continue west until fading out of sight. At a similar interval (just before the second object faded completely), the third object appeared. It was sighted just above &amp; to the left of the moon &amp; traveled in exactly the same direction &amp; approximately the same speed as the first two objects (presumably it was in pursuit). This third object was quite obviously a plane, as vapor trails and wings were evident. However, the leading edge glowed in 3 places a *bright* red, approximately the same hue as a bright red car, or a fresh cherry. I assume the bright red in front, was a reflection of the now set sun. I am no expert in finding velocities of flying objects, but if all three were plane sized, I approximate their speed at around 5-600mph, &amp; an altitude of 30,000 to 45,000 feet. At no time did any of the objects change speed or direction of flight. My very first impression of these objects was that they were planes that had the setting sun&apos;s light reflecting off of them. But there were no vapor trails (except for the 3rd object), no strobe lights, no sound &amp; no wings or tail (except the 3rd object, where we could clearly see wings). A few moments later an airliner flew directly overhead &amp; it was very clear that this was an airplane, we could see the full length of the fusilage, the tail, both wings &amp; a vapor trail. But the first two objects are very puzzling to us; they definitely fit the under the category of Unidentified Flying Objects.

When I noticed that directly above us was the most amazing sight for me. the shape was that of a perfect triangular form, with each tip of the triangle light with a dim light and pointing the same direction, I beleive that between the three light triangle there was something in the middle, like if it were just one craft.  The craft was traveling east at an astounding speed.  From the time it was over the top of us to the time it disappeared into the horizon was just few seconds, but I felt as I has watched it for longer.

Also, as to the quality of the lights, one of we who saw it noticed that they did not flicker as stars do, but were brighter and had a steady light.  As to the swath, it was three or more times longer than the space between the lights and maybe a third the lights space apart in width.

At the restaurant on the top floor was an outdoor patio where guests of the wedding would go to smoke and socialize. The group (5 in number) which had gathered on the patio were talking about how beautiful the moon looked coming over the western horizon and we talked about the number of shooting stars which had shown themselves throughout the evening sky. Just as we finished discussing the shooting star, which I had just witnessed, one of the people in the group yelled, &quot;What is that&quot; and pointed above us looking east in the night sky. It was a group of about 6-7 oval shaped objects traveling in a straight-line formation. They didn&apos;t seem to be lit up by their own luminescence but since they were traveling over Victoria near the city center it looked as though the city lights lighted them up. The objects appeared to be a grayish in color. It was also hard to tell exactly what altitude the objects were traveling. We couldn&apos;t discern any noise coming from the objects throughout the entire sighting. They proceeded to move in a westerly direction until they began to form up into a new formation in an square/rectangular shape and began to ascend into the sky almost directly above the city center. At this point the videographer who had been hired for the wedding was called out on to the patio and we all pointed to the objects in the sky and told him to start taping the event. A few other people who came out on the patio also witnessed the formation and their ascension. The objects continued a slow climb in the square shape formation. As they got smaller we could see their lights flicker and at this point it was hard to make them out. However, we did see some of the objects seemingly streak off into space, but I do clarify at this point they had become faint star -like lights.
