["Brillant Orange glow lasting for minutesI steeped out on my back porch to smoke a cigarette and looking across the sky to the NW, I noticed an unusually bright orange light hanging in the sky several miles away.  Being in aviation over half my life, my first thought was an airplane reflecting the setting sun.  I was using a power line as a reference, I watched the light drop below the power line.  It then moved quickly to the East and faded out.  Within a few seconds, it reappeared and was a little brighter this time.  The light continued in an Eastern direction for about 15 seconds before completly fading away.  During this sighting, there were no noises associated with normal aircraft activity.", "It was a circle shape with a very bright Florissant lights glow to it and a red light would blink on top of it about ever five minuets it would move a little and then stop and so on .", "My Report to the UFO Website October 6, 2007 5:45 a.m. Central Approximately Three Miles West of Johnstown, Nebraska   On October 6, 2007, I was driving to Wayne, Nebraska, for a meeting, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I had allowed enough time. I was in a hurry.  It was about 5:45 a.m.Central Daylight. I was traveling from Valentine, Nebraska.  The meeting registration was at 9:30 with the meeting to begin at 10:00. I&rsquo;m including this piece of information because it did have a small part in my actions at the end of this story, I believe. I was  traveling on Highway 20 approximately two to three miles west of Johnstown, Nebraska, just a very short distance west of Plum Creek. (less than a mile, I approximate)  It was dark and I was watching for deer, porcupine, etc, yet, trying to keep aware of the time and my schedule.    The stars were out.  All of a sudden there is a flying object coming parallel to the road in the opposite direction I was traveling, just clearing the trees. In other words, it came from the other direction and was just beyond the fence line on the opposite side of the road.  It was flying pretty low to the ground, yet, high enough that I was thinking it was a small private plane because I could hear it so well, and because it was so low.  There were a lot of lights flashing, and a pretty loud whirling sound, an unusual sound to me, but the only way I can describe it was like a helicopter sound, but more a whirling sound than a chopping sound.  It definitely was not a helicopter. I remember being amazed as there were twenty or thirty lights flashing on this vehicle.   At first I thought I was close to Ainsworth, as there is an airport there and it was so low to the ground I thought it must have just taken off.  I thought it was a very fancy plane.  I said some things out loud, and I believe they had a bearing on what ensued.  I will relate those comments in a few paragraphs. At first I didn&rsquo;t think much of it, I thought it was a small plane definitely with sophisticated instruments, radar, etc. I continued driving only glancing at it twice. It immediately came back to check me out, as that is when I realized I must stop to see what in the world this was.  I was looking at the road, (driving) so I didn&rsquo;t see it shift into reverse, but that is what must have happened.   As I think about it now, at that point, I remember being surprised as I could see stars through it, and the lights weren&rsquo;t flashing and making as much a noise as it had made an instant before, when it first was visible and coming over the trees.    I pulled over, off the road onto the shoulder, put the vehicle in park, and opened my window.  That is when I realized this was a very unusual event in my life.  I stared at it, and remember there wasn&rsquo;t much of any sound now, and just an instant later, there was no sound.  It was suspended in the air, and just hovering there, about 15 or 20 ft. in the air.  I could see through it.  The lights weren&rsquo;t flashing then, and there were only a few lights. Also, I remember thinking that whomever was in there, was not visible, but no doubt was looking at me.  The lights I could see were on the exterior of the craft and there were only two or three that I recall along with apparent illumination in the interior.  The visible lights  were in the position of one or two corners of the craft, I believe, but I remember thinking there weren&rsquo;t lights in each corner, maybe just three lights.  My attention was directed to the interior, illuminated but not a very large space, and I thought two levels. It looked like a large rectangular glass (plastic) box.  The interior wasn&rsquo;t very wide. There were no desks, no panels of instruments, no anything, but it was dimly lighted allowing me to see functional space. I&rsquo;ve tried to recall the measurements, but bear in mind, this all happened in a few minutes time.  These measurements are the best I can recall, and here they are.  The plastic box, which this craft appeared to be, was approximately 18 feet long, maybe a little less, but not much.  The height was approximately 13 feet.  It was rectangular with the horizontal measure greater than the vertical measurement.  It appeared there might be two levels, but, of course, I didn&rsquo;t see any steps, etc.  The space inside was illuminated lightly, I could see some depth to the space, and I&rsquo;m going to guess that at about 4 feet. The reason I thought it was two levels, it appeared there was some kind of horizontal divider in the craft, in about the middle. I have calculated that I was no more than 120 feet from the craft. 18&rsquo;x13&rsquo;x4&rsquo; approximately, and about 120 feet away. I looked in the rear view mirror and saw two large trucks (cattle trucks I realized after I got out on the road) approximately 1/8th of a mile behind me, coming very fast toward me.  I got scared all of a sudden, and wanted to be in front of the trucks to protect myself.  I remember calculating that it wouldn&rsquo;t put the trucks in danger if I were to pull out on the road and get up some speed, which is what I did.  I didn&rsquo;t even glance back, even though I wanted to, to see if I could see the vehicle flying away.   I was in animal country, and I had two large trucks bearing down behind me, so I just drove and concentrated on the road in front of me. The appointment I was traveling to had a very small bearing on my leaving so abruptly, but primarily I felt I wanted the safety of the trucks to escort me away from this experience. It was a very meaningful experience to me, however, and now I know UFO&rsquo;s exist.  As I was driving away from this experience, I felt a sense of gratitude I had experienced it. After getting out on the road again, I immediately came to Plum Creek and then Johnstown, and soon after that, Ainsworth.  I pulled in at the gas station, and saw the two big cattle trucks go by, and I&rsquo;ll always wonder if they saw anything.  They may not have, because the craft was  inconspicitious and the trucks were traveling very fast, and I recall some trees just to the left, or west,  of the craft. The lights of this craft  appeared to be the source of the energy to navigate it, and with the many flashing lights and the whirling noise, it seemed like a happy little vehicle, just singing and whistling along, before  it spotted me. Forgive me for  being repetitious, but I don&rsquo;t have time to make this a grammatically correct manuscript. Some of you who are reading this are probably appreciative of my repetition as I don&rsquo;t want to leave out any important points that I know I experienced. When I was first parked, and looked at it, it shut down to no sound and even though there were some lights, they were not flashing and they were very few in number.  The craft was completely stationary, suspended in air about 15 ft. off the ground.   I could see through the spacecraft, and could see the interior but could see no objects.    I would gauge it just a few feet on the other side of the fence line (standard distance from a road) and suspended approximately 15 ft. in the air. The last thing I want to relate is what I said, outloud, because I think they heard me, understood me, and that is what caused them to take a better look at me.  When I first saw the vehicle (which I assumed was a plane) I distinctly recall what I said, and that I said it out loud.  My windows were rolled up incidentally.   After glancing at this vehicle initially, I assumed it was some rich person&rsquo;s vehicle because it would cost a lot (just judging from the power and the energy I could see and hear) and I said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sophisticated little plane.&rdquo;   Then I recall saying, as I&rsquo;m driving down the road not even looking back at it, &ldquo;little fancy dancy plane!&rdquo;   Then, I remember saying, not having any idea the craft was anything other than being a mile or two away from me, &ldquo;Wow, twenty or thirty lights!!&rdquo; more or less to confirm in my mind what I had just seen. (When I first laid eyes on it, it was just having a good old time, clearing treetops and all those 20 to 30 lights flashing, making a lot of whirling sounds.  It appeared to be feeling very good.)  Then, I realized it had reversed itself, and it was still parallel to the road I was traveling down, at approximately 60 mph, and that&rsquo;s when I said, out loud, as I pulled off the road,  &ldquo;Boy, I&rsquo;ve got to have a better look at you!&rdquo;  I stopped on the shoulder of the road, put my pickup in park and rolled down the window.  And there was no more talking, just looking at this space craft, as I have attempted to describe it.  I definitely remember hearing the small purr being cut even more, so there was absolutely no sound as it was suspended in air. I sensed no evil or ill feeling.  It was a friendly force.  I sensed curiosity on their part, and I greatly appreciated this experience, even though I did get scared and wanted to be ahead of the trucks and not left behind. I hope to see another space vessel sometime, if I am so blessed.  If I do, I will  try  to be braver. But, you have to admit, I was pretty brave the other morning when I had this great experience. Before October 6th, I really didn&rsquo;t believe in UFO&rsquo;s.  I had not been drinking or smoking anything, I was totally sober and have been for years.  I know what time I left Valentine, and what time I arrived in Ainsworth, and there was no great lapse of time.  I imagine my encounter lasted only a couple minutes from the time I first spotted this noisey  craft, when the craft returned to my proximity, when I parked to observe it and  when I pulled out on the road again. The man I talked to on the phone from this website asked me to draw a picture of the relationship of the size of the  vehicle I saw to the sun in the sky.  I think this would be confusing, I&rsquo;ve given you the measurements as best as I can recall them.  If I would have to do that, it would be close to the relationship of a 3x5 file card to a penny.  Thank you for your attention.", "Strange light and illumination  pattern in early morning S and SSE skyI was walking our Beagle and watching the early morning sky, as usual.As I looked due South, at about 35 degrees above the horizon, I noticed a very odd light. It didn&apos;t &quot;twinkle&quot;...it didn&apos;t &quot;pulse&quot;...it didn&apos;t &quot;flash&quot;...it wasn&apos;t a &quot;strobe&quot;.It was more of an irregular &quot;flicker&quot;, much like a fluorescent bulb when it is getting ready to burn out. It was not regular in shape, but seemed to be extending out from a slightly brighter center point in a somewhat irregular form or pattern. Each illuminating flicker had a bit of a difference to the shape. And the color was odd, not a single shade but a blend of shades. The size was larger than a medium-sized star, but that included the emitted light form. It never went completely dark until the last quivery flicker. About 2 or 3 seconds later it was in the SSE sky, at just slightly above the original degree point...seemed to be same size and description. (Locations would have gone like this...Original sighting was as if I extended my arm straight out in front of me...Second appearance was as if I extended my arm mid-way between straight in front and straight to the side...hope this makes sense.)  It did its behavior for about another 10 seconds or so and was gone...nothing more. I scanned the sky for the next 20 minutes while we walked, and it never appeared again. Since I watch the sky on a regular basis, I have seen many different lights, and illumination patterns.I have never seen one like this. Just a quick mention...there is a Space Shuttle launch later this morning.", "SR-71&apos;s over Washington County?

It was moving due north when the second one appeared and moved in very close proximity to the first.  It then passed the first one a bit and they both sped off in the northerly direction.  It was broad daylight on a partly sunny day.  There were a few fluffy white clouds nearby.  I tried to run inside to get my camera but by the time I could get back, they were gone.

So we got our coats and went out onto the porch and started walking towards my barn where I keep my horses and dog. Out of nowhere we saw this light and an object that had a metal look to it. It was easy to see because  the light was surrounding it. The object (we couldnt really identify the shape) was moving slowly throught the sky as if it was looking for something. At first we thought it was a helecopter but it didnt seem to have blades (on the top) and it was not making nosie like a helecopter does. It seemed like everything around us was still and silent. We started walking towards the barn, again, and i could hear my dog barking. We still had a strange feeling and i got goosebumps as we started moving closer to the barn and towards the spacecraft. Then the object starteed moving towards us very slowy (still looking for something, i think) and thats when me and my friend started to get scarred so we turned around and ran back into my house. When we got in i looked out the window and the object was gone. The next morning we went back out to look around the feild and there was no traces of the object.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The sky was a brilliant blue, temp in mid 70&apos;s and the visibilty was unlimited. The sun was to our backs, my friend said they might be fighter aircraft but I said no way, too fast. As soon as that object faded from view to the NE, another SPHERE came along in the general same track this one PULSED a few times along the flight path.  Again, it faded from view to the NE.  The color was a golden yellow and real sharp and defined, but small. No estimate of altitude but it was up there. I joked, these must be UFO&apos;s any more? and sure enough, another came along this time to our  left but followed the same flight path.  No pulsing, just a steady, bright light. Again, faded from view in NE distance and again, a fourth object, the last, came into view as same as third, but this one pulsed a few times as it zipped over head and on to the NE. The color of these objects were all consistant and the only reference of luminosity would be the yellowish hi-way lights they use to light the interstates, only more intense. No contrails or erratic flight, just straight and true. It was really strange how brilliant these objects were and stood out against the daylight sky.

We pulled into the campground around 10 p.m. and proceeded to try to find my parents.As we were trying to find them, we both noticed a large aircraft over the water near the 28-mile Road Bridge. It was triangle in shape, and very large, maybe 200 ft wide. It had no sound, was maybe 100 ft off of the water, and moved very slow (10-15 mph). There were white lights at each corner of the aircraft, the lights were not particularly bright, nor were they dull. They had a warm fuzzy &quot;glow&quot; about them. As if this wasn&apos;t amazing enough for us, there was what appeared to be lightning bolts shooting out of the front of it. This lightning came in pulses lasting about 5 seconds each, and maybe 10 seconds in-between each.We watched this for 15 to 20 minutes before we were both so freaked out that we went into town to get a hotel room for the night. It is important to realize that both of us seen this thing. Neither of us was drinking, or on any drugs, and even 14 yrs later our individual accounts of what we seen that night are the same.I have searched for similar accounts online, but have so far not been able to find anything.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a very bright light, larger than any star and seemed to be falling fairly fast; it got dimmer and dimmer until I couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore. I was almost to Beldenville when I spotted another. I pulled off on to a side road to get a better look. There were as many as six objects flying in large circles. At the closest part of the circle they were bright and large like the first one I saw; as they got further away they looked to have one red light and one green light, and very fast flashing white lights that ran along the length of it. I watched them for a while then decided to move on.Just before Ellsworth I saw them again; again I pulled off onto a side road. I saw one very close this time; it consisted of a row of five red lights. It was flying very low and it was wider than the road I was on, yet it made no sound. When it started to circle it banked so sharply that the lights went from being horizontal to being completely vertical.While going east on hwy 10, between about eleven miles out side of Ellsworth, one flew over me. This one was very irregularly shaped, with the same red and green and flashing white lights. While it was over head, I spotted another just like it in my rear view mirror, at first I thought it was the same one, but I looked over my shoulder and there were two of them.When I got home I could still see them, little more than flashing lights on the horizon, I brought my dad out side and showed him. Every so often one of them would get very big and bright again, and then fade just as quickly. Dad thinks that they are probably military planes on practice runs, and he&rsquo;s probably right, but it&apos;s still unlike anything either of us had ever seen before.

It also seemed to change size and got so small and so close at times it looked like a model of some sort, but then it would get very large and shoot back out to what looked to be about 1-2 miles and hover again right out out above all the incoming jets coming in to Honolulu International airport.  I happened to be on a first date and it litterly scared the girl I was with, that she went running back to the car at one point.  It would seem to hover and travel slowly across the sky and then come in directly at us from time to time, thou always getting smaller when it would approach.  Then towards the end a red ball came out of nowhere and seem to meet up with the triangular craft then shoot away then come back, then both dissapeared.

As I was staring out the windshield into the sky I noticed an  unusually bright light in the sky. The object looked like a star but appeared to be in the sky at or about the same level a plane would be. The object did not appear to be moving, so I immediately ruled out that it was a plane and it was also much to high to be a helicopter. After staring at it for a few minutes I noticed that the object actually had moved slightly in the sky and was no longer in the spot it was just a few minutes ago. The light appeared to be about 5 times in diameter bigger than the north star. When I zoomed in on it with a camera, I noticed that the object actually was not bright white but it was actually blinking other colors of light. Red, green, blue and yellow lights were blinking one at a time. But when you looked at it with the naked eye it appeared to be just bright yellow or white. After driving around for a short while I tried to figure out exactly where in the sky the object was. I estimated that it was somewhere between Brooklyn and Manhattan as I was staring at it from the eastern shores of Staten Island. Staring at it with the naked eye, the object looked like a white flair that was not moving in the sky. Just a very bright and close twinkling white star, but as I said when you zoomed in on it, it appeared to be blinking different colors. When my girlfriend attempted to take pictures of it, it would not appear on camera. For a split second we were able to zoom on it very well and see that it was actually a circular object. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I am wondering if any other people saw this object because it was in the sky for about 2 hours. If I were an alien, I would probably visit NYC at that time because every is sleeping or drunk. I went to sleep and when I woke up the next day the object was obviously gone.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD))((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I heard he saw something after some of the family was giving him a hard time about the experience; saying he must have been drinking and didn&rsquo;t take him serious (he&apos;s an honest person).My cousin (35yrs old) and his friend (33 yrs old) were at the friend&rsquo;s house at about 1:00am, but I am not sure about the date (mid July?) 2007. They had been out fishing and were moving fishing gear back to his car from his friend&rsquo;s vehicle. His friend said something about the neighbor (1 mile down) must have got a new yard light. They then noticed that the light looked like it was &ldquo;wobbling&rdquo; back and forth. Then all of a sudden the light slowly rose above the tree line still &ldquo;wobbling&rdquo;. I believe he said it was triangular shaped with three lights (one on each corner); he got a better look at it above the tree line. Then he said within a couple seconds it was a dot in the sky. It went straight up at a very high speed. After seeing it rise he said it might have been further away then what they originally thought (maybe 4 or 5 mi away?).

I looked off to the northeast &ndash; towards Scott County &ndash; and saw a round shape with bright lights of Red, Blue, and white. The lights went all around the object and sometimes seemed to be steady and at other times seemed to strobe or even rotate around the object. The object also had at least four straight extensions coming off of it and running underneath the main object. The extensions were also lighted. The object sat perfectly still. I got my daughter to come look at it. She thought it was a Police Helicopter, mainly because of the red and blue lights. The object was way too high to be a Helicopter and the area it was hovering over would have been very rural. My daughter went back inside. I continued to watch. We do not have binoculars, so I went inside to get my daughter&rsquo;s Digital Camera that has Zoom capabilities and thought that might help. When I returned to the balcony, the object was still there but then there was a second object much closer and much larger. It was more of a perfectly shaped orange ball and almost appeared to be &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; on a house off in the distance. I called for my daughter again and she thought it was a full moon. I did not think that was the case because it was too orange and I don&rsquo;t recall ever seeing a full moon in that spot before. This morning I looked at the Naval Observatory&rsquo;s Web Site and according to it there was no full moon last night, it should have been a &ldquo;Last Quarter&rdquo; moon.  My daughter told me that I had watched one too many X-Files and that she was sure it was a Police Helicopter and a Full Moon.  While I do not know what either object was, I do not believe they were those things, and my daughter who was so sure of herself was too &ldquo;scared&rdquo; by what she saw to sleep in her room downstairs last night.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??

At the time the school got out at around 5-6:00 pm.

We sat there for quite some time and i began looking up into the white sky and suddenly i saw something that was pretty strange. I didn&apos;t say anything for a moment and i did not take my eyes off of what is saw that day. In the sky was a dark colored triangular aircraft of some kind. It was perfectly triangular and was obviously not something natural. I wouldn&apos;t say it was black; more of a metallic dark grey. I was comepletely amazed at what i saw, and for the most part i wanted to be practical and believe it had an obvious explaination. It seemed to have been standing in place but suddenly it started moving. It was moving steadily fast. I moved fast enough that it was leaving sight rather quickly, but it wasn&apos;t leaving at lightning speed. It was a super cloudy day that day, and it was probably strange that we even saw it at all considering how overcast it was. I watched it go into the clouds and i kept looking out for it, but i simply didn&apos;t see it at all. My friend then spoke up and told me that she had just seen something really weird. She hadn&apos;t known that i had seen it too. And my i told her that i had seen it and we talked about it for the ride home. I kept looking for it all the way home, but i didn&apos;t see anything strange. I decided to believe it was nothing, and when i told adults, they sort of looked at me as though i didn&apos;t know what i was talking about, since i was only sixteen at the time. I gave up trying to get anyone to believe me and soon i quit thinking about it, though i never forgot it. A couple nights ago something sparked my memory and so i decided to look it up on the internet and i did some research. I didn&apos;t even know that triangular shaped UFO&apos;s are reported but i found out that they are. And i looked at the description and sure enough, the descriptions had an uncanny resemblance to what i saw. So, i looked into it further. I typed in something about triangular ufo&apos;s seen in Moscow Idaho. I didn&apos;t think i would get anything. I found a reporting on this website that took place on the same date someone else had reported a sighting. I also noticed that that it is not particularily common for Moscow to have reported UFO sightings on this website. But mainly, i was take away that it was on the same day.

I first thought it was a mylar balloon being blown by the wind, however I quickly noticed that it was not moving nearly as fast as, or in the same direction as the wind. Its path through the sky was quite smooth, not like it was being tossed about by the wind. The object was oval and was changing color every few seconds from reddish orange to white. It seemed to me that the object was slowing turning or wobbling, alternately showing a red and white surface. The object was bright, but not glittery as a metallic balloon would appear reflecting sunlight. I watched the object for about 5 minutes as it slowly made an arc towards the southeast. It finally hovered in one spot in the sky. I continued to watch it for another 20 minutes or so, and apparently it was gaining in altitude. When I first saw it, it had a definite oval shape and seemed to be about the same altitude as some general aviation type aircraft that were flying in the vicinity.

There was a second smaller orange light kinda below it moving up and down. I stopped and called my sister to have her go outside to see if she could see them from Stephan, where we live. She said she didn&rsquo;t see anything. We didn&rsquo;t see them anymore and started back home again. Then we were about two miles from home and again we seen one bright orange light then it spilt into two with one below the other, moving up and down.We got home and I walked down our road alittle to see past the campus High School building and south in the sky was five bright orangr lights. Four were in a straight line and one just below the left of the formation. I ran back to the house and got my kids in the van and we were going to go drive to get a better look at them. We made it just off our gravel road and we seen the one orange light again drooping what looked like flares. My daughter was filming it on out cell phone. We waited for about 30min and nothing.We were so excited leaving our house my sister ran over our dog, bummer. There are several residents in the area that seen the same lights. I even e-mailed it to Keloland our news station, no responds.Then on the 24th in Chamberlain, SD the  Keloland weather camera caught this burning light crossing the sky to the east, and a School bus had to stop and check it out. They said on the news that it was burning space debris.I know what I saw was not burning space debris or anything like it . What I saw was stationary and moving up and down.

We, at first, thought it was a small aircraft, but it was very close to the ground. The light showed that it was very maneuverable in its sporadic, three-dimensional movements.Unique to this light, however, was a beam of a lighter white going from the main light (let&rsquo;s say craft) to the ground. The light could move independently from the movement of the craft itself, and it searched from the trees surrounding the field to about the middle of the field.The craft continued these actions for about 15 minutes until it traveled to the tree line. The movements then switched to only a line parallel to our side of the field on the opposite side above the trees. The light remained on the ground for 1 more minute until the craft got brighter (as if its beam were shining at us).

Having originally planned on having the whole afternoon together, our lunch visit had to be cut short due to an unexpected appointment involving my friend. Because I live in Toledo, Oregon, I decided to take advantage of the unseasonable sunny weather that afternoon by stopping along the way home to take some scenic pictures. Being semi-retired and living on the scenic Central Oregon Coast, I have enjoyed taking pictures as one of my favorite pastimes. I stopped at the Seal Rock area around 2:00 pm. Having a digital camera, I am able to take many pictures and then sort through them at home on my PC to choose my best shots. It wasn&rsquo;t until after I downloaded my pictures onto my PC that I discovered that one of my pictures had an &ldquo;odd&rdquo; object in the picture. When first trying to zoom in on the object in the image, I thought that the &ldquo;odd object&rdquo; was possibly two seagulls that were casting an unusual or &ldquo;odd&rdquo; appearance. However, as I zoomed in on the objects in the image, I felt that the unusual object was not simply seagulls as I had first thought. I instead felt that I had unknowingly taken a picture of some object. I also realized that I had not seen nor heard anything unusual at the time that I was taking the pictures. Of course, being right down on the beach, it was the sounds of the pounding wave action that was heard most. Although I have been somewhat hesitant about submitting this report and my photo image to the National UFO Reporting Center, I have decided that I must try to find out just what the object really is. Along with this report submittal, I am also emailing the image to the National UFO Reporting Center. I am hoping that the UFO Reporting Center might be able to determine the most likely explanation for the object that appears in that one picture.", "((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to he gentleman who first apprised us of this article, and for his having provided a translated version.

Here&apos;s the link:   http://www.expres.ro/article.php?artid=329959   &quot;MiG hit by a UFO above Ardeal  November 9, 2007  by Mihai Soica   A jet fighter from Campia Turzii was hit by four unidentified flying objects   Air force pilot Marius Mitrica declared yesterday that his MiG 21 Lancer craft was hit while flying at an altitude of 6,500 meters by an unidentified flying object.The accident took place last week during a training flight in the area around the city of Gherla, close to Cluj.The jet fighter piloted by commanding lieutenant Marius Mitrica was flying at over 850 km/h. &quot;I was flying at 6,500 meters [of altitude] and I didn&apos;t notice anything particular. Suddenly, however, I was hit by a sturdy object from the Right side of the airplane. The collision broke the Plexiglas covering the cockpit. The pieces pierced my helmet and injured my face. At first, I ducked as much as possible because the air current was very strong and the temperature reached -30 degrees Celsius. I came down to a lower altitude and I slowed down. I noticed that the airplane responded to my commands and I finally slowed down&quot;, explained Marius Mitrica who is an Air force pilot since 1991.Neither a bird nor a meteorite   The pilot is convinced that the object that hit him was not a bird. &quot;I&apos;m 99,9 percent sure that it wasn&apos;t a bird&quot;, he said. Immediately after landing, a committee of specialists from the Air force inspected the airplane hoping to find the rest of the object that hit the MiG. &quot;When I landed, my first instinct was to look in the cockpit to find the rest but I just found Plexiglas pieces&quot;, added Mitrica who ended up with a Black eye due to the accident.The pilot also added that it is impossible that he was hit by a meteorite because in such a scenario the impact would have been devastating. &quot;I don&apos;t think it was a meteorite because this one has a considerable kinetic energy. Had it hit the airplane, I don&apos;t think I would be here talking to you&quot;, said the pilot. He added that he was lucky with the Oxygen mask who helped him overcome the shock quickly. &quot;Had I not had the mask, I could have lost conscience due to the shock of finding myself without the plastic shield. The biggest danger was hypothermia&quot;, Mitrica said.One of the air controllers from the Campia Turzii Base during the training flight when the accident happened was the pilot&apos;s own wife, Carmen Mitrica. She declared that she could not ask her husband if he is all right through the radio because that frequency was used by the other pilots in the air. &quot;I gave him all the indications he needed to land safely&quot;, said Carmen Mitrica. Every fighter jet has a video camera recording training flights. However, the video analysis did not shed any light on this accident according to the Air force&apos;s 71st Base stationed in Campia Turzii.The video clip with the UFO is with the SRI  Air force general Ion Avram specified that the video clip shows four triangles the size of an A4 sheet each coming towards the aircraft from the right. &quot;We gave the video images to the Romanian Information Services [SRI, N.B. The Romanian secret services] to be analyzed and to tell us what hit the MiG&quot;, declared general Ion Avram. The general also added that birds do not fly during this season at such altitudes because it&apos;s too cold.The 71st Air force officials also verified if the &quot;UFO&quot; could be an object from another airplane flying in the vicinity. The hypothesis was excluded since the last airplane flying in the area passed by there more than an hour prior to the accident.&quot;", "Bright large orb with bright light shining to ground, lasted only 30 seconds.Large flash like welder over prairie.

I was in a dark area near the corner of Convoy and Armour Streets in San Diego, California.  This area is directly under the flight path of Montgomery Field and a few miles south of Miramar Marine Air Station.  I have lived around the Miramar Marine Air Station for 20 years in several locations.  I have seen just about every possible plane and plane formation flying over me in this area and I have never seen anything like this. Each light was about the 3 or 4 times the size of a normal star (so they were very obvious). A plane close enough to have a light that large would be very loud; but there was no sound.  The distance between each light was about the same as each light (making it seem like all 4 lights were linked) but I could not see anything in-between the lights.  This was a tight formation.  This V-shape of lights traveled from north to south across two-thirds of the sky in about 5 seconds  (5 seconds is not a quick glance---I watched it clearly). Tonight, at 7:48 pm, there was about 10 to 20 percent of wispy cloud cover and these lights were above the clouds; but I do not know how high above the clouds.  I could see the lights through the clouds as they passed over the clouds. The quality of the lights needs mentioning.  The lights were solid and bright; but not a bright light like a star or blinking plane light.  These lights were different, maybe softer.  These lights did not blink. I guess the best description of these lights would be a slightly dim, off-white.  I say they were a V-shape; but the open end would be wider than a typical V.", "Medium sized triangular shaped craft hovered and shot off extremely fastWe were in Gig Harbor Washington. Looking East from shore of the bay I saw a triangle with lights. The corners were acute and sharp. There was a very bright white light in the center of the triangle.  The three corners each had a light.  The craft was a perfect triangle, yet it&apos;s west pointing corner had a red light. This appeared to be the leading edge as it moved from East to West.  The south corner had a blue light and the north light had a green light. It was 9:10-9:15 PM.  It was dark and cloudy. The size of the craft I would say was about half the size of a jet liner.  I was below the cloud cover which was perhaps 1 mile away. When I first saw it, it was moving west from over the bay to over land a few hundred feet then stopped immediately. It stayed still for only about three seconds.  Then it went straight up very fast a hundred or two hundred feet. It stopped immediately and stayed there for only one second or so, then it shot off to the west and because I was in a car and the west view was obstructed by a hill (and the roof of the car), I couldn&rsquo;t see it again.", "Huge Delta-shaped craft over San Diego skyI was on a routine evening walk with my 16 month-old toddler, when right above our head a massive delta-shaped craft with pulsating red lights glided through the sky.

There were no audible engine sound other then a humming noise - the type you would hear emanating from a Goodyear blimp.  Make no mistakes about this one, it was the size of a damn city block and if it were a conventional craft it would have dropped straight from the sky at observed velocity.

Upon further examination by myself and the three other people sitting at the table, the object had no other lights and shone only as a large glowing orange light, much like a fireball. We then noticed that the object was moving very slowly toward our direction, though still miles away. After a short while the object stopped and hovered in place, moving slightly and then appeared to turn over at which point it was revealed that there were multiple lights on the object, all the same orange color. The object then moved back in the same direction it had come at approximately the same speed. It was at this point that two of my friends and I walked down to the end of the block to listen for any sounds, such as helicopter rotors, which might have helped identify the object. As we were walking to the end of the block I noticed a small light fall from the object, glowing like fire and then disappearing almost like an ember, which had fallen and gone out. I pointed this out to my friends and we then observed several more of these small objects falling from the main object before the main object itself disappeared from view, presumably behind clouds. When we returned to the patio many people were standing up looking in the direction where the object had disappeared and they were all talking about it.

The crafts were in sight for approximately ten seconds each, before we lost sight of them. These two crafts came out of what appeared to be high altitude cirrus clouds, moving in a east-southeasterly direction. The clouds were long, thin and transparent, localized to a specific area in the sky. The clouds themselves seemed to last no more then two hours in duration.

However it appeared to not be moving, and all of sudden it shot off to the west, then back east. It was moving side to side, and up &amp; down, at a slow pace. Then it would move in circles and zig-zags, continuing these patterns for hours.My brothers came inside to get me out of bed and pointed it out to me, I saw it doing everything they had claimed it was doing. Through taking a look at different angles and using different reference points we were able to establish that it was between 50 and 100 miles away, likely over North Bend, Washington.The unidentified light was out before they went outside, at approx. 11pm, and remained out until we all went to bed, after 1am, but it continued moving around and would be in different spots ranging from directly south to directly southeast, constantly moving, then stopping, and changing the pattern of it&rsquo;s flight.We can&rsquo;t come up with any logical reason for any sort of craft to stay in an area for so long, but it quite clearly was moving in a fashion unlike any craft we have ever seen on earth.", "i choked on me jonny cake and started screaming for my parents to look at the sky.i was looking up in the sky by a cloud with my cousin then we saw a distortion of light coming from the cloud like half moved and half didnt i think it was cloaked.it went off leaving no trace but in like 1 third of a second((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax, we believe.

We stayed at an oceanfront hotel and the first evening we arrived, we went downstairs to take some pictures of the indoor lazy river and the outdoor pool area of the hotel. We noticed a very bright white light with a little red in it, in the sky over the ocean.  Thinking it was a plane at first, we still continued to watch it because it was so bright!  It was moving very slowly to the left (north).  After about a minute or two, another light shot out of the bright one (to it&rsquo;s left) and then 2 other lights lit up in a straight diagonal line with the one that had shot out.  They lit in sequence at evenly spaced intervals of time (about 2 seconds apart).  They were bright white also with a little red in them, but were smaller in size than the initial one. The initial bright light and the 3 other smaller lights all moved very slowly to the north in the same formation (still over the ocean).  The initial bright one went out after a couple of minutes and the smaller 3 lights went out about a minute later, one at a time and at evenly spaced intervals of time. Then just a few seconds later, we could see 2 very small white lights traveling at a very fast rate of speed much higher up in the sky.  One was slightly below and behind the other.  They were also traveling northward.  We did see a plane in another section of the sky, and observed that these smaller white lights were moving so much faster than the plane!  We have no idea what any of these lights were, but we were certainly fascinated by them.  Dumbstruck might be more like it.  I had a camera in my hand and didn&rsquo;t think about taking a picture until after the first bright light had already gone out.  I tried to take a picture of the other 3 lights that formed the diagonal line, I used the 12x zoom, but I had just gotten this digital camera and am still learning how to use all the different settings, so the picture came out very grainy.  The lights also look rather orange in the picture, but in person they were white with a bit of red.  Just to note: the other pictures I took outside that night (before we saw any of the objects) didn&rsquo;t come out as grainy as the picture of the objects.

It appeared to change shape from that of a hexagon to a triangle to a longer sphere.  The outer edges were extremely bright with a huge cluster in the middle &ndash; almost like multiple points or dots of lights.  Sometimes, the shaped changed to a crescent form &ndash; like a ladies diamond necklace.  At all times, there appeared to be 8-10 larger lights with all of the remaining dot lights contained within the shape.

Neighbors dog barking on the east side of my house, looked in that direction and noticed a large boomerang formation between 5,000 - 7,000 ft. altitude, 45 degrees above the east horizon about 300+ yard across.  Moving from north to south along Beltway 8 corridor from Westheimer to Hwy 59 south before I lost sight.  Clear night.  No sound. At first thought it may be one large single object but as it moved along, noticed some of the 20+ lights moved out of formation slightly so figured they were independent objects moving in formation like a flock of geese.  Having seen geese migrate all my life, quickly ruled this out.  Lights had an orangish/yellowish tint but seemed to be slightly fuzzy.  When the formation moved in front of the stars, the stars would obscure slightly but still be visible so that is also why I believe it to be multiple objects.  I have extensive knowledge of aircraft and know when I am looking at a plane, helicopter, meteor, or satellite in orbit.   Looking from my back yard to the south I can observe approaching aircraft from the west into Hobby airport, but this thing came from north to south and I first observed looking due east.   It made me think, &ldquo;Phoenix Lights&rdquo; when I thought about it later because of the boomerang/wedge shape and the color and it being right over the forth largest metro area in the country.   I have no doubt other people in the city probably saw this but just wrote it off as something ordinary.

I told him to shut up and look, and we sat in silence, absolutely amazed. The fireball was just hovering over the ocean about a few miles from shore. After a few seconds, little pieces of fire began to fall from the original fireball.  Then, as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared in the most peculiar way. The fireball expanded, contracted, and then just disappeared into thin air. There was no smoke, no other aircrafts in sight, there was not anything except for eerie silence. We were so freaked out that we left the beach and went home.  We discussed the possibilities of an airplane crash, military experiments, falling stars, but nothing seemed to make sense.

We watched the news for days, waiting to hear some kind of mention of this bizarre incident.  We heard nothing.  I was provoked to make this report after two years because a good friend, who had previously heard my account in detail, called last night to tell me a friend of his just described a very similar event. This event occurred even closer to The Cape and was observed by several other people and boaters, but was similar in its characteristics.  Apparently, this event began with an odd-shaped formation of light, and then proceeded to turn into a fireball before evaporating into thin air.

I have never seen anything like this before and I got a very good look at it.It was a shiny silver, like polished aluminum, completely round along the horizontal plane and yet about 1/3 that size in the vertical. To me it seemed about 50 feet in diameter. What really shocked me was it&apos;s flight characteristics. I flew manuevers I have never seen any plane accomplish and it was completely silent. It I was not looking directly at it... I would have never noticed it.It came over the mountain tops over the edge of the ridge, so it could be seen clearly from the valley where I was standing. It then abruptly turned a 180 and headed directly back over the ridge. But what was really amazing was during the 180 turn it also completely flipped over on it axis! So it was basically heading back over the ridge on its bottom...or upside down. If there is a top and bottom.Anyway, this short sighting was very profound to me. Since I know planes and this was nothing I have ever seen and the propellants produced no noise....whatever it used. That too was shocking.So there it is...I know what I saw and it was very clear, though very brief.What really shocked me later, because I live in a small community we tend to know all our neighbors. Where I live they are mainly cattle ranchers. They run them on open range up there on the mountain tops. We had two cattle mutilations reported up there over the years... I really was blown away when I learned this...because it seems just like other reports. I found that to be very strange.Let me impress upon you.... I am a very honest person... I strive to be all my life...this was no hoax.You can easily verify my story about the mutilations...the local law went up there and documented the cases.

I do not believe the UFO to have been any sort of craft, terrestrial or otherwise, though Freddy is near a military base (CFB Gagetown) so who knows. We were walking the gravel trails along the Saint John River at night, headed west, perhaps slightly northwest. I had seen a shooting star earlier that night directly above us. This was probably a latecomer amongst the Perseids from August. Then, ahead of us and at a seemingly low altitude, and pretty close distance-wise as well, a bright green fireball entered and left our field of vision in about 3-5 seconds. It was moving quite quickly and of a distinctly spherical shape. Whatever it was, it was certainly not a &quot;normal&quot; denizen of the night sky, esp. over harsh city lights.My Paint sketch depicts the view from southside Freddy along the trail, with a bridge across the river, dotted with cars, in the foreground and the northside, dotted with lights, in the background.

I used binoculars to try to get a better look, and as I was sweeping the binoculars, I noticed a very bright star to the lower right of the comet.  It appeared to have a cluster of lights above it, so I focused on the star and observed what looked like a &ldquo;net of lights&rdquo; that were white, red and green and pulsating.  I continued to adjust the focus, thinking I was not properly focusing, but determined that I was indeed focused properly on this object.    I called my husband over, pointed out the star, handed him he binoculars and asked him to look.  When I asked him what he saw, he described seeing a &ldquo;Jellyfish&rdquo; of lights above the star.  He confirmed that the lights were pulsating and the object was larger than the star.  We continued to take turns with the binoculars (7X35) and the object moved below the star, and to either side of the star, but with no apparent pattern of movement.  The bell shape of the &ldquo;jellyfish&rdquo; widened and narrowed, again with no apparent pattern.I then called my neighbor and asked her to meet me outside to look at something.  Without telling her what my husband and I had seen, I asked her to observe the star using my binoculars.  She did and asked me what the lights were below the star.  I asked her if they resembled a jellyfish with lights and she confirmed that&rsquo;s exactly what it looked like.  She also observed it moving, pulsating and changing it&rsquo;s position around the star.  She then had her husband come outside and instructed him to look at the star, without telling him what she had observed.  He saw the same patterns of pulsating light we other three had seen.  I got another, weaker pair of binoculars, and saw the same thing, only appearing smaller. We continued to watch this anomaly for about ten more minutes.  None of us could explain it, nor had any of ever seen anything like it.I came inside about 8:40 P.M.PDT, and looked on-line with my husband to see if we could find any information regarding our observations.

While my son searched for the cat, I happened to look up to the sky as it was a clear night and the stars were out.  I noticed two red and blue &ldquo;Stars&rdquo; twinkling rather fast and they seemed to be moving.  I went inside to get the binoculars for a closer look, and as I focused on the &ldquo;Stars&rdquo;, they appeared to be red/blue circle-shaped objects that were moving southwest.   I would have passed these off as stars had these objects moved together in the earths natural rotation; however these two red/blue twinkling objects seemed to be moving towards a third object farther in the distance and got considerably closer during the 45-50 minutes we watched this.  I compared these particular objects to the other stars in the sky, even the bright yellow planet Venus, and there were no other similar objects like the three we were watching.  We watched this phenomenon for about an hour and the two objects were moving at a good pace towards the third object which moved at a slower pace in the same southwest direction.  Ultimately, it appeared that the two larger objects were trying to reach the more distant third object of the same description.

At first i thought it was a shadow or something but when i saw the planes,and traffic hellicopters flying near it,i knew it was not a shadow. At one point it looked like it changed shape from a circle to a shape of a top hat. I tried to figure out the size of it as i saw a few jet planes flying in its direction you could fit at least 3 of those jets together just for the width,and it would not cover the whole thing.After about 8 minutes of whatching this, the black mass started to move away,and this time at a steady flow forward heading west into the sky line.", "Sighting near Irvine Spectrum.I work in south Irvine near the Spectrum and I was behind our building when I saw the object.

John Wayne Airport isn&apos;t too far away, so we see alot of air traffic. Well, as I was observing the jet, another object moved into view. What caught my eye was the sun reflecting off it&apos;s surface. At first I thought it was a weather balloon, as it was translucent in nature. It was a solid shape at first, like an aspirin. Then it lost it&apos;s shape and became unstable and undulated along. It did this for a moment, and then became a sphere, then going back to undulating. I watched it sharply and then it just disappeared. I&apos;m not sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but I know what I saw. Also, I should mention a few other details such as it&apos;s size. While at first appearing small, the jet passed right underneath it. The jet was pretty high up there, so this thing must have been about 1/6 the size of the aircraft. Even though it was translucent, I did notice that whenever the sunlight reflected off it&apos;s surface, the material briefly became dark and metallic.

My digital camera has sound too, so we will both be recalling and talking of what we saw that night of early 1978.

I was riding a bicycle on a dark side street facing east.  As I recall, the evening was clear and moonless.  I figured that the &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation would cross the path of the jet airliner and I would be able to get an idea of the altitude and size of the objects as they intersected with the airliner. As the &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation approached overhead, slightly to the east, if low, possibly traveling above 35th Avenue.If higher, they possibly would be above Black Canyon Freeway (I-17), over the Metrocenter regional shopping mall.  The &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation was not directly overhead, but slightly to the east of me at an undetermined altitude.As I watched the &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation approach the point directly east of me, the objects did a coordinated maneuver: They moved out along the &ldquo;V&rdquo; and spun in a coordinated circular pattern and then moved close together in a circular group packed tightly but none of them overlapping.  They moved out of the &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation in opposite directions and formed two separated circular clusters.  In doing this complicated maneuver, they never changed speed or their north-south orientation.  The motion out of the &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation reminded me of the Paramount logo at the start of Hollywood movies where the star flow up an around the mountain forming a circle of stars.This happened out of the arms of the &ldquo;V&rdquo; forming a rotating circle of rectangular objects that then tightened the circle into a paced grouping also having a roughly circular perimeter with all the objects maintaining their north-south direction only now formed into two separate circular tightly packed cluster &ndash; still moving toward the jet airliner.  The separation between the two clusters was approximately the length of the ends of the &ldquo;V&rdquo; when I first saw it and when it reached the point direct east of me.. These objects continued moving due north and at some point would intersect the path of the jet airliner &ndash; either In front of it or behind it &ndash; at least one or the other of the now two separate circular tightly packed clusters.  The jet airliner continued NE.  The two clusters were moving toward the rear quarter of the plane and I was sure one of the cluster would intersect and pass over the plane either above it or below it and that would give me some idea of their relative size and altitude.  As the two clusters moved toward the rear quarter of the plane, probably at about a 45 degree angle if a passenger on the plane were looking back over the plane&rsquo;s horizontal tail assembly.  As both clusters approached the plane and reached a point fairly close, both clusters simultaneously blinked invisible &ndash; as if the simultaneously and instantly turned on some kind of &ldquo;cloaking&rdquo; effect that rendered them invisible.  Neither cluster passed over or under the plane.  They just suddenly turned invisible.  The jet airliner continued it NE heading, the pilot or crew or passengers, unaware that a large cluster of rectangular objects had nearly intercepted it. When I arrived home, about a half mile from where this sighting occurred, I looked in the White Pages and found two listings for UFO reporting.  The first one I called rang with no answer.  The second one I called, UFO Watch I think was the name, located in Fountain Hills east of Scottsdale.  The man I talked to said it was extremely unusual to see rectangular objects and even more unusual to see multiple rectangular objects.  He said the complex coordinated maneuvers I described the objects performing would not be possible from any current technology he was aware of.  The U.S. Air Force didn&rsquo;t have anything capable of such a complicated, coordinated maneuver and they certainly would not perform something as complicated as the circular spin and tight formation clustering over a densely populated city such as Phoenix.  He told me to make a note of what I had seen and leave it at that.  He said no one would believe me.  I told him that I had two thoughts.  One was that this was the first UFO sighting I had ever experienced and couldn&rsquo;t believe that it occurred over a metropolitan area.  I thought UFO sightings usually were seen over remote, rural areas.  And second, that this occurred in the early evening and surely I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who had witnessed it.  People would be out playing tennis or shooting baskets or doing other outdoor activities and would have seen the same &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation and the maneuvers that I had seen.  I watched the news the next couple of days and never heard any report of such a sighting or similar UFO report.  I find it hard to believe that I was the only one who witnessed this unusual event.  There was a different sighting reported over Phoenix of some kind of unusual &ldquo;lights&rdquo; but they were moving in the opposite direction, from what I have heard, moving from north to south.  I told the man in Fountain Hills that I was sure that if I went out and purchased some video or photography equipment that it was unlikely that I would encounter such an unusual display of UFO mass coordinated maneuvers in the rest of my lifetime.  I probably would be wasting my time expecting to see such a sighting again and hoping to record it on videotape or on photographic film.  But what I had witnessed spanned about ten minutes at the most, maybe not that long.  The objects were not moving very fast, no faster than the jet airliner.  If I move my hand to trace the movement of the objects, the time lapse is more like one or two minutes, possibly less than one minute.  When I first saw the &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation, it was about halfway between the hor! izon to the SE and zenith looking due East.  This is the first time I have ever given a written report of that sighting.  I have told family and friends what I saw.  Each time a movie started showing the Paramount Pictures-Gulf &amp; Western stars spinning in a circle, I would mention that&rsquo;s what I saw those UFO objects do as they moved out of the &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I presumed it was a landing light since I could also hear the sound of a small airplane which would have been SE of me and inbound to the local airport. The reflected light was extremely bright. When I went on deck I looked up to where the sound came from to look at the plane and I saw a craft which was not at all an airplane.  It stopped making any sound and stopped in mid-air.  I &quot;felt&quot; it was looking at me!  It appeared to hover over a building located approx 200 mtrs away altho I&apos;m sure it was past the physical ridge of the island.  It had a window area which looked like a cartoon version of human teeth; 1 row upper 1 row lower. It emited a color of red then changed colors to yellow to green to yellow then red. It blanked out all color and moved east (50 mtrs as I saw it) and stopped again and repeated the color sequence.  It moved once more, stopped, and repeated the color change.  It then moved off slow but steady toward Puerto Rico then gathered speed as it left.  It disappeared from my view into clouds.  It made no sound once I had it in my sight.

From almost overhead I followed it to a place fairly well before the horizon.  It was a single object that took about 20 seconds to disappear into the sky.  My first inclination was that it was a balloon, but following it fairly high in the sky I was positive that it was not. I would guess the elevation to be 10,000 feet or below.  It did not leave a con-trail and did not resemble anything that I had seen before in my 46 years of life.  The path was not an ordinary North - South commercial jet flight path.

I&apos;m not an expert on contrails, but I have never observed one with such a sharp angle before. It seems to me that the G-forces would not be too forgiving on the occupants inside of the craft. I did see the craft travelling at the upward angle, but could not make out a shape and becuase it was daylight, I could not see any lights.

It is very prominent, currently, at this time of morning.  PD))My brother and I were driving home from Wal-Mart at 4:04 in the morning. While on the off-ramp leading to the road back to our house, we looked up at the sky and noticed a very large yellowish-white object in the sky, too big and bright to be a star. While we were stopped at the red light at the end of the off-ramp, we also noticed it was moving slowly to the left. Since planets do not move that quickly from a point of view on Earth, we also knew it wasn&apos;t a planet. When viewed with the naked eye, we even noticed wing-shaped protrusions. I though it looked like a phoenix. When we finally arrived home, we could no longer see the object through the tall trees, so we had to walk down the road to view the craft with a pair of binoculars. We stood there for 20-30 minutes watching the craft. We noticed that it had a flashing red light on its underside, and had a faintly visible flashing red dot moving around it. We are not sure whether or not this was another craft, but if it is, we believe the larger craft is a mother ship. The large craft also had a starburst light pattern around it, which did not twinkle, indicating that this was definitely not a star. While we watched it, it stayed still for the majority of the time, but every now and then, it would noticeably move to the left, to the right, up a little, and further away...and at one point, closer to us. It also occasionally changed shape. We walked back to the house at about 4:30, and noted that it was much higher up in the sky now; we could see it over the treetops while standing next to the house. It was also moving much more frequently, and slightly more quickly. At approximately 4:56, I ran into the house to wake my mother up to show her the craft. At approximately 5:20, after my mother and brother had gone back into the house, I noticed that the red dot that was flying around the object had flown into the object, and a dim blue light flew out in its place.

It was about 2100 hrs and the night was dark. She had just arrived from visiting our son who lives closer to town. Minutes prior, as she was driving home toward our house, she had observed a craft that had her mentally shaken, even today. She was 1 &frac12; miles from our home when 3, evenly spaced, bright lights, descended toward the road in front of her. Her first thought, when she saw the horizontal lights, was an airplane about to crash or land on the roadway ahead. The lights didn&rsquo;t seem to illuminate the ground, but were more like round window lights.  As she drove forward, the lights continued to float downward toward the road surface. She became concerned the craft might actually hit her car. At the brim of the hill before the little valley ahead, she stopped the car, thinking the aircraft would likely land in front of her. A pick up truck, had been following my wife, also stopped. Then both she and the pick up truck edged over to the side of the road., attempting to give as much room as possible to the craft.As the lights dropped down to the level of telephone wires, they continued their approach directly toward the front of my wife&rsquo;s car. &ldquo;At that point&ldquo;, my wife explained; &ldquo;I gunned the car downhill figuring I would be able to get under the plane.

Since the shadow and the lights then completely disappeared, without noise, my wife realized she had seen something she had heard about, but never wanted to see and was terrified.I drove my wife back to the site immediately.

It was far, far bigger than a normal shooting star (we had been watching the Orionids earlier in the month) and it&apos;s diameter was similar to that of the full moon. It appeared to be moving in an East to West motion diagonally towards the Earth, we witnessed it cover an area similar in width to the constellation Taurus. It did not however move in a straight line, it abruptly moved downwards slightly halfway through it&apos;s streak, as if it&apos;s trajectory had been abruptly altered (The best way I can explain it is picture drawing a straight line, then someone nudges your hand and your straight line is altered and continues in a different path) Because of this I believe it was &apos;close&apos;, at least far closer than a normal shooting star. It&apos;s motion was not similar to that of a normal shooting star. It was incredibly bright yellowish-green. It&apos;s peak brightness was comparable to an orange streetlight, it had to have been greater than -5 magnitude. It&apos;s movement appeared natural and not machine or human like. It lasted for about a second, with an ionization (?) trail lasting an additional second. It&apos;s motion was beautiful. It appeared perhaps 30 degrees above the horizon and disappeared perhaps 15 degrees above the horizon. We had been impressed with alot of what we saw in our telescope that night but this fireball made me and a friend resoundingly yell out in amazement. It looked like something that actually could have impacted on the Earth but we heard or saw nothing else past this. My roomate heard my tale of this fireball and attests he saw a similar phenomenon driving home from Riverhead in the same general area.((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??

It was a clear night. As I approached the Smokey Point Exit, I noticed a very bright white light (the size of a bright star) traveling from the east to west. It was several miles north of my location. At first, I thought it was a shooting star. But it wasn&rsquo;t moving as quickly, and it was blinking at the rate of about once per second as it moved across the sky. I watched it for several seconds, and thought perhaps it was a satellite. As soon as that idea crossed my mind, the light suddenly shot back the way that it came, zipped up, zipped north, and then shot east again...and disappeared. It startled me quite badly, and I felt nervous as I continued off I-5 at the Smokey Point (#206) exit. I kept searching the sky, looking for the mysterious light, thinking it might reappear near the place that it had disappeared. As I turned east and came to stop at the light at Smokey Point Boulevard, I glanced around and looked directly up. I was terrified to see an extremely large triangular object hovering directly above the intersection. It was so low that the streetlights shined on its underside, highlighting large rectangular shaped panels and what appeared to be rivets that were spaced very far apart.  I can&rsquo;t describe the size of the craft, because it extended beyond my scope of vision lengthwise, and I could see clusters of small white lights that indicated the shape. Could it be that they saw my headlights, and traveled to the intersection where I was heading toward? It HAD to be more than a coincidence. I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes. I looked around for other people who might see what I was seeing, but there were no other cars around, and no people to be seen at the 7-11 store on the corner.  Even after all I&rsquo;d witnessed, I really hoped that my imagination was playing tricks on me, so I looked up and expected that &quot;it&quot; would be gone. But, it was still there. I then noticed that it made no noise and created no turbulence in the air. I got SO frightened that I ran the red light, turning north onto Smokey Pt. Boulevard and drove as fast as I could all the way home.I never heard any other reports of this.  It has bothered me ever since, and I am uncomfortable to this day about looking skyward.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I thought maybe it was a satellite burning up falling to earth, but then it just started to move north again like nothing had happened.

As I walked toward the container I looked up and saw a formation of white objects in a &quot;Vee&quot; formation. At first I didn&apos;t think much of it as it looked like a formation of white birds flying southward.As I watched them I suddenly realized they were moving way too fast to be birds. Within 10 seconds they had already flown about a 90-100 degree arc from my stationary position. At my home if I look directly west I am about even with Marina Del Rey. As I watched the object(s) move southward, in those 10 seconds, they moved from directly westward to southeast of where i was standing, an arc of over 90 degrees.

Like I said, it looked like a formation of birds so I couldn&apos;t tell if it was a singular object or many objects.

However, I have a strong feeling that what I witnessed needs to be reported. Because of a work-related assignment, I have rented a 1,500 sq. ft. condo in an area of Punta Gorda, Florida, called Punta Gorda Isles, since May of 2007, and will be here until mid-December of 2007.  My condo is on the fourth floor of a building in a complex called Fountain Court.  The condo faces the north, and it has a screened in balcony that faces north as well.  The balcony looks out over a beautifully landscaped circular drive area, and beyond that is a street, then a complex of two story apartment buildings, then another building.  For about a mile-and-a-half beyond that are tree tops and, low on the horizon, a couple of buildings, a few broadcasting towers and a high-rise construction crane. The face of the balcony is approximately nine feet across.  I work at home and, (though I wouldn&rsquo;t want this known because I&rsquo;m in the health field) I smoke.  Therefore, several times during every day and night, I walk out onto the balcony, sit down, smoke a cigarette and think.  I also make many business calls out there. On the evening of Monday, September 24th, I was sitting on the balcony smoking a cigarette.  The sky at the time was a grayish color, and it was a patchwork of clouds (in different shades of gray) at different altitudes.  I was just staring forward as I always do, because there is nothing else to do.  Anyway, while I was sitting there I noticed what appeared to be a dull silver-colored parachute floating downward out of the clouds at an angle headed directly towards me.  However, there weren&rsquo;t any lines/cords hanging from the parachute, nor was there anything or anyone suspended from what appeared to be the parachute.  I remember wondering why there wasn&rsquo;t anything suspended from the parachute, and I can remember thinking that maybe the parachute cables were clear plastic and just couldn&rsquo;t be seen &ndash; but that didn&rsquo;t make sense.  I can also remember wondering how the parachute could be pulled towards the ground by gravity if there were no weight beneath the parachute to draw the parachute towards the ground.  Nonetheless, I wondered why someone would be parachuting at night, and I wondered where they could land at night with all the trees and buildings in the area. Punta Gorda and where I live here are the most boring places on earth and, therefore, what I was witnessing should have riveted my attention &ndash; but it didn&rsquo;t probably because of the following reasons:  1. I am in the middle of some very stressful situations at work, with which my mind was preoccupied. 2. I was taking a smoke break while working on another book, and I was thinking about what I had been writing and what I would continue writing when I walked back inside. 3. There are so many technologically-advanced things that are happening these days that almost nothing surprises us anymore. 4. And, this may seem strange, but it seems like I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to see it.  No matter what else was on my mind, I can&rsquo;t now understand why I wasn&rsquo;t riveted to what was occurring in front of me. As the object came closer I realized that the top of the object was flat, its sides were curved like a parachute, and its bottom was flat.  For an instant I thought it may have been an odd-shaped advertising blimp that had broken free.  However, there were no illustrations or writing on the object, and the object wasn&apos;t shaped like any blimp I&apos;d ever seen. In the middle of this, I stood up and walked about two feet indoors to get another cigarette off the table that is right next to the door.  Then I turned back outside and stood there on the balcony watching the object come closer.  I noticed that the wind was gently blowing to the west, however, the object was coming in towards me at a direct and seemingly determined angle &ndash; almost as if it were guided by a rail (which it wasn&rsquo;t) &ndash; and it was totally unaffected by the wind.  Therefore, I began to assume that it was somehow propelled. I then turned inside again (this time to get a lighter &ndash; which took about four  seconds) and, when I turned back out onto the patio, the object was traveling east at about thirty-five miles per hour.  I didn&rsquo;t see the object make the turn, but from its before and after locations and motions, it seemed that it would have had to have made a sudden left turn.  Although the object was obviously propelled by something, there were no sounds whatsoever, nor were there any jets, propellers or other visible or audible indications of propulsion. After the object made its left turn, it was traveling, as stated, at about thirty-five miles per hour.  It was traveling about twenty feet above the tree tops, and I realized from my vantage point that the object was about the size of a compact to mid-sized car.  I moved to the westernmost corner of my balcony and watched the object maintain a constant altitude and speed as it traveled east.  I watched the object travel east for about fifteen to thirty seconds until it disappeared into the haze of the eastern sky. I now realize how these types of things can happen and no one reports them.  It was all quite inconspicuous, quiet, and it was over with so quickly that it wasn&rsquo;t until it was over that I had time to really think about what just occurred.   And, after it was over, I realized all the things the object wasn&rsquo;t:  1. It wasn&rsquo;t a parachute  2. It wasn&rsquo;t an advertising blimp, and there was no advertising on the object. 3. It wasn&rsquo;t like any kind of craft that I&rsquo;ve ever seen or heard about before. 4. The object had no windows, no antenna(s), no wheels or pods, no propellers, jets or other visible means of propulsion and it was absolutely silent. To me it strongly seemed that the object had a mission.  It came down at an exact angle from the sky.  It turned and went in an exact direction to the east.  After it turned to the east, it maintained a constant altitude just above the trees and buildings.  If it had been a government craft, it would have most obviously been a surveillance craft. After the object disappeared, I became a bit upset with myself for not being totally focused on what had occurred from beginning to end.  I wished, for example, that I would have witnessed the object stop its descent and make its turn to the east. The next evening, Tuesday evening, September 25th, I was at a small meeting where I had to give a talk.  A very level-headed woman, with whom I work, was there.  I told her about what I&rsquo;d witnessed the night before.  She responded by saying: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange.  My mother told me that she saw something unusual in the sky by Punta Gorda Isles last night at about 8:30 p.m.&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I live, in Punta Gorda Isles, but I thought it was about 11:30 or midnight when I saw what I saw.&rdquo;  She said, &ldquo;No, my mother said it was at about 8:30 last night.  However, you know my mother is very intelligent but she is eighty-seven years old.&rdquo;  We all chuckled and that was it. Anyway, I definitely saw what I saw and it was real and not imagined.  It may have been a new type of government craft but, if so, it was unlike anything I&rsquo;d ever heard or read about. I&apos;ve never before seen anything like this, nor have I ever seen or reported any kind of U.F.O. event.  This all was totally unexpected.

The ufo was staying in that same spot for ten minutes and it was very low. A truck driver told my friend that there were 5 more in town. Then the army went to the gas station and started taking peoples phone away from them. My friend then told me to go outside and see if I can see anything. So I went outside and I thought it was a plane at first but the lights were not blinking and it starting coming down closer and I can tell it was a circle with lights all the way around it. I went inside to tell some family members to come check this out. And they couldn&apos;t believe what they were seeing. Then the ufo went higher up in the sky and stayed up there for about 30 minutes to an hour then just left.

The object was just within the glow of the street lights being reflected off the street but not quite low enough to be fully illuminated.

The road turned a bit to the right and was at a higher altitude than where I was currently.

I left the research complex a bit early today and began walking to my car.  When I reached my car, I opened the door to get in, and I momentarily turned back toward the research buildings. I saw a large object in the sky, and a quick comparison allowed me to estimate its altitude to be three times as high as the research building.  This was, of course, without knowing the ultimate size of the object, or the distance at which it appeared, so altitude was merely estimated. My first thought was a helicopter, being on the campus of a university hospital, but there was no sound - absolutely no sound.  This caused me to look closer. The object appeared to be quite large, larger than a helicopter, and spherical in shape.  Metallic silver best describes the color, with flashes of reddish-silver as the object caught the bright sunlight.  The object appeared to be hovering, slightly bobbing back, forth, up and down, as if it was a gigantic weightless balloon, tethered to the ground, accosted by the wind. But the movements seemed different &ndash; as if they were defying gravity.  Up, then sideways, then quickly backward.  I&rsquo;ve never seen any aircraft move that way.  Then, suddenly, the object shot upward and was nearly out of view within a few seconds.  I could still see the shining sunlight reflecting off of the object at its new altitude.  Suddenly, I was able to see a smaller, white object orbiting the object, which eventually shot off into the distance.  The object then ascended to an even higher altitude. I sat down in my car, and rapidly opened my window.  The object was still visible.  I pulled out my phone and called my mother.  As she answered, I told her that I was seeing my first U.F.O. &ndash; and being a scientist, I wanted to rule out natural phenomena.  I mentioned the helicopter idea, but we both shot that down.  I mentioned an airplane &ndash; not likely.  A balloon?  It rose too quickly.  We couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. Then, as if on cue, a helicopter appeared from behind the hospital.  It passed through the general area where I had originally seen the unidentified object.  This was clearly a helicopter, it was smaller than the object, I could see the red and white paint, and I could make out the unmistakable sounds of the rotors.  It was a perfect controlled comparison. Next, I was able to see a passenger airplane pass in the distance.  The shape, size, and sound were unmistakable.  Another perfect controlled comparison. The object was still visible, a mere pinprick of bright light, moving slowly back and forth in the high atmosphere, reflecting sunlight every few seconds.  Suddenly, the object faded from view.  A few seconds later, I viewed a jet approaching the area where the object had been.  I could easily see the wings and shape of the aircraft, although I couldn&rsquo;t make out the exact type.  The jet proceeded on its course then it disappeared on the horizon. I waited a few more minutes, and the object appeared again.  Only for a few seconds, it quickly enlarged in size and then shrank off into the distance and disappeared for good.  It was 16:22 when I last saw the object. I have no explanation for the events of this afternoon, although I can definitely say that the object was not a conventional aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I remember leaving work and proceeding north through south Aberdeen, and had to stop at a red light before proceeding over the Chehalis river bridge. To my surprise, a long convoy of military vehicles was headed south over the bridge, pulling trailers, some covered with tarp, others obviously diesel generators, along with one truck pulling a piece of heavy equipment (bulldozer). I just thought there were military exercises taking place somewhere and thought nothing more about it. Later that day, I heard local radio, reporting that a cylindrical shaped object was seen over interstate 5 near or at Olympia WA, and that the craft was headed West. This craft was witnessed by hundreds if not thousands of people already. The craft was now reported by eye witness accounts to have been following State Route 12 West towards the coast. The craft was witnessed flying low, not very fast, and was on fire, but emitted no smoke and made no noise The craft was under some sort of control, as witnesses reported that it followed the highway, making turns to correct course.  It had flown over sparsely populated areas, and was later seen flying &quot;along highway 12&quot;, through the vicinity of Central Park, a outlying area East of Aberdeen, and again witnessed by hundreds, (motorists and residents of Central Park). Before the craft entered the city of Aberdeen itself, it took a fairly large turn to the left, flying over Junction City, across the town of Cosmopolis, and was now headed South West towards Westport WA.  Witnesses reported the craft to have followed the Westport highway to the point of the Elk River bridge where it turned abruptly to the left, flying directly over the bridge and followed the Elk River South East where one witness reported it crashing with a white flash on the visi! ble hori zon.  The area of the crash is forest land accessible only by logging roads.  No explanation was given as to what it was by any Government agency.  Residents in the vicinity of the crash site reported that the military cordoned off the area and installed road blocks into the area denying any entry. Reports by residents, (rumors) that some of the teenage boys took dirt bikes out and rode as close as they could,&rdquo;after already trying the roads and having been sent away by armed soldiers&rdquo;, and hiking through the timber, where they reported seeing tree tops broke. They reported seeing a roughly 70 foot long cylindrical craft, lit by flood lights, with men moving about the craft in protective clothing, &ldquo;obviously what the diesel generators were used for&rdquo;. About 10 years later, while working another job, I had the opportunity to speak personally with one resident who lived in the area of the site, who was a fellow co-worker of mine. He told me, &ldquo;one of those teenage boys on the dirt bikes was his&rdquo;, and that many days after the event, &ldquo;government sedans had stopped at many of the residents homes to ask what they had seen, and to not continue to spread rumors&rdquo;. He also said that some residents had been &ldquo;threatened to shut up or else&rdquo;. This was big news for about a week in the area, but died out just like the rest. I recall my co-worker telling me that they flew the craft out, wrapped in canvas tarp towards the ocean slung under a sky crane helicopter. Weeks later, after many calls to the local authorities, the local radio reported that the government reported  that it had been a small airplane that crashed. Nothing more was ever reported, but to this day I believe what I saw (the convoy), and what the neighbors in the area saw to be true. I truly believe, if this was not a crash of a then new cruise missile, to be a craft from another place, and another Roswell, but due to the time and place, receive much less publicity. This incident happened in the evening, while I was working, my shift ending at 07:00AM, so the m! ilitary response was pretty rapid since the heavy equipment was assembled and in the area in less than 9 hours, as witnesses in Central Park were calling in reports to authorities around 22:00 hrs. Fort Lewis WA is less than 2 hrs from Aberdeen, and probably less than 3.5 hrs from the actual crash site. No other aircraft were reported in the air visually, with the stricken craft. All witnesses reported seeing flames emanating from the craft and they also reported that it made no engine noises, or any noise at all. If it was a cruise missile it would have been emitting sound.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Strange Red lights over Myrtle BeachI saw a round reddish object 5-10 times brighter than Mars 15-25 degrees above the horizon over the ocean. It faded out over a five second period. Within 30 seconds  I saw the same object several miles or degrees to the North. It also slowly faded out. I searched the sky for minutes looking for moving clouds or other circumstances which would have caused the fading lights. After about 3 minutes I had one last sighting, this time two lights right next to one another. They also faded out in 5 seconds.", "Object which looked like a lighted jellyfish pulsating around a star below and to the right of Cassiopea.This is an amendment to my sighting description earlier today.  The &quot;star&quot; and the jellyfish-like shape pulsating with lights was to the lower left, not lower right of the comet Holmes. Sorry, I was thinking comet was to the right and typed right instead of left.", "Multiple Silver Orbs over Canton Township, MichiganI returned from a day of driving and stood in the yard by my truck to have a smoke. The late afternoon sky was clear. I noticed this bright silver orb at a very high altitude (about the height of a cumulus cloud). And then another. And then another, until there were 7-8 of them. They were tiny, like pinheads and flew randomly, quickly. They would appear and disappear from sight. Before they would disappear, they would turn dull, then dark (aImost black). They would reappear suddenly. There movement was very similar to a swarm of fruitflie:, in close proximity to each other, very random, in all directions.  I thought perhaps they were floaters in my eyes, but when I closed them, I didn&apos;t see anything; when I followed the objects, they didn&apos;t move in my field of vision like floaters would. They&apos;d stay where I focussed or followed their movement. I said &quot;Wow! Look at this!,&quot; to alert my co-driver, but I couldn&apos;t get him to see where I indicated, before they all faded and disappeared. &quot;You seeing UFOs?,&quot; he said sarcastically.  Then a single silver orb appeared in the east and flew west, which he did see. It was a bit larger (maybe lower) than the others. This one crossed the sky like an aircraft would, but he agreed it looked strange and not like a plane at all. It moved too slow for a plane at that altitude. It had an aura around it and left a slight trail.  It kept going in a straight line until we lost sight of it due to the sun.  We see planes all the time (we are not far from Detroit Metro Airport), but this one was not in a regular flight path, moved too slow and didn&apos;t look like plane.  I am a college grad in my early 50&apos;s, my co-driver is an army veteran in his mid 40&apos;s.", "eight bird shaped objects flying in a figure eight patternI was standing in my mothers yard and I had a feeling to look up. And high above me, altitude unknown, were eight craft shaped like birds (no wings flapping) flying in a figure eight pattern, and after a minute or so they would break from the pattern in a single file and form another figure eight pattern. There was no noise no near collision. I was really dumb founded. I remember I kept thinking those aren&apos;t birds and that was to dangerous for air acrobatics. I watched until my eyes hurt and then sometime they just disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

She called me outside and by that time the neighbor was outside and we all watched the unusual activity up in the sky by that time there were 4 lights and then at times there would be 3 making the shape of a triangle in the sky, then finally only one remain and i saw the trace when it drifted off for a flash of a second until it went away.Then Suddently we saw an aircraft surrounding the area where the activity was untill all the lights dissapear and the air craft drifted off((NUFORC Note:  We believe the source of the report implies an evening sighting.  We have changed the time above, in order to reflect that fact.  PD))", "We saw a dark round fast moving object engulfed by fire/plasma that vanishedAs we were checking out stars and constellations, we witnessed a round dark object streaking across the night sky at a very high rate of speed. It was visible only because of the fireball/plasma that fully engulfed it, and it&apos;s lines were not vague, but distinct. In the front (foward section based on direction of travel), the plasma was sparse, heavier on the sides, and formed a tail in the rear that was approx. 50% of the size of the object itself. The object was travelling south to north (approx.). As the object entered our field of vision, it disappeared completely without changing any direction or speed. The sky was not clear, but contained light, sparse cloud cover that I believe helped us to see it better. Altitude is unknown, but it was either under/in the clouds, or very bright/ burning through from above the clouds.", "2 Objects with Extreme Flashing Lights Moving Diagonally Witnessed By TwoMy daughter and I were on the back deck at 9:50pm on the evening of November 11, 2007. It was a dark evening with no moonlight.  We were talking and an auto siren from somewhere in the distance went off.  My daughter asked what the sound was and I turned.  When I did, I immediately saw 2 extremely fast flashing objects in the sky.  The flashing lights on the objects were nothing like I had seen before on any airplane.  The primary light was white but there was also a red light.  We both were shocked as we never had seen anything like that.As we watched the objects, at first they were close together and seemed stationary and then started to move.  One object seemed to move diagonally very quickly and then to the northwest passing over our home.  The other went in to opposite direction and disappeared.My daughter ran into the house to get a camera.  The object was lower in altitude and when it passed over the house, I tried to get a good look.  It seemed to not make any noise at all.  It looked to be sphere shaped.  The lights were now not flashing as fast, but there was a pattern of white, red, and green lights that continued to flash.My daughter couldn&apos;t find the camera so she came running back out and tried to get a picture with a cell phone camera, which didn&apos;t work.When we were over the shock, we kept looking into the sky and realized that we counted over 6 airplanes in different courses.  They were very recognizable as we could recognize the airplane lights.  We live near the Atlanta airport and apparently there was numerous planes flying at the time, even though I&rsquo;ve never seen that many at one time where I live.  However, the 2 objects we witnessed were not like these airplanes.  The lights were very different.  The only way I can describe the quickness of the lights is that it was like Christmas Tree Flashing lights turned up to the highest speed.  Extremely Fast Flashing.  Then when the one did a diagonal zig zag, we both almost panicked.Neither my daughter nor I have ever experienced anything &quot;paranormal&quot;.  She is a college student and mother herself.  I am a 38 year old Real Estate Professional.  We have a family of 5 and live a quite simple life.Since that night, I&rsquo;ve been out each evening trying to see something similar, however I just see airplanes.  This is just reinforcing that the 2 objects we saw, were not airplanes.", "4 DOTS OF LIGHT AROUND MOON  MID MORNING TODAYSTANDING OUTSIDE MY WORK THIS MORNING @ 0945 I WAS LOOKING EAST AT THE MOON AND I NOTICED 4 STARLIKE LIGHTS IN THE SKY BORDERING AROUND THE MOON.  AT FIRST MYSELF AND ONE OF THE OFFICE LADIES DISCUSSED STARS, ECT. UNTIL ONE WENT OUT AND THE OTHERS APPEARED TO BE MOVING.  I WENT IN THE BLDG AND GOT MY BOSS AND HAD HIM COME OUT AND SEE FOR HIMSELF.  HE SAW THE THREE AND WATCHED THEM WITH ME FOR 10 MINUTES EASY.  THE LIGHTS WERE VERY STEADY AND THEY EVEN CROSSED AND PASSED EACH OTHER A FEW TIMES.  THEY SEEMED TO TRIANGULATE AND THEN PASS SLOWLY.  JUST DOTS OF LIGHT.  NOT STARS, NOR SATELLITES, AND DEFINATELY NOT PLANES.  I CALLED MY WIFE AT HOME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN AND SHE SAW THEM ALSO.  AT 1015 I HAD TO GO BACK INSIDE TO WORK AND WHEN I RETURNED AT 1025, THEY WERE GONE.  AT ARMS LENGTH THEY WERE IN A GROUPING 3&quot; BY 2&quot; AND WERE JUST BRIGHT DOTS.

It was more than the usual touch and go&apos;S that occured everday. I attended Niceville High School , located not far from the base. My father picked me up from my sisters house and as we were driving off the base heading to our home in Fort Walton Beach we saw a saucer shaped object that was traveling at a high rate of speed just over the tree tops. It was being followed by two F-4s ..also traveling at a high rate of speed and also very low. As the saucer went across the road it seemed to dissappear as it went over the tree tops on the other side of the highway. At this point the F-4s then climbed back up to a higher altitude. This is my first public mentioning of this..because of the attitude towards people who observe such phenomena.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This object fell in between 2 aircraft that were traveling in opposite directions, it fell at a high rate of speed. This object did not have a tail like a shooting star. I am sure that the pilots of the 2 aircraft must have seen this object!  A for the description of the observer. I was just getting home from work and as I got out of my car I just happened to look up and catch a glimpse of this thing. I have never reported a ufo before....", "very bright greenish blue light the size of a large star moving slowly  NW to SE and back again gaining altitude for 1/2 hour at 3:30I first noticed a bright greenish blue light high in the northwest sky moving very slowly in a southeast direction. I thought at first it was a helicopter but after a time I realized it was much too high for any helicopter to be flying. After nearly 10 minutes of travelling three quarters of the way across the sky it suddenly stopped. It remained stationary for a minute or two and then headed back the way it came toward the northwest. I assumed it was gaining in altitude as it did so because by the time it reached the northwest position where I first noticed it it was barely perceptable. I stood in the middle of the street and  watched it for aproximately 1/2 hour before it was too high in the sky to see.", "Pulsating light dissappeared glided across sky, descended, dissappeared, reappearedMy girlfriend sent me a late SMS at roughly 1:30 am on the 13th of November, waking me up. I looked outside my bedroom window and noticed an odd blood red colored light gliding across the sky very smoothly.  At first glance I thought it was a typical aircraft however, it was pulsating from dim to bright very slowly and irregularly. I gave close attention to it as it began to slow down.  It eventually went out of my line of sight and so I got out of bed and ran outside in the dark. The object came to crawling stop. After 1 minute of me having seen the object initially, it had covered 90 degrees of the entire horizon, which meant that it was either ridiculously quick, or that it was ridiculously close.  However, the first thing I noticed when I went outside was that there was no noise at all. This object was completely silent. It stood still in the sky for approximately 3 or so minutes. It looked much like a radio tower beacon at this point as it was not moving, and its blood red illumination continued to dim and brighten randomly. At this point I was considering waking my parents up, or running and getting the camera, or even jumping in my car to chase it, but I was frozen. I am now kicking myself for not having got the camera.  At this point I was also coming to terms with the possibility that I was probably the witness of a UFO sighting.  On closer inspection I noticed that the object was in fact made up 3 distinct lights, forming a triangle. The object eventually began to descend very gently and then vanished entirely.  I waited for another 10 minutes before seeing the object again gliding low to the ground behind some trees in the way before my view was obstructed by bush.", "Bright white light and then 2 blinking red lights in Western SkyAt approximate 8:15 p.m. I went outside to see if I could see Mars, Venus and Saturn as I had seen early in the morning.  The night was especially clear&hellip;you could see thousands of stars and even what I believed were probably galaxies.I did not see the planets I was looking for, but I watched one particularly bright star (I thought) in the western sky.  It appeared far away.  The light continuously kind of jerked a bit (unlike the other stars).  As I watched it, I noticed that it moved down and to the right, then left, and then back into its original position (making a triangle).  It took apx. 5 minutes to complete the path of the triangle.  I watched for about 20 minutes and it continued to repeat the path during the entire time.I then saw a shooting star fairly close to the bright object.  I did not see it burn out but it dropped below the horizon still very bright.  I went inside, found my cell phone to call my sister who lives approx. 20 minutes to the northeast of me to see if she could see the object and then returned outside.Before I called my sister, I looked to the where the bright object had been, but it was now gone.  To the right of where that light had been I noticed 2 blinking red lights (much closer).  One was below and farther to the right of the other.  I assumed they were airplanes &hellip; but while watching those, the lower light immediately moved straight up to be on the same level as the other one (still to the right of it), taking only about 1 second.  It remained there for probably 5 seconds and then dropped back immediately into its original place.  This happened probably 4 times in the span of 3-4 minutes.  They both seemed to be moving slightly to the right during this time but not very far.  Then both lights suddenly disappeared.Unfortunately, by the time I got my sister on the phone the red lights had already disappeared so I could not have her confirm it.  She lives in the city and the sky wasn&rsquo;t nearly as clear where she lives.  We couldn&rsquo;t find any other unusual occurrences.  I cannot explain what the bright light and blinking red lights were, but their movements were very unusual.  It&rsquo;s suppose to remain very clear for the next several days here so I&rsquo;m looking forward to viewing the sky tonight.", "The strage starAt Midnight I noticed a unusual star shaped object moving side to side changing it&apos;s  shape as well as it&apos;s color.I woke up my wife and daughter,they witnessed this  object with me for over an hour. The craft has returhed on and off for the last couple of months.While watching it I noticed vapor around the ufo,as it sits still ,it appears to be a star,as it moves it flies unlike any aircraft. It swithes directions faster than the naked eye making no noise and knowing when its being watched.It doesn&apos;t bother any of us, be sometimes it gives you the creeps to know we are not alone.", "Large Orbs of Light over Keller/Southlake on 10/19/2007On 10/19/2007 my husband, and I were sitting on the back patio at our home when to the east of us I first noticed what appeared to be a very large meteorite entering the atmosphere, (from west to east) it had a very long, wide tail behind it.  This lasted 5 seconds or so before it disappeared.Our daughter had joined us on the patio and about 20 minutes later I noticed in the approximate same spot in the sky as I had seen the meteorite 3 very bright large lights just stationary in the sky, in a shape of an arch.  One on top, one below it but slight out to the right and then a 3rd beneath it, and slightly into the left.  Suddenly a 4th light appeared parallel to the second but much farther to the left of the others.  Then a 5th appeared, and then the 1st one disappeared and then reappeared.The lights were not fading in or fading out they just appeared.  There were stationary the entire time.My husband went in to get his camera and took a picture of three of the lights, but the shutter speed was not correct and the picture did not come out very good.  Our daughter grabbed her digital camera and came back out with the video feature turned on.  She captured a few seconds of it, but unfortunately handed me the camera and I not realizing she had it on video tape, held it down to my side, when she told me she was videotaping and I got it back up facing the direction the lights were in they had all disappeared.The lights were over the Keller/Southlake direction looking toward the airport.  There were several plans visible in the sky, and these lights were 100&apos;s of times larger than planes. We snaped a picture of a plane that was in the sky, slightly further away and to the south east of us, the difference in size is incredible.We watched the news last night and this morning thinking that several people would have reported seeing this, but have heard nothing.I would expect that pilots flying in and out of DFW would have reported this sight to the Tower.I looked at the picture my husband took today and was surprised at what I saw.  I was expecting to see three blurry blots of light, but instead all three look like a child had scribbled in the night sky using lights. The video my daughter took clearly shows two of the lights or orbs.((NUFORC Note:  No time for the sighting indicated by witness.  PD))", "Fast bright object over Independence, MOMy daughter, Maria and I went outside my house last night at 8:23 PM and noticed a bright white fast-moving object came into view at about 45 degrees up from the horizon and moved swiftly across the sky from West to NNE. It was the brightness of Sirius or maybe brighter, and the size of half of an eraser head at arm&apos;s length - close to the size of Venus.  I could not tell what the distance from earth was, but it was high up at the altitude I would expect to see a satellite at. The object changed trajectory at 80 degrees to a more NE direction.  It was at that point that I said maybe it was not a satellite - it then faded slowly and moved UP and it was gone at about 110 degrees or so.  The entire sighting lasted maybe 20 seconds. We both came away with the idea that it did not look like a satellite or a plane, and by going up and away, this would indicate something else.", "Big white light, then smaller red lights seen in the eastern sky that should not have been there and then vanished.Was seen first as a bright white light as big around as an ink pen app. 300 yds away in the eastern sky at 20:15. Elevation was at a 40 to 45 degree angle. Height was about what one would expect of a low fling small aircraft. The skys were clear until 22:15. We observed the light not moving for app. 5 minutes. My fellow security guard and I were on patrol and lost sight of the light behind a large two story house before going on with our patrol. After doing an outer perimter check, which took about 5 to 7 minutes, we reached a place we should have been able to see the light again and it was gone.At app. 21:20 I dropped my partner off at the security office and drove the same route to see if I could see the light again. The white light was not to be seen, but I seen three red lights perfectly diagonal and spaced in the same general location. I observed the lights for a minute or two trying to think if there was any towers or  buildings in that direction tall enough for these unblinking red lights. The answer is No. I started my patrol of the south part of the proprty and returned to security office at 21:30. Upon returning to security office I spotted 2 red lights directly in front of security and pointed them out to my partner. When asked if he had ever seen them there before he said no.These lights seemed to be about a mile or mile and a half futher east, hard to tell. They too were unblinking and unmoving. The red lights I saw before and these were smaller than the white light we had seen earlier. They were also slightly lower in the sky than the white light we had seen ealier. Also the spaceing was like the middle red light, when I saw three red lights, was missing. A third security gaurd came in at 21:45 and we pointed the lihgts out to him. At 21:50 I crossed the road in front of security station to get the lights from security and cars going down the road behind me to get a clearer look. I wanted to see if these lights were connected, because if they were this thing would have had to have been a hundred yards wide, very big.From security one can see radio towers blinking red but there was a different look about hese lights and they never blinked on and off. While trying to get a closer a look a friend of mine called me on my cell phone. I told him to go outside and see if he could see what I was seeing. He could not and before he might see anything the 2 lights went out as if someone had turned the switch off.Just a metion here that when my partner came in that night he had a 12 sec. phone video of a simlar white light seen from his house in Springdale Ar at 4:30am the night before that he showed me when he first came to work that night. I also saw the white light the night before when I was leaveing work at 22:00 but did not take time to see. if it was a helocopter or plane. He still has it. There were planes in the area, very close, and they should have seen what ever this was plainly. I will try to get more info from local airports and radio stations to see if anyone else saw this and exactly where and how big this might have been. I called one local police station, newspaper,tv station that night to se if anyone else had seen this. Never heard back from tv or newspaper. Police said they had not reieved any reports of strange lights.", "(Same as other 10/23/07 overland park kansas sighting of triangular craft) triangular craft with several dim orange lights arranged sporadically on bottom moved silently and briskly south at approximately 1:00 am NOTE:  I have seen the B-2 stealth bomber on several occasions at night and daytime and this craft moved and looked nothing like it save perhaps the shape.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was less than half a mile from my house, coming up towards my turn off when I saw something in the sky that looked like a low airplane coming in on final approach at an airport, that&apos;s how low it was. It had to be no more than a few hundred feet in the air. I turned off at my usual turn, and I could see this thing was low so I pulled over at a clearing where there weren&apos;t any trees around, parked, and got out. This thing, from what I could tell from the lights, was shaped like a triangle. There were two lights on the bottom of it at the front, one at the back at the point of the triangle, and then a blinking red light about 3/4 of the way back on it. I was looking up thinking it was an airplane or a helicopter (when I was pulling over and getting out), but there was something wrong. This thing slowly passed literally right over me, but there was not a single sound coming from it. It was almost like it was just slowly seamlessly gliding through the air. From as low as this thing was, there should have been the sounds of an engine or something if it was a helicopter or a plane. And it sure wasn&apos;t coming in for a landing because the nearest airport was about 5 miles SW of where I was and this thing was traveling N-NE. I watched it until I had just gotten past me and then I jumped back into my car and turned around because I wanted another look at this thing. I got back onto the road I had just turned off of, but this thing was nowhere to be found. I looked all over in the sky in the direction it was going in as well as all around in every direction and there was nothing. No white lights, no red blinking light, nothing. Just the moon and stars. I drove for a little bit longer trying to find it again but couldn&apos;t find a single sign of it.

Sighting approx. 3 minutes; return path 1 1/2 hr. laterOn Monday, 17 Sept, 2007, myself, my husband, and two of our out of state {W. VA} friends were at our pond on our property in Southwest Virginia, bordering Hawkins County, TN. We had fished for a couple of hours, then built a fire, had some supper, and eventually gathered the lawn chairs around the fire and played music. The other three were all picking various acoustic instruments, while I sat back listening, watching the sky occasionally, and enjoying the music for an hour or so. I stretched out, and just looked over my left shoulder while flexing my neck muscles. A bright yellow orange light caught my eye, coming from the north over Clinch Mt., and moving in an easterly direction. I immediately sat up, turning toward it. It was stationary at first, then moved forward slowly, hovered, and then moved back again to its original position. I knew then it was not a plane. I grabbed my husbands knee, as he was picking a banjo, and pointed to the object. He looked and stopped playing immediately after watching for just a couple of seconds. He then told our friends, who were sitting with their backs to the object, to &quot;stop now, and get a look at this&quot;. It was that quickly apparent that this was out of the ordinary. The time was approximately 23:15, on a clear night, no clouds, and no background lights, as we live in the country. We watched this light go in a controlled yet occasionally erratic pattern for about three minutes. At one point, it went from a 1 or 2 o&apos;clock position, to a 7 o&apos;clock position, then back. It would hover, then go forward slowly, deliberately, and had occasional almost jerking movements back to its previous hovering point, then jumping ahead slightly, and then moving smoothly. I had a Nikon D50 with me, and a Hitachi digital dvd camera. Neither of them would work. They both had fully charged Li ion batteries. [I had both of these present, and fully charged, to record some of our annual get-together music]. I was very surprised about my digital SLR, as I quickly changed settings, wondering why it would not work, as I had taken several shots previous to this sighting. I tried to just fire the flash of the camera, to see if there would be a reaction of some sort from the object. The flash would not fire. I was torn between trying to figure this out, knowing I&apos;d be missing part of what this object was doing. I tried the the video cam...nothing. It would not record. I put them both down, deciding to just watch, while mentally cursing the manufacturers of what I thought was fairly good digital equipment. By this time, the object was halfway between Clinch Mt. and Pine Ridge. We continued watching its movement, fairly slow, deliberate, with occasional moments of hovering, until it could no longer be seen over Pine Ridge. No blinking lights were seen by three witnesses. The fourth thought he might have seen a blinking red light, but not at all times. There was absolutely no sound. The estimated time of sighting is three minutes. I knew something extraordinary had been seen, and we were all fascinated, not really knowing what to think, except that it was definitely not a plane or helicopter. About 1 1/2 hours later, we were still around the campfire, still playing music. I was listenening, still watching the sky occasionally. The approximate time was 00:45. What I believe to be the same object came around again, this time from the south, traveling north. Easy to see, and still absolutely no sound, and definitely no blinking lights. Same bright yellow orange color. The movement this time was just as slow, though not as erratic. Short periods of hovering were observed intermittently, then a continuation of a fairly straight path. This second pass took about two to two and one half minutes to cover the area, where it disappeared over Clinch Mountain. We all agreed that this was the same object seen earlier. After this, we called it a night and came home. While the event occurred, it seemed to me personally that I was seeing it, yet at the same time not really believing that this was something I could not explain. Just remarkable; I really can not find the perfect word. Totally amazing falls a bit short. For informational purposes, about 5 minutes later, I picked up the Nikon to see if I could take a shot; it worked perfectly, still showing a full battery charge.", "Dark area in sky over Liberty, MissouriAbout Jan. 15, 2007 at 22:30 I was taking my dog out for last time before bed. I was looking at the stars as it was a cold clear night. I noticed an area of stars that were disappearing then coming back. Something was blocking them out. If you held out your arm full length and had your index finger and thumb about two inches apart that would be about the size of the area. I watched it moving slow for about two minutes then the area got a white area about the size of a nickel. It was very bright and all white. It started to move faster and looked as if it was ascending .The light started moving to the right and getting smaller. Then it was gone. The object the whole time was moving from north to south but when it lit up it moved slightly to the east before it disappeared. I thought it might have been a satellite with a north to south orbit. After thinking about it the area was to large for a satellite. There was no sound with this event.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The top three rows of windows and the bottom three rows of windows were square  and seemed to be windows, which were emanating an unearthly white glow. There were also two rows of circular shaped windows in the middle of the ship from my point of reference that emanated the same white glow.There were also two red lights one was located towards the top, and the other was located towards the bottom. These red lights pulsed on and off every couple of seconds. There were also many white lights that were around the edge of the craft. The lights had the same glow as the windows.The ship was located 50 to 100 feet above the tree line and was moving around 40 miles per hour.

I was coming home&mdash;pulling in the driveway-- (I live on a 40-acre farm) and immediately noticed a very bright orange-haze glow in the eastern sky&mdash;when I first noticed the object it was hovering (barely moving) and it was glowing. I noticed it immediately because of the size of the fireball/light and because it was much lower in the sky than any other celestial objects. I watched closely because it APPEARED to be moving, and sure enough, it was moving. The sky was very clear and the stars were very bright and beautiful on this morning. I am a college professor, and I was 100 percent sober. I was so taken back by the object that I woke my sleeping mother out of bed so she could also witness the object with me. I&rsquo;m 37 years old and am always very cognizant of my surroundings, and I have NEVER in my life seen anything like this. I watched the object for approximately 1.5 hours (until about 5:00 a.m.). The object would hover for about 5 minutes at a time (sometimes more) and then it would disappear by ascending at a tremendous amount of speed. It would then reappear in a few minutes and repeat the same pattern. You could witness a zigzag hovering pattern&mdash;it changed directions very abruptly and almost zigzagged while hovering but we also witnessed (what appeared to be) either rotation of the air craft OR lights that were spinning (like a giant search light)&mdash;we could see the light going back and forth. The object we watched was orange in color and very bright&mdash;like a ball of light. Towards the very end of the sighting, we saw another object that was very different in shape with multi-colored lights (including red). The object was completely different in shape---not round but more like the shape and light configuration of a traffic light looks like. It did not look like an airplane because the rate of speed at which this 2nd object was traveling was incredible. It almost appeared as if the 2nd object ! was look ing for&mdash;or chasing the 1st object. Eventually, the orange glow ball object disappeared (as if it was being chased away). I was facing east toward Rochester and the 1st object disappeared into the south-eastern sky. The multi-colored object moved in from the north-eastern sky and disappeared in the north-eastern sky. When I first got home, I observed the object from outdoors. I did not hear any noises associated with this object. It was not a helicopter and it was DEFINITELY NOT an airplane. As the object appeared to be getting closer, I ran indoors because I was scared!

I looked to see if there was a fire going on and as i turned around i heard and saw a woosh and a circular dark spot moving across the field.  I went to see what it was and the bottom was circular but the top was triangular.  As it went southeast towards the ocean and disappeared the lights came back on.

There were, back then in 1967,  no houses, roads, or buildings--nothing at all.  We lived, literally, on the very edge of town.I had just gotten into bed at about 11:00 PM and had definitely not fallen asleep. (I have examined this fact a number of times to counter the argument that I was dreaming. I am sure, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I was wide awake.)  A faint, intermittent noise began, similar to the sound of a rain bird spraying water, and I can remember thinking, &quot;Why is the neighbor watering his lawn at this hour?&quot; The noise slowly began to get louder, as if it was approaching, and, in fact, it was, and began assuming a more electronic character as it did so.  By this time, I began feeling afraid.The noise became quite loud, and suddenly, in front of my window, wreathed in green light, appeared a figure in silhouette, moving back and forth in my window as if trying to look in at me. While the window had a sheer curtain covering part of the view, it did not obscure the bright green aura, or the box-like protuberance around the ears of the being.  It wavered back and forth in front of my window for a minute or so, and then moved away down the path behind my house.  As it did so, the electronic sound diminished as well, eventually fading completely. By this point, I had the covers over my head, and was shaking in fear. I did not jump up to tell my parents who were sitting in the living room in the front of the house, as one would normally do, and have never understood why.I can honestly say I have never been so frightened in my life. What happened was, of course, completely unexpected, and there fore carried an element of shock as well.  It was not a prank by friends (to stand as high in the window on the path behind my room, one would have to be 7 ft. tall) nor was it a dream. I have replayed the incident many times over in my mind since that time--and each time must conclude, after looking at all other rational explanations, that I saw the outline, silhouetted in green light, of a being not from this world.There are other elements to this story from other members of my family, and neighbors as well.

After arriving at restaurant my wife preceded inside with my youngest son. I could not take my eyes off the objects along with my oldest son do to the fact they had not seemed to move for a good amount of time. I first thought they were balloons tied together, but a commericial aircraft (DC9 I think) actually flew between the ground and the objects at about 6:40 P.M. This gave a great visual reference to the actual size and altitude of the objects in question.As the aircraft had passed the objects actually changed from a vertical position to a horizontal position and stayed approximately the same distance away from each other.

After about 2 to 3 minutes the object ascended in altitude and then you could no longer make them out do to darkness and altitude of the objects.

It was late at night and i had just left a truck stop where i had a cup of coffee.About 100 yards off the road to my left there was what appeared to be an accident where someone had rolled over out in the field. There was what appeared to be emergency vehicles there with what looked like a floodlight on the vehicle.  I didn&apos;t stop because there was no need to with what seemed to be emergency vehicles attending. Actually the whole scene seemed surreal.As i continued down the two lane highway, I remember listening to Art Bell on coast to coast radio and there was a show on that was sort of a take off on that 1948 radio show with Orson Welles and &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;. I remember that on the show, there were alien spacecraft landing around the United States. I remember being momentarily sort of alarmed as i was listening to the broadcast.A couple of minutes later, I noticed a light ahead of me shining down on the road and coming towards me.  I assumed that the light was from a medivac helicopter going to the rollover accident to evacuate injured people.As the light shining down on the road approached and flew over my vehicle I noticed that there was no noise coming from the object which was at a very low altitude (i&apos;d guess no more than 100 ft or so).  I remember how strange it was that a helicopter could be flying that low and make no noticeable noise.  I remember looking in my rear view mirror and saying to myself, what the &quot;F&quot; was that thing.Basically,  I forgot about the whole incident until a couple of years ago when I was talking to my son about UFO&apos;s while we were having dinner at an Applebee&apos;s Restaurant.

Also, that area where the jet was flying around is not an authorized training point for fighter jets, so All I can think is that this object was picked up on radar and a jet was sent to go check it out.", "Loud piercing sonar metal like disturbance at 4am in freehold,NJ December 31,2007It was december 31,2007 when i heard a loud metal almost sonar like disturbance outside.

I had gotten off work at 17:00 and was headed to a family gym close to my home in Fair Oaks, CA. It was getting dark quickly and I could barely see the sun disappearing on the horizon in the west. I was traveling west on Fair Oaks Blvd which is the main street where my gym is located. I could see in the distance that there were unusual bright lights in the sky just a little to the left of my view.The lights appeared to be anywhere between 1500-2000 feet in the sky. The most notable features were that the lights were really bright and the object was motionless. Now I was thinking to myself, this could be helicopter hovering with its search light, but then I realized there was no cone affect or motion of a search light. I&rsquo;ve seen those enough to not be fooled. This wasn&rsquo;t a star because this really bright light was too close for observation, but too far to actually see a true form of the object. It wasn&rsquo;t the moon because the moon is usually in the east and the really bright lights were too small to mistake for the moon.As I approached my gym I thought to myself to park as soon as possible and jump out and get a look at this sighting and to see if anyone else had seen it. At about 200 yards from the parking lot I took my last look at these really bright lights. The lights in the sky are still motionless and still not sure of the form of the object. I pulled into the parking lot and parked. I jumped out of my vehicle and looked up in the sky to see nothing. I looked west, south, east, and north. These lights were high enough that if they had moved in anyone direction I would be able to see for at least a half mile in any direction, but there was nothing, like there was never anything ever there at all. What could move that fast in 15-20 seconds? I&rsquo;m very puzzled.I didn&rsquo;t check any news reports or police reports because I&rsquo;m still not sure. It&rsquo;s bizarre because I&rsquo;ve seen planes and helicopters move in the night sky. I can guarantee that if indeed it was a plane or helicopter I would have easily had a chance to see it move from the area as I got out of my vehicle.", "Cigar shaped object hovering approximately 100 feet in 30 knot wind making no sounds.My fianc&eacute; and myself were driving down the road when we saw an object just hovering above the tree tops.We pulled over to a shopping center and watched this object for approximately ten minutes. It had two rows of lights on it, upper and a lower. The lights were going in different directions and would change colures. I estimated the length of it to be around 80 feet. And approximately 25 to 30 feet from top to bottom. I couldn&rsquo;t tell how deep it was due to seeing it only from the side. This craft was hovering in a 30 to 35 knot wind making no sound. It was barely over the tree tops next to a four lane highway. At the time it was near dusk dark and all you could make out were the shape and colored lights.Amazingly enough no one else even acted like they saw it. I wanted to go underneath it to see more of it, but my fianc&eacute; would not have any part of that.After observing this craft for ten minutes from approximately 200 yards until it slowly few off to the SW.", "High-flying light that grew brighter, then dimmer, showing a blinking red light.At approximately 21:15 my wife and I were walking our dogs.  She looked up (looking for a meteor from the Geminids) and saw a light.  She pointed it out to me and, as we were watching this &quot;meteor&quot; move very slowly across the sky from North to Southeast, it suddenly glowed very brightly and then dimmed slowly.  As it continued to slowly dim, I could make out a blinking red light.  For this to have traveled that distance in that short of a time, high enough for us to not be able to identify it, leads me to believe that it was at an extremely high altitude.  The only blinking light that I could see was a red one, no green or white as an airplane would have.  Neither one of us could come up with any idea as to what this was since aircraft have the additional wing lights, meteors don&apos;t have blinking lights, and satellites generally are in stationary orbit or are in equatorial orbits.  I spent eight years in the Navy in communications and I&apos;ve never seen a satellite that had an orbit travelling in this manner.", "We saw two lights that went across 40 plus degrees of sky, while watching I got my telescope and tried to see them, which the two lights were flying together at this time.

You could see this light pass through the clouds, that&rsquo;s how powerful that light was. It was low in the horizon and just hovered in the sky. A couple minutes later a second bright yellow light appeared next to it about a football field length away. It wasn&rsquo;t as bright as the first and it too hovered in place. After about 5 minutes of staring at it, they began to alternate in brightness. One would get dim and the other brighter. I had never seen anything like this before. After about 5 minutes of that, one of the lights began to move away in a southwest direction. It was slow moving but as it passed overhead the light disappeared. While this was happening the other light remained hovering in place. After the 1st light dimmed out the second light followed in the same direction and passed closer to us where I could make out the shape of the object. It was diamond shaped and had bright yellow lights on each corner. It too dimmed out and vanished.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This bridge provides an excellent panoramic view of the sky, perfect for capturing images of clouds. I considered stopping at home first, to grab my Nikon D50, but I could tell I was testing my wife&rsquo;s patience as it was. To my everlasting regret, we proceeded with my cheap digital camera that I kept in my car. We got to the bridge and I walked out to the center of the bridge and took about 20 some pictures. The sky was partly cloudy (25% cloud cover?) but mostly blue sky. When I finished, I walked back to the other end of the bridge where my wife stood waiting. As I talked to her I noticed two grey spheres flying toward us from the East in tight formation, the one nearest us just above the other. They flew at a constant speed and trajectory from East to West. I was so excited I forgot that I had a camera in my hand. I kept asking if my wife could see them, but she could not. By the time I finally got my composure, the objects had begun to pass behind an apartment complex in front of us. Unfortunately the next mistake I made was to switch my camera to the movie setting, not realizing that the resolution is so poor it would not pick up the objects. I took a short video which is completely useless. I have seen many different aircraft in my 43 years on this planet, these objects defy conventional classification. They were not weather balloons, I have seen weather balloons. They were perfect spheres, metallic gray, but not too reflective. I figured that the reason my wife did not see then was the glare. Despite the partial cloud cover that day, it was actually a very bright day, and I had polarized prescription shades on. As the objects passed through the sky the seemed light gray, as they passed in front of clouds they seemed darker. They disappeared on the Eastern horizon. From the time I spotted them to the time they reached the Eastern horizon was less then a minute.", "Two mysterious silent lights flying along the shorline with very fast, precise, sporatic movements !!!!!!!!Around 10:30 pm last night it finally stopped raining for awhile. The sky started to clear and I was outside on my balcony facing the ocean. I looked up and noticed two lights parallel with each other approximately 1/2 a mile offshore and around 400 feet in the air. They were moving very slowly but in sequence with each other. The next second they crossed each others path very quickly and then resumed there slow pace. At that point I was stunned and amazed at what I was seeing. The sudden precise movements that they made were not of man made technology in my mind. These things were completely silent. If I wouldn&apos;t have looked up just at that moment, I would have never known they were there. The next second, the bottom one from what I can see just darted straight up to a higher elevation with that same precise movement as before. They continued at the slow speed together but further apart from each other. Then all of a sudden they both merged closer together very quickly. I just couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. Then one more time they both made a sporadic different maneuver but at the same time and then they just kind of vanished. There were still a lot of clouds in the sky and they may have been just  being covered by the clouds from my sight. It was like they were patrolling the shoreline together. But it was very very cool and I am so glad to get it off my chest. I haven&apos;t called anyone to report it cause I like my freedom (haha) and I know what I saw. I can honestly say there is no doubt in my mind that something else other than ourselves is out there.", "I was driving on the LIE with my daughter heading west.  The night was very clear.

Then all of a sudden it was gone but reappears about 3 seconds later further north.  This time I saw only 3 lights but it moved very fast to already be that much farther north in the sky.  Two guys in a truck in front of me pulled over and as I passed them I saw that they were both looking out of the windshield, meaning, their faces were right up against the window.

At first, it was wavy like it was not all there, as if it was materializing. I watched it for about 15min and it was somewhat fuzzy.I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I looked away and I did not see it anywhere else, so it had to be real. I always believed in UFOs, so I was so happy I was seeing one. I heard a noise behind me so I looked back it was just a squirrel. I looked back into the sky and it took me about 30 seconds to find it again. When I looked back up it was still blurry. About 2 min later, it looked solid, it was a perfect circle, and it was still white. I watched it for a while then my dog pulled me and I lost it in the sky.I searched the whole sky for along time, but I could not find it. I went back inside and told my mom about it.

They were very large--it looked as if it was fire moving up the foothills. As we watched these, they were climbing up into the foothills (not far off the ground) in a straight line. They started to move together into a circle--at this point, it was apparent they were not on the foothills, but in the sky just above the mountain line. After forming a tight circle, two disappeared while the other 3 formed a triangle and started to climb much higher into the sky. The two bottom ones disappeared about halfway into the sky (I would say 15,000-20,000 feet) while the top one climbed to at least 40,000 feet and then disappeared.

The railroad runs directly behind my house. We sat down to take a quick break I looked at some constellations, I began looking for Orion. We got up and lit up a cigarette and started walking along the tracks back toward our neighborhood. We saw a bright off white light just above the street lights running alongside the tracks. We both said it was probably a street light or a star but it was too big. We kept walking and talking about the day we had only taken a few steps when we both looked up and saw it had moved so we watched it and it kept moving towards the left and up at a sharp angle. It slowed down to a stop then turned completely around 180 degrees on a perfect axis.It started heading back right then it slowly turned towards us and began to pick up a little speed. It slowly went over our heads and to our right shoulder when we stopped and began watching it. There was not a sound no dogs were barking and the object gave no sound. It was very low to the ground and we saw reddish white lights that blinked very slowly. This is when we saw the outline of the object it was long but thin it appeared to have a point at the tip with the brightest light on it. it flared out to either side with much smaller red lights. It had three lights (one on each side and one on the tip) and was kind of smooth looking. It gave off no noise if it was a helicopter or a plane we would have been able to hear the sound of the engines because it was so low to the ground. We began to get very nervous and started walking very quickly trying not to trip and fall. We walked for approximately 15-20 seconds when we looked over our shoulder at it. It had moved a good ways away and we felt like we had to watch it, like something made us want to see it. We watched it go into some clouds that had just formed as it moved away from us. it had been a relatively clear day with low amounts of clouds and those clouds were very thin. It appeared to hover and it was gone. It didn&rsquo;t fade away as if it was flying away it just disappeared.

I was out walking my dog and I saw a very low flying object around 8- 8:30 PM.  It was over a corn field near Old Collinsville Road.  The object came towards me and I panicked and ran home.  Then I went back out and from a distance observed the object.  I don&apos;t see how this could be an airplane. The object would go very low, then zoom high.  I am not 100% sure of the shape, although it had 2 white headlights in front and a red flashing light on the side.  I think it might have been triangle shaped. I think it was gray or silver, but it was dark outside.  I thought it was a plane at first, but planes can&apos;t zoom up and down.  About 30 minutes later I noticed lot&apos;s of other planes in sky and around 9:15 I noticed another object flying low.  I am fairly sure it was a helicopter (sounded like one) and I think it was looking for the UFO.  Two of the other planes were flying close together and I think they were also looking for / following the object.  The helicopter flew around the area for at least 30 - 40 minutes and kept back tracking.  The object I saw made no noise. You might be interested to know that the Travel Channel did a special called UFO in Illinios and it was specifically about a UFO in this area back in January of 2000 or 2001.

The temperature was about 36 degrees, perhaps two degrees above the dew point. My wife and I were in our spa.  It is situated where two legs of our house (an &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape) join such that we have a clear view towards the north and east.  Some trees block a horizon view to the east, and the house blocks the view to the southwest.  There is considerable ambient light. At 2112 (PST) I noticed two lights moving from the northeast to the southwest.  They were moving parallel to each other, being apart about the same distance as two of the stars in the Big Dipper handle, and half as bright as Mars.  [I think it was Mars I was seeing in the northeast sky.]  I said to my wife, &ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo;  They passed right over the top of us, just after which my wife located them.  When they disappeared two seconds later, she said, &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;  They moved fast and in straight lines.  About seven seconds elapsed between the times I first saw them above the trees until they disappeared behind my roof.  All I could see were lights, and the lights never varied until they were almost gone.  No noise was heard, although the damned low-speed spa pump was on at the time. It was too late to see satellites.  Had they been aircraft they would most certainly have been heard (a sonic boom, no doubt).  Since the light was either generated by the objects or reflected, in my mind the only &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; explanation is they were birds.  However&hellip;  These two &ldquo;birds&rdquo; had to be low (considering their speed) and expert fliers (to perfectly maintain their wide spacing).  They must have had bright underbodies to reflect the light.  City light varies, hence reflection varies, but their brightness didn&rsquo;t vary.  I sense they weren&rsquo;t that low, hence the perception of significant speed.", "Dim, low orbit, high detail, backyard satellite shaped object, hazed by distance.Well this object was really high up, like in orbit....bear with me.

Basically it looked like a backyard satellite dish, but it was so far away it had that blue haze on it, like viewing a mountain, or high altitude airplane from a distance. The sun was starting to set, but the sky was still lit fairly well. 3 other people saw it, but everyone just assumed it was a satellite. Now i might be wrong but this didnt look like your traditional NASA satellite with the solar arays and what not, and even if it was it would of had to been in a super low orbit, and ginourmous for us to of seen the detail that we saw.

The 3 lights were &quot;joined&quot; by 2 very thin, black lines.I asked my brother if he saw anything up in the sky, without showing him and he described what I saw.I then went over to my 21 y/o niece, and without describing to her what I saw, asked her. She described the same  lights.The 3 lights were due south of San Quentin Prison, and possibly directly high over San Francisco.It wasn&apos;t possible to estimate the distance - but they were, as best I could tell (I triangulated with a tree branch) motionless over the city (or at least in that direction).There was an air show down in South Bay that day and 2 military jets did do a low pass over us before we saw the 3 lights.We saw the 3 lights for 30 to 45 minutes and then as my brother and I were watching, they &quot;seemed&quot; to flit up and disappear.They left no vapor trails Their light was almost lazer-like, dazzling and just a pinpoint with some slight &quot;flaring&quot;.I am also a pilot and can state that it wasn&apos;t a satellite, a plane, a balloon or blimp.About a year later, I ran into my sister-in-law&apos;s brother - and - he recounted that he, from the South Bay, was working on his house on the weekend and also had seen a series of, what he proceeded to describe, as the same type of lights and about the same time of the year.

I was cutting behind the building to get to the aparment complex next door.  I rolled down the window to hear a motor and it was completely silent.  That was when i got scared.  The car almost stalled.  At that point I panicked and prayed to God that we not get taken up as I have heard that happens to people.  I checked my clock to make sure no time would had been lost.  I took my adult friend and her 2 children home (in the complex) and then raced back home.  When I got home I went to my backyard and could see it in a distance moving toward UOP.

I looked up into the sky and toward the west I noticed the contrails of three aircraft in a formation and could identify that they were military aircraft probably Airforce Fighters. the sound was rather loud and figures they were accelerating possibly using afterburners.  To the south of the aircraft I noticed a round shaped rather larger object. The three aircraft were making a turn to the west. The round object seemed to be reflecting the sunlight coming out of the east. The larger round shaped craft then dissapeared from sight.  I grew up in Southern California near Edwards Air Force Base and was familiar with the sound of military aircraft and fighter jets.  My father worked for NASA at Dryden Flight Research Center. There is not much aircraft noise is this area and thought it odd that there was a group of Fighters in the area.  The larger round object seemed to fade as it turned slightly and dissapear from sight.  Jet aircraft contrails were still visible for a short time and were curved as the aircraft were making a high G force turn.  The Profile of the Jets seemed to disapear but the jet sound reduced in intensity possibly to moving away from the area, changing course or reducing throttle.

It was your classic disk shape, light grey in color, with multi-colored lights I think that were roatating in a clockwise fashion. It was hovering not more than 20 feet from us yet it did have some movement in trying to stay in place but ever so slightly. I don&apos;t recall any heat coming off the object. I did hear a buzzing sound. The dimensions weren&apos;t very large maybe big enough to fit 4 humans comfortably inside. At a certain point I recall a small panel on the inferior-anterior edge of the saucer slide open and some sort of camera like cone shaped obect come out and pointed it at us, almost like it was observing our actions. My Dad said to stay put and keep an eye on it while he went into the house to telephone some friends.  Ater a few seconds of finding myself alone with this floating disk I got scared and ran into the house. When we came back out the disk was gone and I was very disappointed. I don&apos;t exactly know the exact time and Month when this occured but I born in 1964 and I was six at the time so the year was 1970.

It was a very calm and peaceful shade of florescent blue or soft powder blue lightTo whom it may concern,  On approximately June, 1994 at 21:00 hours a girlfriend and I were at a Carnival in North Bergen, NJ. There was a crowd of people there but no one seemed to catch a glimpse of what my girlfriend and I saw that night. She tapped me on the shoulder and said &ldquo;What is that!&rdquo; I looked up to where she was pointing and there was a disk shaped object out in space.  It was a very calm and peaceful shade of florescent blue or a very soft powder blue light. It was a very clear night and I know definitively the unidentified object was out in space and not a hoax. It hovered there for about 20 seconds and as soon as I tapped my husband&rsquo;s shoulder and asked him to look up at the sky, from the time it took me to tap him on the shoulder and the time he looked up which was only about a split second, the saucer left in a flash and instantly disappeared into space. My guess it was traveling the speed of light to disappear that quickly. I would say about 0 to light speed in approximately &frac12; of a second. I thought to myself how lucky I was to have seen it because most people have to go through life wondering if UFOs and life on other planets exists. Now I know the answer and I consider myself privileged to know.

It was still quite dark (sunrise that day was at 7:50 a.m.), but it was the first dry morning in some time.  The view at this point in my daily commute is one of the best views I get.  I can see west to the foothills, east to Mt. Hood, and north to Mt. St. Helens on an ultra-clear, summer morning. But on this dark winter morning, I was happy to be able to see the city lights so brightly.  These lights reflecting up at the flat thin clouds gave them a rosy glow. I would estimate the level of the clouds to be about 600&rsquo;-plus. I base this on the elevation of the road at this point, (topographic map on-line gave elevations between 450&rsquo; and 500&rsquo;) plus about 100-150 ft. of clear skies above me.  The road behind me was clear of cars, so I topped the rise at about 35-40 mph and let the car coast. I immediately notice, just a bit east and above my line-of-sight, four distinct sets of lights grouped in a small amount of airspace, and note that the rest of the skyline is empty. This immediately makes me think &ldquo;news copters&rdquo;, and something must be going on near the I-205, which I will cross over in a couple more minutes down the road. My initial number of four includes a small airplane, furthest on the right, (quickly apparent by motion and lights flashing, gradually moves south out of my view), then two stationary pairs of lights in the middle, and finally, a helicopter, furthest on the left. The helicopter is easily identified by its motion and the main light (plus red and green flashing lights as I get closer).  My assumption is now, &ldquo;Three News Helicopters&rdquo; and my thought regarding the two stationary, level &ldquo;helicopters&rdquo; is, &ldquo;Damn, those two guys are GOOD.&rdquo;  It looked like the helicopter on the left was arcing around, or towards, the two others, at about the same altitude as they were. The movements of the helicopter emphasized to me how dead-set the other two were by comparison. The only distinguishing thing about the stationary lights was that they were round, white lights, set as a pair, side by side. The two objects were level with each other the entire time, and seemed to maintain the same distance from each other. I can only guesstimate: 50-75 yards?  I could perceive no shape behind the lights. The road drops down gently but steadily, so even with coasting, I had a clear view of the skyline for a maximum of 9-10 seconds before trees blocked the view.  For the next couple of minutes I really didn&rsquo;t think of it specifically, knowing that I would see the I-205 up ahead, and maybe figure out what was going on.  By the time I actually came to the overpass and dipped down over the freeway, I was more concerned with something happening on the ground rather than in the sky.  There weren&rsquo;t any bright lights apparent, but as I came up the hill to the Stop Sign at 65th and Sagert, I did look up into the sky again, knowing I could linger just a bit, since there still weren&rsquo;t any cars coming up behind me. I really craned my head forward to look up as high as I could, and amazingly, I could make out a hazy pair of lights. But just as I really focused on it, the lights seemed to dim out, and the clouds obscured them completely. So now my thought was, &ldquo;S#*%!, What timing,&hellip; just in time to NOT see it!&rdquo;  But, just a few seconds later, as I was making my left turn onto Sagert, I figured I&rsquo;d be able to see the other pair of lights if I looked back over by left shoulder, which I was absolutely right about.  I could just make out the other pair of lights, and once again, just as I focused on it, the lights dimmed out quickly and clouds almost instantly obscured them. Right about now, I think, was when I sensed that things had changed.  As if the first one disappearing into the clouds wasn&rsquo;t just bad timing after all. And I would have easily let the first one go, if seen only that once.  But seeing the same scenario, repeated just a few seconds later, in a completely different direction, was hard to write off so easily. It now felt purposeful. I told two people at work that day, and my husband later that night.  I felt compelled to share my experience, but also compelled to make a diligent effort to eliminate obvious explanations. Since this is my normal work route, it was easy to return during daylight hours and take photos of the surrounding area. I parked and took photos from the intersection looking in all directions. I then drove behind the medical buildings and power substation and took more photos toward the intersection.  I could find nothing in the vicinity that is the right shape of light fixture, and/or tall enough to be seen from the initial distance of almost two miles. I also came back with my husband when it was dark enough to distinguish whether there are any other permanent lights in that particular view from the top of the road. There were none we could see. I would have reported this sooner, but the only person whose opinion I would be interested in hearing on this subject, happened to be on vacation until Monday. He quickly recommended this site as the best place to report what I saw. My background includes no special skills or training, but I&rsquo;ve always been a sky-watcher. I pay attention and take note.  That&rsquo;s my skill. Now, what I really want to know is: What did the helicopter and/or airplane pilot see? They were much closer than I was. I look forward to your call.", "December 10th object seen in Richmond, VirginiaHello, I also saw the December 10th object in the sky over Chesterfield county outside Richmond, VA.  It was very high, looked almost like a comet it had a wide tail, it also had a white speck at what would seem the front. Although you think it would head in the direction the tail shows, it moved against itself. I also got my girlfriend (20) my friend (23) and his dad (55) to come look at it. I continued by myself to further view it with my binoculars thats when i realized it was traveling strange. It moved in directions it shouldn&apos;t have, I&apos;ve seen some things in the sky but this was by far the strangest, man-made or not.

I have detect a ufo in the ground and it has been here a very long time. I have found only (1) thing that is evidence that the ufo was there. Over time what I found was that one ufo was only one of a number of them. because the metal is detect in complete shape I have to say that the metal was a alloy that was like ours  becouse any other metal would be found in pieces not complete like what was found.  I do not know why I found it but I did. becouse it is complete it is like a blueprint and you can tell how it would work . It being the large one is so large you would think that it would hold a lot of there poeple, but when you look at the print , you see that only the core of it would hold life. the outer part it like ballast tank, this allows it to go to the bottom of water. It has in the core (7) riser that lets it rise without vacum damage it. This design shows that they use all of nature to do things. What I see of there design, If they have it they use it. In march 0f 06 I saw one that was flying . It was only a cicle of light very bright&lt; but looking at it this llght must be very cold to be this bright. becuase they donot have anything that donot use , why have the light. We donot think that they need light to see so WHY HAVE IT. I now know more about ufo,s then I need to know. but am having the same problem that most people have that has see them, Is it because we are unwilling to say that they were here and still here, I donot know but I am happly  to know that I have the luck to studies them, there is a lot to know but I understand you are not going to read it all.

If someone can tell me what it is I&apos;d be grateful. In the 70&apos;s I had lived in a house in the St George section of Staten Island. It was a lovely old place, on a bluff overlooking New York Harbor. I moved from there in 1975 and the house, along with the rest of the block, was torn down in the late &apos;70&apos;s.On my birthday in 1997 I went by myself on a sort of pilgrimage to the site. The block had been turned into a parking lot and by 1997 the lot was not even being used. It was mid afternoon, sunny, I was sitting on a log on the site just looking out over the harbor. I saw a commercial jet coming up the harbor to my right and to my left I caught sight of a flock of seagulls. AND right behind the seagulls was a metallic cylinder, I&apos;d say about 10 feet long and maybe a foot round? ( I&apos;m not sure how to describe the measurements). If I had to guess it was moving at about 100 MPH. The sun was gleaming off the metallic surface. It was moving in a straight line at a steady speed going from Bayonne towards Brooklyn. I just watched it, fascinated. It flew UNDER the commercial jet so it could not have been too high up. Commercial Jets going up the Hudson are in their final descent to LaGuardia, so the jet couldn&apos;t have been more than 3000 feet up? And this cylinder thing flew under it. I watched the cylinder continue a on a steady path until it disappeared in the distance as it was heading toward Coney Island.I saw what I think was a UFO 30 years earlier and hadn&apos;t seen anything else before this happened, or since for that matter. The thing looked so everyday, so matter of fact that at first I didn&apos;t realize it was anything unusual.I&apos;ve told a few people about it over the years, but I&apos;ve always wondered what did I see?...If anyone has seen this thing or knows what it is I&apos;d love to find out...For whatever it&apos;s worth I just noticed the boxes the boxes about being contacted by an investigator. I have no problem with that, however I don&apos;t think I can add anything more than what I&apos;ve just written. Thanks", "On Sept 16/2006 silent silver sphere passed horizontally overhead slowly, seemed to avoid viewing by rapidly ascending into cloud coverTo the best of my recollections, as I cannot find my copy of the original report this occurred about 2 pm in Bramalea, Ontario on Friday September 15 2007 and I was sitting outside in my friend&rsquo;s backyard. That it is near Pearson Int. Airport is surprising to me. The sighting lasted a good 5-6 minutes. When I first saw the object, it was hard to grasp what I was seeing. My second thought was maybe it was some kind of perfectly round and silver coloured balloon, but it could not have been; both by its configuration and its motion. There were 2 lines running horizontally in the mid section as if of windows but of the same silver metallic material. Its look and behaviour suggested intelligence and purpose. It moved silently. When it first caught my eye it was travelling horizontally slowly at approximately 500 to 1000 feet. It was hard to judge height accurately as it was a bright clear sky and there were only thin wispy patches of clouds at around 10,000 feet. As the object passed out of sight over the roof line I moved to continue viewing this phenomenon. As I moved, the object started a rapid right turn; as if to block my view with other roofs, so I moved further. Each time I moved it seemed to attempt avoiding my gaze. Finally I had a full view of the sky at that height. It then suddenly went straight up and within 4-5 seconds had hit the cloud layer and disappeared from view.  As for size I can only guess that it was about the size of a dump truck. Weeks later I noted that a near earth encounter of an asteroid occurred on Sept. 16, and I wonder if this had anything to do with this vehicle being there at that time; perhaps to view the close fly-by. I don&rsquo;t know. It has remained a profound event to me and I am sure it was either not from our time or not from our planet.   Respectfully, Mike M.", "2 disk like objects above treeline, extremely bright, turned and shot straight up and out of sightDriving east on Hwy. 82, just west of Waycross, Ga., first object was south of road.  Observed bright lights just above treeline.  Watched it turn and move south. Disappeared below treeline, 30 seconds later it was moving north, gaining altitude, stopped, and shot straight up, disappearing from sight. Second object was on north side of the road, again just above treeline, was visible between trees for about 1 minute. When view cleared past trees, it was gone. It appeared as if light from the ground was reflecting off bottom. But that area is very wooded, no known lights in that area. Goldish yellow in color. Approximately 300 feet across and two stories high. Lights across the back end when it turned.", "7:00 pm Dec. 10 2007  I am weather forecaster meteorologist with two decades plus of experience observing. I work for a radio station in northern Vermont and what I saw I will describe--it not that big a deal really. There is a comet forgotten the name to lazy to look it up but a comet or fuzz ball like or bigger than the 7 sisters that I saw in the eastern sky. This fuzz ball was moving over so slowly but in odd directions to the rotation of the earth not making any sense. A friend of mine alerted me to it and said hey go outside and check out the comet. I did and went out several times only to find that it had moved to odd positions and in weird trajectories that a comet would not normally follow. My only conclusion is that it was man made perhaps a urinal dump that caught the sunlight similar to when you can the ISS or other satellites at night but then why would it move into the different positions over the course of the next hour and half. It is the erratic nature of the movement. The sighting  took place this evening in mostly clear skies with good clarity on a cold winter night with temperatures in the 20s.((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.

There were so many plane contrails in the sky, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. There were six of them that looked to be evenly spaced apart.  I have been going outside on break here for the last 8 years and have never seen the uniform pattern I saw today. There were actually at least ten to twelve contrails all over the sky.I looked up in the sky above our building and to the west and I saw an object in the sky just sitting there. As I was staring at it all of a sudden to the left appeared another one and it was moving from west to east.  It passed right in front of the 1st object. They could have almost collided. It was moving at a steady pace. It was not moving too fast. It was not that high in the sky.I guess if I had to compare it to my building. My building is about 18 to 20 feet high. I was looking at an angle and it was probably 2 &frac12; to 3 times my building in height in the sky and 100 to 150 yards away maybe. I got a good look at it. It was oval shaped, it looked to be silver. I watched it go about several hundred yards and then fade out. It disappeared. I looked back to see the other one, but it was gone.It was really cool to see. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. This is not my first sighting of a UFO, but it was definitely the most awesome to see. I started to laugh because it happened right in my plain view of sight. I didn&rsquo;t have to squint or guess at what I was seeing.  I immediately called my wife and then my father after.I see planes fly over all day going to Austin Bergstrom. 737&rsquo;s, 747&rsquo;s, cargo plane&rsquo;s, jet&rsquo;s, Cesena&rsquo;s and helicopter&rsquo;s every once in awhile. These objects were silver looking, oval and had no wings. They made no sound. Without a doubt there are objects in our skies that defy physics as we know it. They were over a neighborhood of homes.", "Group of 4 Orange Objects land near hills just west of small town of Maricopa Arizona... Oct, 1975Objects first appeared as bright orange lights like flares dropped from parachutes in formation.  We knew they weren&apos;t flares when two objects on opposite sides of the formation simultaneously rose several hundred feet above the other two center objects.  The strangeness continued when the intense orange light disappeared from each and was replaced by three white circular lights in a triangle. They seemed to emit smoke but it was likely from super heating of the air around the lights in the cool night. The objects drifted out into the flats and landed about 1/4 mile away right in the backyard of a local ranch house in the desert lighting up the whole place. My girlfriend started running into the desert at the objects but we caught her and all walked to a better vantage point(a few weeks or months after our sighting T.Walton ran up on one too - bad idea).  We watched the objects on the ground and one of them kept going up and down, six - ten feet into the air.  Reminded me of the dance of the bees... The objects were smaller than the house, perhaps 20 feet in diameter.  The lights went dark after a time and we never saw them leave.  About a week or two later one of the witnesses and myself walked up around the hill where the objects were first seen and found a mutilated steer that had not been touched by coyotes or buzzards which were very numerous in the area.  At the time we had never heard of cattle mutilations and did not seriously connect the two events. We were never able to approach the ranch house to ask what the hell went on that night as they had very big dog that chased us away whenever we ventured too near.", "amazing pictures in the sky of a 100% ufo what else could it be? i believe i believe i believeI was laying in bed, and as  i turned i spotted something bright in the sky at 02:30 there abouts.I got out of bed looked closer through the window to see an object in the sky it was bright and in a static position, it remand there for a few hours i eventually fell back to sleep, but i couldn&apos;t help but to keep getting up to see if it was there, and it was every time ! i fell back to sleep about 04:45.I was amazed at what i thought i may be witnessing i took a picture of it on my phone, and again with my phone zoomed in.

I am a Wedding Disc Jockey and the father of the bride (who is also a friend) asked me to check to see when the Buffet was to be served, I left the music playing and went out the side exit of the tent to ask the servers when dinner was going to be served and as I came around the corner of the tent the servers were looking at the sky and asking me what is that? Now at this point I am upset because they should be working not looking at the sky and as I looked up I see a silver object floating between 500 and 1000 feet in the sky over Avila Bay!  This caught me by suprise and I viewed the object for at least 7 minutes. The weather was clear and it was a beautiful day (no Fog!), the object was floating in the air and at times would move in very small circles.. there was not any noise or lights, this object had no windows and was not spinning! This UFO was near Diablo Canyon Power Plant and I expected to hear jet&apos;s as I believe this to be a no fly zone (I did not hear any!). I did not stay out side to see the object depart and the photographer for the wedding was busy doing a slide show and I could not ask him to take photos!

We were walking on Roxiticus Golf Course and we were on the highest hill on the golf course. The hill was about 100 ft higher in elevation than most other parts of the golf course. We decided to sit down and catch our breaths. While half way down the hill, I looked above a partially developed hill called Brookrace and saw three whitish-red lights that were over the hill. It appeared to be a bent radio tower because they were not directly above and below each other, but in a curve shape above Brookrace. I said to my dad, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that&rdquo;? He said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s no radio tower or anything up there, right&rdquo;? After two minutes of observing them, the one that was placed in the middle, vertically, started to move to the right and closer to the hill. It now appeared to be about 300 ft above the top of the hill. The hill in which Brookrace is on is about 450 ft above the surrounding land. The other two lights started to drift to the right in up, down, circular, and diagonal motions. It appeared to us tat they could move in any direction that they wished and also come to a complete stop at any time. One minute later, the UFO that is more to the right and about 300 ft above the hill, corkscrewed down in a spiraling motion to about 150 ft above the top of the hill. About 20 seconds later the highest UFO dimmed its light and started moving left of the other two UFO&rsquo;s. Again it was moving in odd, non-pattern like motions. Very soon after the same UFO appeared to turn on lights that went horizontally down the side of the craft. The colors of the lights were green, white and, red. The craft was about &frac12; of a mile away from us in the air. We could clearly see the description of it. It looked like we were seeing the side of a triangular prism. At no time did they change shape. Soon after the first craft moved away form the others, the most left UFO out of the two that were still above Brookrace started! to foll ow the other, it appeared to follow the same or a similar flight path. The third UFO stayed in the same area that we first saw it in but was doing amazingly odd movements such as zooming up and down. The top of Brookrace, as a crow flies, is about &frac14; of a mile away from our position. We would have gone home to get a video camera if we knew how long they would be there, except our house was about &frac12; of a mile away. While the one UFO was still over Brookrace, the other two UFO&rsquo;s were now directly behind us (if the starting position is directly in front of us.) The two behind us seemed to be about &frac12; of a mile higher in the sky than when they started. Than, about 8 minutes after first discovering them, another UFO started slowly coming over the hill in which Brookrace is situated on. This one as well as the other UFO that was there from the start headed towards the other two UFO&rsquo;s behind us. They also put their side lights on and as well as all of the other UFO&rsquo;s dimmed their lights before going into major (fly mode). For the entire time that we were watching the UFO&rsquo;s, about 500 geese that were on the lake below Brookrace, were making loud distress calls as if something were hurting them. Over a period of about 20 minutes 3 more UFO&rsquo;s came from over the hill and followed the same flight plan. Behind us, the 7 UFO&rsquo;s were forming a formation that seemed to be like a sideways &ldquo;T&rdquo; shape.               This is the formation that they made about &frac34; of a mile up in the sky  directly behind us. The formation consisted of 7 UFO&rsquo;s. This may sound odd because most UFO sightings consist of 1 UFO, but we saw what we saw. Thirty seconds later, another UFO started coming towards the formation. It looked like this UFO was coming from over the nearby town of Chester, NJ. This was flying at a reasonable rate of speed (about 40-50 mph). The other UFO&rsquo;s seemed to be going about 20-30 mph considering the amount of land that was passed in a certain amount of time. Thirty seconds later, it eventually joined the formation. &ldquo;Wow, this is amazing&rdquo; my dad said as we walked home in disbelief. As we looked up into the sky, we saw what appeared to be a shooting star, but the beam of light kept going and going, it must have been one of the UFO&rsquo;s blasting off. As we walked home we saw the most amazing part of our night. While walking we glanced over at the lake where the geese had been making distress calls. We saw a UFO hovering about 80 ft above the lake in a kind of wobbling motion. It appeared to have an internal light and a triangular shape to it. It also appeared to be about 30-35 ft long. When my dad saw this, he shined his large spotlight that we had brought with us on it (it was about 600 ft away from us, the light did nothing to help us see it) as soon as he did that we felt a large vibration through our bodies. then we left and thought about it the rest of the night.", "Three glowing discs above Las Vegas New years.I was looking to the north east as the vegas strip firworks were starting. I am in the south west area of las vegas. I looked to the south and saw two orange glowing discs. I was very perplexed. The discs sometimes appeared to be two discs then they changed into one disc each. Then a third came into view. They were heading southwest towards the L.A. area. I watched these glowing discs and knew they were not firworks, airplanes or helicopters. I continued to watch as they faded from view. All this was going on while the fireworks were going on the strip. The discs had what appeared to be a glowing orange field around them each. They were not very bright but I could see general shape and outline. I know others had to see what I was seeing.", "Mass sighting of spaceship.My brother a mutual friend and I were out to meet a bunch of fellow high schooler in the summer of eighty-eight. The place was called &quot;the sherrifs posse&quot; out in the county.

We knida pulled over and got out screaming at each other to remember what ot looks like. Some other cars pulled over and a few people came out of a couple of the houses. It looked like it eventually floated over looked as if it landed.We continued on to the meeting place to find chaos. Bout 30-40 folks freaking out and girls crying.The next day all I heard about it was that a Russian satelite had fallen.", "Cigar shaped object with bright light zigzagging above Winder Georgia.It was dark outside and we saw a cigar shaped object in the sky, It had a light as if a flashlight and that was shinning, that was the only light on the object.  It had zigzagged through the air for about 2-3 minutes than it look as if it had stopped but the light kept getting dimmer and dimmer as if it was going up.  It had looked like the lights were changing colors from white to yellow.  At first we thought it was a plane but it was going way to slow, and about 4 planes had passed it, and it was to high up.

This morning one of the mangers came out of his corner office overlooking LAX and told me to &quot;come here, quick&quot;. He pointed towards the sky and I could see a small black dot against the clouds. He said I just saw this thing come from about 20 feet over the runway at LAX and ascend to where it is now at about 1000 feet. He said when it was over the runway it was about the size of a large truck because it could be seen in the context of the objects on the ground.. He had binoculars, and when I looked through them I could see what looked like a metalic object that was moving slightly, but hovering at around 1000 feet. It looked like a metal tube at one point, but then appeared to change orientation and at that point it looked like a disk shape with lights around the perimiter. The lights appeared to flash. Then the objust appeared to rotate and lights were shooting out from the midline of the object where they had been in a rotational pattern before. The object hovered there for about 20 minutes, staying just below the cloud level before we lost sight of it. We got pictures and will have those tomorrow. Note: this is the second time we have seen this, but first time we didn&apos;t have binoculars. Three of us saw it and saw the same thing. This is no joke or b.s.

This is the report that MUFON processed. Summary:  Witness called me to relate her UFO sighting of December 16th at around 8:15 PM. She says she was looking out her window which faced a field behind her house. There is around an acre of land between her and the tree line where the object was seen. She states that she saw an object just above the tree line. It was like a triangle standing with the point facing up. She first thought it looked like a pyramid but it was only three sided. In the center of the object was a white light. The object looked all white. She does not know if this was due the center light or if the object was really white. On the three corners were red and green flashing lights. She says this object moved very slowly and began to rise up higher as it went out of view heading from the East going to the Northwest. It made no noise. The object was in sight for about five minutes. She said that the object was about the size of your thumb at arms length which would have made this object very large. The County sheriff&apos;s Dept. was called and the local police. Nothing had been reported to them.Filed 12/18/04 Southern Ohio Section Director MUFON   Recreation (white out and marker on photo) by witness.Home | Abduction Reports | UFO((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of the report, MUFON/Ohio, for sharing the report with our Center!

My dogs started barking and there was something large in the yard.At approximately 22:15 on 12-26-2007, I was awakened by a strange motor sound and a light.  My family lives near a rural well traveled road, so I was confused by the sound but not really by the light. Sometimes car lights will shine through our windows.  The sound I heard was like nothing I had ever heard before except for maybe on a movie. I laid my head back down and then our dog, along with the neighbors dog, started barking frantically. This was a real shock, my dog normally does not bark. This was when my wife and I both were startled.  After about 10-15 minutes of the barking, I had enough and got out of bed.  I looked through the shade and saw something very large at the outer edge of my yard.  It had no lights, it was on the ground, and it made no noise.  It did not move. The moon was bright, but there were clouds in the sky. I did not have on my glasses, but there was something defiantly there. Approximate size was probably 30x25 ft. It seemed a lighter color on the outskirts and very dark in the middle.I was half asleep when all of this happened, I remember saying something to my wife about it then going back to bed. Then hours later I awoke realizing what had happened. I looked again and there was nothing there. I went to work that day thinking I imagined the whole thing until I got home that evening. That&rsquo;s when my wife made the comment about our dog barking and not sleeping well. I realized then that possibly there had been something there after all.On Thursday evening, the 27th at around 18:39, while my wife was cleaning up after supper  cooking supper, the dogs started barking again. I arrived back home after taking some trash to the dump. She explained to me about the dogs and I went outside on the back porch. At this time the dogs had stopped barking and I could not see anything.I am a skeptic, and I don&rsquo;t know what it was that night or the next.

I was reading on the balcony of my apt, located on the 3rd floor, which faces a wooded area. I noticed something bright out of the corner of my eye. To the right, above the tree line, I saw a large, round, very bright white object moving very quickly. It moved so quickly it gave off a tail of light. The object made no noise at all and moved in a straight horizontal line. It appeared to be no more than 10 to 20 feet above the tree line.

The object seemed to be traveling along the street, toward us, but moving very slowly and only flying about 200-300 ft off the ground above the street.  Originally 2 lights were in view, but as we got closer, I noticed that there were 3 lights on the bottom of the craft, in a triangle formation.  At this point I was literally yelling at my sister to confirm the object herself, and she seemed very concerned about it as well.  The object then passed directly over our vehicle while we were stopped at a light.  I stuck my head out the window to get a better look at the object, and to see if there were any sounds coming from the craft... there were none, which seemed very disturbing to me.  I asked my sister if she heard anything, such as helicopter rotors or an aircraft engine, and she said she did not.  As I looked straight up at the craft, I very clearly saw that it was triangular in shape, with a circular light at each tip, and an illuminated white line connecting each light.  There was also a square panel at the bottom of the craft that was glowing red, and a smaller yellow light next to that that was pulsing.  I have never seen anything like this before.  The craft moved so slowly that it is impossible to have stayed airborne if it were a plane, and absolutely no sound was heard coming from the craft at close proximity to indicate that it was some sort of helicopter. The object then continued east down the Blvd. until it was out of sight. This object must surely have been seen by many observers, and after seeing it, cars around us were driving erratically, passing each other on city streets illegally and driving very fast.", "2 chevron-shaped crafts over Clifton  ForgeI was lokking at the moon with my friend &amp; my telescope.I saw a blue object fly overhead.It (or different one) came back with red lights and i got out my binocularsand we both agreed it was a chevron-shaped alien craft.it was similar to the one seen by those crazy people who all commititted suicde with 5 dollars in quarters in their pockets.Soon after it passed over our heads,a meteor passed behind it.

It had a wide, bright white tail fanning out from from a point at the front of the &quot;fan&quot;. I looked at it through 2 sets of binoculars and a 90mm Retractor. Through all of these instruments it looked just like a comet in the sky with the exception of a random flashing blue light either at the forefront of the tail or somewhere inside of it. It moved though the sky very slowly but in only one direction.It dissipated after about 25-30 minutes.I thought perhaps it was the remnants of a trail from a rocket. I checked for a shuttle launch but one did not take place this evening.I believe it was some kind of smoke remnant but I simply cannot explain the intermittent blue light.

The time was between 18:10 and 18:40 .I was conscious of the time because I had to take my son to school for a function at 18:40. I looked up in the sky and saw what I first took to be a comet, but I did not think there were any comets around. I then decided that it was just a star and distortion from my glasses lenses was causing me to see a tail. Normally if an object is distorted by my lenses I can look dead on at an object and the distortion will clear. In this case however, no matter what direction I looked at the object, the tail remained. I was in a hurry and just decided that because this thing definitely had a tail I guess that I had missed the fact on the news that there was comet visible in the night sky. I then justified this decision by thinking that I remembered hearing on the radio about a comet. The object looked to me very similar Hale Bopp. I did not study it for more than a few minutes, knew it was out of place, then justified why and went about my business. It had enough impact on me to look for it again, when I went to unplug my Christmas lights, but I could not locate it. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast To Coast.

On Monday 10th December 2007 we went for a short walk at about 10.30pm, and noticed the lovely clear skies, and how bright the stars were and decided to use the binoculars we&rsquo;d borrowed to sit and watch them for a while.  (We live in a city, so can&rsquo;t see the stars very well at home)  We&rsquo;d just started passing them between us, when my husband exclaimed that one star was very bright and twinkling.  At the time I thought nothing of it, as it was a clear, cold, winter night, and stars can appear to shimmer in the atmosphere.  We were looking over the loch as the &lsquo;Little Bear&rsquo; constellation was becoming visible and rising over the hills.  There was no moon.  Weather was cold, clear and bright, no clouds in the sky.On looking through the binoculars, he could see a white glowing body of the object, with flashing red, green and blue/purple lights around the edge.  Of course, we both thought at first that it was a helicopter, civilian or military plane (especially as we were in a remote location, we thought it could be the RAF testing a new/unknown craft) or even a satellite, caught up in the atmosphere, as it seemed a long way away (the colours were only visible as twinkles with the naked eye, but clearly with the binoculars)  We sat passing the binoculars between us for some time, watching in puzzlement as the object moved quickly around the sky, but always in the same patch of sky (south west of the &lsquo;little bear&rsquo;  constellation)  Several times (at least 3) the bright object seemed to disappear into the distance, as it became so faint, it was only possible to see it if not looking directly at it (as with a faint star) the first time this happened we thought it was travelling away from us, and that was that.  But it came back into focus, clearer this time, and appeared larger (though still a white glow) there were absolutely no clouds in the sky at the time; all other objects in the sky were clear at all times.This first phase happened over about an hour.  Then, as the stars gradually moved around the sky, the object appeared to stop moving of its own accord, and drift in the same direction, at this point we were wondering if it had been a satellite we were watching.  But then, the object starting moving rapidly against the direction of the stars, and could be seen to be streaming white almost like a vapour trail and seemed arrow shaped (possibly due to travelling through earth&apos;s atmosphere), previous to this it had appeared oval/disc shaped it continued doing this for some time--it was reminiscent of when a kite is being flown and the flyer yanks the string to pull it in or out of the wind flow--it looked as though it was jetting out of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere to the other side.Eventually it stopped jetting in the opposite direction of the stars, as if it had got through the atmosphere and through the other side into outer space.  It appeared to be moving further into the distance, and now only glowed with a pulsing light, that changed from faint violet to greenish yellow in a clockwise motion, almost as though a beam of light was emanating from the object and changing colour as it did so.  The object then did not continue following the direction of the stars but remained in one position.  We continued watching for some time, and it remained, glowing in the sky.We first spotted the object at about 11.00 pm and finished watching at about 2am, as were very cold by that point.", "One seemingly star seemed to zoom away and dissapear within moments.While stargazing, I noticed two paticular stars, which seemed to be stationary for the past few minutes, until one suddenly sped away and disappeared.

PD))", "Early Morning Lights w/Methodical Flying SpeedHope I don&rsquo;t sound crazy, but I&rsquo;ve been looking online to see if anyone else saw this for 2 days now.  I was walking my dog and lights to my right caught my attention.  I cannot give them a true color as we know it&hellip;they were not white and not yellow.  They had a very &ldquo;warm&rdquo; hue, yet bright and steady.  There were no blinking lights like in aircraft I&rsquo;ve seen flying.  The shape was between a triangle &amp; horseshoe.  Not as sharp as a triangle yet more pointed than a horseshoe.  The area is very close to a military base so I am VERY used to aircraft, but what was most odd about this is that it was not the sound that caught my attention - but how inordinately low &amp; how methodically it was flying. There was an odd, methodical  steadiness of the lights and movement.  The other odd thing was once I noticed it, I could then hear a soft (almost muffled) sound. The closest description I can give is that it sounded more like a soft muffled whooshing than the engines of a plane, military plane or helicopter.  In hind-sight when I think of the soft whooshing sound &amp; lights I would almost describe the combination of the two as an &ldquo;energy&ldquo; of some kind. Needless to say I had a very conscious thought that if I didn&rsquo;t know better I&rsquo;d say that is a UFO&hellip;..but then low &amp; behold (almost as if it heard me) it literally hovered for just a second (no more than 2) right above this exceptionally large pine tree that stands out above the tree line and hung there in a complete stopped position.  As I started to move further out onto my drive to make sure I was REALLY seeing this &ldquo;plane&rdquo; just hovering, it lowered straight down.  No angle to the lowering, just a straight line down at the same methodic speed it had been flying.  Having asked a question or two (while trying not to make anyone think I&rsquo;m crazy) I have determined there is actually about a 30 acre field within &frac14; mile of where it appeared lower straight down.  I stood there for about 4 minutes waiting to see if it would come back up. I went back into the house I immediately told my boyfriend what I just experienced.   Another VERY important note is about 3-4 minutes after I came back into the house I heard an exceptionally LOUD boisterous military aircraft engine fly directly over my home.  I again ran outside to see what was going on &amp; though you could clearly hear the military plane (&amp; the house was vibrating from it) I could not readily see the aircraft.  Now this we&rsquo;re used to hearing regularly - NEVER so close above the house but it undoubtedly flew directly overhead.  Again in hind-sight I can&rsquo;t help but think it was following or looking for it.  One other important note I&lsquo;d like to make, it was not flying from or towards the military base&hellip;if I had to give it a direction it appeared to be flying towards the Hudson River.", "UFOs hovered in low-lying clouds near my apartment this December!

This object has not ascended but has rather remained in a hovering position at same eye level as a cruise ship that would be on the horizon leaving Port Canaveral.

It is nearer to the surface and to the shoreline than last reporting. The movement is more pronounced as hovering or observing than &quot;ascending into the sky&quot; with Earth&apos;s rotation...it is now 31 minutes into my observation and the object is clearly some sort of craft due to the smaller light on bottom left, and movement resembling that of a darting insect, not a star or planet.

Weather conditions were bright and clear with blue skies and some very patchy, high, thin, hazy and mostly transparent clouds. The clouds were not as high as cirrus clouds but they appeared quite high and were much higher than what one would call coastal haze.The brightness of the object caught my attention through the window as it was quite intense somewhat like a bright star at night or the landing lights on a plane at dusk.

The object was moving in a straight line from east to west very slowly. I could observe that it was traveling just beneath the high clouds as it would occasionally dip slightly into them. When I was viewing it through the some what dirty window I noticed that it would disappear and then reappear with the same intensity. I thought that perhaps it was becoming obscured by the clouds. However when seen from outside the house I could see that when it was not shining with a bluish light it would turn completely black as in pure black and not at all grayish as it might have been if there were some atmospheric interference. In it&rsquo;s black phase I got the impression that it was shaped somewhat like a very shallowly curved fingernail clipping with the con caved side down, the convex side up and pointed on the ends.I am not an aviation expert but I believe I could safely say that no conventional aircraft could fly that slowly except for an ultra light and I don&rsquo;t think that ultra lights fly at such high altitudes. There was an airliner flying above it and it&rsquo;s rate of movement across the sky was much faster than object in question even thought the air liner was at a much higher altitude. I considered that if it were an ultra light the top side of the wing might be made of a highly reflective material such as a blue tinted mylar while the bottom was either non reflective or simply not catching the light. In that case it would have had to be changing it&rsquo;s degree of tilt in relation to my point of observation in order to cause the on and off effect. However it&rsquo;s trajectory looked straight, slow and steady.When lighted it seemed to be emitting light just like a bright star but I wondered if it might not simply be reflecting the sun.As the object moved far into the west and eventually went out of sight it continued to appear as thought the light were emitted from it. Im not sure if anything could change it&rsquo;s position that much relative to my point of observation and still reflect the sun with the same intensity directly to my eyes. I have never seen anything like it and I&rsquo;ll be watching for other reports about it.Some brief info on me: 19 years employed at UPS as receiving counter clerk, 14 years teaching art and music in state prison as a contract teacher for arts in corrections.

We headed back to our house when I looked up in the northwestern sky and yelled &lsquo;what is that?!?!?&rsquo;   It reminded me of Comet Halle-Bopp, but was moving to fast for it to be a comet.  I ran for my binoculars as fast as I could.It first appeared very bright, even to the naked eye, then seemed to split at which time the cigar shape was very apparent.  It seemed to grow in length with a luminescent debris field on either side.  My boyfriend noticed that the object would blink every 3-5 minutes.    My first thought was &lsquo;space station accident&rsquo; but we were not scheduled for a fly-over that night.   We watched it until it dissipated, about 30 &ndash; 45 minutes in duration.I am an amateur astronomer and have seen many, many wonders in the night sky.

I was traveling in my car with my wife and daughter. The intensity of the light was that of the brightest star you&apos;ve ever seen. Probably 2 or 3 times that of Jupiter. As we continued traveling eastward the light remained the same for approximately 30 seconds. We then turned and traveled northward for approximately .25 mile. I then stopped the car and rolled the window down to more closely observe. It was then the object started traveling westward. The intensity of the light diminished to a faint light. It picked up speed as it traveled and went out of sight on the horizon in approximately 3 to 4 seconds. Things to note: There was no sound heard, there were no flashing lights like that of a normal flying aircraft, there was cloud cover with a ceiling of around 10,000 feet. No precipitation.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Flashing colors appeared to be spinningAt approx. 8:00 on Thursday night, i saw a light in the eastern sky.  It appeared just to be a bright star at first but started changing colors.  After about twenty minutes, i went back outside and saw the light still there but seemed to have moved southeast some.  I went inside and asked my roommate to come look along with his girlfriend.  They both saw it also.  The light seemed to be red on top with flashing of blue and green around it.  It seemed to be very distant but very bright.  Probably nothing but it also seemed to be spinning rapidly.  So much staring probably caused it to just appear that way.

In our area the night sky is really dark and occasionally you can see satellites.  I thought it would be really cool to show my daughter an orbiting satellite if I could locate one. I was standing in front of our house (which faces directly north) and I looked in a NNE direction in the sky and I witnessed a bright white light slowly heading in a NNW direction. I watched the light for about 45 seconds to a minute when my daughter started to ask me if we could hurry up and go. I didn&apos;t want to point it out to her becuase I thought she might get a little freaked out.  As I watched the light move across the sky it faded to orange and gradually got smaller until it completely faded into the night sky and was no longer visible. After about 2 minutes the light was completely gone. When I first noticed the light I almost thought it could have been a spotlight from a helicopter, but there was no sound and because of the mountains in the canyon we live in, my thoughts are the elevation of the light appeared to be much higher than a helicopter would normally fly. The light gradually disappeared kind of like when you turn a clear light bulb off and the filament is still hot and glows and as it cools of it goes completely out.", "Strange flashing lights in the sky in South East KentuckyOn Thursday Jan 04, 2008 a few friends and I noticed a strange light in the sky. This light was in the South East sky and we noticed it around 7:45 PM.  The light was very bright and seemed at first to be a plane or helicopter of some kind but we noticed it wasn&rsquo;t moving. If it was moving it was at such an altitude we could not tell. Like I said the light was very bright. The light was blinking red, blue, and white. From the blinking you could see what appeared to be a triangle of light creating itself every time it blinked. The light seemed to get brighter and blink in a pattern &ndash; we watched it for awhile (approx. 30 min) and then went inside.While watching the light moved back and forth in sudden motions approxiamtely 1/2 inch the sky.  Approx at 9:30 we went to see if the light were still visible in the sky it had moved more south and wasn&rsquo;t blinking as much. We at first thought this might be a plane or helicopter. We ruled that out as we could see other planes in the sky at what appeared to be the same altitude and they were moving much faster. We also thought it might be a tower of some sort since at first it was stationary. We ruled that out when we watched several planes fly across the path of the light and it moved. Our next thought was maybe it was some astronomical event so we researched the news, Google Earth&rsquo;s sky charts, and other astronomy databases. We didn&rsquo;t find anything remotely close to the area except for Sirius and the description did not match what we witnessed. We also checked the alignments of the planets and noticed the planets were in a straight line on Google Earth - but the only visible one was Mars. We had been watching Mars for a week or so now so we have been watching the sky. We lined up Mars with Orion&apos;s belt to see if we could locate this flashing light  - but we could not. As the time passed the light did not follow the path of the other stars and did seem dimmer. We didn&rsquo;t want to report it to the local news out of fear of being laughed at but we wanted to know if you people had any other reports of a similar affect. Also if you had not what this light might have been.Thank you  ((name and e-address deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius??

It was roughly 9:30pm.  There were 5 lights that I could make out.  Very faint.  They were traveling upwards it seemed, and they were traveling at different speeds, as if they were a family walking with a few child stragglers trying to catch up.  I had no explanation, and soon they just faded still travelling upward.  I was dumbfounded people could just discard it and go back to dancing--this was my first time seeing anything in the night sky that couldn&rsquo;t be explained.

It was approx. 7pm. relatively a clear night.  We were just talking and happened to be on opposite sides of street looking for any signs of a bus coming from any direction, when clear as can be, an object appeared and disappeared.  It was huge!  In addition, it made no sound at all.  In a particular site we gave seen five other sightings of the same thing over the last 1 1/2 years.  Seems to be on the same path.  It appears and disappears with never ever any sound.  Only the last to times it has been closer where you can see the lights flashing strobe like.  It just disappears! We like the sky, we like watching for planes, stars, satellites ECT.  In addition, if you look way up in the sky, beyond the stars almost...you can see the satellites moving but we have seen objects moving in straight lines and back at record speeds.  I know their are allot of satellites but these seem to be moving strangely.  I did not know this site existed, or I would have written along time ago.  There are ufo&apos;s out there, and their are closer then ever now.  How could two people see the same thing?? At the same time?  The government has found out a way to have these flying objects now and fly them around to be unselective for future wars.  Alternatively, another country has made the ship that disappeared many years ago, actually traveled in time but not without major problems and skepticism.  Also on our computers and on our TV, witch is all 2 years old.  Are picking up signs.  Someone said it is just other satellites passing by, but then why are we not hearing it none stop.  I think the plane that hit a&rdquo; air pocket&rdquo; last week in B.C. was probly on top of a ufo.  Skidding on top with out knowing it was there.  Because all the ones we have seen, they have appeared and disappeared, witch means they can become invisible at any given time. Some one knows and has had contact with them.

This was no conventional craft, triangular, darted in all directions.First, this was not a significant sighting as sightings go, though it was my first, but I&apos;m submitting because my report may help corroborate reports of others. We first spotted the craft at 18:15 EST.  It was dark here in Florida.  I noted the time because as soon as my wife said we have a UFO we checked the time. The craft appeared WSW of my home and at a very high angle, almost overhead.  I would place the craft almost due west of Saint Petersburg proper.  There was heavy periodic cloud cover with some moonlight. The size of the craft to the naked eye appeared to be just larger than a star so it was very high.  However, we had low power binoculars, and night scope. When viewed through these two aids it was clear it was a triangle and had lights. There&apos;s no doubt this was a craft as it was clearly intelligently guided.  It would dart to the right, left, back and forth at amazing speeds and do a strange wobbling motion in concentric circles.", "Floating large rectangle near Highland Park/Pasadena CAI was in my car traveling North on Figueroa St. in Highland Park, Los Angeles. I will have to return to see what the cross street was, but I had passed 60th St. It was about 4PM, perhaps a little after. Looking through my windshield, on the right side of the street, I could see the neighborhood buildings and beyond them, the hills South of Pasadena dotted with houses, across the LA River, not very far away at all. In between, I spotted a rectangular object in the air. It was a flat gray. I could tell that it was slowly moving southward, perhaps above the river, which winds with the 110 freeway but more likely, above the hills. I&rsquo;ll state right now that I know it wasn&rsquo;t a billboard, although it was positioned in a manner a billboard would be (long side down) and was at least the size of a billboard. The difference being this object was floating and moving through mid air. I&rsquo;ll also state that it wasn&rsquo;t a blimp and I had already seen the Goodyear blimp earlier in the day, around the Pasadena area, since tomorrow is the Rose Bowl Parade. That was my first thought, that this was a promo for the Bowl and a plane was towing it, even though a plane at that low an altitude in that area would be a freak flight plan. My &ldquo;mission&rdquo; then became to see this thing and the plane that might be towing it together, but I&rsquo;d have to see it in enough open space as I was getting my view blocked by buildings and trees as I drove. The next chance revealed the rectangle still moving with no plane to be seen anywhere. Now I thought it might be a balloon and I tried to get a good look at it, replacing my sunglasses with my glasses. There seemed to be a texture to it like a chain-link fence pattern. Also there seemed to be 3 segments to it with 2 vertical lines from top to bottom. So it looked like left side, middle, right side, all about equal width. There may have been a circular shape in the middle one. No sound from it that I could hear. No lights or glows. It still continued to move behind things that blocked my view so I tried again to get a better view and was frustrated by slow moving traffic. I&rsquo;ll state it was moving unlike a loose balloon might. It was heading in an edge-first, sideways manner, as if the bottom edge was on a track. I could also tell by the edge it was not very &ldquo;thick&rdquo;, that is I wasn&rsquo;t looking at one end of a house-like frame. It was much more flattened like a billboard. It occurred to me to get to a spot where I could try to photograph it with my cell phone. I took out my phone and prepared it, still trying to keep the shape in sight. I approached an intersection and saw it again. This time it seemed to be picking up speed as if going around a curve and I stuck my arm out the window of my car and tried to snap a picture above the roof of my car. At the intersection I realized I could go down the street toward the freeway and at that point, my view would be unblocked. I made the turn and raced down passed the cross streets, hopefully on an intercept course, as that was the very direction it was headed. It took anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds to get there without seeing the rectangle (blocked by neighborhood houses). When I reached the end of the street with its open view of everywhere around, hoping to see a larger version of the rectangle or maybe even some explanation, it was totally gone from view. I looked in every direction. Nothing but everything as it usually is in broad daylight. Possibly, I thought, it could have turned and descended on the other side of the hill ridge (it seemed to be low enough). Or, if it had simply dropped straight down, the trees would immediately block it from sight. I stopped my car and then inched it along each block. Finally, I gave up and looked at the camera photo. The shot doesn&rsquo;t show it as it may have been pointed away slightly and I tried a vertical shot (done again I&rsquo;d have held it sideways or even chosen video capture and turned it to get the best coverage). The shot is oddly over exposed but it may have been the time of day. I also immediately turned down the way I had come up Figueroa and retraced the road from the last 5 minutes, looking for any billboards I could have mistaken for it, etc. I saw nothing like it. If I hear of any explanation of it, fine. I just would like to know what it was. I won&rsquo;t believe it if someone says it was pulled by something&hellip;there wasn&rsquo;t anything in front or above. Also, anything loose that size near a highway and homes is hazardous.

This is a very remote area approaching the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range.  The area is primarily cattle range land, with a sparse farm house here and there. At around 17:45 we noticed a large (bigger than a fist) bright light to the south.  It appeared to be around 1500 feet agl, and looked to be 2 or 3 miles south of our position.  My first impression was that it was a landing light on a commercial aircraft on approach to Stockton Airport, some 30 miles to the west. As we continued east on Hwy 4 the light remained stationary.  Eventually we lost sight of it either due to its departure, or it may have become obscured by the foothills that we were not traversing. Two days later I drove the same route during the day and confirmed what I already knew:  There is not a natural or man made structure anywhere near this area over 100 ft. tall.

There were no flashing lights on the sides or under belly.  It is hard to know what the complete shape and dimensions would be because it was dark.

We were stopped , watching through the drivers side window, the object began traversing from our left to right.

I believe what I saw was on December 27, 2008. I was driving to work at 7:30 in the morning, driving on I30 Westward towards Dallas, Texas. It was VERY overcast this morning and traffic was not very full, due to kids being out for the holidays. I was looking straight ahead down the highway and I thought I saw a dark gray cloud. It looked like a plate sitting there up in the sky right above the highway. It was not quite to the skyscrapers, yet. It was between Mesquite and Garland, Texas. It was dark gray and was not like a plane, not silver, not outlined. I was afraid it was just a reflection from my truck windshield, but it moved. It did look like it was made of dark gray smoke under gray overcast sky. There were no lights. I watched it and it laid flat, like the typical UFO, but it was neat because it went lower and lower, in a slow, diagonal direction, like it was going to try to land. I was fascinated. It was like one description I had seen before on this site: &ldquo;Smoke moving weirdly&rdquo;. I was trying to see if anyone had ever seen anything like this by reading all your descriptions on the site.  Anyway, the shape was a saucer, but it was very very smokey. It then kept going lower and kind of stood up again like a plate and then got horizontal again. It moved REALLY fluid, like water. I kept looking and looking as I finally got up to the place where it should have been, but could not find it. Sort of like a rainbow situation. I could swear it was invisible and the gray overcast actually made it stand out, somehow. It was a dark gray ship and I could see the outline of it against the sky. It was truly weird.  I could have sworn it landed somewhere, but I could not see past the buildings. I was embarrassed to tell anyone. I tried to call the news, but got shy to ask if anyone had seen anything and shy to tell my family. I am still so curious if anyone else saw it. I also wondered if it could have be! en a ref lection from a car dealership, but why would they shine a shape of a UFO changing form and shape up over the highway?

PD))The fuzzy, comet-like object seen on December 10, 2007 across the East Coast was apparently a rocket stage from a classified satellite.I live in Smyrna, Georgia, about 12 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta and approximately one mile from the southern end of Dobbins Air Reserve Base. At approximately 6:45 p.m. last night (December 10, 2007), I took my dog for his evening walk and looked up at the sky. I noticed slightly to the south of the zenith a fuzzy patch of light in the sky. It was maybe a quarter of the size of my pinky fingernail at arm&apos;s length. I watched it for a few moments, thinking it was a bright star blurred by a cloud, but the night was perfectly clear. I discerned a comet-like shape--a brighter triangular point with a fanned out, fuzzy &quot;tail.&quot;  As an amateur skygazer, I was amazed that I&apos;d not read about anything like this being visible and certainly had not seen anything like it on previous nights. I called my father at his house east of Atlanta at  6:48 p.m., but there was no answer. I went into the house to get my binoculars and came back outside to get a better view. Through the binoculars, the object definitely looked like a comet, and I could see that it was clearly moving against the background stars. I then called my sister&apos;s house in Loganville, Georgia (approximately 30 miles east of Atlanta), at 6:52 p.m. and my father answered the phone. I told him to go outside and look up and when he did, he said, &quot;Well I&apos;ll be damned! What&apos;s that?&quot; &quot;I think it&apos;s a comet,&quot; I told him. &quot;But it&apos;s moving too fast for a comet and it&apos;s not supposed to be there!&quot;  I chatted with my father and continued to observe the comet moving slowly northward close to the zenith. It seemed to get very slightly brighter. At about 7 p.m., through the binoculars I noticed a pinpoint flash of white light just to the right (north side) of the object (the flash was in the same spot as the one noted on the illustration on your website concerning this siting). I told my father, &quot;Wait, there&apos;s a flashing light...that&apos;s not a comet. I&apos;ll call you back.&quot;  I observed the flash several more times but was unable to determine if it was happening at regular intervals or not. It seemed to flash about once every 30 to 45 seconds at first. The patch of light continued to head north toward Cassiopeia, and its brightness was fading quickly. The last time I saw the flash of light next to the fuzzy light, I counted up to 120 seconds and did not see the flash again. It dimmed and I lost sight of it at roughly 7:05 to 7:10 p.m. before it reached the &quot;W&quot; of Cassiopeia. I went inside and called the Smyrna Police Department and described what I saw and asked if anyone else had reported it. No one had. I then called the local Fox affiliate, Fox 5, and asked their news desk if they had received reports of the light in the sky. The man on the phone said that they had calls reporting it from Clayton County (south of Atlanta) all the way up to Cleveland, Georgia (roughly 40 or 50 miles northeast of Atlanta). He had no explanation as to what it might be. I called Fox 5 back at 11 p.m. to see if they had learned anything, and there was no new information. This morning at work, I&apos;ve googled &quot;mysterious light georgia&quot; and numerous other applicable terms, but nothing came up on google or Fox 5 or the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (the city newspaper). I just spoke with a public affairs sergeant at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, and she had heard nothing of the unusual light in the sky. When I typed in &quot;ufo december 10 2007&quot; and the first link that came up was this website. At various times, I have seen satellites, the space shuttle, and the international space station moving across the sky in the evenings. They are always distinct, fast-moving points of light that generally dim and &quot;blink out&quot; once they enter the earth&apos;s shadow. The object last moved much slower than any aircraft (save a helicopter) or satellite. When I saw the flashing light and realized it was not a comet, I thought maybe it was a high-altitude balloon of some sort that had vented gas or propellant, but since this appears to be the same object seen by many people over several states, I have doubts that a weather or test balloon could have been high enough in or above the atmosphere to be viewed from such a wide area. I have no idea what it was. The times listed above are very close approximations from the call records in my cell phone. Now that I have typed all this, I just heard back from an astronomer at the Fernbank Science Center&apos;s observatory here in Atlanta. Apparently, the object was an Atlas rocket performing a &quot;fuel dump&quot; after depositing a classified satellite in orbit. The story can be found at www.spaceweather.com. No little green men responsible this time...", "A triangular formation of 6 white orbs flew together, then separated and reformed formation again.I had just gotten the kids to bed and stepped out onto my deck to smoke a cigarette.  It was a very clear night and I was looking up at the clear starry sky when a triangular formation of white, orb like lights flew over my house from behind me.  There were three orbs extending down the left side of the formation, and two down the right, with one at the point.  They made NO noise and flew in perfect formation while turning to my right as they appeared to be doing a large U-turn.  At what seemed to be the apex of their turn, the last orb in the uneven left side separated from the formation and maneuvered itself precisely into the same position on the right side of the formation.  I realized then that these orbs of light were totally independent objects flying in one perfect formation.  I was now trying to focus even more intensely on whatever these orbs were and began to notice that their was slight variations in the intensity of light being generated by the orbs.  The formation continued on its flight path and disappeared from sight when the house blocked my view, completing almost a perfect U-turn.I never heard any noise coming from these objects, and had no real way of judging the distance between them and myself.  A major highway is within sight of the house from the deck.  The path these objects appeared to take almost makes me wonder if they saw the highway and decided to turn around in the other direction.  I stood there for sometime waiting for them to come back, hoping they were flying in a circle so I could see them again and be more prepared for what I saw the first time.  But nothing came within sight for the next 30 minutes I stood there waiting.In the days to come, I contacted a customer of mine who is an Air Traffic Controller at the Lancaster Airport.  I asked him if they had any reports of strange lights in the sky Christmas Eve and was told they did not.  He did ask why, and I briefly explained.  His analytical disbelief in what I saw prevented me from sharing this experience with anyone but my wife and kids.  A few close friends were told whenever the topic of ghosts and UFO&rsquo;s came up, which is how I received the link to this website.  A friend of mine sent it to me and suggested I read up and submit my story.  I&rsquo;ve been a believer since that night and would love to know more, see more, do more.  It&rsquo;s exciting whenever I think about it.  Thanks for this website, as a place to examine what I do not totally understand.", "15 quick moving white orbs in perfect/tight formation over Sierra Nevadas.Woke up at 11:00 to check out of hotel and go get hiking permits. I went outside of the Lone Pine Hotel to pack backpacks. despite the fires going on to the right, near big pine, and the huge advaning smoke plume, it was crystal clear and bright. I was looking up at Mt.Whitney and decided to put on my glasses(amber lens)because it was so bright. I  immediately saw a group of 15 or more white colored round objects moving quickly above the Whitney range. At first I thought them to be birds but I noticed they all moved together, in perfect formation, up and down. They disappeared when they turned either towards or away from me. I couldn&apos;t tell how large they were or how fast they were moving. I guess they were pretty far away and high, They appeared to be moving quickly to the north, right into the smoke (they may have been higher than the smoke but not likely). I didn&apos;t think birds fly into smoke! Anyway, they were remarkably similar to those ufos spotted down in mexico.

I was waiting in the driveway for some friends of mine to show up.  While I was waiting, I was observing this bright star ( I think it was the planet Mars that I was seeing) and some of the other stars that was shinning that night.  I noticed the moon was just beginning to rise on the horizon.  The moon was mostly hidden by some oak trees, but I could still see the moon&rsquo;s light shinning through the trees.   Then I noticed a blinking red light moving in the sky near the upper left of the moon.  The red light would stay on for about 1 second and then off for 1 second as the object traveled  North in direction.   I watched it for about a minute, then I ran inside to get my Mom who I was visiting Christmas day.  We both hurried back outside, and I was able to quickly locate the object again.  She had a little difficulty at first in locating the object, but finally she was able to locate the blinking red light  in the sky.  It might have been a plane flying, but I thought a plane also had a white strobe light that flashes brilliantly off and on, not a red light for a strobe light.  Normally when I see a plane flying at night, I would see a white, strobe light flashing off and on, and red lights or green light that is continuously lit on.  The red light seem bigger in light effect than the red lights I normally see on the wing&apos;s tip of a plane. I didn&rsquo;t hear any noise of any planes flying while observing the blinking red light; it was just really quite outside except for when a car occasionally drives by me on the road. Maybe it was a plane flying, and if it was a plane flying, it definably didn&rsquo;t have the normal lights it suppose to have to indicate that it was a plane flying.  It almost seem like it was a satellite moving across the sky, but it would have been way too low, I think, for it to be a satellite, especially blinking off and on a red light.", "A UFO explodes in the skyI was driving home from Michigan, South on 75, and had just passed the Michigan/Ohio border.  It was late September, I think, around 8 PM, and the starless sky was pitch black.  As I drove down the highway, I looked up and noticed two lights, two lit up objects, travelling across the sky, one following the other.  They showed up in the upper half of my windshield, near the top, and appeared to be moving eastward at a steady clip.  The objects must have been a considerable distance away yet appeared like two quite visible lights separated by three or four &apos;object&apos; lengths.  Since it was rather cold, my car windows were up and I heard no noise.Suddenly, a tremendous explosion engulfed the front object, and it appeared to be desintegrating in a burst of flames.  The whole surrounding sky had lit up.  I was shaken by the spectacle because, subconsciously, I wanted to believe that the two objects were passenger planes, and here--one was desintegrating right in front of my eyes.I believe I slowed down, checked my driving, and then, the next moment, I saw only one object remaining, still travelling East.  There were no falling aflame parts of the structure.  One moment there was an object in the sky, the next--there was an explosion, and then the object was gone from the sky, as if rubbed out by a pencil eraser.Again, I did not hear the explosion, the objects were too far away anyway.I arrived home around midnight.  I asked my parents if there were any news about an airplane explosion/accident.  There were none.  The next morning, I read the newspapers and watched the TV News and heard nothing about the explosion I had witnessed the previous evening.  I believe I had called one of the local news agencies, but without results.  And yet, if I had witnessed the explosion, someone else must have seen it too.  I have never heard or seen a word about it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I had two long windows that reached almost from ceiling to floor and I was enjoying the Los Angeles downtown lights. My apartment was on the seventh floor  I became aware of a lighted object that did not seem to be moving.  It may have been disc shaped, but I could only see lights.  At first I thought it was coming directly toward or going directly away from me, but it did not change size. I had the eerie feeling that it was aware of my watching it which caused me to feel apprehensive.  Then after about 20 minutes it started moving very fast to my right (south) and up.  I watched it disappear in about 2 minutes.", "It was flashing different colors such as blue green and red.

I happen to look north down the alley and up into the sky and noticed an object hovering about 45 degrees from the horizon. I asked my friend what he thought it might be and he said he didnt know and there was another one just like it directly above us. The one above us appeared to be larger. I immediately got my binoculars from my truck and had another look. It was a dull metallic sphere and appeared to be getting smaller or it was going straight up. About this time there was what appeared to be a jet plane flying between the objects and as it passed, the objects just simply vanished. The objects did not drift or move from thier position. I could not tell how big they were or the distance from us. However the jet plane I estimated to be around 30,000 feet up. My friend and I are middle aged and just regular guys.

When I was walking back up the drive, I turned to take in a deep blue sky with large cumulus clouds. That is when I saw a large disk-like object sitting next to a big cloud in the southeast at approximately a 35 degree angle. It looked a little shiny because it was probably reflecting the sun from the SW. I would estimate that it was about the size of a large, commercial plane. It did not move for about two minutes, but then moved very slowly to my left and stopped. When it started to move to my right, there was a bright flash of red light from the bottom of the craft. It continued to move slowly to the south until it disappeared from my view because of some trees.", "I saw a set of lights in the sky that hovered above the road and then dissapearedI was going to work around 2:08 am.

Between the two white lights were four yellowish-brown square shaped lights. What ever this was hovered above the road about 100 feet off of the ground for about 10 minutes. It didn&apos;t make any noise. After about 10 minutes the lights just went off.

As always, I was looking up at the sky as I walked to the car and noticed two bright orange lights. I thought nothing of this since there are many aircraft in the area (commercial and military) and I thought the odd colour was just due to atmospheric conditions or something else. As I kept scanning the sky I noticed that all &ldquo;normal&rdquo; aircraft&rsquo;s lights were their &ldquo;normal&rdquo; colours, with the usual flashing red markers, etc. So I looked back at the orange lights and noticed that they hadn&rsquo;t seemed to have moved much, nor changed in size or intensity. This was intriguing, so I kept on watching. I noticed that the lights were moving very slowly but regularly towards the south. Then they suddenly shifted direction and started moving slowly west and then north &ndash; without changing colour/intensity/etc. There were a few other people in the front-yard of my friend&rsquo;s house and I asked them to look &ndash; but they kind of just shrugged their shoulders since I was doing a pretty good Richard Dreyfuss as the realization of seeing a real UFO was dawning on me. I ran to my car to get my video camera and by the time I got that, powered it up and pointed it at the sky &ndash; all of 2 minutes &ndash; the lights were dim but seemed to be in the same position as when I last looked. One was dimmer than the other &ndash; even though they had both been roughly the same intensity before. I shot some footage but haven&rsquo;t even bothered looking at it yet, as I expect the CMOS sensor and auto-focus probably screwed the whole &ldquo;capture&rdquo;. The world doesn&rsquo;t need yet another crappy piece of UFO footage, I&rsquo;m guessing. Anyway, I continued to watch the lights dim-out which they did over about another 2 minutes. Later, when trying to make sense of what I&rsquo;d seen, I thought it must have been some rocket or satellite boosters or something of that nature, but there were no contrails or any smoke or haze around these lights. And if they were military jets, or something of that nature, then they must have been climbing for a hell of a long time &ndash; but without making any sound at all. And their motion from earlier wouldn&rsquo;t fit normal aircraft flying characteristics. So, this was a UFO &ndash; I&rsquo;d love to think it was ET and that 2008 was going to be the year &ndash; but I&rsquo;ll be happy with a much less glamorous resolution to this.

The incident occurred at approximately 7:13 pm Hawaii Standard Time (UTC-10) and I was on my way home after attending a Christmas party at the Pearl Ultralounge.  The night was black, no stars, with light, intermittent rain falling.  As I drove down H-1, there were numerous other cars present when the incident occurred.  I observed in the sky an unusual aircraft flying overhead from the mountains towards the Pacific Ocean with two extremely bright lights (a small white light, and an extremely bright pink light) far too bright to be normal anti-collision lights.  My estimation is that the distance of the object from myself was probably less than five miles. The object appeared to be operating at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet above ground level and maintained steady altitude as it headed towards the ocean, flying above what appeared to be the Kalihi area.  During that time, green fireworks were being fired over the city at that time, but the object I observed was by no means the explosion of a firework or a signal flare because it did not suddenly ascend or slowly descend as one might expect of a parachute-retarded flare; rather, the object moved slowly on a level flight path from the mountains to the ocean.  I could not see any distinguishing features on the object, because its lights were so bright.  As I drove down the road, I continued to visually track the object for a period of approximately two minutes, when suddenly the object disappeared completely.  I must emphasize strongly that the object did not &quot;fade away&quot; or fly behind a building or mountain causing it to be obscured from view, but rather completely vanished as if one minute it was there, the next minute it was gone.That evening I was completely alert, not fatigued in any way, and I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages.  I am not currently taking any form of medication and I am in good health.  My estimation is at that time of night and level of traffic, many people must have seen the object from H-1.

We lived by a small lake out in the country in which there were only narrow rocked roads.  We had just topped a large hill when we instantaneously spotted a large round lighted object in the middle of the road.  The object was much wider than the road, about the size of a house and was immediately recognized as something that shouldn&apos;t be there.  My mother had slammed on her brakes coming to a skidding stop.  We both we very nervous about this finding, just then more lights appeared and it seemed to start rotating.  Now stricken with fear and apprehension we were both cussing about it being a UFO and getting the beep out of there.  She slammed the car into reverse and almost crashed into the ditch.

It was a semi truck with trailer jacknifed in the road! Dear UFO Reader in the mix of what you probably read every day I just thought you would enjoy this story.

This is a daily ritual for me on the weekdays before I start work in the area.  The sun had risen, and there were a few light clouds.  There was no wind.  The area is in the flight path of jets landing at Orlando International Airport, which is approximately 10 miles to the south. I was staring out over the lake when I looked up and noticed a black form flying towards the lake from the west.  At first I thought it was a large bird such as a vulture or eagle circling over the lake.  The object was dark, big, silent, and was not traveling at a high rate of speed.  As I examined it more closely, I could see that it was not a bird.  The object descended, and for a moment, I thought it could be someone parachuting into town, but I didn&apos;t see any evidence of a person beneath the object.  It stopped descending and began to slowly fly to the northeast, towards the Casselberry area.  Despite the object being very dark, the rear of the object reflected in the newly risen sun as it flew out of sight.  There are some cypress trees by the lake, which obscured my view of the object as it flew away.  When it was shining in the sun, it appeared to be spherical - I&apos;m not sure if the object actually changed shape as I watched it, or if I had misjudged its shape when I first noticed it. A few strange things about the object:  It seemed to be flying low.  It was difficult to determine its exact shape.  It was completely silent.  It seemed big, but I was unable to determine its size without a nearby sufficient frame of reference.  The moon was still visible in the sky - if I had to compare it to the moon, I&apos;d say that it wasn&apos;t big enough to have obscured the moon had it flown over it.  Also, it seemed to appear from the west - it was just there over the lake somewhat suddenly, but it&apos;s possible that nearby trees obscured it from my view. My only thoughts on what it might have been is a balloon, but not a hot-air balloon.  It seemed to be following a definite flight path - not randomly being carried by air currents and ascending and descending.  Also, the shape seemed to be off.

Initially, I thought the object was the recent comet that burst into a cloud as the object was cloudy with a prominent bright spot on the lower part of it. However, the comet shouldn&apos;t be as bright as this was nor was it in the right place... therein it wasn&apos;t the comet.

My sisters and brother and a few others were outside and saw the exact same thing. I ran outside with my aunt to take a better look, and it was still moving south in a steady pace. It looked almost exactly like a meteor, except it was moving very slowly. There were about 3 points behind the head of it, like it was burning up, but there were no tails that are usually associated with meteors. There were no sounds whatsoever.

PD))", "Unsual light seen throughout house late at night.My wife and two young children and their grandmother all lived in a two story home in a very dark and thickly wooded private community in Northern California in August of 1998.  There are no street lights in this area and the nights are incredibly dark. The house lots are huge and far apart and across the street from us was a huge undeveloped tract of Pine forest. At approximately 2:AM on this absolutely calm and relatively warm summer evening I was awakened by the brightest blue-white light I have ever seen. I was sleeping in my own upstairs bedroom and my wife was in another next door one and my two children in their own rooms as well. Grandma was downstairs in her own bed. My door to the upstairs hallway, which had windows facing out to the woods across the street, was open.  My room was so immersed in this blue-white light coming in from this wooded area direction that it was blinding. I had to actually shade my eyes.  I was very groggy when I first awoke so I was just befuddled as to what this light could be.  It took me several seconds to wake up. When I became fully awake I studied the light with incredible amazement and curiosity. It was illuminating the entire inside of our house!  I didn&apos;t know a light could be this bright.  It was like one of those six foot wide &quot;Hollywood Premier&quot; night-beam-in-the-sky lights were being shined right onto and into our house!  This light was steady and unwavering. It had a cool, unearthly, blue-white glow to it. Almost like a welders torch glow but no wavering and flashing at all like a real welders torch would have. I was unnerved and my mind came up with a &quot;safe&quot; scenario that there must be emergency vehicles outside our house and every one of their lights were being shined on our house and lighting it up on the inside. But then I listened and I couldn&apos;t hear one sound outside.  No voices or engines running.  Then I got a little scared.  I just couldn&apos;t get up and look outside to see what was directly making this light.  It was a strange &quot;sense&quot; of apprehension and fear. I actually felt cowardly for not doing so. Just then, two minutes after this light first lit up our house I heard my wife in the bedroom next to mine shout out &quot; what the heck is that light?&quot;  Her door to the windowed hallway was closed, and still the light was so bright it woke her up as well.  Unlike me she &quot;bravely&quot; got up and as soon as her hand touched the hallway door knob to open it the incredible light blinked out.  And as soon as it did...every electrical appliance including the humming refigerator, clocks and clock-radios in the house went out too.  We tried the lights, nothing worked.  My wife staggered into my room and sat on my bed. Like me, she was shaken and said she had never seen anything so bright in her life.   We called the gated community 24 hour security guard house about 1/4 to 1/2 miles away as the phone did work and they reported no outages or calls about anything unusual like people&apos;s electricity being out. We sat there pondering another couple of minutes and all of a sudden the lights and power in our house just blinked back on !  It was all so strange we just sat there silent and dumbfounded.  Eventually we got up and walked down to our children&apos;s bedrooms and took a quick non-entering look inside and they seemed asleep and fine so we just went back to bed. The next morning my wife and I got up and she started making an eggs and bacon breakfast for us all.  Not long afterwards our 13 year old son came slowly walking down the stairs.  I didn&apos;t look up but said &quot;good morning&quot; as you could hear him coming down the stairs.  He kind of moaned in response and said &quot; ohhh, I must have had the worst nose bleed of my life last night.&quot;  We looked up and the front of his T-shirt was partially stained in blood and he had dried blood underneath his nose and down his cheek and chin. My wife and I immediately walked over to comfort him and then we went upstairs to his room.  His pillow was fairly well splattered with dried blood also. To this day we don&apos;t have a clue as to what happened that summer evening. But the events I am describing happened exactly the way I say they did.  Our son seemed okay after this and I don&apos;t recall him ever getting another nose bleed. But that light.  I still don&apos;t know how anything could light up the &quot;inside&quot; of a house like that with absolutely no sound. Was this a UFO event?  I can&apos;t say it was becuase I didn&apos;t see anything but the light.But, it certainly was a U.L.E.  &quot;Unidentified Light Event.&quot;  And it reminded me of the movie &quot;Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.&quot;((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There were two, one was higher than the other one. I have photos, and if you zoom into the photo you can see the flying object is a disk shaped object. It was situated over the sky of medellin, Colombia (south America), my 3 friends were with me. One of the objects moved away across the sky keeping the same height, the other one was very much higher and moved upwards and away. They had the ability to keep in the same place, they did so for 5 minutes or so. The one that moved across the sky before stayed in one place and did so continuously. After the 5 minutes were over and eventually after four minutes was the other side of the city....what i will add that i think is an extremely important point is that the the flying objects were VERY close to aeroplanes that were flying into the airport, this is why i knew (in my opinion) that it was a UFO simply because if any other flying aircraft were that close the pilots of the strange crafts would be sacked as they were so close to the planes coming into land. There were no lights coming front he craft, well there might of been as it was in the day, but from what i could see no lights at all.

Flew straight course but made partial spines on its axis left and right.Our Power was out do to late payment that night ( 9-18-07, 11:25 PST ). I was alone in the back patio, reclining in a chair listening to my headphones and enjoying the cool night air, there was not much else to do.First I will tell you that I am very familiar with the night sky and can tell the difference between planets, stars satellites and different aircraft. I have been through Private pilot and Civil Air Patrol ground schools and have had over 60 or so flight hours in private pilot training, and familiar with what lights aircraft should and are required to be equipped with and what each lights function and meaning are etc.On the night of my sighting the sky was clear and I was sitting back looking up at the stars while enjoying my radio station. I was facing up and out to the east.  I noticed some movement in the corner of my left eye, I faced that way and saw what looked like and moved like 4 bright white satellites moving in perfect formation across the sky at a speed a little faster than satellites move across the sky. The formation was that of a perfect triangle with the fourth light dead center. All the lights (3 points and 1 center) were identical in size, color ( white with slightest hint of blue) and brightness. And all about 50% brighter than the brightest stars out that night.As I have no way of knowing the actual size of the craft as there was nothing to reference it off of, I cant make an estimate on the altitude or speed. But I got the since it was pretty high and cruzing at a good speed, If I put my hand up to the sky the object would be equivalent in length as the width of 1 1/2 fingers. The object had only these lights and they stayed solid. No red/green wing tip position lights, anti collision or any other for that matter. The object moved in a straight line to the south east crossing my view of the sky at an angle. I was very confused as to what it could be, I took out my headphones ( volume was not high so I had no ringing in ears from radio station) and listened for sounds of engines which I should have been able to hear if it was a passenger jet, Prop plane or rotocraft at their perspective heights based on the size of the object as it appeared, but heard nothing, this is also a very quiet neighborhood especially at night. I still figured for a moment that just maybe, it could be a newly deployed satellite. I have seen on the NASA channel where a satellite would be deployed by being released in a case where the case comes apart and the parts drift apart leaving the satellite. But I was convinced it was not some kind of conventional aircraft or space junk moving in formation when after about 15 to 20 seconds the craft rotated approximate 90 degrees to the right on its axis ( the center light ) it took about 3-4 seconds to make this smooth rotation. At that point it stopped rotating and was still flying in the exact same line of travel and speed but now sideways. (it was pointy side forward to begin with) Facing almost south west but traveling on to the south east. It continued on for about 10 seconds in this configuration then just like it did before it now rotated on its axis left back to its original configuration now facing its line of travel.I was really excited to see this because I knew for sure it was not any satellite(S) or aircraft I have ever seen. I was thinking this is either some out of this world craft (cool) or something brand new that we had (also cool), and if it is something we have It has to be using some new kind of propulsion to be able to rotate and fly sideways so smoothly like that. It continued on to the south east until it was out of site. Both of the crafts rotations were the same speed (about 3-4 seconds) and smooth, never seeming to have an effect on its straight line of travel or speed. The best I can compare it to would be a tank moving down the highway and the turret being able to swivel left and right without effecting the speed or course of the vehicle. Only what I saw was what appeared to be an entire aircraft do the same. In my aircraft (flight schools aircraft I use for training) I can do what is called a crab which is where you give full left or right rudder and opposite aileron to put the aircraft in a slightly sideways configuration, but only about 10-20 degrees or so and at the expense of speed, it creates major drag and is used sometimes to drastically slow the aircraft, usually for a landing where you may be coming in a little high and or fast, it allows you to loose some altitude and speed quickly by using the body of the aircraft it self to create a lot of drag. I know of no aircraft that can put itself in a sideways configuration from forward movement at high speed without breaking apart, moving off course, loosing speed etc. Some aircraft can hover and fly sideways at very slow speeds and some rotocraft but not at high speeds in the hundreds of miles per hour or faster. Because of the amount of space the craft took up which was not a lot, like I said about 1 and a half finger width  and limited number of stars out at night in our sky around here (near by city lights drown out all but the brighter stars) I did not get a chance to see it cross over a stationary star to see if it would block it out, I did watch for that but it did not cross any stars in its line of flight from my point of view. This may have helped rule out separate objects doing formation ( very impressive Formation ) flying but I really got the since it was a single solid object. Also the lights on the craft all maintained their brightness during the entire sighting across the sky. Satellites I see will usually blink or fade, these lights did not. I do not know for sure what I saw that night but It was diffidently making deliberate movements making me believe it was controlled by something or someone. Also for reference the crafts line of travel was south east with the line taking it over or just slightly north of BFL Meadows Field, rather than right over the city of Bakersfield. If anything it would have skirted the area of Bakersfield on its northern edge. I have included a picture I made on a paint program showing the crafts appearance, line of travel and movements. What I actually seen looked a bit more distant than it appears in the picture. Consider it a somewhat zoomed in look at exactly what I had seen. Also the positions in the sky where the craft changed its configuration was much more distant from each other than what you see in the picture, it was about 10 seconds between the left and right rotations and the craft was seen for a total of about 50 seconds to 1 minute which covered the entire line of sight of sky I could see which was quite a bit.

I was about 10 years old. My father and I went outside and walked over to a good place to see if we can see the meteor shower.

It was hard to see the craft because of these lights all over it. My dad just stood their. I was like oh my god there is a flying saucer.

One t ime at another Air Force base my father and I saw a Nighthawk, F 117.  This was before the public new about stealth aircraft.  My father said that is a Military Experimental Air Craft.  So why didn&apos;t he dub what we saw a military expermental Aircraft like the craft that we did see.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This is done on a regular basis here in Phoenix,AZ, on cloudy or heavy cloud nights where visibility is limited, to aircraft flying through or in an out of the airports.The first time I saw them I was mystified by the strange behaviour of these white lights and also thought they could be UFO`s.

The flashing light was white and very bright it was moving at the speed of my car just below the treetops. It was about 100 feet from my car and the highway. The flashing light stayed at the same speed as my car. I slowed down to 50MPH and the light slowed down, I sped up to 60MPH and the light stayed even with my car. The light followed me for about seven miles until I got to a clearing and then it raised up directly above my car close enough that it&apos;s light was flashing on the highway in front and sides of my car. I could see the light on the pavement outside my driver&apos;s side window flashing. That occured for about two blocks until I had to turn east on Highway 59. When I made my turn, it raised way up high, still flashing then flew southeast at a very fast rate of speed. After I went four blocks I turned north onto Old Highway 99 and drove 3/4 of a mile to my home.  The display of the milage turned red. I turned my car off in the driveway after the display turned red and then started the car again the display where the milage is was a row eights. I turned my car off and then ran into the house.

He was in his vehicle on a very rural wooded county road &amp; watched the object cross the road in front of him about 15 feet below tree top level, approximately 3 car lengths away. The object was golden in color &amp; pulsated without being brightly lit. The object was apparently silent. It maneuvered around &amp; between bare tree limbs &amp; trunks, then hesitated before darting quickly across the road.

My husband &amp; I both heard &amp; saw low flying fighter jets at about the same time (4 pm) on December 2, several days before we knew about the sighting.In retrospect I recall looking out my windows or running out the front door at least twice in the week prior to this sighting because I&rsquo;d also heard unusually low aircraft &amp; then saw fighter jets flying above our home on those occasions. Their direction was always north to south or back again. I remember being surprised that the aircraft were so loud &amp; were flying so slowly at this low altitude although they looked like jets.Is it possible this object was in the neighborhood for a few days?", "I saw a light coming towards the ground and shot due west and then disappear.

It was coming south towards traffic for about 15 seconds maybe, the height was about 2 telephone poles high.  As it came closer it shot due west, after turning west you could see it for maybe 5 seconds and then it was gone. I know other drivers saw it because they were all pointing at the sky in the same area i saw it.

After that we were standing out in the parking lot talking when I happened to look up into the sky.  I was looking toward Hunter Army Air Force Base.  In the sky I saw a round bright white object.  At first I thought it was a helium filled balloon from the car dealerships on Abercorn road not far from where we were.  As I continued to watch another object appeared, then another, then another.  I said to my coworkers &quot;What is that?&quot;  They looked up and saw the objects also.  There were four objects that were roughly in the same line.  As we looked one of my coworkers said &quot;Look to the right of them there are some more&quot;.  I looked to the right and saw three more in the shape of a triangle.  As we all looked they suddenly all changed into a V formation.  Then, as quickly, they changed back into four in one line and three into the triangle formation.  Most of the objects were very bright but a couple were somewhat dim but visible.  I don&apos;t think these were helium balloons as they were staying pretty much in the same position in the sky.  A lady came out of one of the businesses close to us and asked what we were looking at.  One of my coworkers jokingly said &quot;UFOS&quot;.

I do not smoke in my house, so i&apos;m outdoors quite a bit, and have gotten to know the sky very well. This object was clearly out of place. As I looked closer - it appeard there was a tiny bright sphere, several times brighter then any star on the sky - and just off to the right of it, a smaller point of light, similar to the average star. The object appeared to be hovering extremely high over the carson valley.I did not think anything of this at first, but then i noticed what appeared to be a halo around the bright object. As i stood there for roughly 10 minutes or so - the object began to move upwards in the sky, as if to a higher elevation. It also began moving from side to side. I have never seen any aircraft move in any manner such as this, and certainly not one so high up. It seemed able to move in any direction at any time, regardless of current velocity.I went back into my house, and peeked out the window from time to time - and it was still there before i went to bed around 1:00am. Every time i looked, it appeared to be in a different area, but with no obvious pattern , or with any obvious progression in one direction.I have seen odd things like this in the past, but something about this was just different.

Her attention was then caught by what looked like a meteor shower in the western sky.  There were several lights that looked like stars blinking and falling.   She called me over to see this and it did appear to us to be a meteor shower although neither of us had ever seen one before.  When I got to the backdoor to look out, we noticed an object to the south that was much more out of the ordinary.The first thing that caught my eye was how bright the object was.  This object had to be pretty far away, but it was clear to us that it was not a star or meteor.  We soon also ruled out the object being an airplane or helicopter.  This object was hovering in a small circular pattern.  Then the object would shoot to the east and circle around again.  The object would remain in a small area (small from the distance we were seeing it from), but it would hover and shoot to the east, hover and shoot west and so on.  The object moved very fast.  It was very strange.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like it.  The object blinked with lights and when it moved they seemed to disappear briefly and then re-appear. The distance the object moved in such short periods of time was unbelievable.  This went on for about five minutes.  I called my mother who lives about 7 miles away to see if she could see it.  By the time I got her on the phone, the object started flying directly east in a normal straight pattern.  It took off continuing east, but very fast.  Faster than any plane I have ever saw fly.  The erratic patterns the object made and the speed of it lead us to believe it was definitely a UFO.  It sent chills down my spine and my wife was in tears.  She wasn&rsquo;t scared, just in disbelief of what we were witnessing.  Now we are wondering if the first group of objects we saw may have been connected to this one in some way.My wife is a biology major working on her Master&rsquo;s Degree for teaching.

The only way to describe it is to say that the sky itself began to move in different directions, like a wave action, and was becoming distorted in a small area.  There was quite a bit fast distortion with apparent motion of the stars for about 4-5 seconds.  I cannot really describe this distortion with accuracy because I have never seen anything like it. A huge, in &quot;width&quot;, (estimated width of a 727&apos;s length from my vantage point) thin, dark, crescent shaped object emerged from the distorted area of the sky headed in a south westerly direction.  It had several bulging circular dull yellowish shapes on the bottom of it but they did not appear to be lights or if they were lights they were not on.  Each of these circular shapes lined the entire bottom of this object side by side.  It displayed no illumination at all, but I could still see that it was a physical object.  There was no sound, and I would estimate its altitude to be at or below 1,000 feet above ground level. I have no true frame of reference for this altitude or size other than the fact that I am an experienced pilot and judge distances constantly with good accuracy.  It was obviously not low, rooftop level, and it was equally obvious that it was not at a high altitude or in orbit. What struck me as being very odd is that as it emerged from the distorted area it was traveling SIDEWAYS, not in the direction of what one would expect from a crescent shaped airfoil such as the B-2 Spirit.  It traveled so fast that it was out of sight within 2-3 seconds.  It did not appear to climb or descend, just shot away at tremendous speed after appearing from the disturbed area of sky. I have no logical explanation for this.  If I was not star watching just prior to the disturbance occurring, I doubt I would have even seen it at all. Note: I immediately ran into my house to tell my wife, she looked at my face and said, &quot;What&rsquo;s wrong?

In a couple of minutes I noticed a fairly bright and steady light coming from the west to the east.  This was at about 12 miles. I focused my binoculars on it and didn&apos;t notice any wing or strobe lights. I continued to watch it and after about 30 to 45 seconds began a turn toward the south.  This was probably at about 8 miles. I still didn&apos;t notice any wing or strobe lights.

At the time we were skiing down mount Alpamis and had just reached th bottom of the mountain when a fellow student pointed out an aircraft which looked like an American stealth plane. After a few seconds we realised the plane was travelling too slowly to be an aircraft as it seemed to be blown by the wind. The object was around 0.5 km away from our position at the time. All the students I was with at the time witnessed this, so did a skiing instructor and a few Italians too. It seemed to be black/dark grey, with no lights and was not shiney. I estimate the object was the size of a small aircraft and was triangular with rounded off edges. The next day our ski instructor was interviewed by the local police who told him it was most probably a kite or baloon, but admitted to him that in the past few monts there had been more than 14 sightings of the same description. It was certainly not a kite as it did not weave around like a normal kite and it waS certainly not a baloon as its altitude did not change and was too big. The objects was at an estimated 400 ft above ground level and left no haze and made no noise, although during the event, a truck behind us was reversing and its sirens were going off.", "Diamond broach shape over Eugene, OR.I was returning from taking my kids to ballet class.  It must have been winter, because it seems to me it was dark early.  As I pulled into my driveway in the north of town, I saw a huge &quot;diamond broach&quot; shape in the sky, south-southwest.  It was humungous.  If I had put my hand up, my palm would have just covered it.  It was a triangle, point up, with lights in rows inside the triangle, like diamonds.  I don&apos;t recall how many.  It could have been 6 (1 at the point, 2 in the next row, then 3 on the bottom row), or there was another row, making 10.  It wasn&apos;t moving and didn&apos;t make a sound.  I could see lights from helicopters and small planes heading towards it from every direction.  I jumped out of the car to see it better, but my kids freaked.  They ran to the house, begging me to open the door and come in.  They didn&apos;t want it to come get us.  My kids were very young at the time, the oldest about 7, the youngest at the time 4.  I don&apos;t know why they thought this thing would take us away, and I wasn&apos;t showing fear, but rather fascination, so I&apos;m not sure whey they reacted with such terror.  For them I went inside. Later that night, or possibly the next night, I chatted with someone on Prodigy (remember that!?) who claimed to work out at the airport in Eugene (the airport was north of the object, behind me while I was watching the triangle).  She said there was some sort of sighting, a report made even, and no official announcement of what it was, but supposedly it was noticed by the airport, or perhaps reported by them. Again, I can&apos;t be sure of the date, but it must have been Fall or winter of 1996, or perhaps late winter of 1997, although I don&apos;t remember it being cold, just dark early.

They fired/tested them going west over the Pacific. Of course, this was either coincidence or absurd.

It appeared to be a comet; I quickly slewed my telescope to the object, and viewed it at a magnification of 100X. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed, but much slower than a normal satellite when viewed through a telescope eyepiece field of view.The object contained what appeared to be a head and a tail (very much like Haley&rsquo;s comet looked years ago through a pair of binoculars), and its magnitude was so bright that it was dominant in the sky.  There was also a point of light that moved with the object at the same speed, approximately one tenth of a degree from the &ldquo;head&rdquo; of the object.I tracked the object for approximately 45 minutes, the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; faded (almost appeared to dissipate over time), but the point of light near the haze remained in the eyepiece, it&rsquo;s magnitude and position not changing over the period of time that it was tracked. The object passed very close to the star Schedar in the constellation Cassiopeia.  I stopped tracking the object as it passed through the constellation Cassiopeia at approximately 1935 hrs. The object continued to move in a NE direction at approximately 60 degrees above the northern horizon.The Telescope I was using to track the &ldquo;object&rdquo; was a Telescope Engineering Company (TEC) 200mm (8 inch) f/9 refractor, mounted on a Astro-Physics 1200gto computerized equatorial mount. The object was tracked by moving the Declination and Right ascension axis in a manual mode.((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.

West of Brinnon. I was hired as a carpenter to complete an octagon cabin to be used as a Lama pack base camp. That night about 11:00pm. as I was getting ready to retire in my tent, I looked up to notice a strange light moving through the trees. I was looking South and could see Mt. Jupiter in the background.The object was glowing with a Yellow/White light and appeared to be moving in a Northeast direction, straight towards Bangor Wa. It was a quiet still night in mid Summer as this strange object made no sound or noise and appeared to be floating over the ground at a steady speed I can only guess at, maybe 100- 150 mi./hr.It was gone from my sight in about 15 sec. It was not enough time to arouse my friend out of his tent to witness it. I sighed and thought to myself, no one is going to believe me! The object had no other identifying lights on it as navigation or strobes. We were located near some power lines and I thought about some phenomena that would involve    high voltage electricity. I have heard of all the different phenomena of Earth lights and ball lightning. Neither of these seem to match as an explanation. I have sailed on several ocean voyages and have experienced lightning, St. Elmo&apos;s fire and phosphorescence, but this was really weird! If I held up my fingers at arms length, the object appeared to be the size of my first two joints of my little finger. I can only guess it was flying at about 50-100 ft. in elevation.

One was bright orange and the other was bright white both with tails and were descending at 45 degrees intertwining each other as they fell.  We were heading to northern York county for a campout.  After we dropped off my car we traveled together and saw the same glowing orange and white fireballs about 25-30 miles south of the original sighting.

The lights changed in color and intensity, although luminosity was maintained at comparable brightness to stars in the vicinity, over the course of the half hour in which they were seen, the objects also meandered across the sky, going various directions at most times, while stopping and staying still for more than five minutes at a time. The first light was observed heading SW, then NW, then N, then back to the south, and so on. Eventually, three of the objects made a triangular formation. Several attempts were made at photographic evidence, but the cameras in use were not powerful enough to pick up the lights clearly.

I never had the money to stop at a motel along the way, so I usually drove straight through. A normal trip with the occasional rest-stops would take me about 28-32 hours. (LA to Dallas, via El Paso).The time was approximately 2AM. We were in the desert in New Mexico, about two hours away from El Paso. The roads were clear, very little traffic except the occasional 18 wheeler. Running parallel with the highway is a rail-line. But, it is at least 5 miles in the distance.The girls were asleep in the back seat. I promised them if they rested, we would stop in El Paso at our favorite Denny&rsquo;s and have breakfast.I had the window down, it was summer and the desert air was finally cool. I was very tired. My legs felt like lead, my hands were bruised from holding the steering wheel; and my eyes burned from lack of sleep.I heard a whirring noise that I thought must be a helicopter or a small aircraft. The only difference was the noise was more of a soft hum than that of a gas fueled engine.I glanced out the window and saw this object sort of hovering above my car, just a few feet above us. There was a row of lights along its cylindrical side. They were soft, blinking lights; twinkling more than blinking; nothing garish about them.When I stared up at the object, it took off at an angle that no other aircraft I had ever seen could have done. It went on its side about half-way over and then with a soft&rdquo; whoosh&rdquo;, it was gone.I shook my head and drove on and suddenly realized the aircraft was back, this time on the other side of the car. I leaned over and looked at it and it made the same noise and instantly was on my side of the car again. The aircraft followed my car, playing with me, dashing from one side of the car to the other; hovering in front of me, and following along behind, for about 20 miles.When they took off, I heard the soft whoosh and watched as they disappeared in the beautiful night sky. I felt such a sadness that they were gone.But, the strangest thing had happened. The girls were awake, and we were all completely refreshed as if we had been asleep for nine or ten hours. My legs were no longer tired, my eyes didn&rsquo;t burn, and the girls were wide awake and jovial. We laughed the rest of the way to El Paso.While we were freshening up in the restroom at Denny&rsquo;s, my youngest daughter said to me, &ldquo;Mommy, those were angels driving that air car. They knew you were going to have an accident if they didn&rsquo;t help you.&rdquo; I asked her how she knew that and she just smiled and shrugged.After that, whenever I tried to talk about it, neither of the girls remembered the incident at all.

My guess is that this object was probably moving at about the same speed as the cars below which is 65 miles per hour. We looked at the object to where it looked like a small dot in the distance.

The cloud had the appearance of being slightly leading the star point in the front facing west, but the cloud mostly trailed to the east as if the object were traveling due west.

One  layer  was baby blue, another  was gray , third was almost white. (truthfully can&rsquo;t report in which order&hellip;..sorry) The big or little dipper (not sure) was clearly illuminated in the sky to our left as well as tons of other stars we had been unable to see earlier due to the oncoming storm.We could not take our eyes off these bright objects!

The large shape kept hovering and darting all around the little light and then it just took off, like lightening! It was so quick that I could have sworn I saw a stream behind it, but it could have been my eyes adjusting to that incredibly quick exit. I don&rsquo;t know. I do know that the little light kept shining and moved sporadically and much slower than the big one. I then brought my 5 year old to the window and asked him what he thought.

She is on the other hand, terrified. Go figure. Who the hell is gonna believe either one of us, eh? Here is the testimony of my terrified friend in her words;  I was smoking out the window when I saw this bright light in the trees out back. It kept going up and down gradually. Next thing I knew it was on top of the tree tops again. I saw an octagon shape at that point. It started going up and down through the trees and that&rsquo;s when I started paying more attention, When the lights started going up and down faster I admit I freaked and shouted to my friend to come and see this for yourself girl.

I have only spoken about his with my wife since but it is still very much in our memory. Extremely clear and, in fact about the most clear memory I have from my past. That in itself is very odd to me. It was early winter (Dec/Jan) 1993 and we were living in a rented house on a pond in Windham, NH. I was sleeping at about 2:30 am and was awoken by light dancing on the ceiling of our bedroom. It was not that unusual as the pond water would reflect car headlights going by. The odd part was that I felt threatened and actually a little scared and I am not sure why. I am a pretty big guy and not much scares me, but this was very creepy. I do not know why, but I got up and went to the back yard. When I looked up I saw what appeared to be a round cloud (like a big cotton ball) about the size of a tractor trailer, slowly rising and hovering at the other end of the pond. Inside this cloud were several lights that were pulsing on and off. They were blue and white and the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; material seemed to expand and contract around it, almost like liquid. There was absolutely no noise at all. I actually do not remember getting to the shore of the pond or even leaving the house but when I realized what I was looking at I was completely amazed. I do not remember being afraid at all but what is a bit frightening now is how I got to the shoreline of the pond. This loss of memory has never happened to me before. That really haunts me because I have no absolutely no memory of it. At this point I went back into the house and woke my wife up. I asked her to come outside and she did. It was still there and she saw it. It had moved a little further away and higher in altitude (I would guess it started at 100 feet and when my wife saw it, it was at 500 feet) We stood there for a few minutes and didn&rsquo;t say anything. She looked at me and said &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in&rdquo;.  As we went back to the house I do not remember if it was still there. That is another thing that really haunts me. We went back to bed and looked at each other and were pretty much too amazed to talk. I do not remember falling asleep but I did and as soon as I woke up for work I asked my wife if she remembered it and she just said, yes. I asked her to describe it and she did to a tee. After that she asked if we could not talk about it. She was clearly shaken by something neither of us could explain. Every now and again we do talk about it but never with anyone else. I know this sounds weird but this is coming from a guy who just does not believe any of the UFO stuff. Even today I find myself doubting every report I hear but I listen closely to see if what is being reported is described as a cloud with lights pulsing inside of it.

Lauderdale spiraling pinpoint of white light, spirals across the night sky with neon green cloud alongside.I was 15 and living with my married sister (26) while she was pregnant in a residential area of Fort Lauderdale, FL near the inter-coastal waterway. We went into her backyard, behind the pool to steal lemons off of her neighbor&apos;s lemon tree.  It was dark and a clear night. My sister exclaimed &amp; grabbed my arm &amp; pointed up towards the sky. STRAIGHT UP was the brightest white light I&apos;d ever seen (brighter than a Klieg light), a pinpoint of white light that spiraled out in lines that were so even they could have been made with a &apos;compass&apos;... the pinpoint of light continued to shine as the spiraling lines filled the entire upper horizon... but what was odd is that we could see through the widening white, spiraling lines... we could see the starry sky through the widening white lines. Next to the pinpoint of white light was a neon green cloud.  A cloud, like a white cloud you&apos;d seen on a blue-sky day, except this cloud was green and it glowed like a green neon sign. We both stood there with our mouths agape and watched this entire phenomenon for about 2 minutes... the white, transparent, WIDE spiral lines filled the entire upper horizon and then the white pinpoint just stopped emanating light and the green cloud took a few more minutes to fade away. Apparently, thousands of people in Ft. Lauderdale saw this and called into police.  NASA claimed the next day that it was a &apos;reflection off of a rocket that was shot over the ocean... as the sun was going down.&apos;  The only problem is, it was DARK, it was 8:30 PM and the sun sets on the Gulf/west side of Florida.  We were on the east side of Florida, quite close to the Atlantic ocean (perhaps 1 mile). There was no way this was a reflection off a rocket as it was STRAIGHT UP and the pinpoint of light was emanating from above the earth (from space) and it shown down to the atmosphere where it spread out across the entire upper sky. In my opinion, some superior visitors were taking a very large &apos;photo&apos; of the area. The green cloud was translucent.  The white spiral lines were transparent.

I&apos;ve told many people about my sighting, which was several years ago, but never reported it to an organization that collects UFO reports.  And since I don&apos;t spend much time reading or researching UFO reports that other&apos;s have written, I&apos;m not sure if what I saw is common or not or relevant to your collection of reports. I thought it might be helpful however to document my sighting so that other people can compare it with what they have seen.  Let me say however that I didn&apos;t believe in UFOs until my experience. Frankly I find &quot;UFO people&quot; at bit odd and I&apos;ve always distrusted them- still do. To this day, I believe most people are lying about seeing UFOs. It&apos;s as if they want to believe in them. Now that I&apos;ve seen a UFO, I have no choice but to believe that there is something to this phenomenon which can&apos;t be explained. The day was October 31 (1991?) . It was a warm sunny day in the mountains in an area a few miles West of Boulder Colorado near Sugarloaf Mountain. I was standing on a path which I had been on hundreds of times before. There are a few houses around and the area has a lot of people during the Summer months. In October, traffic drops considerably. On this day, I was alone for several hours. While standing on the path, I looked Northeast toward  a thicket of pine trees about a thousand feet away and slightly higher than my elevation. I noticed a round reflection of light moving around on the limbs of the trees as if someone was using a round mirror to reflect sunlight (about a yard in diameter). It had a very pale yellowish orange glow much like reflected sunlight on a surface and I could see the trees through it. At first I thought it was from a mirror on a moving car which was reflecting light in the trees. I looked for a car under the reflection but there wasn&apos;t one so I looked back up at the light. What struck me was the way that the reflection was moving so smoothly through the trees. Light, dancing off of a mirror from a moving car, would have a jerky motion but this did not. Normally a light reflection would change in size when it hits a tree that is closer than one in the distance but this was not the case either. A piece of tumble weed, blown up from a dirt devil, would have snagged in the thick trees. There was no dust or pieces of debris with it. On that day, the air was completely still. I realized a few seconds later that it was not a reflection because it moved higher in the sky above the trees and there was nothing behind for it to reflect off of except blue sky. It remained translucent against the sky but a little less bright. While it circled above the tree tops a second one came up from behind the trees and followed it. The original one dropped back into the trees and the second one followed. It was as if they were playing with each other. Almost like a game of tag. At times they would chase each other in the sky and then they would drop into trees and maneuver smoothly through them. This went on for about 30 seconds and they would take turns chasing each other. One of them darted from low in the trees and shot up back into the sky  behind the trees and out of view. The other one followed. After about 10 seconds, one of them rose up from behind the trees, flew around in a circular pattern and slowly descended to the ground at the base of a tree. It remained there motionless. The other one never returned. I looked around hoping to find someone who saw what I had just witnessed but there was no one. I decided to hike over to the tree and check it out. I don&apos;t know why I wasn&apos;t frightened except that I suppose it was just too fascinating. I made a point to keep my eyes fixed on it as much as possible as I hiked nearer to it&apos;s location. There were times when I had to look down to check my footing. The closer I got to it the dimmer it became. I&apos;m guessing that I was within 500 feet when the glow became so faint  that I couldn&apos;t see it anymore and I couldn&apos;t spot the exact location where I thought it landed. It was private property so I didn&apos;t go all the way into the trees. When I returned to the area of the path where I first sighted the object (about 5 minutes later) the object was no longer visible under the tree. Anyway, that&apos;s it. It&apos;s not a very exciting story  and most people find it kind of boring. I can tell you however that it&apos;s exciting to me and I&apos;ll never forget that day and how it changed my view of things. I have some additional observations about this incident which I haven&apos;t included but may have some scientific relevance if anyone is interested. Someone can contact me from the NUFORC if they like.

That said, this event varies quite a bit from the former. (2) I&apos;m a comprehensive mental health case manager for Volunteers of America, and am currently pursuing a masters in counseling psychology.  Anything that sounds like a definitive conclusion that I may mention I stress is purely speculative on my part.  I&apos;d like to think my background is fairly based in scientific observation. This occurred at 6:25 pm on Friday, January 11, 2008.  I was in my car in Lake Charles, LA.  I had turned off 5th Avenue onto Prien Lake rd., headed east-bound towards the onramp onto interstate 2-10 west (where I was going to merge).  There is a fairly short distance between that corner and the onramp, perhaps a half mile.  I noticed up to my left something that I hadn&apos;t seen before.  I assumed it was a tower; Lake Charles is a fairly large town so it didn&apos;t surprise me that I had missed seeing it before.  The reason I thought it was a tower was because it appeared almost stationary, and was about the height of a tower top.  There was three white lights in a triangular formation, and along the back base was a blinking red light.  I thought for sure it was a tower top, yet when I kept trying to locate the actual tower itself, I couldn&apos;t see it.  It was dark, so I assumed that it was just obscured.  Then I realized it was moving. At that point my onramp was coming up, so instead of pulling over and risk not being able to get a good shot of this thing, I merged onto 2-10 west-bound and grabbed my 5 megapixel digital camera out of my tech bag (I keep my PSP, DS, and cam in there when I spend a couple days away from my apartment).  The thing was moving slow still, from north to southwest.  I took an initial picture with the flash on, which looked like crap because of the glare of my dirty windshield.  I turned the flash off and took several more photos.  The thing disappeared over the southwest horizon just before I hit the 2-10 bridge of the Calcasieu ship channel. I wouldn&apos;t have given this a second thought if the thing hadn&apos;t just *sat* in place while I passed it, and like I said, it seemed somewhat low over the Oak Park area of Lake Charles.  My camera picked up little more than taillights and darkness, except for one picture.  I had to adjust the brightness on it to see anything, but I believe I may have gotten it on the right side of the frame. I&apos;ve been monitoring local media to see if anyone else saw it, but I&apos;ve heard nothing yet.  Traffic was fairly busy, too, at that time.  I will say this, too:  I&apos;ve been to Long Island, NY, so I know what real air traffic looks like.  We don&apos;t get that here, but as soon as this thing was out of sight, lots of planes with blinkblink-pause, blinkblink-pause white running lights started popping up all over.  I&apos;m not saying they were chasing anything, just that they were there in stronger numbers than I remember seeing before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There were three lights.  I took them to be a nose gear light and wing lights. Then they started a sequence from left to right, going on and off in sequence.  After several minutes my wife asked if I had seen those lights. I told her I was glad she was there because I had been watching them already and wanted to be sure I wasn&apos;t seeing things. This pattern of coming on and off in a left to right sequence continued until we lost sight well inside city limits of Keokuk, Iowa.

I was standing in my front yard near 10th Ave. and Garrison St. in Lakewood, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. The sun was close to setting but had not yet set.While watching a flurry of leaves fall from a tree I noticed a bright object in the northeast sky through the tree&apos;s branches. At first I thought it was the sun reflecting off an airplane but it became apparent to me that the object was not moving in relation to the tree&apos;s branches. I checked my watch and it was about three minutes past 6:00 p.m. (Mountain Daylight Time). The object appeared to be in a position not quite half way between north and east and all the activity I describe took place at an elevation of between 30 and 45 degrees above the horizon. Having no reference point, I can not guess as to the distance or altitude of the objects I saw.I moved to get the tree out of the way and began thinking perhaps I was seeing a star becoming visible as the sun was setting but it was just too early for a star to come out. I then began to think it was a weather balloon reflecting the sun. I have not seen a weather balloon since I was a kid and am now 60 years old. By the time I changed position and got the tree out of the way, I could see that the object was now moving in relation to some overhead electrical wires.About 30 seconds had elapsed at this point. Now I began to think I was seeing a satellite of some kind, as it was moving to the southwest at about the speed I have seen satellites move. I called to my daughter (age 24), &quot;Come see the satellite,&quot; and when I looked back the bright object was moving to the straight west. While I was waiting for her to arrive I saw several smaller bright lights (of two sizes) appear and disappear randomly at varying distances around the first object. Some were visible for several seconds, others just flashed on and then off. She arrived just in time to see several smaller objects, about six of them, form a semi-circle around the first object for a few seconds and then, in a split second, a number of the secondary objects formed a straight line with the first object for a few seconds. The line was angled in such a manner that, if extended upward, it would have crossed the northern sky in direction of the north compass point.My daughter looked at the bright objects through binoculars and said that they appeared to have orange and green lights on opposite sides. After this, both the primary and secondary objects appeared and disappeared randomly in the same vicinity for several minutes. Some were large and others were small.At some point one of the secondary objects separated from the group and began moving in a southwesterly direction. Every so often it appeared to produce flames, like rocket propulsion, and would accelerate rapidly in random directions. At some point another object separated from it and acted in a similar manner, flaming and changing direction at odd angles but keeping in the vicinity of the object from which it came. Both objects headed west, sometimes bright and sometimes dark, as silhouettes, but I could not discern any particular shape. The offshoot object disappeared but I continued to watch the other object for a while. It became dark continuously and looked and acted much like a radio controlled model airplane. It flew west and I swear that at times it looked like the silhouette of a large bird flapping its wings, then it too suddenly disappeared.While this took place, several of the other secondary bright objects moved off slowly in a northeasterly direction. The first object then disappeared and by 6:15 p.m. all objects had completely disappeared.My daughter continued to watch the sky and about 10 minutes later she said she saw a bright object again in the vicinity of where the dark objects had disappeared.", "Two converging, then disappearing moving lights.Two lights in the sky moving very fast. they eventually converged and suddenly disappeared.

It was traveling at a low rate of speed and seemed to be following me. I continued to see it until I pulled up into our driveway. It came and hovered over the front of our house and projected a bright beam that lit up our front lawn. The object was round and you could see light coming from around the top, like it may have had windows around the top. It didn&apos;t sound like a plane or a helicopter. It made a humming sound. I got out of my car and went to the door and called my wife. We watched it for at least 5 minutes.When it left it seemed to just dart it was so fast.

Saw 3 times.12-12-07  I was driving to pick up my son from daycare and it was 5:15 pm. The first series of lights I saw were red-orange and appeared for approximately 5 seconds as a series of straight line lights all of the same shape, and then all disappeared at the same time.  I looked around to see what could have caused the lights, perhaps a reflection, someone turning on Christmas lights, etc&hellip; but could not see anything.  I drove further towards town and off to my right, right above Palmyra center of town I saw a series of white lights &ldquo;come on&rdquo; one at a time and as each light (looked the size of bright stars) came on, the first one was still visible but looked less bright.  This continued quickly until about 9-15 lights along an arc were lit up and again, as quickly as this happened it all disappeared at once.  I was shook up by this and could not figure out what it was.  I again quickly looked to see if there were lights in my car that could be causing the visual images &ndash; but again couldn&rsquo;t find an answer.  Finally, as I arrived at my son&rsquo;s day care as I was about to get out of the car I saw another arc of lights form above the horizon in plain sight.  The arc was shaped different &ndash; different angle, but behaved the same in terms of the lights &ldquo;coming on&rdquo; one at a time with the one just lit the brightest until the next came on.  When all were lit  - it disappeared at once. I have lived in the area with my family for the past 18 years and have never seen such lights.  I am an organizational consultant and have never seen nor reported anything that I would consider UFO material until now.", "Before dawn, I saw a  source of light moving steadily, high in the sky for 10 minutes, then stop for 5 minutes.I awakened at 6:15 a.m. to go to the toilet at my residence on a mountain near Roanoke, VA.  Out the bathroom window, I noticed what appeared to be a startling bright star, and then I realized it couldn&apos;t be a star, because it was moving east to west at a high rate of speed, such as might come from a military jet, or satellite or space station.  But this appeared to be more brilliant than reflected light and, besides, the sun was coming up in the east, a wrong direction or slant to have made a reflection that would be visible to me.  The brilliant spot of light continued to move east to west for about 10 minutes.  I hoped it would not pause or sharply change directions, but it did pause.It was stationary for at least five minutes.  My wife also so it; we watched it together.  I can say that it was stationary, unmoving, because at that point I saw it through the leafless upper branches of an oak tree, and with those twigs as a still screen between us and the now-stationary and still as bright as ever object, the tree wasn&apos;t moving (windless night) and the object remained at the same location when seen through those twigs.   If it were Venus moving through the sky, it would not have stopped and become stationery for five minutes.I do not know if it later continued its trajectory, is still there, or simply vanished.  After watching it in it stationary position for five minutes, I returned to bed and to sleep.If tomorrow morning brings a cloudless early pre-daybreak, I&apos;m sufficiently interested to set up my camera on a tripod and at the appropriate time, look for this interesting phenomenon, taking several &quot;bursts&quot; of digital photos.((NUFORC Note:  Venus??

My family member said that at time there should at most only be one bright &ldquo;star&rdquo; in the West and it should be Venus.  This family member became curious and walked away from the building to get a clear view of what I was looking at. We were looking at partial moon several degrees above Venus and that there was another bright object, about one inch (at arms length), to the left and slightly below Venus.  After watching for a few seconds we realized that this object was moving slowly up and a little to the right in relation to Venus.  As the object moved it slowly became less bright and disappeared from sight in about ten minutes.  The total &ldquo;distance&rdquo; traversed during this time was about three inches (at arms length) up and to the right and then it disappeared almost directly above Venus but very slightly to the right.  On a clock it would appear to be at three minutes past the hour.  During this slow transit we realized that there were very tiny and very difficult to see flashes of light at a distance of about one quarter of an inch (at arms length) in all directions from the object.  These flashes seemed to both come from the object and come from outside the object.  My family member said that the apparent movement of the object would indicate that it was not inside of the atmosphere.  If the object was, it would have to be increasing in altitude but somehow reducing in reflectivity.  At that time of day (just after sunset) the object did not move far enough East to pass the solar terminator and lose its light source.  The object also did not seem to be moving fast enough to reach escape velocity. The sight of the moon and two &ldquo;stars&rdquo; was so beautiful.  If I had not stopped to look at them, this sighting would never have happened.  My family member would not have come to look at it, too.  We would not have realized that one of the &ldquo;stars&rdquo; was moving and wasn&rsquo;t a star at all. My chant to everyone I know is to look up!  Cloudy or Clear! Day or Night!  Look up!", "Bright light and flashing in covington gaMe and my friend were coyote hunting and it was very windy out.  We were out there for about an hour when we first got out in the deer stand there was a orange light in the distance almost like some one was walking through the woods with a flash light.  Everything was still there was no wind and then out of no where a light lit up the deer stand we were in and we could see everything like some one was standing behind us with a giant spot light.Then after about 10 seconds of looking around it stared flashing like a strobe and we looked up and saw a blue figure in the sky it had no definite shape it was just there and then out of no where it was gone but it didn&apos;t leave a streak or anything behind it.It was just gone.It was the clearest light I have ever seen in my life it lit up the whole sky and it didn&apos;t hurt my eyes.

Report  I&rsquo;m writing this report more then a year after the event originally happened, I feel that what I saw was substantial, and needed to be known. I also have heard of other similar sightings and felt this may contribute some important information. The event took place in early July 2006, the night was clear and weather was warm. Some friends of mine took a sailing trip to Thompson Island, located in Lake Superior, this is about a 4 hour sailboat trip from the Thunder Bay Marina. The unidentified craft was seen at night. Some of our friends had decided to sleep on the sailboat in the small bay that the island offers, however due to the warm July weather 5 of us had decided to take the 15 minute walk to the other side of the island and tent. Rather then tent, we actually decided to lay our blankets out upon the beach and lay beneath the stars. We  rested on the beach and talked late into the night, during this time 2 of the 5 of us drifted off to sleep, the time was now nearly roughly 3 or 4 am. The stars were out and visible all night and we had been looking at constellations and the stars all night. Well in mid conversation,  one of us was distracted by what seemed to be a star and commented &ldquo; Guys look at those stars they seem really bright&rdquo;. So all three of us looked upwards and the same distance as a star would seem away was a ball of light, it seemed to be a star at first but it was getting brighter without at doubt, upon closer inspection it seemed to be slightly blue/white light, the type you would see in some peoples headlights for there vehicles, and as we looked.. off to the right side of the sky faded in two more lights of the same type and size. They moved parallel to each other and then moved into a triangle formation with the third and original light. They then stopped all motion, and unexpectantly began what seemed random looping and changing of direction, something a plane/ helicopter/ or satellite could not accomplish, the movement was from nothing to very fast in no time at all, after doing ! what see med at random series of movement the three lights split apart and moved away in different direction. This whole series of events happened in probably 5- 7 minutes, and was viewed from this remote island in the middle of Lake Superior by 3 people.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Flying then disappeared in to skyAt 7:00 it was a clear, sunny day, I looked at the northern horizon; I saw a triangle shaped object that was heading south. The object was flying around 300yds. It was a 3-D triangle with two lights on each side. It kept on moving until it whet behind my house. I moved over so my house will not be in my way. It could not see the object any more.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Not moving in the traffic, I glanced up in the sky to my left and saw, very clearly, a shiny silver, object about the height and size as if a helicopter was hovering over the morning traffic. This object had no propellers though and no wings. It hovered in that position. I turned my head to watch the slowly moving traffic. Then I quickly turned back to the object. It didn&rsquo;t occur to me what I was seeing. The shape was that of a blimp, but smooth, shiny and reflective like polished chrome. I turned to watch traffic again and move as needed. When I turned back to see the object it was gone. I looked around and didn&rsquo;t see it near by.  If this had been a plane flying into Atlanta&rsquo;s airport it would still be visible making its way as would a helicopter.  This object disappeared from sight altogether. My wife&rsquo;s son also said later that he believes he saw the same object.  With thousands of cars stuck in morning traffic, I can&rsquo;t believe that I was the only one to see this.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I am not sure but I think the aircraft was a C-141 or some kind of military cargo plane. It was off the cost of Florida and reported that they had seen a craft come up out of the water and fly off.In a few minutes they were tracking it and it was flying at (I think they said 60,000 ft). and was traveling at a speed of around 4,000 MPH. It was heading northwest.We scrambled F-16&rsquo;s. At the speed it was flying they scrambled planes from Chicago to be in front of it.Somewhere need the South Bend, IN area it just went off the radar.That was the end of that and I didn&rsquo;t think anything more about it that day.But the next day we had some people come into out area and cleaned the information about what had happened of all the computers that had been used in our area.Where I work we had access to everything that was going on in the war and gave briefings to the Whit House and no one had ever cleaned any information off our computers before or after that.

For example there were two lights on then four and then five or six.  I am the first person that would say this was not a believable event but I was there and I saw it.

I was talking to a couple at the jacoozie when one of the twins said &ldquo;What is that Dad?&rdquo;  I looked and at about 500 ft. was a perfectly round ball, painted black, with a hint of green.  It was going north, against the wind, keeping the same altitude.  I suspected it might be military, as it was going the direction of Beal Air Base, up by Marysvlle, Ca. My second sighting was 2 years later.  I had driven up to the Sierra&rsquo;s for a picknick with a lady friend.  I went up almost to Borial Ski Center, then north about 20 miles to a small lake I knew about.  After lunch, while enjoying the senery, I was watching Comercial Jets going north on a Jet Way.  I am a GA Pilot and know about this.  I could easily see the planes.After a short time, a silver (plane?) looking like a cigar holder came flying north, also on the J Way.  It had NO wings, propellars, tail, or Jet streem.  It was just like a cigar holder in silver.I think, because of using the Jet way, it must have been Military.

In 1999 I lived in Hobe Sound Florida. One night I was taking my garbage out and as I walked out my door I looked up and saw an amazing site. A huge object was very low in the sky, moving east to west, at a tremendous speed but making no noise. There were many different colored lights all around it flashing in a circular pattern. I ran around my building to keep site of it and it was going so fast I could hardly see it within about 10 seconds. I have never seen anything move so fast but what really freaked me out was the fact there was no noise.

PD))&apos;Mile-wide UFO&apos; spotted by British airline pilot Last updated at 16:44pm on 22nd June 2007 One of the largest UFOs ever seen has been observed by the crew and passengers of an airliner over the Channel Islands.An official air-miss report on the incident several weeks ago appears in Pilot magazine.Aurigny Airlines captain Ray Bowyer, 50, flying close to Alderney first spotted the object, described as &quot;a cigar-shaped brilliant white light&quot;.As the plane got closer the captain viewed it through binoculars and said: &quot;It was a very sharp, thin yellow object with a green area.&quot;It was 2,000ft up and stationary. I thought it was about 10 miles away, although I later realised it was approximately 40 miles from us. At first, I thought it was the size of a [Boeing] 737.&quot;But it must have been much bigger because of how far away it was. It could have been as much as a mile wide.&quot; Continuing his approach to Guernsey, Bowyer then spied a &quot;second identical object further to the west&quot;.He said: &quot;It was exactly the same but looked smaller because it was further away. It was closer to Guernsey. I can&apos;t explain it. This was clearly visual for about nine minutes.&quot;I&apos;m certainly not saying that it was something of another world. All I&apos;m saying is that I have never seen anything like it before in all my years of flying.&quot; The sightings were confirmed by passengers Kate and John Russell. John, 74, said: &quot;I saw an orange light. It was like an elongated oval.&quot; The sightings were also confirmed by an unnamed pilot with the Blue Islands airline.The Civil Aviation Authority safety notice states that a Tri-Lander aircraft flying close to Alderney spotted the object.&quot;Certain parts of the report have not been published. I cannot say why,&quot; said a senior CAA source.Earlier this year, however, the MOD declared its intentions to open its UFO files to the public.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I looked out the window and clearly saw 3 silver flying saucers hovering above a big field of red flowers. They had a slight woble to them as they were sitting stationary in the air about  200 feet up. They had a circular pattern of red and white lights around the bottom and were about 40 feet across. I also remember seeing a small antennae on top of their dome.  I revisited the site recently and estimated that we were between half and a quarter mile away as we were driving closer.  After about 20 seconds, within a blink of an eye they were gone. I was twelve at the time and was very impressed by what I saw and told my folks about it as soon as we got home. The next morning when I awoke to my radio alarm clock, set to KCBQ, the DJ announced that over 150 people phoned in to report seeing 3 flying saucers throughout San Diego County.

I was in my second to last week of the fall semester when the sighting took place.On the night of December 6, 2007 at almost 8:00PM on the dot I saw four circular craft flying in formation doing aerial maneuvers.  I was walking back to my apartment from campus to pick up supplies for a computer animation I was working on for finals.  Just as I got through the back parking lot I looked up at the roof and balcony of an apartment building that flanks us on the right side (I&apos;ve been watching the icicles grow on their side from all the snowfall).  When I did, I saw four low flying craft that were a dull silver and without lights flying well below the heavy cloud cover.  They were flying low enough that the lights from town were shining on the bottom but I was standing in such a way that there were no lights to cause glare so I could see them very clearly.  I could also see an under-carriage type object that was also circular and about half the diameter of the craft.  They were flying from the direction of the Edinboro Lake, which is about a mile away from where I made the sighting and heading for the river located behind my apartment building.They were in a sort of triangular formation so at first I thought I was seeing the engines of a really low flying jet plane but it was dead silent and I couldn&apos;t see the wings attached to these &apos;engines&apos;.  Just as I was thinking this, the one on the far back right of the triangle formation did a swap with the one on the back left before they formed a more diamond shaped formation and I lost them behind the trees on the backside of the parking lot (I&rsquo;m sending an email with a diagram and illustration of what they did and what I saw).I&rsquo;m not sure if this is prudent or not, but the night before this sighting, the town power grid where the sighting happened lost electricity.

It was much longer than it was wide, had a pointed head and very unusual indents and I don&rsquo;t know where the light was emanating from on the craft.  It did not have wings like an airplane.

I went outside with my friend, and I immediately and asked what they were looking at, and they replied, a UFO.  We asked where, and they said,&rdquo; It is above the second palm tree&rdquo; and I looked and saw it. It was perfectly still.  It was a clear day, and I could see that the sun was glinting off of the object, which was the cover of silver, and it was not twinkling, or anything, other than the light of the sun reflecting off of it.  The surface seemed to be more muted, like the difference between glossy prints and matted prints of photographs. It was reflecting the sun, but not in a glare like airplanes do for example. The other 2 guys, who called our attention to it, said it had been bigger, huge, they called it, about the size of the moon, and it had just moved away, distally, and went from being that size to the size of a star, where it paused. They pointed out the object to me which was located above a palm tree, over the ocean, at approx. 45 degree angle in the sky. We were about a block from the ocean, in the down town area of Isla Vista. I immediately spotted it in the sky, and it looked smooth and oval or circular and was perfectly still. I asked one of the other spotters, who had his camera out if he had managed to photograph it and he said no, and as I reached for my cell phone camera, it zoomed away very fast.  It was getting smaller and smaller until it was gone. It took it probably less than 2 seconds to disappear.There were at least 4 of us who saw it, perhaps more.  At the time, there was about 15 people there, however most were distracted by breakfast, and conversations.  I think that only about 4 or 5 of us actually saw it. From our advantage point, it looked to me to be over the sea, probably only about 3 miles out. I do not think I would have seen it if not for the fact that it was about a hand&rsquo;s with above the palm tree, and the other spotters gave good directions on where to look for it.  When I saw it, I noted my feelings about it, and I felt calm, which was unusual as normally just the thought of them scares me a lot.

They were shaped like elongated circles; possibly at a span of several hundred feet.  The middle of the craft was seen as only a spec of light.  These wings did were not fixed in a uniform position.  One appeared to be angled at about 30 degrees to the back and the other wing was pretty much 90 degrees straight out.  As the craft moved through the sky, I could notice the wings shifting slightly but no drastic shift.  One strange thing was that I saw this craft only 30 minutes after the sun went completely down.  Something that high up should have refracted some of the Sun&apos;s light but this did not which is why I say it was in some sort of cloaked mode.", "Daytime sighting two or three objects30 September 2007 Nikon 10x25, 5&ordm; binoculars Three objects These objects were &lsquo;noticed&rsquo; in the background as I was watching other objects. Planes birds etc. ~ 14:25 Whitish / Bluish object seen with binoculars for about 30 seconds viewed toward the West  at ~ 75&ordm; elevation, lost view when I moved my position slightly. Traveled about 1-2 inches (arms length) toward the SE. The object was &lsquo;self illuminating&rsquo; and not reflective. The object was spherical and illuminated &lsquo;white&rsquo; from the center outward. The color changed gradually to a bright blue at the well defined circumference. This blue color must have been quite intense due to the fact that the normal blue of the cloudless sky appears quite dull/dark in my binoculars. This object was most likely not visible to the unaided eye. This was the most interesting of objects seen thus far during my daytime viewing. ~ 14:27 Attempting to relocate the object above, I saw a &lsquo;whitish&rsquo; object in the same general area. The object was not highly reflective. The exact form is uncertain. It was not well defined; however it had the shape of a rectangle if I were to guess. I followed the object in a somewhat southerly direction. The previous blue object appeared within the &lsquo;field of view&rsquo; (fov) for a few seconds.  I continued to follow the 2nd object for 2-3 min. It traveled ~ 5-6 inches (arms length). Due to the apparent altitude of this object and the one below, the exact form and shape are uncertain. I&rsquo;m not certain why I did not return to viewing the &lsquo;bluish&rsquo; object rather than the &lsquo;white&rsquo; object ?  Again, this object and the one below were most likely not visible to the unaided eye. ~ 14:35 3rd object. Identical to the 2nd object. I viewed it for 6-7 min. traveling at a relatively slow pace as above. It suddenly began to pick up speed and began to travel in a SW direction.  I maintained sighting of the object as I backed 15 feet toward the NE in order to maintain view. This movement was required due to tree obstruction.  The objects acceleration increased to the point that I was required to run beyond the tree obstruction. When attempting to relocate after moving to a new viewing location about 30 feet to the SW, I think I found the object,  however it appeared to be accelerating at a rapid rate and appeared to be droping in altitude to point of losing sight. This last view is uncertain. 15:00 as perspective: Four (2 blue / 2 white) balloons, visible w/o binoculars as a single object toward the North at about 75 &ordm;.  Balloons traveled ~ 12-14 inches (arms length) over a period of 25 min. As they traveled toward the West, they ascended to an altitude during this period where they were not visible w/o binoculars.  (later ID&apos;d as typical &quot;Caldwell Banker&apos; grouping of &apos;open-house&apos; balloons)", "i thought i was seeing stuff at firstI was sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette and looking up at the stars when i seen these two lights through the trees that kind of looked like a cars headlights and as it came closer i realized it wasnt a helicopter and it sure as heck wasnt an airplane,it was making a noise,but not like a helicopter or air plane would make, i only saw one and it was shaped like a triangle,it had two very bright lights in the front and then a light in the back that flashed all lights were white.", "Summary of Radio news coverage for Stephenville, TX sightings 1-8-08Hello Mr Davenport,  I am a former CBS reporter that is living near Dallas, TX, and not too far from Stephenville, TX, where, as you know there was a very dramatic sighting.  (I actually did a report for you a couple of years ago about a sighting I personally had in Amityville, NY that was very clear). I did not see the incident myself. But I thought you would enjoy a compliation of what has been reported on mainstream media about this since it is getting a lot of coverage from both radio and TV stations in this area.  KRLD radio has had comments about this incident in almost every newscast since the 8th and has reported that they had a flood of calls about it. WBAP has been discussing it also, and there have been several TV News reports (I no longer get tv/ cable service, so I cannot tell you as definitively about that coverage, only what has been on radio and websites.)  I have compiled the following details from the news reports over the last week that were not mentioned in the report on your front page. These notes are taken from several news reports over the last week (1-8-08 until today 1-15-08).  Many talk shows have been encouraging callers to call into their stations. (KRLD news dedicated 2 hours to this topic today &ndash; and had several credible witnesses including a pilot and a Constable who witnessed the event.)  Many others, including a fire fighter, and other police officers reported seeing the object (and several others). Witnesses have been describing the object as being either a dark brown, black or a grey color ranging from a white to dark grey.  It is possible that it may have been changing color, or to have had different colors on different sides of the object because witnesses even in the same location disagreed about the exact colors. All witnesses agreed that there were orange lights on the object, but reports of white, red and yellow have come out as well.  All reports agreed that the lights were numerous, very bright and flashing or changing.  Several witnesses described something that could have been flames, and one person heard on KRLD said that she believed the object had &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; something behind it that appeared to be on fire.  Most witnesses said the lights were moving or changing position  Some reports have said there may have been a smaller second object, but the majority has said one.  The size largest size estimates described the object from &frac12; mile wide and 1 mile long, the smallest I have heard said &ldquo;bigger than a football field&rdquo; It was estimated to be flying at about 300 feet. All agree that the object was smooth on the outside (no wings, no tail or protrusions of any kind) with a shiny surface, but again the color is in debate &ndash; All reports agreed that the object had a somewhat cylinder or oval shape to it. The Joint Reserve Naval Air Base is not far from Ft. Worth which does have significant flight activity, however their first response was that they had no knowledge of any aircraft in the air at that time.  There are some witnesses who spotted military planes in the area after the object had been spotted; some say there were chasing the object. The next day there was a statement denying that the military had launched any planes at all.   Monday the naval base reported that this was &ldquo;probably an illusion created by two commercial planes in proximity&rdquo; and again denied that they had launched any of their planes in response to this object. There is a small airport just outside of Stephenville, however it is a small private airport which does not have capacity for anything larger than a twin engine plane.  The closest airports that could have ability to land a commercial jet would be Dallas Love Field, 110 miles away from the sighting, or Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport , 100 miles away, and there are no matching reports of commercial airliners coming close, or flying that low in that area. (Which would be needed to verify the naval base comment that this was an optical illusion)  Witnesses say the object moved very fast, and appeared to disappear and reappear a few minutes later.  Most say it moved in a straight line, came to a stop and remained stationary for a moment, but it accelerated very quickly and turned sharply, or even appeared to be moving in reverse.  Witnesses report hearing noise from the military planes, but no noise from the object itself. If I may add my opinion: The military claim that this was an illusion is not plausible for several reasons:  Tthe Object is consistently reported as being the wrong shape; there is a very large portion of the witnesses who are pilots or public safety officers of different branches &ndash; all of whom would be able to easily recognize a plane&rsquo;s shape; and it was after sunset and the witnesses are consistently reporting the lighting as being dark.(i.e. the &ldquo;reflection of light&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t have happened.  Finally, the object has been consistently reported as being not more than 300 feet above the ground, at that distance it is clearly visible to see the details on any airplane.  KRLD reported they had tried to confirm this with military bases throughout North Texas and even as far as Oklahoma but had not gotten any confirmation of any kind as to this being their air craft.I will also add, that WFAA http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/wfaa/latestnews/stories/wfaa080114_mo_ufospotting.21892ccb.html is reporting that there were several sightings over about a week which may be why there is some inconsistency as to the date of the sightings.  I believe that the majority of witnesses are talking about the sighting on the 8th, but that there have been similar objects seen over Stephenville over the last few weeks.I hope this is helpful to you.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the young woman who submitted the information.

Beyond the other witnesses account, I could only guess it was summer (due to the fact that it was still light outside at 7:30 pm) and that it was 1979 or so (based on my age at the time).My older sister and I had been sent to bed early for misbehavior that evening. We were in the back bedroom of a single story duplex on Toulon Dr. in Baton Rouge. Out the back window of the room we saw a large metallic (silver-grey but not shiny) disk with round windows around the upper edge which were amber orange-yellow in color. It emerged from behind a cloud and moved slowly across the sky and into another cloud. During the time we watched and waited, it didn&apos;t emerge from the second cloud. The clouds were low puffy white clouds, otherwise the sky was blue, it was early dusk so it was light but not direct sunlight.I couldn&apos;t say how high it was in the sky, but it was low enough to see in great detail that it was a disk, that it did have windows (portholes) and that it was not in any way shaped like known aircraft. It was lower than we ever saw planes in that area.The craft moved much slower than you would expect a plane to fly.

So it&apos;s very, very clear tonight. Anyway, I was looking, west towards the ocean at the sky. I saw two planes off in the distances. Then i moved my eye towards the east and then i stopped and notice a bight light, that seemed to shimmer, yet it had no blinking light, like a planes or small jet, nor was it a helicopter. As soon as i saw it, i knew it was different. I thought maybe it&apos;s a balloon, but this had light around it and seemed to coming from it. Yet it had no locked shape or form, sort of round but not. I cannot tell how high it was, but i know it was at least as high as the plane, but it seemed a little higher up. from what i can tell this was not a balloon, nor a plane. It made no sound, not contrail. It moved faster then any plane in the sky, and they&rsquo;re where at least three planes moving in different directions. It moved much faster then any of them and was across the sky before they where the same distance.

I&apos;m aware many have trouble believing this especially if they themselves have never seen anything.  I&apos;m glad there has alway&apos;s been soemone next to me!  I have had less then a hand full of occasions in my life actual telepathic communication involving a sighting and other encounters. On this particular night I was sitting in my living room and all of a sudden heard the words &quot;Eric ! Come out side we have something to show you !&quot;  I told my two Son&apos;s to get their shoes on as we need to go out  side and see a UFO !   they did so did I. I for what ever reason knew right where to look exactly   I don&apos;t know how I knew this,   I told the boys one 16 at the time the other 14 to look right up there and watch. My youngest Son for some reason walked back toward the house and looked up at the sky and toward the home away from the scene. Suddenly  four huge round lights proceeded to turn on  all straight down then three across turned on,  it was sort of like a flicker as it came on i.e.  a florescent light that is aging .   The lights were the size of a nickel held out at arms length possibly a dime.    They made no sound. My Son watched it just as it was happening and we both had drawn exactly what we saw when we returned to go inside.     Then all of a sudden this light which was the shape of a thumb nail and the same size at arms length had illuminated directly to the left of this cross just as it has illuminated completely  !  This light was about one finger size length away from the cross to the left of the object and it was very bright as if a old style blue flash cube had went off !     Just then the cross began to shut its lights off just as fast as it turned them on in different order .   My Son for what ever reason did not see this part happen,  he may have looked down,  however I never looked away and saw everything !  The Cross was in the Eastern sky and almost directly overhead of my home.    The color of the circle  shaped  lights was white and it was perfectly inline and appeared to be in space , though I really do not have any reference to go by at the time,  only that this is what it looked like.    I would assume if this was a craft it would have to be miles long ! and left us with a sense of Aw  !

He said he was standing out front drinking beer with friends as it appeared and he happened to have his  camcorder.         I had a one plus a digital camera but did not have time to get them out of the box on the ground and did not want to take my eyes off of the cross as it had just finished lighting up and I was waiting for what it would do when the light next to it forced it to shut down . I had immediately walked back up to the house and as I reached the steps I was hit with a really bad feeling as I felt much disbar about what happened   as if the feeling was sent down to me,.

After a while, I noticed that the road was narrowing, and I was afraid to follow it any further. I decided to try and turn my car around, and drive back to Cave Junction, Oregon which was about 30 minutes away. As I was backing up the car, it went off of the road, and the rear end of the car was off the road and the car was tottering. I slowly got out, and was trying to figure out how to get my dogs out, which were in their kennel in the back of the car. If I tried to reach them, the car could tumble down the cliff.

In spite of the 100+ degree heat of the day, they were all wearing black trench coats.  I said Hello, and they did not reply. Without a word, they went to the front of my car, and picked it up, and sat it back in the road, facing the direction back to home.  I do not think that even twice that number of humans could have lifted my car from the front end only and place it on the road. I do not remember how I got past their car, or they passed mine, as they were headed up the fire break road as I was originally as well.

I called the police because we are on the flight path of Ohare airport and I thought a plane part fell or a plane when down.  When 911 answered the phone, they asked where would it land.  I said it had to be close because it was so low but it wasn&apos;t coming down in a vertical descent.  It was confusing.  I asked if there were any other 911 calls and they said no.  There wasn&apos;t any reports of things crashing to the earth.  The fire ball was maybe 8 feet across.  This was years, maybe 2, before the Ohare reports and I didn&apos;t know what to make of it.

However, having lived in the Central Florida region for about 20 years, I can say that many strange things have been seen along State Highway 60 and US 441.  I have seen things in the Polk County and Osceola area many times and so have others I know.  This area is desolate cow country as well as farming areas growing sod for new homes and crops.

Highway 60 and 441 intersect at Yeehaw Junction.  I would also like to add that south of Lake Wales on US 27 in Avon Park there is a military area known as the Avon Park bombing range.  This past spring south of Lake Wales in the direction of the Range, I noticed lights the same as those seen over Phoenix several years ago. The duration of the sighting was about an hour and I was not the only witness.  I should have reported it then, but I think the out come would have been the same.  They did not fall but where stationary, at times all lit, at the same time in a flat arc, and at other times the lead light would extinguish and immediately the rear light would come on.   Prior to this formation, all the lights were traversing through the night sky but staying in the same general area.  As I recall this was between 2100 and 2200 in late April or early May.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

First, it was moving to the north-west, and as I watched it it changed direction and came towards me in an east direction.

It was a full moon so I was easily able to see the shape of the craft against the sky, the craft was not white like a commercial jet, it was either gray or black, the only way I was easily able to distinguish its shape was by observing it against the moonlight sky.  It was difficult to tell how &quot;tall&quot; the craft was because I was observing it mostly from the bottom so the craft could have been pyramidal.

I had the apartment to myself for the entire summer and it was time well spent.  I loved the beach, the girls, etc. I have ALWAYS been a morning person and remain so to this day.  I&apos;ve never needed an alarm clock and rise most mornings before 5am.  I&apos;ve never been into alcohol or drugs of any kind.  In fact I love my lucidity and enjoy my conscious life.  I was wide awake that morning and could not wait to step out onto the terrace to look out over the entire Atlantic Ocean and feel the sweet breeze of freedom that was my youth.  I was smart enough to know how young and free I was because I knew one day I would be who I am today and how hard it is to make a living and meet one&apos;s responsibilities. As the Sun was rose to light the morning sky. a speeding craft came from way out in the ocean.  I knew instantly this was something not of our experience.  This triangular object did in fact stop at the shoreline and hovered about 75 feet above my vantage point from the 17th floor terrace.  There were bright lights on each point of the triangle and it just hovered there for what seemed forever.  It hummed just enough that I could hear it over the sound of the waves beneath us.  I was not afraid but felt glued to my fixed position as I gripped the rail of my Grandmother&apos;s balcony. What happened next remains forever in my head all these years because the craft turned on its right (my left) and sped off at such tremendous velocity and made a sound like a team of muffled Lions roaring in unison.  There was a faint liquid vapor trail and I could follow the craft with my eyes for the length of the coast until it then ascended into the clouds with a speed I can not comprehend or convey here.  This thing zipped away like nobody&apos;s business. I never forgot it all these years. ! I&apos;m fam iliar with Harrier Jump Jets and even witnessed Israeli fighter pilots doing manuevers over the Negev Desert when I lived in Israel.  I&apos;ve seen them turn on a dime during arial dogfighting manuevers.  I was even buzzed by Israeli warplanes while working the fields of a Kibbutz and I know what F-18&apos;s can do. You don&apos;t hear them until they are already gone.  Nothing on this planet can do what I saw that day in 1980.  I&apos;ve never told anyone except my Mother and my Aunt.  To this day I feel blessed to have witnessed something not from our imaginations but the reality of other life somewhere in the universe.  What a gift.  My best to all.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The sky was dark and I couldn&apos;t see anything but the light. It was traveling away from me so I got in the car to go to my destination. As I drove I kept watching it.

Clouds were hanging around but there were clear patches where I could see stars.  But this one looked really cigar shaped. I watched it twinkle and throb for a minute...when suddenly it just took off across the sky...but it did some very theatrical moves!  I was shocked.  A pretty star turned into a light show. For about 25-30 seconds this thing hung in the shy...But when it finally left....its movements were so intense!  It was a very light blue in color with a very noticable glow.  And was long and cigar shaped.  I could see it plain as anything.  It was so noticable. I have wondered if anyone else saw it that night as well- It was the only thing I have ever seen move that fast!   It did a zig-zag through the sky and left.

I was 5 and hadn&apos;t started school yet.  My family lived in Miami (our address was considered to be Opa Locka) but I would attend school the next year in Carol City.  We lived a short distance from the Opa Locka airport (then, a military airport).  Our home was not near anything but rock pits and cow pastures.  We lived on 1/2 acre lot. Some time, in the middle of the night, I woke up.  I saw the cat was inside and followed her through the house.  She wanted to go outside, so I opened the door and I followed her outside.  I walked into our backyard and saw at the back corner of our yard a large dark sphere.  Curious, I went closer to see what it was. The object sitting in our yard was about 40&apos; in diameter and faceted - like a disco ball.  The facets were small and bevelled, but clear - like glass.  There was a lot of moonlight, so I could see the color of the glass appeared to be bronze.  There was no light emanating from it, but it looked like whatever was in it could have seen out the glass. I became afraid thinking that a door might open (and maybe it did - because I have a vague memory of seeing a black ramp extend from the lower fourth of it) and ran back inside the house and locked the door.  (Back then we NEVER locked a door.)  The next morning, my mother asked me what I was doing up.  (I think my return to the house and slamming the door woke her up.)  I told her I was letting the cat out of the house.  She thought I was sleepwalking, she said the cat wasn&apos;t left in the prior night.  I can&apos;t remember if I told her what I saw in the back yard.  If I did, that too was probably written off as &quot;sleepwalking.&quot;  I may talk in my sleep, but I have not had any other experience with sleepwalking.  After this incident, I began having a recurring nightmare about being abducted by people who looked like my parents, but weren&apos;t.  I would be in the back seat of the car riding along with my parents, when I would realize they were different, not my parents.  I would jump out of the moving car and run back to my grandparents&apos; home.  When I would get there, my parents would be there.  But, I could tell they weren&apos;t my parents either.  This recurring nightmare went on for about two years before subsiding. I am 53, female, have a slightly above-average IQ, and that&apos;s it.  I have often wondered if there&apos;s a relationship between the nightmare and the sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As we dropped the water we sat on the tank looking up at the sky when we noticed a bright ball of light in the sky just south of us.  This ball of light sat there for about 5 or 10 minutes.  Then a streak of what looked like fire shot from the north side of the object.  When the fire dissipated  it left another smaller ball of light just north of the larger object. They both sat there for a few more minutes and then the smaller ball of light left to the southwest so fast that it left a small trail of light behind it, this trail lasted only a fraction of a second. In just a few minutes the larger ball of light did the exact same thing.  There is no noise.  I have no idea of what I saw.  I have no idea how large they were because I have no idea of their altitude. I do know that in the late 60&apos;s and early 70&apos;s the Air Force was flying B52&apos;s at low altitude over that area.  I may see as many as 4 or 5  a day always flying the same track or course. Around 1965 or 1966 there was a military aircraft that crashed in Lincoln County close to a little town called Mckinney,  I understand there were several crewmen that died in that crash. There was a lot of activity in that area at the time of my sighting, so I say again I have no idea of what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was putting Christmas lights up on my house today at around 2pm. I was on my ladder facing east when I noticed four silver dots in the sky. Initially I believed they were birds, as they were flying in an arrow type shape headed in a southerly direction. After about 20 seconds they doubled back and began to weave in different directions. They went up, down, sideways, made circles. This went on for about 1 minute, then they began to head south again, still weaving and bobbing. I have an American flag flying on a pole in front of my house, as the objects began to fly south again the flag obstructed my view. I jumped off my ladder and went around to get a better view, however they began to fly toward the sunlight and I lost them in the glare. The strangdst part about this is that they stayed completely in synch with each other the entire time. When the first dot would bob and weave the others followed the EXACT path. They were all the same size, shape, and color. It reminded me of a ribbon on a stick. When you shake the stick and move the ribbon in the air, it follows the same path, it was very strange how these did the same thing.

I looked at my cell phone and I think that was the date I saw. There was a main, large UFO that was  just above the tree line across the lake we were on. Three of us were on the dock of my friend&apos;s parents lake house. We were drinking alchohol but we were winding down and quietly chattering under the cover of my friend&apos;s dock. I noticed an object out of the corner of my eye reflecting across the lake almost like how the moon does. This was not the moon. It was seemingly hovering, almost bouncing very quickly, so quickly it was kind of blurry. But while it was bouncing the object was moving from left to right and up and down but staying around the same spot. It was a round bright blue ball of light. It did not make a sound. Later on it changed colors,we all agreed on that. It turned a lighter bright and not so blueish but more white, but at the top it looked kind of green.I could see the stars in the background and that was how we determined it was moving. There was no air traffic that we could see. No airplanes. The whole lake, as far as we could tell, was out. It was dark everywhere and there was not a light on anywhere. It was cold. We sat and watched it for a long time. After a while we began to see other objects in the sky moving around and then stopping. They looked like stars. As the main object started to slowly shift little by little higher up in the sky these small star looking things moved with it. It would move then stop then on of them would move then stop then the one below it would move then stop. We also saw these object moving sideways across the sky it got brighter to bright then it dimmed to out of sight completely. My friend says he saw something I must of missed. He says he saw something that looked like a star, I think, drop out of the ball of light and move across the sky. The other person who was with us was a friend of my friend and she saw everything we did. She pointed out the smaller objects mov! ing in p attern ever so slightly with the big ball of light. The UFO moved around but stayed above the treeline until after about an hour then started to shift upward with the smaller objects. It seemed like what ever this was, was trying to make anyone who might be watching them think they were stars, I guess, moving with the rotation of the earth. But I saw the stars in the background while this thing moved around side to side, up and down, and bouncing so fast it was blurry.There are only so many things you typically see in the sky at night which is the moon, the stars, shooting stars, which we saw earlier, airplanes(military or not), and helicopters. This didn&apos;t make a sound, but it was clearly moving as far as we could tell. One of my friends are licensed to work on planes and they viamently agree with me about what we saw. Even more so. It was absolutely unidentifiable and in the sky. We watched it along with the 2 smaller star like objects go up into the sky slowly and then slow down to a stop. Completely still. We also started seeing airplanes blinking red and white in the sky. We started seeing the planes between 5 and 5:30 a.m. We went inside the house to sleep around 6:15. By this time we very cold,tired,hungry and got sick of watching it. In retrospect I guess we should of tried to keep watching but we were bored with it. All the factors I mentioned attributed to us going in. In all this time we didn&apos;t leave the dock to go wake anybody in the house up until we went in to sleep and we didn&apos;t attempt to photograph at all. We just watched.

It was very large and at the same altitude as the passing commercial jets. It had colored lights surging in a circular pattern on what I assume was the perimeter of the craft. It was at least twice the size of the jetliners.It came to a complete stop at about 80 degrees off vertical and at that point I decided to get off the roadway and to the base of a tree as I was a little bit chicken.It stayed in one spot for a good 5 min. I placed my head against the trunk of the tree and kept an eye on the craft to see if it was sitting still or my mind was playing tricks with me. With my head steadied I compared it to an overhead branch and it was still. It eventually moved off towards the southwest and the lights were  shut off . I remained under the tree untill the next car came along which also picked me up . I got in somewhat panicked and asked if they had seen anything . They said no and I left it at that.I told people about now and then and was struck by how many people went on to tell me of there UFO sightings. I&apos;m certain of what I saw.

I went out of my house to walk down the street to babysit the neighbor&apos;s kid.  I was in an astronomy class in high school, so every time I went out at night I checked the skies to identify constellations.  I looked up, as usual, and saw over in the north-northeast three &quot;stars&quot; in a triangle shape.  It stumped me, because I could figure out what constellation it was.  I remember thinking something about the Summer Triangle; most likely that it couldn&apos;t be the Summer Triangle because of the time of year or location.  I assumed it was a constellation that wasn&apos;t easily seen in town, and I was just lucky to catch it on a clear night, up in the foothills where there were no lights to interfere.  I went on down the street to babysit.A few hours later I returned home.  It was close to 11:00 p.m. or so, and I again looked up into the sky.  The same &quot;constellation&quot; was in the same location.  I knew at that point that it was impossible, after several hours, those stars should have moved.  I stopped to watch them.  I noticed they were brigher than the other stars.  As I watched, the three points of the triangle came together in the center, scrambled around each other, then shot off in three different directions at an incredible speed.  Needless to say, I was a little freaked and ran into my house.The next morning I heard my parents talking in the kitchen before I got up.  They said something about not mentioning anything to me, because with my imagination it would scare me.  Years later I asked them both about the incident.  They both remembered that my father had gone outside after I had left to babysit.  He went to close the garage door.  He also saw the lights.  Something happened, he never did tell me what, but whatever it was was more than just three &quot;stars&quot; up in the sky, otherwise there would have been no need to protect me from what was seen.So, apparently I saw them in formation, went indoors, and in the interval between my two sightings of them, my father also saw something.

It did that twice in a row, and then the third time it got very bright then faded to this red color then broke off into three little circles. Then a couple minutes later it disappeared from the left side of the sky then turned up on the right. It did that for about 10 - 15 minutes. As we got closer to Mission the lights faded then disappeared.  After that we did not see them again. It was the next day that we found out that another person who lives close to the town saw the same thing we saw. She went online and reported it. But I&rsquo;m not sure what sight she went to, to report it. It was just an amazing sight at what we all seen. I am still in shock that I saw that even though it happened a month and a half ago.

Object description:  To the naked eye, appeared as a gray hazy patch, mostly circular but flattened on one side. Approximate magnitude 1 to 2 at initial sighting, approximate size &frac34; degree across. Through binoculars (10x50) &amp; telescope (6&rdquo; F5 reflector) was shaped very much like a water fountain spraying straight up (or a mushroom cloud, pointed at the base). Through the telescope I noticed a point-source of light traveling with the cloud, near the tip, or base. This point-source varied up and down in magnitude slowly, averaging around 5th magnitude, but every so often (between 10 and 60 seconds or so) it would flare to perhaps &ndash;2 magnitude, instantaneously, as if sunlight were reflecting from a flat surface, as is observed with tumbling satellites. Movement was in a straight line. At initial sighting this was approximately 3/4 degree per minute. Object speed slowed as it progressed across the sky, indicating to me that it was traveling in a straight line, as opposed to orbiting Earth. The brightness of the cloud diminished as well, though more rapidly than the point-source. At the end of the observation the cloud was no longer visible, only the point-source, which by this time had faded to average magnitude of 10 to 11, still flaring to magnitude 4 or so. Movement had slowed to about 120 arc seconds per 10 seconds. To summarize, object was first sighted in Cassiopeia, approx Alt. 65 degrees, Az. 5 degrees (R.A. 0h10m x Dec. 55 deg.). After approximately one hour, final sighting was in Lynx at approx Alt. 40 degrees, Az. 60 (R.A. 6h40m x Dec. 55 deg.) Object traversed approx 55 degrees. I have sketched the view through the telescope, indicating the location of the point-source of light, the direction of travel, and the direction of North. I will e-mail the sketch. Also I took several photos with a 35mm SLR, ranging from 30 to 60 seconds each on ISO 200 film. When I get it developed I will send those pictures.

Straight ahead, about a 45 degree angle, we saw a single medium to bright light. I asked him to watch it as I was driving. I asked him to look for the red and green sidelights to see if it was a plane. He could not see anything.He mentioned that we could be seeing the headlight(s) of a small plane. I said that I didn&rsquo;t think they had headlights of that color.I made a left 90 degree turn. The light was nearing our position, so I could not see it anymore but he could.He rolled down his window to listen for noises. He could hear nothing.When I got to the next intersection there was a store there with a large parking lot. I pulled in and parked, turned off my lights and engine and got out of the car.By the time I saw it again it was almost directly above me and moving slowly to the North. My son asked if it could be a helicopter and again, I didn&rsquo;t think they had lights of that color.He suggested that it might be a hot air balloon. The color of the light did look like it could be a flame of some sort, being a red/orange shade. That made the most sense, although if it were a balloon you would be able to see the outline of the balloon as the flame would ignite the air inside the balloon, giving us a good view of the shape and size of the balloon, if not the colors of he silk. We could see no shape of any balloon and there was no obvious basket below the object for holding the people who would be operating the balloon.  He mentioned that he thought the light was flickering as a flame would.Just as he said this the flame flickered out and disappeared. We waited, thinking that if it were a balloon, the operator would have to re-ignite the flame to keep the balloon from falling. There were no sounds of attempts to re-ignite the flame and there was no more light. We could not see anything falling to the ground, even at a slow rate given for the hot air of a balloon to cool, bringing the balloon down.The sighting lasted about seven minutes. It was approximately 5:45pm, Wednesday, December 12, 2007, in the very Northwest corner of Washington State, about 30 minutes south of the Canadian border. There was a wispy cloud cover of about 1000 feet, but we couldn&rsquo;t even see the diluted light of a flame going through the clouds.We continued on our way with my son watching for a return of the light, while I drove.

Only single engine planes can land there. We were facing south looking out into the field when we noticed 7 very large, very bright lights up in the sky. They were all in a row, yet slightly curved downward. As if they were the mouth of a sad face. The lights were not pulsing or flashing. They were just stuck in the sky, not moving at all for about an hour we watched them. I remember watching UFO shows when I was younger. I remembered seeing the Phoenix lights in Arizona. These lights reminded me exactly of the Phoenix lights, and that is when I started to get creeped out a little bit. I was talking to my friend who was with me about the Phoenix lights and he started to get creeped out. I have lived next to that airport for 19years and not once have I seen these lights in the sky. I also know the difference between a star, satellite and an airplane. These lights were very large and very bright. They were glowing an amber/green color. We drove to my friends house who lives right next to the airport, we could see the lights from his back deck. He said he saw them appear in the same place the night before. They turned on one by one he said and stayed in the sky for 2 hours or so. As he was telling us the story the lights began to turn off. They just disappeared one by one in order. It was the most amazing site I have ever seen. Just like that they were gone. I went home to tell my father what I just saw, and he claimed that he had seen them 2 nights ago, but he just thought they were landing lights on towers for the blimp to use when it was landing at night, but during the day I could not see any towers. I don&apos;t know what they were, but the lights have not been back since that night, so it could not have been anything for the airport.", "Two very bright lights seen in the sky before vanishing, one seen a second time in a different location several minutes laterLast Saturday evening, the 15th of December, I was running some errands. I was on my way from my apartment to my place of work to pick up my paycheck (about a 5 minute drive.) I was alone in the car. There are two ways to get to my work, and if I had chosen the way that I usually prefer to take, I may not have seen what I saw that night. I thought that this other way would be quicker though, so I went that way. I almost made the light at the intersection of Wyoming Road (which I was on, facing east) and Marrow&apos;s Road, but it turned red just before I got there, so I was stopped for a few minutes waiting to make a left turn.To the south (my right side) of this intersection is a large suburban residential area. To the northwest (roughly behind me) is a shopping center. Directly east (in front of me) is a large warehouse of some kind, and slightly to the northeast of that building is a highly visible chemical factory building with large smokestacks (which I always jokingly call &quot;those pretty cloud machines.&quot;) I don&apos;t think there was anyone else stopped at the intersection.The sky that night was completely overcast; not a single star could be seen anywhere. The sun had set, so it was fully nightttime, but because of the cloud cover bouncing back the light pollution it was relatively light outside.So I was sitting at the red light and just looking ahead of me, when I saw two very bright, circular or spherical white lights come out of nowhere in the eastern sky, above the warehouse. I thought they must be planes at first, and Delaware does have an airport somewhat nearby with occasionally low-flying planes, but these objects were hovering and not traveling in a straight trajectory. The lights on them were also much brighter than on a plane. It was difficult to tell exactly how far away from me they were, and I did not hear any noise. The two lights were close together at first. The one on the right remained stationary in the sky, and its light was stable. The one on the left was blinking on and off, and moved slowly to the left (north.) I got the feeling that the stationary one was in some way controlling the movements of the other one. As I watched this I realized they were not ordinary aircraft, and it seemed that the instant I thought this, the lights stopped moving for a second and then gradually retreated back behind the thick cloud cover. From my perspective, it looked like they faded out before disappearing. I had the distinct impression that they had been aware I was watching, and the whole thing spooked me out. The traffic light turned green and I continued on my way, trying to analyze what had happened and think of any other possible explanations. I was mad that I had forgotten to take out my camera, but I was so shocked by what I was seeing and it was over very quickly (the lights were visible for maybe 20-30 seconds or so total.)  After picking up my paycheck, I went to my mother&apos;s house, which is in a residential neighborhood off of Kirkwood Highway. As I pulled onto her street (again facing east) I saw just one of these same bright white lights. The light was not blinking, so I assumed it was the non-blinking one I had seen before (it looked exactly the same), but it could have been the blinking one from before or possibly a third craft. I pulled into my mom&apos;s driveway while continuing to watch the light, which was still just moving slowly around in the sky, hovering. I looked at the clock so at least I would know exactly what time it was on this second sighting...it was 6:41 pm. Now I thought of my camera and fished around in my purse for it, but was unable to locate it. (I had taken it out a couple nights before to take pictures of something else and never put it back.) I kept watching the light, and again it was like the craft knew I was watching and conspiring to take pictures of it. Suddenly, the bright light was shut off, but I could still see three very dim lights in a triangular pattern in its place. The lights were (I think) red/pink, blue/green, and yellow/orange. This triangular formation then moved to the left (north) and disappeared behind a house. That was the last I saw of it.When I got home that night, I drew pictures of what I had seen and jotted down the details. I looked up the locations where I saw these craft on Mapquest, and I was definitely looking almost directly east both times.I am a college student in my senior year, and I work part time in customer service. I was not under the influence of any intoxicants at the time. I believed in UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence before, but now I am even more sure that they exist. I am not sure that what I saw could not have been explained by man-made technology, but I can&apos;t shake the feeling that they knew I was watching and altered their movements because of it.", "A CYLINDER LIKE OBJECT WITH  HAZY LIGHT SORROUNDING IT AND PROJECTING ON ONE END.A CYLINDER LIKE FORM WITH AN EXTENDED HAZY LIGHT ON EASTERN END SIDE MOSTLY, ALTHOUGH FUZY LIGHT ALL AROUND IT , MOVING NE AT A SATELITE LIKE SPEED, WITH SOME ERRATIC DEVIATIONS, MOVEMENT VERY SLOW FOR AN AIRCRAFT A LITTLE TOO FAST FOR SATELITE.

We were heading south on SE 174th just north of Powell when we saw flashes in the sky.  We pulled over to see if we could see what it was and, from our vantage point looking just west of south,  it appeared that there was a helicopter hovering over Powell at about 170th and that it was firing off a strobe of some sort.   The color of the flashes looked more like fire (yellow) than like illumination and I had the impression at first that they were circular as you would see looking at a  &apos;flashbulb&apos;.    We watched for three or four minutes trying to hear any sound of helicopter blades.   There was not any sound.The shape of the object still appeared to be helicopter sized but there not clear running lights and the flashing didn&apos;t recur right away.   At this point,  the object appeared to be drifting in a north-northwest direction and passed overhead and just to the west of us.   Still no sound.   Occasionally there was a flash of bright light again or two but not strobelike.   I called my brother who lives almost due west of us at about 90th and asked him to go out and look as the object was getting farther away still appearing to be slowly drifting on an air current---straight line.My brother called back and was looking with his binoculars but couldn&apos;t find anything.  The object was, at that point too far to identify in the lighthaze west of me.   I looked at my clock at that point and it was 10:27 so we&apos;d been watching for probably fifteen minutes.   A small plane on a somewhat parallel course in the opposite direction had come out of the northwest heading to the southeast about five minutes earlier and its engines were clearly identifiable.The only scenario I could envision for this event was that a hot air balloon was drifting and was having fire problems with its propane system, but the shape of the object and the inconsistency of the flashes didn&apos;t fit and the fact that it was a December night also made it unlikely.", "Bright light in sky growing larger and brighter.....then gone!  4-20-07    9:37 pm, Royal Oak, Michigan4-20-07 9:37 pm I noticed a bright circular &ldquo;dot&rdquo;  in the sky as I was letting my dog out.

I noticed something that looked like silver sphere hovering in the air to my left, which would be southwest from my location, and I tracked it from my 11 o&rsquo;clock position to about my 7 o&rsquo;clock position as I drove in the number one (fast lane) at about 75 mph. There were no visible rotors, blades or cockpit. It looked solid to me and it was a good distance (1 mile?) away with a good amount of height (300 -500 feet?). I originally estimated its size at about half that of a VW Beetle, but I later changed my mind after comparing the size of the old Norton water tower, which is plainly recognizable as a very large water tower in the distance. I now think the sphere was larger &ndash; maybe 10 feet in diameter. The object caught my attention because it hovered in the sky much higher than a streetlight or radio antenna and did not look like a helicopter, airplane or balloon. In my opinion, the object had no visible means of propulsion (blades/ intake) and no visible cockpit. It was not an obstruction caused by moving traffic or other nearby obstructions. It was in the distance and initially not moving. To me, this is an odd phenomenon, especially on a clear day. As I observed, I watched it maneuver upwards in a reverse &ldquo;J&rdquo; &ndash; it must have gained in elevation about one or two hundred feet in less than a second.It then stopped or slowed dramatically at the peak of its ascent and moved to the right a bit. I looked at the object for about three seconds before I lost visual contact due to moving traffic. I could no longer &ldquo;spot&rdquo; it because it was now behind me to my left. I looked at a map of San Bernardino and it looked as if it was in the direction of the old Norton Air Force Base (San Bernardino International Airport). I had to take my eyes off the object because I almost drove off the freeway. At the moment of this observance, I was in the number one (far left) lane with no obstructions from westward traffic or streetlights. My car was clean with no spots on the windshield, there was no glare from the sun and I was sober and alert. The entire event (while short) caused me enough stress to almost crash my car and I immediately called my family and friends to tell them what I saw. I don&rsquo;t think it was a weather balloon because of the extremely fast movements (stop-maneuver-stop). I don&rsquo;t know what it was; it was an unidentified flying object.

The more I gazed intently, the more it seemed like two very intense lights side by side very high in the sky.  I checked for any movement and found none.  Then, it seemed like a low-intensity red light appeared on it&apos;s right side.  I observed carefully once again to determine if it might be an aircraft (helicopter).  The red glow was NOT blinking, but was constant.  It was cold, so I drove west and continued to observe.  I had to turn left, then right again, a manuver that took approximately 15-20 seconds.  Upon returning to a westerly course I resumed my observation, only to discover that the stationary, intense light in the western sky had disappeared completely!

I have told family members and a few choice friends.  I was on my way home from my ex inlaws home on chiefnoonday road in middleville.  My ex husband and I stopped at the corner of chiefnoonday and yankee springs road.  (Please know that this is several years ago).  We both noticed a saucer shaped object huvering above the tree tops.  There were almost head light looking lights (2) that went from shinning straight ahead to focusing directly on us.  We just watched in disbelief, that it could be a spacecraft of anykind.  I remember rolling my car window down to listen for any noise.  There wasn&apos;t any sound.My exhusband and I watched it cross over Yankee Springs rd.  diagonally.  I was on the passengers side next to the stop sign on Chiefnoonday headed towards Hastings.  It had colored lights on the bottom, green I believe. I was at that point almost hanging my head out of our car to get a better look.  It moved very slowly then almost as fast as lightning dissappeared from sight.  We thought for a moment that perhaps the quick flashes of light we had seen on the drivers side of the road on our way to the corner could of been the same thing.We didn&apos;t live far from that corner and as soon as we got home we checked the time just for kicks to see if we had been gone longer then we should have.  We were fine.  I do remember calling my ex mother in law and asking her if there was anything happening on her scanner.  (She always had it on back then).  She said nothing was being said about anything related to what we had seen.I had pretty muched dismissed the happening until My mother in law called the next weekend.  She and a line of cars wer at the same corner of my sighting and she experienced the same craft I had.  She however hung her head out the window and started shouted to it &quot;beam me up, there is no intellegent life  here!&quot;.  My sister in law at that time was a young teenager and started crying in fear.  My mother in law was dissappointed no one stopped and pulled over to talk about the craft that was there. She called us right away in excitement over the experience.No one else that I am aware of ever came forward and spoke about the events that we experienced.  I guess that is why I never really brought it up before.  I  did ask a family member at that time who had some millitary knowledge  if the was a huver craft that made  no noise?  I was told he was aware of huver crafts but they all made some sort of noise.  In my experience I heard nothing.  I always tease my middle daughter that because she has an odd body part she is my alien daughter.  (I am just joking of course).  She was just a tiny newborn at the time and was in the car durring the experience. I think its odd that she has recently moved to Texas this year.  I cant wait to tease her again.Maybe I make a joke of it to keep my sanity.  Maybe it was a government test of something. I dont think I&apos;ll ever know.  Its just something that happened that I wanted to share almost 19 years later, that seems like it just happened yesterday.I wish I could be more accurate about dates and times.  I also wish I knew if the other lights that had flashed by prior were related to what I experienced?

I&rsquo;m not too worried about my privacy as I have nothing to hide, and if anyone has more questions about my sighting I would be happy to try and answer them. I was on the thirteenth floor of the apartment building I work for in downtown Detroit.  It was a very sunny day, and something in the sky was reflecting the sun light and it caught my eye.  At first I thought it was one of those silver looking aluminum balloons a child might have, but it seemed to be moving towards me at a high rate of speed as it was now much to large to be a child&rsquo;s balloon.  I can now make out the shape of the craft as it seems to have stopped in mid-air only a few hundred feet outside the window I&rsquo;m standing at. It has a clover shape to it.. Three disk shapes connected in the center, with a sort of bulged center area. At this point the craft starts to rotate up on its side, so that the bottom of the craft is facing towards me. I see a blinking red light in the center of the craft and each clover has a large white circular light on it taking up most of the area of the bottom of these three disks. It&rsquo;s very hard to explain the features of the craft in words. So at this point it&rsquo;s been maybe 30-40 seconds that I&rsquo;ve been watching this thing, and it&rsquo;s now hovering at a 90 degree angle to me just a few hundred feet out my window on the thirteenth floor.  I start to get the feeling this thing knows I see it and it can see me, as it suddenly displays a light sequence of blue, green, white, and red in an extremely fast flickering pattern. I don&rsquo;t know how else to describe this light array other than hypnotic in nature, it lasted only a few seconds and when the light show was over, the craft rotated back down from the right angle it was at, and floated off in a south easterly direction (basically directly over Comerica Park) until I lost sight of it. This is absolutely 100% the truth, and the strangest experience I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life.

What at first appeared to be a large commercial aircraft flew towards me, apparently on approach to a nearby airport, but as it passed overheard I noted a lack of engine noise and that the &quot;front landing&quot; light was an usually large distance away from the wing lights. The aircraft made a very low rumbling noise apparent as it passed. There were red and green strobes and white lights on the wings of the trailing aircraft, and the forward aircraft had a single white light that turned red as it traveled away. The rear aircraft lights alternated, I can remember which were strobing as it approach and which were as it departed, but they altered their strobe pattern as they passed overhead. The lights formed a triangular shape in the sky with the base approximately one 6th of the height. As the lights traveled away, the front one drifted out of line with the rear, making it apparent that there were two aircraft in very close formation. Alternatively I could postulate a large cylindrically object with some sort of light tracking around the front of the exterior. Immediately after the aircraft had passed there, a light propeller driven aircraft traveled behind and perpendicular to the aircraft, immediately followed by two others much further but also perpendicular traveling in the same direction. The aircraft in question traveled north to south while the probably unrelated three transited south of my location from west to east. AS for the observer, I was standing in my back yard and the night before had wished loudly that I could see a ufo. Have noted other unusual effects of my silent thoughts. Dogs barked after the lights had passed. I&apos;m not saying these weren&apos;t conventional aircraft, however if they were they were flying very close to together, fairly low and very very quiet. If a car had driven past at the time of the noise I never would have heard it.", "Lights in circular pattern hovered in the trees of a heavily wooded area, uniformly lifting and fading awayBetween Thanksgiving and Christmas 2007 (may have been Thanksgiving weekend), several bright lights arranged in an oval and uniform pattern were seen hovering in some trees between Route 1 and the intercoastal waterway late in the evening between 9 pm and 11 pm Eastern time in Saint Augustine, Florida, north of Watson Road and south of Southwood Drive. Specifically, the lights were seen hovering in the trees near a brand new condominium complex located several hundred yards East of Route 1. A swampy, marshy wetlands area lies southeast and adjacent to the condo complex where this event was spotted. The lights were seen in the trees near a vacant/unoccupied building of the new condo complex. Upon walking my dog, the lights were spotted and they remained still and bright for several moments amongst the trees. Shortly after being spotted, the lights lifted and moved out of the trees in a uniform form pattern, moving upwards and to the southwest slightly  -- all this movement taking place while the lights were still bright. But, as the &quot;craft&quot; or object moved away, the uniform pattern of lights slowly faded away as &quot;it&quot; moved from the area. There was no noise of an engine. The entire neighborhood was extremely quiet. The lights were not of a conventional airliner, as no jet noise was heard and no lights twinkled as with a conventioanl jetliner. In addition, the lights did not appear in an area of sky where jetliners normally traverse; the lights hovered amongst the trees in the dewy, swampy and wooded area. The lights were brighter and more uniform in pattern (circular or oval shape) and the lights moved and faded away uniformly, which made this event so remarkable to the observer. It was an unforgettable moment for the observer and the observer is at a loss to explain or rationalize the origin of the lights and how the lights moved together uniformly and faded away so uniformly against the uninhabited and heavily wooded wetlands adjacent to a vacant building in a newly constructed condo com! plex. Th is event was not reported until now (posting date of Jan. 16, 2007). This posting was prompted by reportings of others from the state of Texas seen on news broadcasts, and the observer contemplated the nature of the sighting in Florida and decided to report it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

He was concerned because it was very low and we thought it was moving slowly that it might be making a crash landing on the highway. As we neared it, it remained in the same location (Trigger Ave, outside of Bangor base) as in still or hovering. Then my coworker thought maybe it was a tower but, I&rsquo;ve lived in this area for a long time and knew there was no tower there. As we approached it, because it was hovering, I looked at it closely to determine what it was. When we first saw it looked like a plane with wing tip lights (white), a head light (white) in the middle and I think I remember a red light. Underneath the object there were more lights (white), not sure how many. From what I could make out between the lights was the object was triangular or diamond shaped and looked to be made of a shiny metal like aluminum of some sort. It was hovering about 500ft. in the air, a few yards from the highway, over a farm. That night skies were clear for the most part but a little cloud cover. The object was in a little low cloud but, still visible. The object was large and it was silent.

Petaluma California. My older brother and I were headed for the school bus just up the road while on our walk we spotted two small red brightly glowing spheres around the size of small basket balls. The red balls came out of some bushes across the road then danced around each other as they hovered in front of my brother and my faces. Both of us were stunned and starred as these hovering balls of light moved around us then proceeded up the middle of the road as they sped off. When the reached the top of the hill they headed straight up then disappeared.  My brother and I just looked at each other without saying a word. My brother shrugged his shoulders and shook it off as if he&rsquo;d just seen something that didn&rsquo;t exist. The other kids showed up at the bus stop and I asked if any of them saw the lights when one of the kids said, &ldquo;They were car lights you saw you moron.&rdquo; I dismissed the incident and really didn&rsquo;t think any more about it till later in life. One summer night in 1977 my older brother, two girls and myself were in the Sonoma Mountains in Sonoma County California drinking a few beers like a lot of teens did at the time when my first incident occurred.  It was late night, around midnight, my brother and I were standing outside the vehicle while the two girls were inside when my brother pointed to some bushes around a football field away and said, &ldquo;What the f---- is that?&rdquo; I looked to where he was pointing and I saw a rather large glowing orange dome just on the other side of the trees. Not knowing what it was I replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; I became entranced with the object as it began growing in size getting bigger and bigger. My brother ordered me back in the car and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;No, wait, let&rsquo;s check it out.&rdquo; He once again ordered, &ldquo;Get the f---- in the car little brother or I&rsquo;m leaving you here.&rdquo; I jumped in, we took off down the mountains and nothing more was said about it until a few days later when my brother asked, &ldquo;Do you know what that was we saw in the mountains?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a clue.&rdquo; My brother continued and said, &ldquo;Little brother, that was God!&rdquo;  Thinking he was kind of nuts for saying it I dismissed the conversation. This concluded this incident. Later on that same year, sometime in the winter evening, I was once again parked close to the same spot in the mountains with a different friend this time. It was around 10:00 pm. And we were talking about things we wondered about. I was saying I wonder why this and this happens when my friend said, &ldquo;What I wonder is what the hell is that?&rdquo; He was pointing to an orange harvest moon across town just above the other mountain range. I laughed and replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the moon you idiot.&rdquo; My friend looked dead serious to me then pointed up into the sky then said, &ldquo;Oh yeah, then what&rsquo;s that.&rdquo; He was now pointing at what appeared to be another moon. Being rather shocked I replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;  We watched as another harvest moon appeared next to the first one in the mountains, soon a third one appeared.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to check these things out,&ldquo; Said my friend as he started the car and sped across town to the other set of mountains. We weren&rsquo;t sure exactly where they were so we guessed and headed out Two Rock Road in Petaluma California. When we reached the coast guard base we drove up to the guard tower and asked if they saw three glowing harvest moons in the mountains. Needless to say they treated us as if we were nuts and sent us on our way. That night we never did find the objects or see them anywhere else. 1984, Seven years later, I was around 24  years old working in Healdsburg California. I had to commute from Petaluma California to Healdsburg which was around a 45 minute drive everyday which I had to be at work by 6:00 AM. Needless to say I had to get up pretty early in the morning to make it there. I&rsquo;ve always been a very anal person always making it to work at least 20 minutes early so I could have enough time to relax, drink some coffee and back in those days, smoke some cigarettes. This incident is a weird one as I didn&rsquo;t remember most of what I&rsquo;m writing about until much later in life. Anyway, I left to work one day at the same time that I always left then headed up Highway 101 north to Healdsburg. I remember leaving the town of Santa Rosa Heading North and driving through what used to be the usual desolate area of Windsor. As I was driving suddenly I started feeling very tired when I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed two very bright lights, speeding up on me. I thought to myself who&rsquo;s this idiot going this fast? As the lights approached the rear of my vehicle my car slowed down to a stop. I remember trying to give it gas but it wouldn&rsquo;t move. Suddenly the car went completely dead and all I could see were very bright lights behind me. I remember wondering what was going on. The lights moved from the rear of my vehicle rising above my car, when suddenly I hear a loud bumping noise much like a tow truck would make as it lifts up a car. I felt my car being lifted off the ground. I tried opening the doors but they were locked. I remember jumping into the back seat and trying the rear door but it was locked. I remember white light all around me and being totally petrified. The next thing I remember was sitting in the driver seat with my engine running but parked off on the side of the road. I shook my head in disbelief and wondered what happened if anything.  I stepped on the gas an my car took off up highway 101 as I headed to Healdsburg. I seriously didn&rsquo;t know what happened and wondered if an! ything d id happen at all. I arrived to work, went in and poured a cup of coffee like I usually did. I lit up a smoke when and noticed one of my co-workers working. I asked, &ldquo;Hey D--, why are you here so early?&rdquo; D-- looked at me, laughed and replied, &ldquo;Why are you so late?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;Late, what do you mean? I&rsquo;m not late.&rdquo; He laughed again and said, &ldquo;You idiot, you&rsquo;re 20 minutes late.&rdquo; Being a little bewildered I put out my smoke then headed to the time clock where I realized he was right, I wasn&rsquo;t only 20 minutes late but, rather 40 as I usually arrived 20 minutes early every day. When I got home both my wife and I checked our clocks and none of them were off. There were 40 minutes missing from my day. 1987 Three years later I was around 27 years old living in a cottage on a hill in rural Petaluma California. It was sometime in spring around 2:00 am. I woke to the sound of a humming noise and looked at the walls above my bed noticing bright lights going around them. I tried to wake up my wife but couldn&rsquo;t so I hopped out of bed. I went to my daughters room next to ours and checked in on her and she was sound asleep also. I walked in the living room which had windows overlooking the hillside. I looked out the window past the grove of trees and saw bright lights. There was nothing on the hill and the lights made no sense at all being there. The lights resembled the brightness of lights used by freeway crews while working on the roads at night.  I turned and noticed the lights bouncing off the wall mirrors so wanting to get a better look a headed out the front door, closing it behind then out off the porch into the yard. In my underwear I exited the gate which opened in to the field then looked up on the hill. About 200&rsquo; in front of me was a large glowing sphere hovering a few feet off the ground. The sphere resembled a small harvest moon and I remembered wondering if I made a mistake going out to investigate. I looked back at the house and seeing the front door closed I wanted to go back in. I couldn&rsquo;t move as I seemed to be paralyzed. Being very frightened I looked back at the sphere when suddenly three images appeared standing in the field. The images were men which looked just like us except very tall. They were somewhere around 8&rsquo; tall, well built and had bald heads. They were dressed in black jumpsuits and wore side arms. The next thing I remember was waking up in my bed around 8:00 am on a Saturday Morning. I remember opening my eyes wondering if I dreamed the who thing. It almost seemed like hours were missing from my night and I had a small hole or mark right in the center of my forehead which wasn&rsquo;t there before. Years later the entire incident started coming back to me and I began remembering  what happened. It was around 2000 when it became very vivid. There were not only the three beings looking like us but also others resembling the typical aliens with big eyes and grey skin. The beings looking like us seemed to be in charge and the other&rsquo;s worked with them. The mark in my forehead, which is still there today was made by a long needle type instrument which was inserted into my skull. This instrument was used for something I&rsquo;m not sure of. They communicated with me telepathically and seemed to download and upload information into and out of me. In summary, the visit was a religious experience in which they told me God and Jesus are real and do exist. I wasn&rsquo;t a religious man before these incidents but afterwards they changed my life. What we communicated about back and forth was very in-depth and there&rsquo;s not enough paper or time to cove the topics but, I&rsquo;ll reiterate in saying they convinced me Jesus is still alive and went on to say that they are us and we are them. We come from them as they are our past.", "FROM OCT - NOV  FT LEONARDWOOD, MO ABOVE PT FIELD LARGE DISKSHAPED OBJECT NO LIGHTS MOVING SLOW BLOCKING OUT STARS IN BACKGROUND,BASIC TRAINING PT FIELD, DARK WITH CLEAR SKY, STARS IN BACKGROUND, SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD OR SLIGHTLY BIGGER, ABOUT 200 FEET UP, RUST COLOR WITH SHADOW LIKE ENDENTATIONS, ALMOST BLENDING INTO DARKNESS ABOVE STREET LIGHTS, TO BIG TO BE AS SILENT, MOVING SLOW ABOUT 25 - 30 MPH, AS IF TO BE OBSERVING.

It reminded me of what missiles look like when they are fired off from the ground.They fired off from the ground one right after another, there was no fire trail or explosion, they shot up fast and then disappeared it only took a second for them to reach a great distance in the sky and then just vanish.What is it?

I didnt think anything of it until that.  The light seemed to turn into two side by side lights with a small strip of different colored lights in the center.  It obviously was not an airplane as the two lights started to flicker simultaneously.  The object traveled south at a much slower speed than even an airplane, and made a flip/turn.  Thats when it was on its side, I guess, and you could clearly see what was now three white lights in the shape of a triangle.  After that, it basically stayed where it was, if moving, moving slowly, it then flew away much faster than it had previously been moving.  It was dark outside, a clear night, nothing behind what we saw, just in the sky.  Im guessing at around 1500-2000 feet.  It was much lower in the sky than an airplane.", "Another bright bright lite in skyI saw a bright white lite in w. sky in Braintree.

It was flying south west and 45 degrees in the sky when I first noticed it. I am not sure of the altitude since it was night but I would have to say it was at least 500 feet and lasted about 10 seconds until I couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore. It faded into the horizon. I can&rsquo;t tell the size of it since I don&rsquo;t know the true distance but to me it looked like 3/4 the size of the moon.Sometimes birds flying at night can glow from lights in cities and I have seen this before but this didn&rsquo;t seem like that. It was flying way to fast and it didn&rsquo;t change direction at all. It was very windy so if it was a bird it would have been tossed around a bit.I have been around and worked on all types of aircraft most of my life so there was no chance of it being one. I can usually explain everything I see at night that other people might find strange but this one has me a little baffled. I just thought I would report it. Maybe someone else saw something.

It was already dark by this time, so I looked up into the sky, to view the stars. The night sky was clear, with no clouds, fog, or haze. Moments after looking up and admiring the stars, I noticed what I at first thought was a flight of geese, or birds of some sort that fly in a &quot;V&quot; formation.The object or formation was very faint against the dark sky, and thinking it was a flock of birds, I continued to watch and listen for their honking sound. Instead, I heard no sound at all. The object was moving from northeast, to southeast and I immediately noted that it was moving at a very high rate of speed, too fast for birds.As the object passed directly overhead, its outline became more apparent, but was still very faint, and almost blended with the sky. As it passed between my position, and a group of stars, I was able to see that it was in fact a solid or at least, a contiguous object (not a flock of birds). It resembled the shape of a stealth bomber, or something like it. There were no visible lights on the object.Another curious fact about this occurrence was that the object made no sound whatsoever. If it was a stealth bomber, I would have expected to hear jet engine noise, or some faint sound, but I heard nothing. The object appeared to be flying at an altitude of perhaps 5,000 feet above ground level, estimated by its relative size in the sky, and the rate at which it moved.From the time I first observed the object, it was at about a 60 degree angle overhead. It passed directly over my house, and I was able to see the faint outline for approximately 5-6 seconds, and then it completely faded as it moved southwest.", "Chile - 3 moving bright red yellow lights at midnight 1/1/2008At around 12:20 AM local time (3:20 GMT) 1/1/2008. my wife an I saw a read light, like a star but changing brightness from very dim to very bright, even brighter that Sirius.

After I passed the New Kingston exit while still traveling east I spotted off to my North out of the corner of my eye what appeared to be a light pink aura moving below cloud level to the point that it refracted the color off the bottom of the cloud cover, to appear as if it was in the clouds.  It was traveling from North West in a South Eastern direction.  I was traveling 65mph and at this point, I followed it until it went over my car and then coming back into view through the front windshield of my car.  It could&rsquo;ve been at least 1500 feet from the ground and the speed was that of a slow moving commuter flight.  I followed it as it moved out of my viewing distance as it was traveling south east and keeping my eye on it and the road was nearly impossible.  I can honestly say that I do not believe that it was a jet flight due to the fact that there were no FAA lights on it or giving the appearance of an aircraft of any sort.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought it was some sort of plane, perhaps a small aircraft flying straight towards my direction.  After a couple of minutes I noticed that the object appeared to be larger and brighter, at this point I realized that the craft&rsquo;s lights seemed odd since none  appeared to be what I&rsquo;ve come to recognize as conventional aircraft strobe lights. The lights did change either color or brightness, I&rsquo;m not certain which, it may have been doing both. However, they did not appear to be those of an airplane and I  then thought it may be a helicopter, but did  think it would be odd to see one near this location at just over 3:30 am.As I continued driving towards it I fixated on the object since it appeared to remain stationary over I-88, and I didn&rsquo;t seemed to be getting any closer to it. It did appeared to be increasing and decreasing in size from time to time, it also became brighter and seemed more colorful.After what might have been 5 minutes I noticed that the objected moved in a semi-circular fashion. It appeared to have flown away in an upwards direction and then circle back towards my direction while remaining higher in the sky than it had previously been.  It moved in this manner a couple of times and was very easy to keep track of since the sky was absolutely clear.   In this stretch of high-way there aren&rsquo;t many lights and the moon was no longer present. The sky was absolutely dark except for all the bright stars and the craft that was flying/hovering around.A moment later the craft was almost directly over my vehicle, at this point I came to almost a complete stop, pulled onto the shoulder and rolled my window down to get a better look at the object.  I became a bit anxious at this point since I still did not recognize this flying object, and it seemed to be moving in a fashion that it just doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit any conventional aircraft that I&rsquo;m familiar with.As I was looking almost directly up at the object, I could clearly see several lights that appeared to be located under a solid structure. The lights were different colors and I believe some seemed to be located around or near the edge of the object while other lights seemed to be fixated directly under the object.  It remained in this position for a few seconds, perhaps 10, and then appeared to ascend straight up. I assumed it ascended because it became smaller. Then all the lights appeared to have faded at the same time and then the object simply disappeared into a completely clear sky. I did not loose sight of it because it increased it&rsquo;s altitude to the point where I lost sight of it and it did not fly off in another direction, or through a cloud, even though it pretty much appeared to have done just that . It simply dimmed quickly and vanished. Again, there were no clouds present what so ever and I was able to see stars in the exact spot of the sky the object had just occupied. Soon after I saw a couple of aircraft circling the area.For the last three years I have driven this road nightly five to six times a week from Chicago Illinois to Iowa City and back. I have never seen anything remotely resembling this object, and while I have seen occasional small aircraft from time to time, none have ever behaved anywhere near this manner. I&rsquo;m also able to recognize how planes of all sorts generally appear in the night sky because first of all I attended flight school for 2 years at Lewis University in Romeoville Illinois, and I later worked at Chicago&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Hare International Airport for ten years. I actually worked as the Night Hotel Manager at the Hilton Chicago O&rsquo;Hare located directly in the middle of the airport itself. It&rsquo;s a ten floor building. It&rsquo;s the tallest structure except for the control tower. I mentioned this because I routinely spent my break on the roof of the hotel seeing aircraft land, take off, and fly holding patterns a countless amount of times. I also lived only ten minutes away from the airport itself.  So I&rsquo;m very familiar with how aircraft look and fly and generally behave in the night sky and I&rsquo;m convinced that what I witnessed on this Tuesday morning of January 2008 was not a conventional aircraft.There were other vehicles in the area, not many, but I&rsquo;m sure others saw this object as well.Please let me know, via e-mail, if you are aware of any other reports regarding this incident  Thank You,", "Bluish white light UFO flying low at high speed above Baltimore Washington Pky, Dec 23, 2007On December 23, 2007 at approximately 6:45pm I was driving with my 21 year old daughter, south on the Baltimore Washington Parkway around Bowie, MD.

The lights were in a straght line, It was too dark to see an outline so I cant say the shape, only that the lights stretched about 1/2 mile. The lights would turn off and on in differnt orders.

I originally submitted this report without cutting and pasting on Microsoft, so I am resending it.  Also, I have a feeling I accidentally put the year as 2007 instead of 2008. At approximately 8pm CST on January 16, 2008 I took my dog out for a walk.  It was a relatively clear night, but very cold and no other people were out walking.  We walked to the end of our neighborhood (The Landings at Far Oaks) and stood in an empty lot. Directly across from our neighborhood is a large cornfield.  The cross street is Old Collinsville Road.  My dog likes this empty lot and while she was sniffing around I glanced up and thought I saw an airplane flying low to the ground.  The plane appeared to behave strangely--- suddenly zooming up and then going low.  I kept watching and then it started coming towards me and I could not believe what I saw!  I am not 100% certain but I think it was gray and had 2 bright white lights in front.  On the side there was a red flashing light that moved alongside the craft.  I think triangle shaped is the best description, but it was dark and I was freaked out and can&apos;t be 100% sure.  Also, it was silent. I panicked and ran home as it appeared to hover behind me.  While I was running I was too afraid to look back.  There were lots of lights on in several homes and one house seemed to be having a party (5-7 cars parked on the street).  However, I don&apos;t know these people and was too embarrassed to knock on the door about a UFO.  I also did not know who to call.  Maybe I should have called the police. I then watched the UFO from my driveway.  It continued to go high and low and I couldn&apos;t find binoculars and didn&apos;t have a camera.  However, within about 30 minutes there were several airplanes in the sky and a large, dark black, very loud craft that I suspect was a military helicopter.  This craft was definetly chasing the UFO and stayed in the area back tracking for at least 40 minutes.  There were 2 small planes from a distance that seemed to be flying too close together, but I&apos;m pretty sure they were small personal aircraft and probably were looking for the UFO.  There seemed to be an unusual number of airplanes in the sky on that night. I lost sight of the object because I was too afraid to get in my car and follow it.

On December 4, 2007 at approximately 19:00 hours I, along with another officer, observed a single bright amber light while driving southbound on state route 379 in Nye County Nevada.  The light pulsated and disappeared as the object generating the light moved quickly to the other side of a small hill. It was dark but the sky was clear and I am very familiar with the hills and mountain ranges in the area. We continued southbound on 379 for another 15 miles to US highway 6 without seeing a second sign of the object.  At the junction we decided to &ldquo;black&rdquo; the patrol unit out and look down the valley toward where we saw the object. We had a clear view of the small mountain range.  In the desert valley 15 miles is not too far to see clearly and mountain silhouette was recognizable even with the nightfall because of the star light. After a few minutes of observing the mountain range the amber light again appeared.  It moved slowly at first then suddenly moved very vast along the range.  It reversed its direction and seemed to climb and descend at great speeds then occasionally stopping after accelerating to what seemed to be supersonic speeds. It would traverse literally in the blink of an eye an estimated distance of about 5 miles. As I said earlier I am very familiar with rural Nevada and I have had the opportunity on many occasions to observe supersonic aircraft flying overhead.  From these experiences I know that after seeing an aircraft accelerate to those speeds a &ldquo;sonic boom&rdquo; can be heard even at that distance.  We heard nothing aside from the usual sounds of the high desert.  Also I can think of nothing living or inanimate that would be able to survive the &ldquo;G&rdquo; forces associated with those maneuvers, though I must admit I do not have an aeronautical background.  This was just common sense. After watching the object for about ten minuets a second suddenly appeared.  It emitted the same amber light and flew in the same manner as the first. There were other vehicles traveling down that stretch of highway.  We observed something that leads us to believe that the objects were not without intelligence.  As the vehicles on the highway approached the mountain range the lights would either disappear or move to the other side of the mountains.  It appeared that these lights were avoiding the cars. We observed this activity for about half an hour before we decided to continue driving.  We drove East bound on Highway 6 for another ten or fifteen miles when just on the East side of Current Summit at the Nye and White Pine County Line we observed two more sets of amber lights behaving in the same manner as the first set.  I do not know if these objects where merely the same as the ones we&rsquo;d seen earlier or a different set altogether.  These objects hovered over the trees of the Humbolt National Forest at about fifteen feet.  They were only about two miles to the North of us we again &ldquo;blacked out&rdquo; and observed the lights which had to be aware of us at this point.  We observed for only a few minuets because one of the objects disappeared and the other seemed to be distracting us by hovering in plane view.  Since it is said that curiosity killed the cat my feline compatriot and I decided drive away as fast as was safe. I cannot say that this was my first experience with these objects.  I grew up in this area and this experience marks the fifth time I had seen these lights.  I was 15 the first time and I had been traveling the same stretch of highway with my grandmother.  After we had seen the object and it disappeared my grandmother told me that she had been seeing the lights since the early nineteen thirties in the same area and that most people just didn&rsquo;t talk about them. I can say that I am very concerned about these objects.  I have tried to rationalize what I had seen before as military test aircraft.  However the area where I&rsquo;ve seen these objects is about a hundred miles from the Tonapah military test range and I would assume that the US military would want to keep top secret craft within secure airspace. There have been reports of cattle mutilation in the area as well. I have to say that whatever these objects are they worry me.  I cannot fathom what their intentions might be; frankly that&rsquo;s what scares me.", "Me and my father&apos;s girlfriend were walking back form the store when what we seen what we thought was an airplane flying extrmely close to the gorund but it was to big to be an airplane.  It was lit up all around in green flashing lights and one huge yellow light in the middle of it.  It took of extremely fast followed by another aircraft that looked exactly like it following this unidentifed flying object.  It was extrmely insane because they were both so huge and neither of them made a noise.  They were traveling extremely fast and went pretty far but the lights were so bright we could still see them.  They then shot into the air and the yellow light that wa sin the middle of it got tinier and tinier until it dissapered.", "Cigar shaped craft stopped overhead - burned circle later in yard.I was a young child &amp; my mother and I were walking in the yard of the family home when we saw a cigar-shaped craft emerge over the mountain behind our house (from the North). It got our attention because there were no wings! We watched as it moved towards the South. As it passed over us, it stopped and rotated to what appeared to be a vertical position &amp; began to glow brightly for several seconds (minutes?). Altitude was at least many hundred (thousand?) feet as it was above the surrounding mountains. Eventually it rotated back to a horizontal position and moved off away from us to the Southeast. This was a distinct directional change from the original path it had been taken. During this entire event, there was no sound - another thing that we found odd. Several weeks (months?) later, I remember my parents discussing a strange burned circle in the yard, in almost the exact location where my mother &amp; I had been standing. Seems like it was roughly 10&apos; in diameter but that could be innaccurate based on the memories of a 7 or 8 year girl from more than 30 years ago! It was several years before grass grew again in that location.", "Bright Green Ball Falls From Sky (and other sightings)I have been thinking of writing here for a long time now.. But just haven&rsquo;t had the guts to put it into writing I guess lol.. But I guess since no one knows who I am.. I will contribute!!  On my birthday, November 14, 2007.. I left work at 5pm. It was a really foggy night. I drove down Hwy 49 towards the beach in Gulfport and about 5 or 6 blocks from the beach, I saw a large green &quot;fireball&quot; shoot down from the sky and behind the Hancock Bank building - out of sight. I know I wasn&rsquo;t the only one to see this. It took my breath for a second and I looked around after it was out of sight and noticed that all of the cars around me had kind of hit their brakes as I did and slowed down a little. This only lasted a couple of seconds and like I said, it was pretty foggy, but I could see it clearly. The fog just made the green glow around it brighter. Tonight,  December 4, 2007, my daughter just tells me that on her way home to Vancleave, she saw the same thing. She said she and her boyfriend were driving home on O&rsquo;neal road in Vancleave and they both saw what she described as &quot;like a shooting star,&quot; but bright green.. And &quot;way too big to be a shooting star.&quot;She said it fell straight down and sort of just disappeared. I don&rsquo;t know what it was, or have any kind of explanation for it, but it was amazing!  I saw the same thing once before when we lived in Vancleave off of Jim Ramsey Rd. My daughter&rsquo;s friend and I were so amazed at some lights that we saw in the sky (blinking red, green, yellow.. And moving in ways that normal aircraft don&rsquo;t move) that we actually, at the risk of looking crazy, got lawn chairs and sat in the front yard and watched for hours. While we were out there, this bright green &ldquo;fireball&rdquo; shot down out of the sky and into the empty lot across the street and just seemed to disappear somewhere between ground level and tree level. We both grabbed onto each other and it just took our breath away! We looked at each other in disbelief.. Just like &ldquo;did you see that too?&rdquo; Needless to say, we didn&rsquo;t sit out there very much longer.. We were both scared to death!  There were other things there at that house as well.. A light shining straight down (like a search light from a helicopter is the only way I could describe it) onto the middle of my street. Dogs were barking out of control as well. I saw this outside of my kitchen window. There were street lights there, but they went off when the light shone down on the street (like when your headlights hit the street lights and they go off sometimes). It moved around a little almost like it was looking for something. If it had been a helicopter.. THAT close to the ground.. There WOULD HAVE BEEN NOISE!! I was in shock.. And called to my daughter who was on the phone. She took one look and told her friend on the phone that it was the &ldquo;creepiest thing she had EVER SEEN&rdquo; and said she couldn&rsquo;t look anymore!  And another night, I was sleeping and my daughter and a different friend walked outside and explained seeing something else odd.. My daughter said &ldquo;have you ever seen a plane with so many lights?&rdquo; and her friend responded, &ldquo;have you ever seen a plane with so many lights flying so close to the ground?&rdquo; and they both kind of got scared and took off for the front door. They said that by the time they reached the front door, the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; was directly over the house.. Moving quickly.. And not making a sound!!  I have also read some of the other sightings in the area and can say that for quite some time, I have been seeing these &ldquo;things&rdquo; in the sky.. Distant, but not STAR distant. And they always have the same signature &ldquo;yellow, green and red lights&rdquo; flashing.     Sometimes they are in the same place, but other nights they have moved to different locations. I can usually see them outside of my house if I go out and look. A few nights ago, I watched one for about 30 minutes and then all of a sudden, it started to move like an airplane would.. Moved across the sky at a pretty fast speed, but no sound. And I can always hear the normal airplanes at even further distances here. And these things DO NOT MOVE LIKE REGULAR AIRCRAFT!!!  Every time I see anything strange, I call whoever I can get to come and look.. I told them I didn&rsquo;t want them to think I was &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; haha  And every time, they see exactly what I see.. My daughter and my son, daughter&rsquo;s boyfriend, my mother and my sister. Even an ex boyfriend whose dad is a pilot.. And he said he has seen strange things as well. So.. Whatever they are.. I can just hope that one of these days I will KNOW for SURE!!  And we are the typical family. I am a single mother of 2 teenagers.. I am an administrative assistant  and my kids are good kids who make good grades in school. As a matter of fact, I told them it might be better to keep it in the immediate family so as not to seem &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; to people who have never experienced these kinds of things. =P  Hopefully, in my lifetime, this can all be explained to me better than &ldquo;flares&rdquo; or &ldquo;weather balloons&rdquo; or &ldquo;satellites&rdquo;. ~ Curious in Mississippi", "Bright fast moving ball breaks in two falling on malahat summit - heavy RCMP presence in the areaTonight Dec 7 2007, my son calls me on his cell.....says he was driving northbound on hwy 1 approaching Goldstream when he has visual of a bright white (burning) light that breaks it two decending on the Malahat summit area.

I was too far away, and it was too dark out to see any sort of distinguishing marks, or the shape.  I assumed they were just planes, however they were moving very quickly towards each other.  All of a sudden the two separate flying objects had just become one.  There was no sound, or crash, or any sign of what one would assume to be a catastrophe in the sky.  The new &ldquo;morphed&rdquo; aircraft started flying in a straight line across the sky.  I also noticed it was moving more quickly than the average plane.The sighting took place in Michigan, it was about 40-50 degrees out.

About 5 minutes went by, then they began to appear again, only this time there were four lights. They slowly appeared one, two, three, four then faded out the same. This time they seemed to be further away but were still appearing just South of us, even though we had still been driving.

I said to my dad &quot;what the hell is that?&quot; he looked and couldn&apos;t figure it out.  It wasn&apos;t a blimb it was very high in the sky, looked like a few miles which would have made the object 100-200 feet in length just glowing like a white tube.

We have just come from eating dinner in the greater Salt Lake City area, and were nearly home.My grandfather also lives in Eagle Mountain and was driving just a few minutes ahead of us in traffic.  We were driving west on S.R. 73 when my wife pointed out to me what appeared to be a row cars parked on the mountainside, facing us with their lights on.However, this row of lights was perfectly straight.  And within seconds it became clear that the row of lights was not on the ridgeline, but rising above it.  The thin horizontal row of non-colored lights was obviously in flight and heading toward us. Within moments a massive, black, triangular-shaped craft (with lights everywhere on the front and bottom) was flying over our car.  It was huge.  Amidst all of the regular looking bright lights, there was one red light on the bottom, and one blue light.  (Note:  These were NOT on the edges of the craft, like on the wingtips of a conventional plane, but just slightly offset from the center of the bottom of it.)  I rolled down the window, and could hear no sound as the craft flew directly overhead.(Relative to our direction of travel, it approached from the &ldquo;1 o&rsquo;clock&rdquo; position when it was just a thin line of lights, and after it crossed the highway and flew over us it was going toward the &ldquo;7 o&rsquo;clock&rdquo; position.) It was visible, start to finish for about 60 seconds. No other cars on the road appeared to slow down, pull over, or otherwise pay much attention to the craft, though, with it lit up as it was someone else had to have seen it. I would like to note that the craft would not have been noticeable, perhaps at all, if the lights had not been turned on.  It was dark at that time of night, and it would have blended in with the night sky if it simply would have turned its lights off.This was a jet-black colored triangle, with a slightly crescent moon-shaped rear.  My wife noticed what appeared to be a &lsquo;transparent bottom&rsquo; of some kind.  We could not see in it, but she at least got the feeling that perhaps it was designed for them to see out. To get an idea of size, if you had to hold something at arm&rsquo;s length to cover it up when it was overhead, you would have to hold a large piece of paper, perhaps 24&rdquo;x 24&rdquo;- at arm&rsquo;s length.  That &ldquo;might&rdquo; be big enough to block out how big this thing was when it was directly overhead. Lastly, my grandfather was arriving at the house when we were still on S.R. 73.  As I said before, he was about a 2 minute drive time ahead of us.  He can corroborate exactly the same object.  We live just off S.R. 73, so his vantage point was practically the same.He also reports that the huge craft made no sound as it glided over.", "Dimly lit triangular shaped object moves slowly high above Carlsbad State Beach Sat. evening 12/29/07Four adults and 2 children witnessed a strangely lit, triangular shaped object quietly traverse the night sky above Carlsbad State Beach.

I turned my attention towards the bright glowing light to my north and it was no longer heading away from me, it was moving towards the east towards the explosion of star-like dust.  As this bright object was approaching the east I notice two objects shoot out from the east where the starry dust came from.  One of the objects headed towards the far east traveling south and the other headed towards the object that was flying in from the north east.  The large starry like object started to lose its brightness.  Again, another star-like object fell from the sky in the same area where the first star-like object fell.  There were other planes in the area that had flashing red and blue lights and I knew for a fact that it was not a plane or commercial plane messing around in this area at this particular time.  I sat in my car and notified the York County Police of this incident.  There was nothing they could do so they gave me a number to call to report this matter.  After 15 minutes all three objects were out of sight.  I proceeded up my driveway to the west and noticed yet another occurrence happening as I reached the hilltop.  There were 3 tiny objects, silver in color bouncing off of each other in the random direction but in a closed radius.  I did not look behind me to see where the other objects were located and if they were a part of the same similar occurrence.  All three object disappeared in a cloud of sparkling dust.

The lights seemed to pulse outwards a little, but mainly they seemed to have more depth going inward.  These lights didn&rsquo;t dissipate like normal lights. They seemed to have very defined edges.  When the lights pulsed &ldquo;on&rdquo;, I could see a light colored gray area between the two lights.  The color between the lights were a light gray and looked smooth.  Underneath the lights I could see that there was something underneath the lights (similar to the area between the lights) that became more narrow the further it went.  The lights were not moving at all.  They were a little higher than the tree lines.  I wanted to stop to get a better look, but I had a feeling of unexplained dread and anxiety.  My two children also saw all of this.  When I couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore (because my car was moving) and the lights were out of my field of vision, I straightened my car back in my driving lane.

I quickly called my wife who is currently in Canada, and she went outside and saw the same glowing cloud.

But this appeared to be drifting toward the east very slowly, but too fast to be a comet.

It was absolutely silent and was moving at an altitude of approx. 50 to 100 feet above our heads. The only light associated with the object was a very fuzzy glow around the perimeter of the object.

They saw 2 red lights descending towards the mountains. This seemed strange to them and as thay observed more closely they described realizing that it was a single very large (aporox 1/4mile perhaps longer in length) elogated object due to the fact that as it moved it blacked out the stars between the two red lights. These lights ocasionally faded or brightened with changes in motion of the entire craft.They pulled over and got out of the car .. the object continued to move across the mountains occasionally descending behind and back up.  A loud noise was associated with the movement of the craft. One brother described the sound like a shotgun blast that lasted the whole time. The other brother described it as like the sound of an earthquake rumble/shock sound but louder. No vibrations or shockwaves were felt by either brothers.At one point the object stopped over the mountain top about 2 miles from their position and lit the mountainside with a very intese yellow light this lasted at least 15 seconds the light allowed them to see the mountainside in exceptional detail, sagebrush, trees, rocks.At this time another freind of theirs returning home to the same area pulled over beside them and observed the following.

I had been fishing with my father on the Dania Beach pier since midnight.

Behind this light, my father and I witnessed two contrails that were lit up by the moonlight, which seemed to chase this bright red light, which did not pulsate or change color. The light suddenly stopped for a second and lowered its elevation, made a quick maneuver to the right and continued south along the coast. The contrails could not keep pace with the light, which then again stopped, this time the orb seemed to expand and become brighter. It then bursted into many fine particles like an industrial firework, then this same process went into reverse and it seemed to implode and collapse on itself and then disappeared over the water. No sound was heard or did we see debris of any kind fall from the orb. My jaw just dropped and we could not believe what we had just witnessed. The contrails finally fizzed. In a matter of a minute we then witnessed two military jets fly into this area over the water. They were military because they had one red pulsing light on the fuselage and I grew up on an air force base and I am familiar with how fast they move.

I lost sight of the first one and then the second one and that was it. They were UFO&apos;s atleast from my prospective. What did I see? Anyone else report anything like this?", "A well definied red light, that looked electronic, drifted overhead and disappeared right above us.For the past few years, I have read about the reports of red lights being seen over the city of San Diego during both the 4th of July and New Year&rsquo;s Eve. I believed that due to a vast number of reports over the years, coming from all over town, that this must be a legitimate sighting. I believed that something really was being spotted by people in the skies over San Diego. The reports usually involved at least two red lights appearing high above the city at night. They appear to hover or drift slowly, lasting a few minutes, and then the red lights either flicker or fade out. It sounded like flares to me. The behavior seemed to mimic what they do. However, I wanted to hold my opinion until I saw it with my own eyes. Last night, I finally did. I brought a friend with me to Cowles Mountain, located near San Carlos and the Mission Trails Regional Park area. The summit has an elevation of 1591 feet. I figured this was the perfect location to see anything that might appear above San Diego&rsquo;s skies because I could see so many communities in and around the San Diego area, while still high above the city, close to everything. The majority of sightings seemed to occur around the Le Mesa area which we would also be very close to. There would be no missing it should the red lights appear in the same skies. We just hoped the weather would be clear, which luckily for us, it was. We arrived by the mountain side at 10:15pm. After grabbing our gear and locking up the truck, my friend and I started walking towards the entrance to the trail. We didn&rsquo;t get too far before I stopped and stared at a light directly above us. We hadn&rsquo;t even left the neighborhood street yet and there it was! Sure enough, I was staring at a single red light just hanging in the sky. My friend turned, wondering why I stopped and followed my gaze. He saw it too. We couldn&rsquo;t believe it. It wasn&rsquo;t even midnight yet. We hadn&rsquo;t even started our climb yet. We watched it, expecting to see it turn or flash some other lights that might identify it as a normal aircraft. The red light was clear and crisp in the sky. It didn&rsquo;t glow or appear fiery. It looked electronic to me. It was sharp. We watched it very slowly move to our right. Had this been a normal aircraft, only seeing a red light, it should have been going the opposite direction. The light should have been going left as on a normal aircraft. The left side light navigation light is red and the right side light is green. Seeing nothing but a red light, It should have flown to our left. The red light was instead drifting right. That was the other thing. It was drifting. It was traveling way too slow for a normal aircraft as well. It moved so slow in the sky that a normal plane would have stalled. It seemed to hesitate and bob in the sky as well. It flew a certain direction, but it wasn&rsquo;t a perfectly straight line. I thought it might be a trick of my eyes at first, so as I watched it, I compared it&rsquo;s movement to the stars behind it and a palm tree that rose up into the sky near it. It really did appear to be inconsistent in it&rsquo;s forward movement. There was no sound. Even watching it, I was thinking, &ldquo;Balloon. That&rsquo;s gotta be something attached to a balloon.&rdquo;  We watched it move to our right, directly overhead, towards the mountain. This was flying in a NW direction. More specifically, I would have to say the object was directly over Navajo RD and just past Boulder Lane Ave flying towards the northwest. Quickly, I swung the backpack off my back and set on the trunk of a parked car. I fumbled for the video camera I had packed. I wasn&rsquo;t ready. I was expecting to climb the mountain, have time to settle in, and break the camera out when I was ready nearing midnight. I didn&rsquo;t expect that I would see it so soon! I fumbled in the dark for the zipper, but I didn&rsquo;t want to take my eyes off it either, so I wasn&rsquo;t able to get my camera right away. While I did this, the light dimmed. My friend commented that, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going up.&rdquo; It appeared to be the case, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was going upwards or if the light had a direction to it and now was turning away from us, so that it appeared to dim. Watching a fainter light now, it did appear to raise up higher into the sky for me too. Before I could hit record and zoom in, it faded away completely. The light was gone. The two of us stood there and kept our eyes on the same general spot in the sky. We couldn&rsquo;t see anything there any more. There was nothing was moving. There was no light, no silhouette of an aircraft with it&rsquo;s lights off. Nothing. There was only the stars of a clear night sky with nothing to be seen in the air at all. We began out trek up Cowles Mountain. As we walked up the long fire road, we occasionally looked back up into the sky, hoping to see something like that again, and we discussed what we had seen. I was certain that the light was actually lower than it seemed. The very first thing I tried to gauge was how close the object may have been to us. A lot of people say that the lights are really high up in the sky. I actually got the impression that the light we saw was a lot lower to the ground than it may have seemed. I thought the object was only as high as the mountain itself, of maybe a little bit higher but not by much. So, I would say it was under 3000 feet. Saying that, that would also mean the object was really small. I thought the object could not have been any larger than the size of a tire. I also thought that I could see a vague shape behind it, like it was attached to something. However, it didn&rsquo;t expand beyond the light much so it was very hard to see. I thought I saw a dark enough shadow behind it to be something attached to it and I&rsquo;ll be honest, it did look triangular shaped. The red light was on one point, towards the back of the direction it was moving. I will not report this as a triangular sighting, however, as the light is the only thing I&apos;m sure about. My friend disagreed on a few points. He didn&apos;t see anything behind the light. To him, the light also appeared to be much higher. He did think that it was high up in the sky, above 3000 feet. He thought it was high enough for other planes to possibly see and be up near. I asked him about the size and he thought it had to be something closer to the size of a car, maybe 6 feet wide. We pretty much agreed on everything else, though, including movement and speed. I told my friend that I was sure it was a prank, still. The light didn&rsquo;t do anything &ldquo;out of this world.&rdquo; I thought there was still possible explanations for it. I told my friend that, in my opinion, someone somehow attached a red light to a balloon and released it into the air. The wind that night was blowing in the same general direction the light was going. However, there are some things I wonder, like how the light went out. We watched the sky for a while. If the light was simply on a string, it should have turned to face us again. It never reappeared. I also find it hard to believe that it would simply go out after being released into the sky. It wasn&rsquo;t a flare because we were close enough to it, we should have been able to see smoke, a flickering of light, or some fiery effect. It wasn&rsquo;t a glow stick because it didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;glow.&rdquo; There was nothing vague about the light. It was sharp and clear, like a bright bulb, unwavering in it&rsquo;s brightness. It only dimmed before fading out. We watched flares later that night. I pointed out to my friend how flares were different. We were given plenty of examples as people near and far fired flared into the sky for new years. The flares were much brighter. The red light would be suddenly real bright in the sky, burn with a fiery effect, even have a hot pink fluorescent glow to it as it drifts back down towards the ground. This object was definitely not a flare. We ruled that out. We&rsquo;re pretty sure it&rsquo;s a prank, we just couldn&rsquo;t explain how it simply vanished right over us. To add more weirdness to the night, the very next time I checked my watch to check the time, the light inside it died. That could have been a coincidence. It is an older digital watch, but some people like to know about electronic things failing during UFO sights.  That actually did happen, so I&rsquo;m reporting it, but I think it&rsquo;s just an odd coincidence there too. Nothing else was seen by us for the rest of the night, to our disappointment. We did get to see fireworks all over the city. It was cool spending New Year&rsquo;s up there. It&rsquo;s an amazing view, but no other unexplained lights appeared anywhere over the city that we could see. I was hoping that if it was a prank, that what we had seen was a test, perhaps planned before they would release more lights into the sky right at midnight, but that never happened. It was just that weird red light at 10:15pm over San Carlos. My friend and I are in our mid-to-late twenties. I have investigated UFOs for a short while and was in the Navy as a trained observer for close to 6 years. I extended and got out with an honorable discharge. I currently work security for a tele-communications company in the San Diego area where I have lived for the past 10 years now.", "A Redish purple teardrop shape ufo.It massive, huge, amazing, and frightning.

K and C proceeded to drive over to his house to witness the light for themselves. However, as they neared the trailer park where he lives they noticed a strange contrast in the night sky and its coloration. On the left side of the street the sky was purest black. On the right side the sky was orange with a white strip across the bottom and darker as we looked higher up. As we drove through the trailer park the sky on our right proceeded to grow more orange. The previous orange shade intensified. Driving down the streets of the trailer park any where the vehicle went the streetlights around it dimmed and continued to do so until we drove away. As we drove out of the trailer park the sky seemed to darken and the orange light gathered behind C&apos;s car. Driving down the main street back to K&apos;s house we were stopped by a train. A light that was previously white was now yellow and while K and C were waiting for the train to pass other colors started to appear mixed in with the yellow. C rolled her window down to see if it might have been the fog that was starting to roll in. It wasn&apos;t. She asked a car on the other side of her and the occupants of the vehicle said they did not see any light. K and C both saw the light. The train passed and we drove on. The fog had gathered to become slightly obscurant and thus we missed her street the first time around. We drove a few more feet to the roundabout and turned around. We turned onto the correct street and stopped for approximately 3 seconds to roll the window up. There was a shadow behind the car yet when K and C looked there was no one, and nothing. There was likewise nothing there as we pulled away.

Overhead was a huge triangled shaped craft with blinking lights.  It glided silently over the top of the house and then over the town going south towards Austin.  I waited for some sort of sound but there was none.  The silver glistened as the light bounced off it.  It was gliding very slow and very low over the trees tops.

Realizing that Venus is normally the brightest object in the sky, I assumed it must be a plane and stared at it for a bit to see if it was moving.  It did appear to be approaching so I kept trying to make my eyes focus on it.  Rather than one bright light as I am accustomed to seeing on airplanes in the early morning, this object appeared to have a ring of several lights, not exactly in a circle formation, but more like a closed half-circle.  I heard nothing, even though this object seemed to be fairly low.I woke my husband to see if his eyes could make this object look like something we had seen before, but he agreed that the lights seemed to form this half-circle.  To be honest, I could not make my 45 year-old eyes focus well enough to count the lights, but there only seemed to be four or five at most.  As we watched it together for the next minute or so, it suddenly disappeared.

As we were laying in bed getting ready to go to sleep, A bright white light came through the ceiling and landed upon us.  We were both immediately paralyzed and filled with a sensation of peace and happiness, a feeling well beyond anything from this world. It filled us and the room for approx. 15 seconds before leaving through the ceiling.  After we were able to move, I asked him if he seen and felt &quot;that&quot; and he said that he did.

A friend and I were in submarine school at the time. We were stationed at Submarine base Groton CT. The two of us were scared to death to say anything until now. He is not aware I have submitted this report, but I am confident he saw the same things as I did, as we talked about it both during the event and many times after.The night began after eating chow at the hall. It was not dark yet, we left the base at appx 7:00 pm. Being on foot we walked the road along the river. We soon found a spot on some rocks not far from the base right on the river. We were enjoying good weather as it was clear and warm outside. Nothing appeared to be any differnt than any other night. The sun went down darkness fell upon us. We both had taken up spots on rocks not far apart, laying down relaxing looking up at the sky.It seemed as if it was in an instance three color changing orbs appeared in the sky in a triangle formation. These orbs moved back and forth across the river in formation. They moved with the speed of light going across the river. Doing this manuver, stopping on a dime, all the time maintaining thier formation. I am not sure if thier were three or this was just one object. The whole event duration was only twenty five minutes in length. In the time frame indicated ten differnt movements across the river appearing to be looking for something. The blink of an eye they were gone disappearing in the night sky again with the speed of light.We were scared to death to talk about this or tell anyone. Fearing what might happen or people thinking we were just crazy. I know what power the goverment wields and how they deal with issues like this. Until now I never understood what they were looking for but now it is clear. The Submarine Base just down the road had in port subs. This now I am confident whatever weapons they contained was what they were looking for. News of any objects in the sky that night was not publicized nor did we ever hear of it. It has been many years but I still recall events on that night as it happened yesterday.I think someone should know about this now. It was as real as I am writting this today.

Then after the plane noise died away, I could hear a strange noise that sounded like something being dragged on the ground, but it was loud and coming from above. Immediately after that, a bright green light appeared in the sky, out to the West. It hovered in the sky for a moment, then disappeared as it fell below the roof level of the house in front of mine. The only reason it didn&apos;t seem like a flare was that it was much larger, and didn&apos;t leave a trail as it moved. My husband, who was in the house, also witnessed the  sphere through a window.

I was not able to capture a photo, but when I saw the one provided at Puget Sound, I realized that it was the same object.I have seen this object on several occasions for the past year, always in the early morning.  But, there are always two of the objects; one followed a moment or two after the first.Until this morning, they always appeared as an almost pinpoint circular object traveling at a high rate of speed, with approximately an inch-wide (from my vantage point) vapor trail.Hills and mountains surround me.  The direction of the first object is from the Southern sky traveling North West.  The second object comes from a bit more South West direction, heading North West also, with the same width vapor trail.My daughter, niece, and grandson have witnessed these sightings and it was during the summer months.For the past few days, the dogs in our neighborhood have been howling late at night and in the early morning hours.  Late last night when they howled, I ignored the dogs as usual.  This morning their howling woke me up.  I went to the bathroom, came back and noticed the moonlight in my room.  I went to the window to look at the full moon.It was 5:22 am and I saw a vapor trail traveling from the North Western sky.  I was looking out of my North West window that is facing a bright full moon.  The moon was at a 45-degree angle from the horizon.   Visibility was 3 miles.  The stars were brilliant.  Our altitude in Mountain House is 160 feet.I witnessed the object from my loft space, which is approximately 20 feet high. The object was traveling this time from North West heading in a Southern direction and it was only when it traveled in front of the moon that I could see that it was a RED fiery circular object.When it left the light of the moon, it appeared as a pinpoint circular object again.  The sound that it made was high pitch and similar to a vacuum cleaner whirring, unlike commercial aircraft or jets engines.  It appeared to be traveling from the horizon up into the sky.I went outside and saw the object continuing it&rsquo;s Southern path.  I couldn&rsquo;t hear the sound anymore because it was traveling higher in the sky.As with the Pugent Sound sighting, there has been increased helicopter activity over this tiny community, often in pairs searching in the exact location where we&rsquo;ve seen the UFOs.I believe these objects to be unlike any aircraft that is known and I respectfully submit this sighting as being genuine in nature.Thank you for the opportunity to share this experience. ============================== PUGET SOUND, WASHINGTON STATE, MONDAY, MAR 5 2007 AT 19:15 HRS The National UFO Reporting Center received three reports of a peculiar, red object, which was observed from multiple points on the western side of Puget Sound.

Just short of 2:00, while driving home from work, I witnessed strange lights in my rear-view mirror. At first, I thought it was a police car pulling me over for a routine traffic stop, but that was not the case. When I came to a stop sign, I looked back, and I saw the lights floating in the air. I put my vehicle in park and stepped outside of my vehicle to get a better look and that&rsquo;s when I saw the shape of the craft. It was a triangular shaped craft. The points of the triangle were rounded. The lights, the color that I can only explain as being a &ldquo;yellow that was almost white&rdquo;, were just on the inside of the angle of the points.  The craft appeared to be rotating, floating still in the air. From where I was parked, the craft appeared to be approximately five hundred meters away, in area on the outskirts of my town, known as Meadow Creek, which is on the south end of town.  From where I was, the craft appeared to be approximately the size of a small sedan; perhaps the size of mine (Chevrolet Corsica). After witnessing the craft, I immediately rushed home to grab my digital camera to take a picture of it. When I returned to where I had seen the craft, it was gone.  This report is being filled out at 2:25 on the same day that I witnessed the craft, so I do not know if there are any other witnesses to this craft.

I have been a police officer for 17 yrs, have seen many extraordinary things, but I am still in shock over what my 2 sons and I witnessed. On the 8th of January 2008 at approximately 1920 hrs. I went outside to gather some firewood, looked across my property which sits on a hill facing the northeast, with a view of approximately 8-10 miles. I noticed these extremely bright orange or flame colored lights rising 300-500 feet above the horizon. The lights were horizontally aligned and spanned an area quite wide. I noticed they would disappear for a few seconds and would appear again at different heights as if they were in sporadic rows. The lights would come and go in various numbers ranging from as little as two and as many as 12. I became intrigued with the lights and called my 15 yo son as well as my 18 yo son to come outside and view them. I suggested to my sons that it might possibly be a fire off in the distance, but recanted as the lights progressively reached greater heights. I went as far as calling the Williamson County Sheriffs Office to see if a fire or something of  that  nature had been reported in the area of the lights. This call was documented and a Deputy was sent to check the area around 1941 hrs. We attempted to get photos of the lights but where unable. The lights disappeared shortly after the call to Williamson County S.O.  I would like to re-iterate the size and brightness of the object rivals nothing of man-made proportions, and my 2 sons could somewhat compare the brightness to the oil drilling rigs you see far offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.

The sky was clear and I had enjoyed beautiful meteor showers all evening while listening to a Utah-Hawaii football game earlier. I was pulling a slight grade and moving rather slow. Suddenly, what appeared as a meteor appeared straight in front of me but this one was coming straight at me instead of moving across the sky!  The object was moving at a high rate of speed, leaving a bright green trail in the sky behind it.  My first thought came out loud, very loud &ldquo;Holy s**t this thing is gonna hit me!!&rdquo;  My first instinct was to get into the breakdown lane and stop.  The object however, stopped directly in front of me.  I would guess the distance at approximately 1 mile, more on this later.  Being night, it was very hard to &ldquo;guess&rdquo; the distance, but the object was quite large and shaped exactly like tops that I had as a kid, the kind you wrapped string around and tossed out to spin.  I immediately looked at my watch and clock, set at PST and checked where the moon was &ndash; behind me. I turned my headlights off and sat and watched the object through my windshield for a full 11 minutes.  It did not wobble or move about but sat stock still and emit an orange colored light similar to some street lights you see.  There was no definite outline, just a top shaped dark color inside the light.  At the widest part, just below the tapered top was a darker line. Windows perhaps?  After watching the object for a few minutes, I flashed my marker lights a few times.  After another couple of minutes I flashed my headlights three times.  Not getting any response I just sat and stared, I know any one there should have seen my lights, as I was the only vehicle on the road. I remember getting the impression that the object seemed to glower, maybe from a slight pulsation of the light.  My windows were down, and I shut my motor off.  There was just dead silence, not even night sounds of animals or anything else &ndash; very eerie. Suddenly a very bright white light shot out of the bottom tip of &ldquo;top&rdquo; and shone straight down steadily and the object just slowly sank out of sight.  I was alone again. After sitting for a few more minutes trying to digest what I had just seen, I fired my rig back up, turned my lights on.  Right in front of me was a view area sign.  I pulled up to the view area and went in, turned my rig around so I could see where the object had been.  I shut &lsquo;er down again and took a look around.  There were a couple of other rigs and a few motor homes there but everyone was asleep.  I sat and had a pipe and a cup of coffee, waiting to see if it would come back up.  After an hour of walking around and stretching, I decided to go to bed. Next morning I took a walk around the area.  There were deep, ragged canyons all over the place.  I took off for Green River again.  Approximately 1 mile up the road was a bridge over a very, very deep canyon/river.  This canyon ran directly toward the area where I saw the object sink down, so I am assuming this is where my &ldquo;top&rdquo; went down.", "Nighttime rendevous turns into a UFO sightingI was with my boyfriend sitting in his car in a field.  We were in the backseat of his car when I noticed a strange light come from outside.  I sat up and opened the door against my boyfriends wishes, he wanted to continue or little rendevous.  So I looked out and a bright light flashed in the sky again.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but it was such an odd shape and color.  It was diamond shaped with a pointed front in back, or so it looked and it emitted a silvery glow. It last for about 30 seconds and disappeared.", "A collection of flashing lights moving quickly across the sky.  Too many to be airplanes.My wife was coming home with our 9-year-old daughter  from her dance class. We live right on edge of the desert, and as my wife and daughter pulled up to the driveway, my daughter said, &quot;Mommy why are those stars blinking?&quot; My wife looked and says it appeared the Little Dipper was blinking.  They then realized the stars were moving some staying.  Some moving. Some up. Some Down. They appeared to be traveling from the northwest to the southeast.   When I saw them they were at a far distance and heading in the direction of Mountain Home Air Force Base. Wife&apos;s account- When I first saw these &quot;twinkling stars&quot; they appeared to be at about an 80 degree angle from the street on which I was driving.  I watched them for about 2 minutes.  They did not change their course.  It looked to me like the Little Dipper blinking in the sky.  By the time I got my husband outside to see what we were seeing, the &quot;Little Dipper&quot; had quit blinking, but there were still blinking lights in the not-so-far distance.  My first thought was that these were the lights of an airport tower - a signal warning airplanes about aerial lines or an upcoming runway.  But I then realized that in the more than five years that I&apos;ve lived at this house, I have never seen towers.  Another thought was that it was several airplanes in the sky.  The lights were too many and too close to be airplane lights.  About 10 minutes after the sighting I went to get the mail and noticed what appeared to be a military helicopter flying above the desert where the lights were seen flashing.", "Two small flying steel spheresSubject: 2 small round UFO&rsquo;s sighted  When:  near end of summer &amp; start of fall 2007  Where:  Mansfield, Ohio  While sitting with my cat at N.W. corner of house, I looked up to notice a &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; of dragonflies all around a &ldquo;ball&rdquo; floating above that corner of the house. I moved slightly to block the sun&rsquo;s glare with the gutter, and had a clear view from 8&rsquo; to 10&rsquo; away of what looked like a metal ball - solid, perfectly round &amp; smooth and the size of a baseball. It started moving slowly to my left with the dragonflies moving with it. I tried to rationalize what I am seeing as a bubble or seed pod - but it was not a fuzzy outline - but a solid perfectly round ball. I looked around for anything else in the sky, but don&rsquo;t see anything. Continuing to watch the object, a 2nd ball - identical to the first  (but with no dragonflies) moved slowly into view on the same track and height reducing the distance between the two until just above me - then it went straight up vertical from horizontal at a right angle increasing speed slightly (maybe x 2) as the first object continued on same track &amp; height. I was astonished that I had seen something that shouldn&rsquo;t be there. Since I had observed this for maybe a full minute and so close, I didn&rsquo;t run to the front of the house to get another look as I had already seen it very clearly and didn&rsquo;t really want to draw attention to myself.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I (age 59) and my adult daughter and her boyfriend witnessed the same 1 mile long UFO, on January 9, 2008. It was about 6.30 pm, and the sky was already dark. I noticed a few aircraft in the sky, and then 2 cluster of lights, one cluster far behind the first one, but in identical path and following at identical speed. Then I realized that, even though the lights were far away, that it was one very large object, since it took up nearly one third of the sky. It wasn&apos;t going very fast, maybe 50 miles per hr. yet, at that height, while maybe only 1000 ft. up, it may have been going faster. It took about 5 minutes to go from the SE to the NW, and that was the precise direction. 2. The curious thing is that while I didn&apos;t see any aircraft around it, there was maybe 9 or 10 aircraft in the sky, about 10 minutes later (I had went inside for about that long).These aircraft were going in various directions, as if searching for the object (as if they could miss it -lol). Then the following day, there was nearly as many jets in the sky, -all producing contrails- and all day long. This was near Okmulgee, Oklahoma. 3. I didn&apos;t consider reporting this until I saw the news article at the &quot;coast the coast&quot; website, in reference to the West Texas sightings. I had hoped that more Oklahomans would have reported this. I had saw two ufos many years ago, around 1983, at nite, about 30 miles west of Okmulgee. These were similiar to other reported objects, which traveled and then stop at the same time, and then shot off in opposite directions, going extremely fast, leaving long smoke trails. I was a total non-believer until I saw these objects. I haven&apos;t actively sought seeing such objects, and didn&apos;t think I would see another ufo, especially one that was at least 1 mile long. And curiously, though I was in awe of the object, I did not have any fear (though I cannot say the same for my daughter&apos;s boyfriend). I had hear about a very large object being seen by others, while listening to &quot;coast to coast.&quot; As well as the TV report of the large object in Phoenix several years ago. (I had wanted to see such an object, but very much doubted that I would. So this was a major surprise, as well as a wish fulfilled. And while I realize that psychologically, some would say that I subconsiously sought such, the fact that many others in Texas also saw the object confirms that this was not psychologically based. As well as my daughter and her boyfriend seeing such.)  4. And though I have told some people about these 2 incidents, I haven&apos;t had any experiences that have been disturbing. I do not seek to investigate such phenomena. I prefer to think of the ufos as being explainable, viz. part of the earth, or some advanced technology by human geniuses, or natural esoteric realities, such as angels and ghosts. Some relatives have seen the ufos that dance in the nite sky (while vacationing in northern Arizona), though possibly these may be remote controlled objects, or some intelligent phasma. They had not seen any unusual objects until recent years. To be sure, I have been a non-drinker all my life, and have never been &quot;on drugs.&quot; Nor have those relatives done so. Curiously, I would say that only 1 out of every 5 people are willing to talk about such, even after 5 persons have seen such objects, at the same time. Again, I hope there are more reports of this particular object, and detailed descriptions((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The time was around 10:30 p.m. and the sky was crystal clear and full of stars.  A few miles south of Forsyth, I noticed a light over the interstate approximately a mile or two ahead of me.  Because it was brighter than the stars &ldquo;behind&rdquo; it, I fixed my gaze on it as I made my way south.  I immediately noticed that it wasn&rsquo;t moving in ANY direction like an airplane would with its blinking lights.  So, I thought it might be a helicopter with a bright front light.  It&rsquo;s not unusual to see one hovering overhead day or night. However&hellip;as I approached this hovering light, I noticed that it wasn&rsquo;t one light&hellip;there were actually two lights.  They were large, round, white, and spaced apart like headlights of a car.  (In fact, that was the image I described later to my co-workers that night&mdash;-like a car hovering 500 to 600 ft. over I-75.)  My heart started racing when I realized this hovering object didn&rsquo;t have any blinking lights of normal aircraft, the two lights were oddly spaced far apart (maybe 20-30ft ???), and it wasn&rsquo;t moving at all.  It just seemed to hang there over the interstate facing north.  I couldn&rsquo;t make out a specific body shape or identify any specific dimensions.  I wondered, &ldquo;Do any of these other cars see this thing, or is it just me?&rdquo;  Other drivers MUST have seen it because it was so close to the ground and the lights were so prominent. As I drove under the object, I tried to take a picture of it with my camera phone&hellip;b/c that&rsquo;s all I had with me, other than a stethoscope.  Unfortunately, all that captured was a dark screen (night sky) with one of the &ldquo;lights&rdquo; in the very bottom corner of the screen.  Apparently I am unable to photograph UFOs and drive at the same time. :)  I&rsquo;ll end this by noting that I am a very conservative, analytical and typically skeptical person by nature.

The object appeared to be two interconnected rings of lights on a single object spinning around a &quot;fixed&quot; center.  The pattern of lights was somewhat gyroscopic moving around an unidentifiable central shape.  The object moved rapidly across the sky.  Two people passed it off as airplane lights.  However, the rings were clearly moving around one central object and unlike anything I or the other guests have ever witnessed.  There was no trail of light or sound that accompanied the object.  The object also appeared to move faster than a typical plane, was very hight in the sky, and was not in a typical flight pattern for Los Angeles or Santa Monica Airports.  The height of the object made the rings difficult to make out.  However, on close study, there were two clearly defined rings of light moving about a central object.

I observed one airliner jet manuveur in direct course with said object to a point that, from a point of my visibility, no more than 10 miles. The object disappeared before the airliner could get close enough. A second appearance occured after the airliner was out of my sight. It appeared to be in the same place. At this time, it was very odd that the airliner had altered it&apos;s course to intercept the object. On the second appearance, there where two Air Force Jets that were enroute( one from the east and one from the west).The object only remained stationary for about thirty seconds. The two jets came close to the object, but did not intercept it. Before the jets had reached the object, it(the light object)made a quick flash to the left and diappeared again. The two Air Force jets turned opposite of their own path. I remained outside for any other appearance for several minutes.

The  sky was clear around the object with dark clouds on the horizon. The object was of a large glowing white sphere shape. As we looked, the middle main lights of the object stood still while it was turning and spinning lights around its edges.  I would say that its edges were shining and spitting somewhat like a &quot;4th of July&quot; sparkler would be shooting/sending out lights. After we watched for about 25 to 30 seconds, all the lights went out at once and the object disappeared before our eyes.   I made a quick grab for my binoculars and looked around the entire clear sky but could not find any dark object whatsoever.  This object never moved from that spot nor made a sound (that we could hear) while we watched.We have lived in this same condo unit for 19 years and have seen many planes and helicopters fly over the water every day and night, but we have never seen another object like what we saw on this night.

All of a sudden all the power went off in my house and in the surrounding area. This happens once or twice a year in this area called the Wenas Valley which is just north of Selah, Washington. I continued what I was doing for about another 10-15 minutes until I noticed a really bright shinning object came straight down out of the clouds. It was about a mile away from me just below the mountain range. It stopped and hovered silently for about 60 seconds and then moved west about &frac14; of a mile and stopped again and just hovered. Then it came towards me about &frac14; of a mile and stopped again. It stayed there about 30 seconds and then shot straight up back into the clouds. This all happened around 2PM in the afternoon on a overcast day where it had been raining about an hour I called 911 to report this and to also see if anyone else had turned in a similar report. Know one had, but the operator said she would call me back if anyone else did. After that I called the power company to report the outage and know one had reported it yet. About 15 minutes later my power came back on. I told a few people about this and they advised me to say no more.

Complex lighting system and lack of conventional engine noise.Jan. 03, 2008  To whom it may concern:  I would like to report a sighting. The sighting event started at approximately 12:20am this morning January 03, 2008. Before going to bed last night I stepped outside on our front porch. We live in a rural residential neighborhood outside of the Charlotte, NC area. Temperature was in the 30&rsquo;s and it was a clear night. We are on a cul-de-sac so there was no traffic or other noise. I began to notice on the horizon a bright white light approaching from the south and being familiar with CLT landing pattern assumed it was a larger jet on approach. The light did not appear to be moving towards the airport but directly towards me. I kept waiting for the noise of a jet, but then began to expect hearing a copter noise because of how slow the object was moving. It all of a sudden seemed then to be moving perpendicular to my location in front of me. This craft appeared to be &frac14; to &frac12; mile away from me and an estimated 800 ft. in altitude.  It was hard to get a perspective of the size because it was dark but judging by the lights I would estimate maybe 75 ft long by 20 ft high. I am not sure of width because of direction traveling. The most fascinating observations about this sighting were the lights on the craft and the lack of noise. In regards to the noise, there was a faint hum/rumble, I say rumble because I could tell and felt that it was powerful. The lighting on the craft was very foreign to me. I have been pursuing my pilot&rsquo;s and flown with my father for the past twenty-five years so I am familiar with plane/copter lighting configurations. On the front of the craft, which appeared to compose &frac14; of its height was a bright white light, but it wasn&rsquo;t white. It looked like one of the H.I.D (High Intensity Discharge) lighting systems found on higher end vehicles these days. The intensity however was much stronger that automobile types. This light appeared to move along the side of the craft from front to half way down the length of the craft in a sweep. It would do this slowly back and forth. In the middle belly of ! the craf t there looked to be a strobe and red light. The main body and tail/aft section had four red lights staggered in a diamond. On the rear there was a bright white/blue light. This describes the craft from what I saw and the light configuration on the craft. Again, the lack of engine noise was very impressive. The craft moved slowly away from my sight and then turned north and disappeared at a quicker pace and I heard more rumble, but not that of a turbine jet engine.  The entire sighting lasted approximately ten minutes.", "I saw a bright blue disc flying through the sky south of Charlotte, NC.I was driving north on I-77 towards Charlotte at shortly before 8:00 PM EST.  The sky was very clear and I had been looking at the moon and stars when all of a sudden a bright, neon blue disk just apparated out of nowhere.  It was spinning, and then it shot off at incredible speed to what must have been the northeast. It was only visible for about five seconds. It moved faster than a plane could. Incredible.", "3 Large circular objects over North MiamiI was in an area of North Miami called San Souci Blvd. I was sitting in the living room of a friends apartment on the 3rd floor. The living room faced the balcony that overlooked the tennis courts. All of the sudden the balcony and part of the living room floor turned bright orange. I thought that was strange, as I opened the balcony door I heard people yelling (I could not remember what they were saying). Everyone was looking at the sky. As I looked up all I can see was that the sky was being covered by something light orange. As I looked at it I really did not understand what it was. I looked at the people on the tennis courts and some of them were running inside the building while a few stayed there point up. I remember looking up and down several times. It covered the whole horizon. I could not see where it ended. It must have been a few 100 ft above me. About 20 seconds into the experience, it started to move straight up at a great speed with no noise. I would say another 10 seconds later I noticed the outline of what seemed to be a circle with an outer ring and a glowing orange/red center. It moved straight up at a great speed. My eyes started to water because I could not stay focus on the object. Soon afterwards I noticed two more similiar objects one on each side for a total of three. As it was moving up it started to move toward the direction of the east, toward the ocean. It finally disapeard, and when I realized what I just saw I looked around me and my friend the owner of the apartment was standing next to me rubbing her eyes with tears. Why eyes were also watered, with a little discomfort. The people below on the tennis courts yelled at us asking if we saw it. We told them we did. We asked them were did it come from, and they said it just rolled over the building and everything turned orange. I have told this experience to all my friends throuht out the years. No one believes me, but I know what I saw was real. I don&apos;t see my friend any more, but many years later we met by accident, and the first thing she asked me if I remember that day when we saw the orange glow. I told her yes, it is something that I have never forgoten.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It produced no noise. However it created a contrail which was approximately five(5)Miles in length and approximately 5ive(5)Miles in width which suggested to the two witnesses that it was not an aircraft of any known type and that it was unusually large. It did not appear to have wing nor engines. Guess: Approximate size/about the size of a small town.Both observers are ex-Military, and one is a retired Commercial Pilot with more than twenty twenty years flying experience, and holds an Airframe and Power Plant Mechanics License from the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA). Perhaps this was a large fragment of a Meteorite that skipped off Earth&apos;s atmosphere upon entry (because it left a contrail) and then continued back into space on a new trajectory. The closest description(from the retired Pilot) is that the leading edge was extremely bright equal to kooking at the sun. it was more flattened in appearance than any other aspect of shape and wa irregular in shape. The mass of the object behind its leading edges was also very bright but  not as bright ad the leading edges.It appeared to have an entry path of approximately 25Degrees of angle in descent. After it passed over Pikes Peak in an Easterly direction it suddenly changed direction towards the Southeast and its contrail indicated a change of direction toward the Gulf Of Mexico and the it was completely gone from the observers sight. There have been no news reports that the observers are aware of frommany local sources but is likely that  some unit of the Military tracked it via RADAR.", "Christmas tree colored sparkling lights hovering over the southeastern sky in FloridaA friend and I had gone out to the movies. Upon our return I happened to glance up and saw among the stars, something that stood out and was different from all the stars. Upon closer examination with binoculars, my friend and I saw christmas colored lights kind of sparkling on the two crafts that were hovering in the southeastern sky over the Indian River or Atlantic Ocean area estimated to be perhaps 8 to 10 miles away. The two objects remained still but sparkled red, green, blue and yellow and one seemed larger than the other. We watched for about a half hour or more until our necks got tired from looking up.

The objects flashed very slowly, the traveled at an extremely fast rate, like nothing I have ever seen. I didn&rsquo;t notice any clouds or smoke, but at times; some of the objects had a trail behind them.  The objects danced around the sky for about ten to fifteen minutes. There was no aircraft or power lines in the vicinity. Nothing that would create a pattern like this. There wasn&rsquo;t anything between the objects, and me but there were light clouds.

Unlike all the other nights I sit at this place at my computer, I had a strange feeling something wasn&apos;t right. I had to keep glancing over my shoulder checking the large window behind me. Between the window and the computer is about an eight foot distance to where I observed a UFO, whilst I sat in the chair. Each time I looked all I saw outside my window was the trees blowing in the wind and the other usual things. Until I had the most overwhelming feeling something was watching me. I ignored it for a few seconds, but the longer I did the more nervous I got. I turned around fully and looked through the window, whilst sitting in the chair. I saw a circular object in the corner of where my backyard is outside. I watched it, realizing it was moving. I observed the difference between this strange light and the light of another residence through my backyard (I live in a suburban area). There was a definite difference and it was unlike anything I ever even heard of, as it was not a typical UFO, which is large. The light came closer, until it seemed to be only 15 or twenty feet away from the window outside. For the first few seconds, it looked had white light emanating from it, with a red light on top. The lights were flashing within the object. Then the red lights on the UFO seemed to be moving from the top of the UFO to the bottom. And as it continued to move closer to the window, I ran away from the room as I felt the object was watching me and could see me in my house. I believe my feelings are right, and not silly. Again, the object appeared to be about five to seven feet long, and about the same amount wide, yet it might have been saucer shaped. The shape was difficult to discern, yet it seemed closest to a circle. This light from the UFO had a shape though and was extremely clear to my eyes and I am sure I can&apos;t explain it as a normal occurence. I was 20 years old the night I saw it. I did not really believe it was a UFO until I heard in a documentary about &quot;alien probes&quot; appearing over suburban areas. The conditions from the room I was observing in, included a lamp light, which was on and a few feet away from the window next to it. Yet, this light did nothing to distort the image. The light of this thing appeared to my eyes to be moving in the middle of my backyard probably 15 feet off the ground. Another detail is that this object was one hundred percent light, but had a definite form, as the red light shifted from top to bottom. At least it appeared to be all light from my vantage point.", "strange and lonely light attracted the attention of two seperate groups of people as it flew overheadEvent: Jan 12 2008 approx 6: oo pm Location: Canonsburg, PA Shape:  triangle and/or light Witnesses:  3 in car + 2 strangers in a nearby parking lot  I wasn&rsquo;t going to report this because the two other witnesses in the car with me do not claim to have seen exactly the same thing that I saw.  Then I explored the NUFORC site further and read an account regarding a possibly similar &ldquo;translucent&rdquo; craft close by over Pittsburgh reported to have happened during Oct of 2006.  Besides that the whole incident is just bugging me. My daughter, a friend of hers, and I were traveling Pike Street towards the intersection of Rt. 980.  This affords us a view of the sky to the north of town and we can see part of Rt. 79N towards Pittsburgh.  The sky was overcast and a bit monotone with no visible stars.  It wasn&rsquo;t dark yet. As I slowed to stop for the intersection, a large white light appeared over the traffic light at a fair amount of distance and it just looked like an airplane that was headed straight towards us.  I noticed that there were no smaller lights to either side though and pointed it out to the teens.  They continued to watch it as we made our right turn and came to another stop a short distance away.  I was able to look out the driver side window and saw that the object was getting very close and was about to fly directly overhead.  After it passed over, my daughter pointed out a man and an adolescent girl close in a nearby parking lot pointing at the sky in the direction that the object had been headed. I cannot begin to estimate the height accurately.  The object was under the clouds, not over them.  It was at an altitude that I would associate more with a small aircraft rather than a commercial passenger plane.  I heard no sound but the car windows were closed. The traffic light changed and while I made the turn, my daughter continued to look for the object out of the passenger side window but did not locate it again. When the object got closer before I had to react to the traffic light, I could see it more clearly and could eventually see the bottom of it.

But I clearly saw more than that and I know I didn&rsquo;t hallucinate.  Even a big white alone is rather unusual though.  There were no additional lights normally associated with an airplane and the teens are adamant about that aspect in their descriptions.

I was sitting in a chair in my backyard brushing my dogs and talking on my cell phone occasionally.  I took a break and leaned back in my chair scanning the southern sky for a few minutes when what I first thought was a plane entered my view.  This object flew in a straight line from my western point to an eastern point in about 6 seconds.  The object looked like a commercial plane (say 727 size) from underneath it. As this object was flying across my view the underbelly of it was lite up (white metallic looking) which I thought was probably from the way the sun was hitting it from underneath as dusk was approaching. In my estimation the object was flying at a lower altitude (10,000 to 15,000 feet) as I could tell the body resembled that of a plane&apos;s size.  Two things really stood out at this time:  first, this object had no wings (I repeated this several times to myself) and second, it had none of the underbelly lights (red/green) that you would see on a commercial airliner. To say truthfully, I was shocked and kept saying how can this be a plane as it doesn&apos;t have any wings.  I stepped outside of my backyard area to attempt to listen for any noise as it began to go out of my view to the east, but I live in a condo and there were 3 airconditioners running within a 20 ft area of me so I couldn&apos;t hear anything other than the a/c.

I only saw them for about three seconds but I remember every detail about them.  They were moving at the same speed.  One was above the other about a quarter inch apart.  The one on top had a white light like most planes do and I remember noticing it had a trail just like a jet has.  The bottom one however was many times bigger, had no trail and was glowing bright orange.  It looked like a perfect circle and about the size of a BB while the one on top looked like a star.  They were moving almost horizontal, but most shooting stars come down at an angle.Almost as soon as I saw them the bottom one steadily grew from dim orange to burning, bright, orange without changing shape at all.

It is not making a sound and its about 10pm so no one is outside yelling or making a commotion..matter of fact, if you werent looking in the sky it would have flown right over your head without you ever knowing.

It was 4:58, and as I waited I watched an airplane prepare to land as it flew overhead.  I live on a flight path and as I watched the plane at 2,000 feet traveling west, I caught the glimmer of an object much higher up above the landing plane heading east.  The sun was in a position to clearly reflect light from the object.  It looked silver with two cylinders attached.  There was a dark band between the two cylinders.  There was no noise, no vapor trail, and no perturbation of its straight flight path. It traveled from the northwest to southeast at a very high altitude.  Because I was in the shadows and the object was in the sunlight, I had a very good view of it.  I watched the object for a number of seconds and it was gone in less than a minute.

This is a daily ritual for me on the weekdays before I start work in the area. The sun had risen, and there were a few light clouds. There was no wind. The area is in the flight path of jets landing at Orlando International Airport, which is approximately 10 miles to the south.I was staring out over the lake when I looked up and noticed a black form flying towards the lake from the west. At first I thought it was a large bird such as a vulture or eagle circling over the lake. The object was dark, big, silent, and was not traveling at a high rate of speed. As I examined it more closely, I could see that it was not a bird. The object descended, and for a moment, I thought it could be someone parachuting into town, but I didn&apos;t see any evidence of a person beneath the object. It stopped descending and began to slowly fly to the northeast, towards the Casselberry area. Despite the object being very dark, the rear of the object reflected in the newly risen sun as it flew out of sight. There are some cypress trees by the lake, which obscured my view of the object as it flew away. When it was shining in the sun, it appeared to be spherical - I&apos;m not sure if the object actually changed shape as I watched it, or if I had misjudged its shape when I first noticed it.A few strange things about the object: It seemed to be flying low. It was difficult to determine its exact shape. It was completely silent. It seemed big, but I was unable to determine its size without a nearby sufficient frame of reference. The moon was still visible in the sky - if I had to compare it to the moon, I&apos;d say that it wasn&apos;t big enough to have obscured the moon had it flown over it. Also, it seemed to appear from the west - it was just there over the lake somewhat suddenly, but it&apos;s possible that nearby trees obscured it from my view.My only thoughts on what it might have been is a balloon, but not a hot-air balloon. It seemed to be following a definite flight path - not randomly being carried by air currents and ascending and descending. Also, the shape seemed to be off.I&apos;m wondering if anyone else saw this object today. It flew towards a very busy road during morning rush hour traffic - Highway 436 in Winter Park - when I lost sight of it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Anyway I was on apart of US 31 which had been cut off because of the building of the power plant, watching the sky as I usually did back then. I was sitting on the side of the road facing south. As I watched to the east, south and west I saw a large saucer shaped craft probably 80 to 95 feet in diameter rise up out of the swampy area to my left and a bit behind me. What has always bothered me is  that there was a smaller saucer shaped craft docked on the side of the large one. Both craft were a gray metallic color but had no lights of any kind. There was absolutely no sound, I sat watching it rise up to about tree top height and then it stopped  and hovered. I was about 200 feet away from the crafts, it just hovered there for about a minute as I studied it. Well it was not moving so I decided I  would.

Since this area is in the landing path for DFW airport, I was not initially alarmed by what I saw. The objects were visible due west from a position located near 33.23 N by -96.68 W. I studied the objects with binoculars, comparing their distance to landmarks, and determined by their orientation to those landmarks, as well as compass readings, that they were not aircraft in the landing path. After several minutes of careful observation, it was determined they were fixed. Five minutes later, one of the objects changed its position. Then, another. Eventually, all three objects departed. On 3 January, another set of lights was seen over a different part of the city. From a closer vantage point, it was clear the object was hovering over the east side of US75, possibly 2KM, near US380. My first impression of these objects was that they were helicopters performing some sort of high-altitude scanning. It is unusual to see helicopters flying so high, especially when they are stationary. The lights, again, were very bright, similar to the landing lights of large commercial jets. Indeed, they were even discernible against the brightness of the western sky just after sunset. The lights did not appear to be flashing from any place on the aircraft.", "In 1979 while driving east on new highway in commack just after dark ,i was looking at the sky over parkway drive north, what looked like a red light that you may see on the top of a water tower caught my eye.I drove in the direction turned right on the service road,drove in the direction of this glowing red light.I parked my car on the sholder it was total darkness,no lights are on this road.Looking through the woods,just above the tree line,my eyes began to adjust to the dark and i was able to make out what i saw. at that moment the red light started to dim, i was looking at a craft around 300&apos; wide it looked like 2 foot ball shape crafts side by side the red light was directly in the middle,i was able to make out structure of the craft it had slots that ran fron left to right ,like square window ports but long ,equal on both sides. it made no noise, i tried to take a back road and come up behind it for a better look.Before i could do this it began to move no light were on the craft at this time, Minutes later this thing lit up like the sun,bright gold.it shot into the south east like a flash and it was gone.It was not from this world ,im 52 today and it seems like yesterday.

Directly ahead of us in the night sky I witnessed a bright white light.  The light appeared to stay in exactly the same place in the sky. As we traveled through town I rolled the window down to get a better look at it and to see if I could hear any sound from it. It was at that time we came to a stop light and I was able to point it out to my friend who was driving.  We watched the light together for about 20 seconds and then it disappeared. I thought I might be able to distinguish some sort of a shape because of the backlight of the moon, but the object was completely gone.

On January 10, 2008 while walking my dog, I saw the following after I had researched all unusually shaped aircrafts and found absolutely none that looked like what I had seen that evening.  The object was a saucer shape with 4 rounded pods protruding from the sides.  It was white, possibly light grey in color.  Under each pod there were alternating dull red/blue lights under each pod.  The craft was approximately 200 feet above the ground, no sound just gliding.  When it came directly over me, there was sort of an emptiness to the environment sort of a black hole if you will.  It hovered over me for a few seconds then came a sound of the engine revving up.  The space craft then picked up speed, travelled approximately 2 miles then disappeared into the air. After this incident, I looked up the hill where I was and saw a dark figure with a bright blue light that did not reflect light as a traditional flashlight would walking towards me.  My Labrador Retriever kept looking in the direction of this image and wanted to go towards it.  I ran towards my home all the while pulling the dog.  When I came into the house, the dog ran up the stairs and looked out the window and began to bark incessantly with his hair standing on end.  I no longer saw the image.  I did not want to call the police because I thought that they would think I was unstable.

Above the trees, we saw a large light, to big and bright to be coming from a plane.  It was yellow, and looked like a fourescant lightbulb.  It wasn&apos;t coming from the ground, no visible ray or projector to be seen.  It had a glassy appeal, like a see through bottom.  At first it seemed like nothing, but then it appeared on the other side of the road after we made a turn.  It followed us for about 20 seconds, then vanished.

It was similar in size to a full moon.  I went in and got my binoculars (12 power) and resumed watching.  With binoculars, I was able to see that the object was moving slowly, referencing the stars nearby.  Over the course of 20 or 25 minutes, the object moved in an ENE direction from near the constellation Pegasus until it became too faint to see in the middle of the constellation Cassiopeia.  Several times during viewing, I observed a single bright flash like an aircraft strobe, and twice I saw objects not unlike satellites in brightness and speed pass moving west to within a degree (a full moon being around 1/2 a degree) of the object.((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.

I looked to the East, where I have seen objects appear in the past, and I saw a light that was not a light in the usual constellation patterns. I look at the sky in this direction every time I take my dog outside, so I know right away if a light is appearing in a spot where there is normally not a light/star. It moved around a bit, and then grew very bright, like a car headlight coming at me, and was very large, then dimmed to the brightness of a star, and then repeated the sequence again at least 3 or 4 times, while hovering and moving about slowly in random directions. It looked to be about at the height that a helicopter flies, but it definitely was not moving the way I have seen helicopters maneuver. It was about 4 miles away from where I was. I was in the US Army for 6 &frac12; years, so I have seen quite a few varieties of aircraft, and know when something is moving in the sky, in a non-traditional aircraft way. Off to the right (South) of that light, there was a smaller object, which had a small white light in the center, and a ring of flashing colored lights across the center of the object.

Its lights weren&rsquo;t as bright as the planes but it had the same shape and size.  It looked like one object with a light on the nose, wingtips, and tail.  The tail light was red and the others where white.  I thought it was another plane until it moved sideways as it was going forward.

I assure you that this is in no way a hoax. My friend and I were leaving a detention session at a high school about 30 minutes before this happened.  I was waiting to get picked up by my parents (my friend and I were the only ones left waiting to be picked up). I was staring up into the sky, lost in thought, when a light caught my attention. It was a bluish-green light that travelled from one side of the sky to the other in about 10, maybe 12 seconds. It looked like it was surrounded by a kind of haze or aura. As my eyes tried to focus on it, it disappeared behind a cloud bank and vanished from my sight. The object seemed to be emitting sparks and left a trail, almost like the haze emitted by jet aircraft flying at a low level. After I saw it, I only had to wait about 3 seconds before I heard a very odd noise, which sounded like a car backfiring, with a whistling noise that followed.  am telling this event to the best of my recollection and testify that is 100% true to the letter.", "It was around nine thirty at night. I began to walk out of my car that I had parked in front of my house. As I began to walk the stretch to my house I noticed four lights that were horizontal that I could tell that they were on craft but I could not see the craft. It traveled at a very fast speed. I have never seen anything in my life traveling so fast. The lights were white and they did not flash and no other red lights were present like they appear on airplanes. The shape went over my house and as it traveled over my head I could not hear a sound. It was a dead silence that I could not explain. The lights turned vertical as it was passing by my head. The lights did not break their form. I could tell that the craft just turned and it did not slow down. As I turned my head the craft kept on going and I saw it for another two seconds before the lights went out.

It is now 12:05 AM as I write this sentence. What I saw happened not less than an hour ago. I was driving westbound on Old Sumner Buckley Highway just behind the fairly recently built Target. I was on the phone with my girlfriend at a redlight admiring the stars on an unusually clear night. I then proceeded westbound with the greenlight when to my right (north of me) I saw a bright light moving VERY swiftly in an arcing vector. It was moving relatively parallel to me heading westbound and dissapeared behind the treeline. It looked as if it were already on a trajectory somewhat like a missile coming down to a target in an arcing manor. To be honest as stupid as it sounds, I thought it was in fact a missile. It looked fairly high in the sky but nothing like an airplane. Maybe a 2 or 3 thousand feet at the highest. It came eastbound across a large field in a straight trajectory until getting closer to the treeline when it took I&apos;d say a 15-20 degree angle change and dove in a curving manor behind the treeline. All of this happened so quickly, it couldn&apos;t have been more than a second. It must have moved a a mile or so in that time. The light was basically just a white ball. There was no tail like a comet what have and no blinking lights like an airplane. That&apos;s why I thought it might have been the tail of the missile and not a comet or something. After it passed however, there was no exhaust trail and furthermore why would there be a missile flying over Bonney Lake. I then repeated what I saw to my girlfriend who is thanks to me probably having trouble falling asleep right now. I took a few side roads driving home in hopes of seeing it again, but had no such luck. I&apos;ve never reported a UFO before and feel silly doing so right now, but I&apos;m sort of hoping to find out what it really was or could have been.", "Very large black triangle with red and white lights at night, seen again in morning with blue and white lights.I was on my way to work heading north on US-127. I had just passed the Business 127 exit and noticed a formation of planes ahead that seemed to come out of no where. As I got closer to it, I slowed down and rolled my window down. The formation was also heading north just parallel to the Interstate. The formation of planes appeared to be flying very slow. Still heading north on US-127 and just past Broomfield Road, I went directly under it. It was not a formation of planes. It was a very large black triangle. I actually saw the shape and texture of it. It was about the size of a football field or bigger. It was approximately 400-600 feet off the ground. It made no sound that I could hear. It had faint white lights on each corner as well as brighter red lights on each corner. The red light at the front of it was flashing as if a Strobe light in a weird sequence of blinks. Almost like Morse code. When I got out of work in the morning, it was beginning to get light out. I remembered the exact location that I saw the object the previous night. Lo and behold, there was something in the sky at the exact location. This time it was much higher. It was barely moving. It was hard to tell the shape of it. It had faint blue lights, and three very bright white lights. The middle white light was flashing just as the red light did the night before.

Suddenly, in an instant, the light changed position about 100 feet to the south. Then the light was steady white, a blinding white light, then it went dark, then it flashed again and zoomed up and away in the sky in an instant, unlike anything i have ever seen. This was no aircraft, but rather some sort of bright white light. It did not emit a beam, or a trail, but more of a flash, and was blinding bright, flash and changing positions instantly, then it zoomed up and away.

It was approximately about a mile away from where I was.  I saw white-yellow lights illuminating it (it was very bright).  The incident occurred in Hillcrest (Queens), New York.My mom looked out her bedroom window and saw the object moving very fast and made a sharp turn and disappeared. This object moved quicker than usual planes do and was much brighter.  A few moments later we noticed an unusual number of planes in the area.  My mom also said that she saw what she thought at first was a star (because it was not moving) but then it began to move very quickly (more quickly then the planes we saw before). She is not sure if this was the same UFO or a different one.  Planes continued to move in that area for some time which is very unusual because we normally do not have much plane activity at that time (or with that many planes in a short period of time). I remember my mom saying how dangerous it must be for the planes since there were so many of them that the possibility of them colliding was high.

I had passed Britannia when I noticed a large red light coming into view from the top of my windshield, travelling in the same direction I was, above the land on the left side of the road. My first thought was that it was moving too fast to be an airplane, and it looked too low to the ground. I slowed my car down and kept switching between watching it and the road in front of me - I was curious enough to want to figure out whether or not it was an airplane or something else. The red light was large and it didn&apos;t blink in and out like an airplane - it pulsed, and on each pulse the light grew brighter and larger. It seemed to have stopped in the distance, as the light wasn&apos;t receding anymore. I turned my full concentration to driving a few bends in the road ahead and I noticed it started moving again, veering towards the right onto the fields on the side of the road closest to me. While it was turning I thought I could make out a bit of blue light on the side of it. I was trying to keep tabs on it but my view was then blocked by a close tree line. I saw it disappear behind the tree line and thought it had vanished. When the tree line ended, opening onto a long stretch of field, I was amazed to see it hovering above the middle of the field closest to the road, between 50-100 feet off the ground. The red light was still large, I honestly can&apos;t remember if it was still pulsing, and I could distinctly make out a strip of rectangular blue lights along the side of it. There was absolutely no noise coming from it, and the shape of it was hard to make out. Other than the lights, the rest of it blended into the night exceptionally well and the surface of it must have been non-reflective. Judging from its distance from the road, whatever it was couldn&apos;t have been much larger than a helicopter. It was too small to be a plane, too silent to be a helicopter, and I really don&apos;t think it&apos;s a military plane.When I was watching it in the field, the car behind me suddenly slowed down enough to make me wonder whether or not they had spotted what I was watching. I kept wondering whether or not I should stop and turn around. In the end, I just kept on driving.The sighting occurred on Tremaine Rd between Brittania Rd W and 2nd Sideroad - the last I saw of the disk it was above the field on the west side of Tremaine between Lower Base Line W and 2nd Sideroad.", "IT WAS FASTER THEN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN AND AS BRIGHT AS A FULL MOONTHIS BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SHAPE OF A CIGAR CAME OUT OF KNOWEAR IN THE SKY WITH A SPEED i HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFOR STREAKED ACROSS THE SKY FOR ABOUT 3 OR 4 SECONDS AND THEN DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT SKY,THERE WAS NO NOISE WHAT SO EVER,NO STREAK OF LIGHT IT LOOKED LIKE A FLOURESCENT LIGHT IN THE SKY.iT WAS IMAZING.", "Three triangular forms move quickly and in sync before disappearing, planes seemingly chasing it!I believe I have had a UFO sighting on this date, Friday, January 11, 2008, at approximately 9:00pm.  I was outside with my brother playing Frisbee golf while we walked his dog.  As he was explaining the basis of the next hole and I couldn&rsquo;t pay attention to his words; all I could do was look at the sky.  Normally in the city you&rsquo;re lucky to see a handful of stars and the only constellation you can ever count on is Orion&rsquo;s belt.  Tonight though, outside of my brother&rsquo;s apartment, I couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at the sky in amazement.I don&rsquo;t know if it was the clear sky or my brother&rsquo;s neighborhood but the sheer magnitude and number of stars was breathtaking.  As I was scanning the sky I noticed the odd triangular shaped light forms.  They were moving quickly, faster than the planes.  They were so low and clear and as I tried to keep my eyes on them they jetted through the sky and disappeared.The whole time I kept shouting at my brother to look at them but they were moving so fast that he was never able to fix his eyes on them.  The three lights just totally disappeared.  I ran down the block looking for them, but they were gone.  I stayed outside scanning the sky for ten minutes after, looking for the lights or anything that I might have mistaken this spectacle to be.  I can&rsquo;t think of any other explanation for it.It was three triangular light forms, flying in formation.  They hovered for a tiny bit, which is when I spotted them.  Intrigued and confused by what I saw, my eyes followed the shaped as they sped through the sky.  I tried to absorb as much as I could about them before they disappeared.  Each triangular formation was actually composed of smaller lights creating the triangular form.  They moved together perfectly and quickly and I know they weren&apos;t planes because I could see planes moving in the vicinity.  It almost seemed like they were chasing the formation; it was amazing.", "Yellow lights in formationLooking SW from SW13 in London,UK We observed 4 or 5 yellow lights high in the sky.3 were flying in a equilateral formation.One travelled just laterally across the sky right to left and disappeared under our roofline. Its apparent velocity was very fast.Another then rose above the roof line at right and seemed to travel towards the other 3 which had maintained a constant position.The 3 lights looked as if they were gaining a lot of altitude as they were getting very slightly dimmer and smaller over the period of time that they were visible. They eventually faded out abruptly The other light continued to move diagonally towards the triangular formation but never got near and at one point kinked its travel back towards the right very quickly before continuing to travel right to left and up. The remaining light then stopped. We live on the Heathrow flight path and these lights did not have the movement signature of  helicopters or planes.

We were renting a house from my parents which is on the north side of Coeur d&apos; Alene Lake, four miles east of Coeur d&apos; Alene, Idaho.  We had just eaten dinner and walked out onto the front deck which overlooked the lake.  It was after sunset and still light outside.  We were looking out over the lake when a greenish-white glow appeared under the surface of the water.  An object raised vertically out of the water, water running off, it was oval and difficult to make out the exact outline of the object due to the light it gave off and was about the size of a semi-trailer which is only a rough guess.  The object rose vertically for an estimated several hundred yards to where it was above our horizontal line of site and southwest of us.  The object stopped for a second or two and the next thing we saw was a straight white tapering line of white light going from the last point we saw the object going horizontally out over the northwest horizon as a thread thin white line. It appeared that whatever it was accelerated instantly to a speed that made it appear like a straight white bolt of lightning, only that it tapered to invisibly thin over the horizon.  I personally never talked to anyone about this until three years after the event occurred because I was so shocked by how unreal it was and that my mind had no reference for such an event such as objects raising from a lake vertically and then zipping off horizontally like a lightning bolt.  We heard no sound whatsoever from whatever this was. I have never even heard of reports like mine from anyone, so it has now been an unsolved puzzle in my mind for over thirty years that has only served to make me wonder what on earth is going on and only fueled my quest for knowledge on the subject of UFOs which, as a scientist/engineer, I take very very seriously and would love to see the human race as a whole get to the bottom of this and with full open cooperation of universities and governments, which unfortunately has not happened and is a disgrace.", "Bright triangular shaped object moves at a rediculous speed across my windowI was sitting at home watching TV early in the morning.

I have probably told this to approximately 10 to 15 people in all these years because as any other person that has seen a UFO can tell you &ldquo;people think you are crazy&rdquo;.This sighting happened in September or October of 1985.I was a teacher for a trade school for Austin Community Collage and a local union in Austin Texas.  I let out class around 9:00 PM on a Thursday night.  My route home took me down South Lamar to Brodie Lane.  This area of Austin was mostly farm land back then.  As I turned left onto Brodie, I saw an object in the sky moving over the farm house on my right.  I stopped and got out of my truck to get a better look.  There were a few other cars going by and I tried to get them to stop and see but they just kept going by.  It was approximately 150 yards from me and 200 feet off the ground.  It looked like both wings of a jet connected in the middle, boomerang or V shaped,  but there was no fuselage.  I later learned it was called chevron. On the front there were 6 extremely bright white lights, two close together on each side of the center and  single lights towards the tips.  Behind it where fuselage should be, was a hazy, foggy, reddish-pink glow.  It was moving steadily only about 5 miles per hour, silently except for a 3 or 4 second blast of what sounded like high pressure air release every 30 seconds.  I watched it for around 20 minutes  as it flew north-northwest directly over Barton Creek Mall.I called Bergstram, the closest Air Force base at that time, to report the sighting.  For the next few days I went back and forth with phone calls with different people and then they gave me the brush off.  They did, however, tell me they had no aircraft flying that night.

As we were getting closer the vehicle, I noticed what at first appeared to be a comet arching towards us from the horizon. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed, but had no trail behind it. We watched this brilliant shape travel from the horizon to directly over us. The speed that it traversed the sky was &ldquo;comet-like&rdquo;. The speed that it stopped directly over us was immediate. It stopped on a dime. All of us took turns with the binoculars looking at this stationary glimmering energy shape. It glimmered evenly and remained perfectly still in the exact position where it stopped. We watched it for about a minute, trying to understand what we were seeing. As we watched with binoculars, the object accelerated from zero to comet like speed at 90 degrees from the original flight direction. It was so fast; I had to lower the binoculars to keep up with the object with my eyes as it traversed the horizon and disappeared. Two teenage boys and I witnessed something.

It was difficult to pinpoint their distance as they were traveling slightly away from me. They were about 30 degrees vertically from the Eastern Horizon line. The strange part was that they were moving together, in unison, about a half-mile apart by my estimates. They were off in the distance and difficult to look at with all the ground clutter and light scatter from the highway flood lights. They were moving slower than a typical plane on its landing approach to Lambert-St. Louis Airport in Bridgeton and were not headed in the right direction for a landing approach.

They had a fluid movement to them and were not jaggedly moving through the night sky. They were visible for about 60 seconds before they disappeared behind a passing cloud and were not seen again. The lighting on the objects was relatively clear. There was one light visible on each object and had a red/pink hue to both of them. It was not like any landing light I have ever seen before.

It originally came over the hills and west straight, perpendicular to the highway, before making a 90 degree right-turn and following the highway.  After that turn, it slowly veered off to the left again, diverging from the path of the highway.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I Tell you what I have seen on January 2 at 8:28 AM 2008 I was going to Vons grocery store at Downey California and I notice four UFO in low altitude hovering in straight formation over head. I thought that was seeing things. I ask an shopper that was leaving next to me and asked her what is that over head and she only stated that they are kites, others people did looked up and did nothing but stair for a moment. People that did seen what have seen just went on with there business. I was amazed what I have seen I look a closer look and notice orange orb hovering over head and a star light object at mush higher altitude hovering next to it. This was taking place of a period of ten to fifteen minus. After that I seen the conventional aircraft flown buy at low altitude heading south it was a twin engine propeller driven aircraft. Whatever they are, we are not alone in the universe. As for the other that seen this I really do understand how embarrassed it may be to tell other what you seen in fact no body would believe us anyway like the Arizona Lights . This really changes me and my prospective about religion and as for science goes we are still in the Stone Age using solid propellant rocket for propulsion. Thank you for your attention for reading this story.", "Bright stationary light in sky in lighted, rectangular, grid shape. Moved to NW, vansihed, then flashed brightly and vanished again.We were on the pool deck in the rear of the house.  I noticed a bright light 60 degrees above the horizon to the northwest.  Surrounding this light were several departing/arriving airliners all of which were trailing contrails.  The light was unmoving and had no contrail.  I am a pilot, and estimate the altitude at 20k feet.  After watching for 10 seconds, the light became brighter and changed shape to a grid, that I can only compare to a grid on a bingo card, and all lines of the grid were brightly illuminated in white light. Immediately after I mentioned the light to my friend and dad, it reverted back to a bright, single, white light.  They only saw the object as a bright light having missed the grid-shape. As we watched I mentioned that it was not moving.  Suddenly, it began to slowly move to the NW.  We watched for about 10 seconds and it simply vanished.  My Dad and my friend looked away and I continued watching.  It had vanished for about 5 seconds when I saw it flash brightly one more time and finally vanish.  I watched for 10 more minutes yet saw nothing more. Strangely enough, a month and a half before, I was in Orlando on a Greyhound bus.  We had just left the station headed to Tampa and were sitting at a traffic light.  It was dark, and I noticed a bright light above the bus about 30000&apos;-40000&apos;.  It was stationary with a changing brightness, brighter than the star Sirius. It began moving south toward Miami, and rapidly diminished in brightness until it vanished.  It appeared very high in the sky, and appeared to move slowly south, but I could tell it was moving very quickly, but due to it&apos;s altitude it overall appeared as though it was moving slowly.  Very hard to describe.  I noticed that no one else on the bus were paying attention, and I didn&apos;t say anything to anyone. These are the first two sightings in my life, and I watch all the time for such activity, and have always been skeptical.", "West Coast FloridaAt around 6pm this evening, I was taking down Christmas Decorations in front of the house.. I looked North west and in the Distant sky I saw a very bright white cigar shaped object it had a clearly defined sharp outline. and as if you were shutting off a light with a light switch it was gone. I did not see it move.. it was just gone. sighting only lasted maybe 2 seconds.", "Seen shiny aluminum colored craft @ Yeager Lake in LitchfieldOne afternoon while taking an afternoon ride out by Litchfield&rsquo;s Lake Lou Yeager I was heading west on Beach House Trail road when I notice something shiny like aluminum in a gap between two trees.  I only got to see it for about 3 seconds 4 tops.  I sped up to see if I could get a good look at it but it was gone no where to be found.  The object was moving back to the northeast towards the lake.  I know I seen something even if it was for a few seconds. It was odd to me by how it seem to just float by not real fast, just like real smooth.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I have a 1 minute video footage of part of this event, that occurred on a clear evening in the South East London area. I am very willing to send you the footage....I have put this on youtube, here is the link- http://youtube.com/watch?v=Fi6zqCIsam0  REPORT.Time 7.10pm Date: december 15th, 2007 Location SE22, London Witnesses 6 Duration of sighting: 7-9 minutes Conditions: Extremely clear night  We were at work. I am the head chef and the other key witness is a kitchen assistant.At 7pm, he went outside to smoke a cigarrette.I was inside the kitchen and I was very busy. I could hear a helicopter at an uncomfortably low altitude (sounded like it was going to land outside!!)My colleague came into the kitchen shouting &quot;OVNI!OVNI!&quot; (Which apparently means &apos;UFO&apos; in Latin.)  I went outside and saw a black military helicopter (possibly a Chinook) flying very low and erratically over the neighbouring houses. On closer inspection,it appeared to be chasing several small darting lights in the sky. We watched for 5-10 minutes as the helicopter investigated. There was also a &quot;static&quot; ufo that was there for about 5 minutes (you can see this in the video, it is the white orb to the right of the street light...this later just vanished, sort of de-materialized. During the sighting, 2 other smaller white orbs appeared to &quot;dock&quot; with the stationary UFO. There were also several other smaller lights darting around it. One was flashing at orange and bright blue colour in 3 second intervals. The other smaller objects (there may have been a total of 20 during the 5-10 minute sighting, kept appearing and disappearing!! Weird.This video was taken using a Samsung mobile phone- This video does not do justice to what we saw. The bright light in the middle is obviously a street light. You can&apos;t see the helicopter on here because it had no lights on at all! But you can clearly hear it. The one to the right is the stationary white orb. The interseting thing is , that there were a spate of sightings in the same area in the same week (the sighting you have on your site in Brixton (Dec 12th) is approx 2 miles away from where I was)  What we saw was amazing.The video footage doesn&apos;t really do justice to what we witnessed. There is absolutely no way that these were baloons, military craft,civilian craft, anomolous lights etc...why was a military helicopter chasing them? And why did the military helicopter have no lights on? I find this very surprising as in this area of SE London, we are on several flight paths for 3 major airports.It seems that the helicopter may have been scrambled to investigate the lights.", "They never appeared there again.I was ready to get into bed, when i heard a weird wizzing sound. I looked out my window and I saw a oval shape figure in the sky. It had different colored lights coming from it. Then another one appeared. I got scared.

At first I just discarded it as my eyes making things up, but then a couple of seconds later I saw it again farther south. Then, a black shape appeared in the sky. It was probably about 2,000 feet high and maybe 100 yards long. It had a series of lights that would circle around it in a pattern. They were all white. About a minute after I saw the first change in the sky, it disappeared and did not come back.", "3 Orange Spheres moving West to East over Carrollton TX.I had just turned South off of Frankford Rd. onto Scott Mill Rd. when out of the corner of my right eye I caught a glimpse of something out of the ordinary.  Three round fire orange spheres were moving (at a seemingly slow pace) from the Northwest to the Southeast.  These spheres appeared to be about a thousand feet above my vehicle.  As I continued southbound down the road I noticed several people looking towards the sky, so I assume there were other witnesses.  When I returned back travelling north up Scott Mill the lights were gone.  They were only visible (to me) for a few short minutes - maybe three or four.  I&apos;ve seen plenty of airplane lights and stars and these were definitely not either of those.  WEIRD!", "saucer shape craft with orange lightA saucer shape craft went from south west to west direction in a straight line for approx 2 mins at just past midnight on New Years Eve in Ellesmere Port, England There were fireworks going on to the side but not near this object.

December 27, 2007            3 brights lights  (15 minutes) in the sky then 1 bright lightWe (my Sister,my daughter and myself) were traveling from Virgina heading to Georgia.  We were traveling on Interstate 20 and suddently there appeared 3 three bright  light circles which appeared in the sky.  These were not spot lights because there was  not a reflection coming through the trees. The lights seemed to be playing or dancing with each other.  Then they got in a straight line, they went together and then separated again.  They danced or play for a few minutes.  They went together to make one circle and then separated again and suddendly dissapeared.As we traveled the lights stayed in front of us very close, even with us traveling approximately 75 miles per hour we could not catch or leave the light.  We were not frighten because we were trying to figure out what they were. We even joked about them being an UFO and if that was the case they needed to drop some money in our vechicle. After they disappeared we went on without event, then we exited for a bathroom break.  Again as we traveled on I-20 we  saw (1) bright light.  This light appeared and stayed for approximately 5 minutes and suddendly dissapeared.

Probably a Centaur rocket fuel dump.We walked outside to get in the car and my son asked &quot;Daddy, is that Venus in the sky?&quot;  I thought it was comet Holmes, so I told him that, &quot;No, that is a comet!  It must have become brighter again!&quot;  On our way to eat, we called a few people, none of them were able to see it from their vantage point.  When we got back about an hour later, it was gone.  Just plain gone.I do know what a comet looks like, as I was an astronomy teaching assistant for four years.  This object was about the width of the moon, about &quot;three moons&quot; in length (full moons) and the &apos;points&apos; were about as bright as Jupiter.  The &apos;tail&apos; was clearly visible, but spread out in a cone shape.  I looked on the internet, and found out that there was a &quot;There was a Centaur rocket fuel dump&quot; this evening that was supposed to look like a short lived comet.  What we saw matched this description, but we do not know where in the sky the fuel dump was to be seen.  We saw this in between Perseus, Auriga, and Camelopardalis.

We couldn&apos;t believe what we were seeing. it began to fall. And then it disappered and we never saw it again.Other witnesses: Friend 24, Friend 35((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were just going off the exit ramp off of 55. Our exit was 50B.  We were turning off when finally I said something to my uncle about these 2 lights directly next to each other that I saw and had been following us for about 5 minutes. He said he had noticed them too and thought he was crazy. We kept going towards my house when finally we came close enough to the object to actually see it good.  He pulled over on the side of Canvasback Drive and we got out.  The object was close enough he said to &quot;shoot it with a paint ball gun&quot;. We were very excited, myself mostly from doing about a year of UFO research so far.  It was a triangle with 2 lights and very large (about 30-50 feet from point to point).  Also, very thick probably a good 30 feet. My brother contacted a friend who lived close to where we were and he told him to go outside. The boys first response when my brother told him to go outside was &quot;Holy Shit&quot;. At this point my brother hung up and took a picture of the object. The picture came out very clear and shows a triangle with 2 lights on the object. The three of us were astonished by the object and it flew over us very slow, we could see it for about 1 minute to a minute and 30 seconds. After it got past us about 300 yards, it sped up pretty fast and just kept flying. I immediately called my friend who lived in the direction the UFO was going and told him to look into the sky. He saw the object and instantly said &quot;Wow, that thing is hauling ass.&quot; At this point we could start to see little red object all around the sky. They were flickering and we had no idea what they were (I researched this later and found out that a meteor had broke that night and was said to be red). But, that did not see the second triangle object we saw. After the red flickering started my uncle said he was actually getting frightened and we got in the car and went to my house. When we arrived my brother and him went inside to tel! l my par ents the news. I stayed outside and was convinced there were more out here. I know that a lot of the times people see UFOs they see more than 1. About 20 minutes later after my brother had came back out to try to see more with me we saw another triangle come from behind my house. This object was a little higher (probably 2,000-3,000 feet in the air. It was the same shape of the previous object with 2 lights again. The only difference with this one was that when it passed we could see these lights on the back. I noticed right away 5 lights across the whole back. They were as thick as the craft and were very fast. They blinked one after another very fast from left to right. It was amazing to see this and me and my brother were speechless. After this object passed I stayed outside till about 11:00 o clock and saw nothing else except an odd amount of planes. There were so many planes that my mom was checking the news, thinking about calling the police, and even thinking about calling the airport or air force. I know that on clear nights you can see everything but there were over 250 planes that night that I saw and they all came within 2 hours. That is an extraordinary amount. After being a believer I now believe that this is real and is a serious matter even more. If I could send pictures from my phone I would but my phone does not support that. I am trying to take a picture of the picture with a actual camera and send it via e-mail. Thank you for your time.   ((name deleted))", "Large black triangle, lights on the corners.

This thing was wider than his house, Im guessing that it was about 150 foot wide. I check the possible UFO abduction box But I dont know. Remember being hazy and tired afterwards.

Then a domed portion on top of the saucer. As it flew over me at about 400 ft. it was a triangle wing sillouette.

This craft would appear suacer shape from any direction of observation eccept directly overhead. it looked the same going away as coming towords me. very big delta shape.
