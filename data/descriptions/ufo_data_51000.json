Looking to the Northwest approximately 340 degrees, I observed what at first appeared to be a star just above the tree level surrounding my property, it seemed brighter than any of the other objects in the area. Suddenly it moved, it looked as though it ascended very rapidly, a significant distance and then descended to about where it had began. I blinked my eyes thinking &hellip; After watching it for a few more seconds it began to move in a sideways motion. At that point I called to my wife and daughter for verification. They both joined me and verified what I believed I had been witnessing. As my wife and daughter observed I went inside to get our Video camera unfortunately the night sky was to dark and the object was to distant to produce any usable images. I then decided to try some still Photography setting up my camera on my tripod and using a wireless remote I proceeded to take still photographs most not showing much more than a point of light. The rapid movements of the object ceased within 10 minutes of first observation, but I continued to watch the object until about 0300 hrs at which point it was behind the tree line.Just a note that although the object moved somewhat from the first position observed, it did not move at a consistent rate relative to the rest of the objects in the sky. I&rsquo;m not unfamiliar with the night skies and at the age of 50 have seen many different things but after checking the location in the sky the following evening, and seeing on a perfectly clear evening that there was nothing but dark sky where I witnessed the anomaly the night before, I felt the need to share this. Thank you for your time.((NUFORC Note:  Probable star, we suspect.  PD))", "I was a young man about 9(1984), but I have told this story to anyone who would listen my whole life as proof UFO&apos;s are not a myth. I was outside playing by myself on a moonless night and I cant say that I heard it, but I felt it for lack of a better term. It seemed audible but not really. I should have been able to hear it because it was not more than a thousand feet. I could not see the craft directly, but it blocked out the stars as it slowly tracked across town towards Cannon AFB, so I could make out its giant triangular shape easily, although I couldn&apos;t see the craft directly. I grew up near the AFB and was fascinated with it. I can remember not getting an &quot;extra-terrestrial&quot; feeling from the craft, but I always assumed it was carrying something to Cannon. The reason I am reporting this is because I went to meet a good friend of mine in Houston, TX just last week and over dinner he described seeing the exact same thing over Houston. He was doing relief work (we are wildland firefighters) and camping at the KOA. He saw a triangle object tracking across the sky. He said it blended in with the sky, but the moonlight was interfearing with its &quot;cloak&quot;. Anyway, I know these things were around as early as 1984. I felt it needed to be documented, the seem to be hard to see. Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.

After a couple of minutes, 2 of the objects abruptly stopped int heir tracks and the third continued north and that one subsequently came to an abrupt hault about thirty seconds later.  About a minute after all three were stationary, the first two that had stopped suddenly began to in circular motions and zig-zag motions, moving quickly in one direction then stopping quickly, then suddenly accellerating in another direction and stopping abriptly again.

My tree blocked the view so I don&apos;t know what happened after that.About a month ago I saw the same type of thing except it did go in a straight line but then turned around in a hair pin turn half way back on it&apos;s first path then stopped and faded out that was about 8:00pm I believe.((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as &quot;teacher.&quot;  PD))", "A large craft rose from a landing position in  a field and took off without making a sound.I was driving northbound on I65 in Kentucky. I don&apos;t know what the nearest town was but I was somewhere near the center of the state. I noticed an incredibly large craft rising up out of a field to my right out the passenger side window. At first I thought it was a military jet performing a vertical take off but as I turned my head to get a better look I could see it was it was not a jet and was about the size of a large commercial airliner or slightly bigger. It was a dark gray color and had some bright white lights on it. I didn&apos;t notice any windows but I could see that the exterior of the craft was not smooth and aerodynamic like you would see on an airplane or jet, it was more like looking at a factory with it&apos;s many components and and pipes connecting them together. It was difficult to tell the shape because of the angle but as it got higher I could see that it had dimensions to it before view was blocked by the roof of the car. I alerted my wife to it and asked her what it was, she couldn&apos;t identify it either. She watched it till it was out of her view and over the top of the car. I tried to get another look as it passed over the car to the the drivers side but it was traveling to fast at that point and could not make out any further detail before it disappeared out of sight.

Other long contrails were visible in other areas of the sky, particularly to the south.  The altitude of the three contrails seemed to be similar to typical jet contrails.The three contrails seemed unusual to me.  The contrail lengths were relatively short compared to others in different areas of the same sky.  The two most westward contrails were relatively close and in parallel.  A third contrail was close behind.  After observing these objects for about 20 to 30 seconds, it then appeared that there were actually four contrails.  The fourth contrail seemed to be close to the forward two.  The flight paths were apparently straight and the movement seemed to be consistent with high altitude aircraft speed which I have routinely observed.These contrails apparently were evaporating rather quickly.  After about 60 to 90 seconds after the initial observation, the contrails disappeared, one by one.  The last one observed was the trailing contrail.At this point, my initial impression was this phenomena could have been some type of debris entering the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and breaking into three or four relatively large pieces.  I was not able to determine if the contrails were actually due to aircraft.  I did not have access to any type of optical devices or cameras.  There was no observed points of light associated with the contrails.There was one other observer besides myself.  My background is in chemistry and radiological safety.  The other observer is a registered land surveyer.My question would be, &quot;Has any local radar station observed these objects at this location and time and made any identification?&quot;A response via email would be welcome if this observation warrants an investigation.", "Triangle formation of lights, one green over Dismal Swamp area Chesapeake,  VaI was alone on my way home from Chesapeake to Portsmouth VA, Friday Oct 24, about 9:30 PM. I was driving my usual route on the edge of the Dismal Swamp. My favorite route, Old Mill Rd, is a lonely dark curvy road, with no traffic lights. The sky was a beautiful dark blue. I think the moon was full. The sky was patched with large fluffy white clouds. It&apos;s close to deer mating season, and deer run across the road, so my eyes were closely following on the road. Above a clump of Cyprus and Oak trees, I noticed what I thought was an oddly moving jet airliner. I say odd because it moved much slower than a helicopter and emitted no sound. It was also to low to be an airliner. It wasn&apos;t a blimp either. The aircraft displayed about 6 or 7 large lights on each side of the chevron or triangular shaped craft with a green light on my left as I looked up. As I stated before, the sky was bright, but it was night. The last time I saw something strange like this I was around 12, 1973.  My brother told me to wait while he went in the house to get Daddy. Heck, no! I went with him, when Daddy came out it was gone. It was shaped like a shallow bowl on top of a saucer. The aircraft had many windows and lights all around and red lights on top. We saw this aircraft two more times the summer 1974 with my eldest brother and a neighborhood kid. I live 20 miles from Norfolk Naval, Oceana Air Naval and Langley Air Force Base. I have lived within the proximity of naval and air force bases all around me all my life. I have seen plenty of planes, jets, helicopters, Stealth Fighters and jets that take off straight up from a aircraft carrier, but I have never seen something like this and what we saw when I was 12.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))", "It was not a STAR!!!I went outside at 3 PM and immediately noticed the unusual low flight of what appeared to be a small military fighter jet. (This was unusual because of the low altitude over a residential area and the fact that not many military aircraft are ever seen in the area). The jet appeared to be circling the area instead of just passing through. I continued to see many low flying aircraft flying low in the area which were likely military aircraft as well, as they appeared to be very large turboprop aircraft and one large helicopter. Around 5 PM, a large orange/white plane that appeared to be a Coast Guard twin engine turboprop aircraft flew directly overhead. (The first that I have ever seen in the area).At 5:22 PM, a stationary object was observed to the West/Southwest about 60 degrees above the horizon. The stationary object could best be described as appearing star-like to the naked eye except that it was too bright and in the wrong part of the sky to be Saturn or Venus, which were not visible at this time. Already having binoculars in hand due to the &quot;air show&quot; that had been taking place for the past two hours, I took a better look at the stationary &quot;star-like&quot; object that looked very unusual and bright to be a star, and appeared to reflecting the sun.Immediately upon looking at the object with binoculars, it was apparent that the object was not a star, planet, or a moving object. The stationary object was totally dark or gray on top and extremely brilliant like the sun only on the very bottom underside of the object. The object appeared to be round. Thinking the only &quot;logical&quot; explanation for the object might be that it was a balloon sitting still with the setting sun reflecting off it&apos;s underside, I decided to watch the object to see if I could tell if it drifted any like a balloon. I braced my elbows on top of the frame of a patio swing to ensure I had a stable view of the object. After locking down my binoculars on the object for about ten seconds, the object shot off due South barely visible due to the high speed of it&apos;s acceleration.This makes over a dozen unusual &quot;sightings&quot; that I have personally observed in the Westlake, Louisiana area in the past six months. (Many with confirming witnesses).", "Nothing like I have ever seen beforeThe sighting was very brief.  I have lived in the mountains my whole life and I know what a shooting star is and this was no a star.  I was in the city not more than a mile from where I live.  You really can&apos;t even see the stars from where I was.  We walked out of the bar where we had had a few drinks.  I looked up and saw a large light moving across the sky.  This was no star!!!!!  I guess if you want the color it was white. WHY IN THE HELL DO YOU WANT THE BACK GROUNDS OF THE OBSERVER!!!!!!!  Either you saw it or you didn&apos;t.  Believe me I feel like an ass even writing this.

I remember sitting on another one of my horses when I looked up into the sky and saw an approaching light. There were no flashing lights and the light was pure white. It was moving as if it was a helicopter, but as it got closer, I saw that it wasnt. As it got above my pasture I freaked out and jumped off my horse and got into my truck, because it wasnt slowing down and kept getting lower. I took off and drove back to my house which is about a quarter mile away from my pasture, and when I turned around as I was driving through the gate, the light was about 20 feet above ground and I could clearly tell it was ONLY a floating light.When I drove back to my house I told my parents what had happened. They went back to check out what happened (I did not go because I was too freaked out), and my mother reported seeing the light but it was hovering over my sick horse, and then just floated away.I knew it was something that must have come from somewhere else...that was definately not some airplane or anything like that.

UFO September 25 / 2008  I walked down to my garage at around 10 and 11:00 pm on September the 25, it was a Thursday night. I was putting my cat in the garage, but before I did that, I walked out to my gate and was looking at the western sky. It was a dry warm night, there were stars out and a few airplanes in the sky. There is nothing but a field, where I walked down to my garage at around 10:00 pm. The incident took place between re I was gazing; I live in the country. As I was looking out into the field, I saw an object in the sky, a little above tree-height - flashing colors. It was an object that seemed to flash colors as it looked to be turning. Or it looked like it was turning or spinning. The lights emanating from the object were different colors - pink, blue green; pastel colors. The object was completely silent, I couldn&apos;t really make out the shape of the UFO. I went to get my film camera and my video camera. When I came back it was gone, I was disappointed. I took my cat into the garage, and when I came out of the garage I walked over to the shop, which is a couple of feet away; and for some reason, I looked down at the ground, looking at the bushes. All of a sudden I looked up and there it was! Staring right at me. It was at tree-top height directly across from me, in front of a house, across the road. The field I was looking at, before, is right alongside this house. The UFO appeared totally different now. It was circular, and of a star-like color, only a little warmer (color). It was white. It hovered for a minute or so while I picked up my cameras and took pictures. When I aimed my film camera, I couldn&apos;t see anything in the lens, but took the picture anyway. I got my video camera up and shot that too.  After I took my photos the object, which was completely silent, then started to drop down from the sky toward the ground. It was descending to the ground, I thought. I walked over to the gate trying to get a look at it going down to the ground and where it would land, but when I got around the gate, it was gone. It must have gone behind the house as I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. I was wondering why it had disappeared on me, but in the morning I viewed the spot again, where it had descended, and it obviously had to have gone behind the house. It had been further away than I had thought. It must have dropped behind the house and landed somewhere in a field. This is all farmland here. That is, if it landed, of course. I took my video film inside and put it on the tv to view. To my astonishment, I did get the UFO on video! It looked like it had five or more points on the object. It looked like it was spinning too. Then I got a white circular object and, a green circular object. Funny thing, the UFO that I saw on the video looked totally different than the one I saw with the naked eye (which was a circular white object at that point). While the circular green object, I didn&apos;t even see! It was like there were three objects out there, and my video camera picked up three UFO&apos;s. The flashing, turning UFO, the circular white UFO - plus, a green UFO. I thought that the flashing UFO probably traveled closer (across the field) and changed into a white circular UFO. ...But I don&apos;t know. The UFO&apos;s were in sequence, one right after the other on film, so I didn&apos;t see all of them at once. It could have been only one UFO changing form, though&hellip; Who knows?", "Bright white and yellow circular light over deserted forest in Brazil, accelerates downwards, four timesIt was just after 10 pm in Pirenopolis, Brazil.

This light stopped suddenly, remained stationary for about 10 seconds and accelerated downwards.In about 20 minutes, this light reappeared and seemed closer, or bigger.  This time it jumped to the left and right a few times which would leave a tail like yellow trail.  It stayed for about 10-15 seconds and again accelerated downwards.In about 20-30 minutes it reappeared again and stood still before accelerating downwards.In about one hour this light reappeared for the fourth and last time, this time a lot closer. This time it rose slowly and stayed still for a few seconds then just disappeared.The following morning I did my own research to make sure there are no military bases, etc. in that area.  There is nothing except forest, mountains, rivers and waterfalls.  It is a totally deserted area.

I was working at a mall in Tulsa, OK.  I had just left work around 10pm to go over to my girlfriend&rsquo;s house for a few hours.  It was October 12, 1999, and Halloween was fast approaching.  She had decided to go as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz.When I arrived at her house, she was outside gluing glitter to a pair of red heels for her costume.  I sat on her front steps with her while she did this.  When she was done, I suggested that we lie in the driveway and look at the stars.  It was relatively warm for that time of year, and the sky was as clear as can be.We got up and moved to the driveway.  As we lay there, looking at the stars and talking, I noticed something disturbing the night sky.  It was moving VERY slowly, maybe 100MPH or less.  The object was very low to the ground.  My guess is between 500ft and 750ft, but no more than that.  There were no lights, and no sound.  I could make out the silhouette of the object against the distant light pollution and the stars in the background.  It had a long fuselage with bulges to the side, kind of in the shape of lobes, where the cockpit might be, and at the back of the object.  The bulges to the side were smaller in the front than in the rear.  It had a slight glow behind it, though not like a jet.  I asked her if she was seeing what I was seeing.  She saw it as well.  We watched as the object slowly and silently moved through the night sky until it was out of sight.The fact that stood out to me was the complete lack of sound.  As a child I frequented air shows.  I was quite aware of the immense noise produced by a conventional engine, be it propeller or jet.  I had seen an F-14 perform a fly by at 100MPH once.  It was greatly pitched with a tremendous amount of thrust, and was loud enough to wake the dead.  What we saw that night was lower, slower, and not pitched at all.I don&rsquo;t think it was alien spacecraft, but the technology was nothing known to exist to this day.  A few weeks later I saw a show on TV about the &ldquo;Aurora&rdquo;, the top secret space plane.  The supposed shape of the Aurora, according to the show, was nearly identical to what we had seen.  My guess is that we may have witnessed a test flight of this plane.  The only thing that keeps me from being sure of that is that there were no lights on it.  I know the US puts lights on all aircraft, even test planes.  We&rsquo;ve seen this with the F-117.  This Unidentified Flying Object is wholly worthy of the title.  Not a flying saucer.  Not cigar shaped.  Not a light that moves at break-neck speed.  It was just an unidentified, slow flying, silent object.", "circular flaming craft,  vanished after 1 minutecircular object traveling horizontal. not an aircrart. no position or strobe lights visible. it appeared to be flaming. this sihgting lasted for approximatly 1 minute, then object vanished.", "Round white light/object moving through sky and suddenly disappearingTulsa Oklahoma:  Approximately 7:30 PM CST on 10-8-08:  I saw an object in the Northern sky. At first I thought it was Venus by the shape, size and brightness. But then I quickly realized that&apos;s not where Venus is located and also noticed the object was moving, heading East South East.At first I thought, &quot;oh well, must be a plane&quot;. But as I watched, I saw that it was not moving like a plane would move and it still looked like Venus, not a plane. So I grabbed my binoculars and looked at the object more closely. What I saw was a white, round object made of just one white round light. The object left no trail, had no other lights around it and moved at a fairly steady rate of speed.I watched the object for about 45-60 seconds and all of the sudden, it just flat disappeared. I don&apos;t mean it slowly went out of sight, more that, all of the sudden, it was just flat gone.There was no sound from the object, it did not change colors.", "Pale blue light streak across windshield in Roswell 11/02/08.I was driving down Hardscrabble road nearby the intersection with Chaffin going due west.  At the top of the windshield appeared a streak of light which I originally registered as a shooting star.  It was a pale blue green light fairly bright, consistant with perhaps a trail from a firework, but without any smoke. It streaked across my vision from the top of the windshield straight due west and possibly down and escaped my vision behind some trees.  It was going far to fast to be an airplane, and it was not a reflection since I have driven that road many times at night and never witnessed the same phenomenon. The only logical explanation I could come up with was perhaps a firework remain, but I didn&apos;t see smoke and it was an unlikely day and time.  I tried to turn down the radio to hear anything but it was probably too late.  The one thing I did notice was a slight increase in static on the radio which grabbed my attention before I saw the object.ADDENDUM TO REPORT:Correction to previous post.  It was pale in comparison to the lights of the street. However then again, there were no stars visible and it was much brighter and larger than any shooting star I have seen. Also since it was dark and I&apos;m slightly nearsighted it was difficult to tell whether it was moving parallel to the ground  or downwardly. There was also no clouds that night at the temperature was about 14 degrees Celsius.", "Opaque spheres in LisbonWhilst doing some sight seeing of Lisbon we drove up to St. Georges hill located in the older area of Lisbon. Prior to reaching the actual top of the hill we stopped on the wat at a Mirador as views were quite amazing. As the international airport is located in the city of Lisbon itself we observed to out right a TAP airliner ascending however, we looked at each other not knowing whats was going on because on the region of 7 spheres began to follow the airplane, sort of greish-brownish in colour, opaque and perfect in diameter apprx. 5 mts judging by the size of the airplane&apos;s windows and these spheres.

Following this, the spheres in an organized fashion beagn to form in a straight line after each had circled the airplanes rear fuselage, then after formation took of upwards at high speed dissapearing behing the grey sky clouds as the plane took off, an airbus (smaller model).

We were 14 at the time and were returning from a Boy Scout meeting.

My friend and I were seven miles northwest of Roseburg, Oregon, in a sparsely populated area (no houses for at least a mile away) checking out a hunting location that I was very familiar with and it was just before twilight.  We sat down to rest next to a creek-we were in a fairly deep, narrow valley between two hills-  when my friend noticed two yellowish lights at a distance about two thousand yards up the valley.  At first, I did not think much about it since I knew of a gravel road at the end of the valley and thought it was probably just headlights of a car, and told him of such.  We were about to get up since it was now almost dark-and had about a quarter mile to hike back to the truck-when I again notice the two yellow lights were now closer and heading directly down the canyon towards us.I still did not yet think they were UFO&rsquo;s or anything out of the ordinary when all of sudden we could hear animal(s) moving  in our direction away from the direction of the yellow lights- I couldn&rsquo;t see the animals since it was almost dark now and the area had enough brush and trees to hide them as well.  At the same time we were listening to the animals, I also started to see small (about 1 inch) red glowing &ldquo;sparkling&rdquo; spheres appearing at the base of a tree twenty feet away from us, towards the direction of the yellow &ldquo;lights.&rdquo;   These red spheres, suddenly appeared at the base, then started to swirled around the tree, all the time rotating upward, and then just as suddenly disappear once they reach the top of the tree.  More and more red spheres appeared around the trees in front of us when I started to asked my friend if he was seeing what I was seeing (I was worried that I was losing my mind) when he shakily replied, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I once again looked at the yellow &ldquo;lights,&rdquo; which were now close enough to see that they were not yellow lights at all, but two glowing, yellowish/orange, oblong spheres or &ldquo;crafts,&rdquo;- about six feet long and 3 feet high.  The crafts were about ten or fifteen feet above the oak trees and twenty feet apart- still fixed on the same course, now about eighty yards away, and still heading down the valley towards us.  These oblong crafts did not make any sound and did not rotate that I could see whatsoever but maintained a slow, methodical speed and spatial distance between themselves and the trees, all the while moving in our direction.  There was no propeller, wing, rudder or prop whatsoever on these &ldquo;crafts&rdquo; that I could see or detect.  They did not appear to be flimsy like a balloon nor rigid metallic either, but almost smooth, round-cornered plastic looking objects.  In addition, they did not glow from within nor from without, but within the skin of the craft itself.  Also, underneath the two spheres the ground was brightly lit up. The light that they emitted was strange in that you could not see the source of the light emitting from the spheres itself, like you would from a headlamp, instead the it was &ldquo;magically&rdquo; lit up underneath the spheres and the edges of the light did not slowly diffuse but stopped very abrupt&hellip; almost like it the light was contained!?! This was becoming too much for my senses&hellip; (I will admit I was starting to get freaked out, feeling quite alone even with my friend there in the woods and even though I hunted in this area alone all my life) we both stood up and I said let&rsquo;s get the heck out of here.   As soon as we moved, the spheres moved in an instance directly overhead and both of us were now bathed in the light.  I stood, in awe, frozen, looking at these THINGS, when one of the spheres shot out a red glowing disk (the same color of the smaller red spheres) straight upwards and then the red disk exploded in a brilliant flash of red light.  I felt frozen as if I was knocked unconscious and the next thing I know I am running.  My friend is also running beside me and we are both running towards my truck not saying a word when I reach the top of a hill I see another object or craft that is triangular in shape that appears high and quite far in the distance further past where my truck is located.This triangular craft is hard to describe how big it is because I cannot reference how far away it is, but it is definitely triangular and of decent size, as well as, far away.  The craft appears to be more metallic looking, in that it is straight lines and appears to be rotating or spinning and has three sides like a pyramid.  It either has three lights or sides or corners of red, silver, and blue, that either interchange or spins giving it an appearance of blinking or spinning motion.  It also appears that the bottom side arches or wobbles back and forth, giving it the &ldquo;blinking&rdquo; or jittering effect?!?.    I cannot describe this craft any further as to the fact that I was moving rather fast.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was moving towards west, towards Saudi Arabia, because it is located on west of Bahrain, from the sight I was viewing.When it disappeared from the scene I suddenly realize oh God I witnessed a UFO. I am not saying that exactly it is a UFO, but it might be. Unfortunately I was not having any camera at that time so I couldn&rsquo;t capture any picture.The place I witnessed this strange object was deadly silent area where no one reside. It is between two hill towns.  Called East Riffa and West Riffa in Kingdom of Bahrain.  I was standing on top of a hill in West Riffa and I noticed this object on sky.  I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else witnessed it.  But it was not too late at night, so I guess there might be someone else as well who might witness it.  It is a busy town, of Kingdom and around 6:30 pm  (This is not exact time when i saw the object, it might be few minutes different, but when everything ends i noticed it was 6:30 pm) during evening it becomes busier on roads.  I know, there were none around where I was standing, but it was too high in the sky, so it might be seen from far too, as Bahrain is a small country.I will also try to draw a picture of the object, which is still in my mind. I will never forget that moment. One more bad luck of mine was I was carrying Sony Erickson Z800, the camera of this phone is not that good, that I can capture the object photo clearly, and as I said I was out of my mind for few seconds when I saw the object. So I didn&rsquo;t even realize that I am having something to capture this object.I am shocked and a bit scared to see such a strange thing flying over our heads and no one can notice it. I know this is hard to believe without any evidence, but I feel my brain was frozen at that time and then start functioning after it disappears. I just need to ask a question here, is it possible that UFO can freeze human brain? If YES, then I think that happened to me.It might not be a brain frozen, because if that was the case then how can I remember the movement and picture.

The flowers hanging over the pot looked pretty against the bright blue cloudless sky, so I shot four pictures in a row of them, from about 20 feet away, using a telephoto lens. (The first shot was a &quot;single;&quot; the next three were a &quot;burst.&quot;) The shots were aimed up toward the sky, slightly north, but mostly to the west.

I was putting my cat in the garage, but before I did that, I walked out to my gate and was looking at the western sky. It was a dry warm night, there were stars out and a few airplanes in the sky. There is nothing but a field, where I walked down to my garage (at around 10:00 pm). I was gazing at the sky; I live in the country. As I was looking out into the field, I saw an object in the sky, a little above tree-height - flashing colors. It was an object that seemed to flash colors as it looked to be turning. Or it looked like it was turning or spinning. The lights emanating from the object were different colors - pink, blue green; pastel colors. The object was completely silent, I couldn&apos;t really make out the shape of the UFO. I went to get my film camera and my video camera. When I came back it was gone, I was disappointed.I took my cat into the garage, and when I came out of the garage I walked over to the shop, which is a couple of feet away; and for some reason, I looked down at the ground, looking at the bushes. All of a sudden I looked up and there it was! Staring right at me, at tree-top height, directly across from me, in front of a house - across the road. The field I was looking at, before, is right alongside this house across the road. The UFO appeared totally different now. It was circular, and of a star-like color, only a little warmer (color). It was white. It hovered for a minute or so while I picked up my cameras and took pictures. When I aimed my film camera, I couldn&apos;t see anything in the lens, but took the picture anyway. I got my video camera up and shot that too.  After I took my photos the object, which was completely silent, then started to drop down from the sky toward the ground. It was descending to the ground, I thought. I walked over to the gate trying to get a look at it going down to the ground and where it would land, but when I got around the gate, it was gone. It must have gone behind the house as I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. I was wondering why it had disappeared on me, but in the morning I viewed the spot again, where it had descended, and it obviously had to have gone behind the house. It had been further away than I had thought. It must have dropped behind the house and landed somewhere in a field. This is all farmland here. That is, if it landed, of course.I took my video film inside and put it on the tv to view. To my astonishment, I did get the UFO on video! It looked like it had five or more points on the object. It looked like it was spinning too. Then I got a white circular object and, a green circular object. Funny thing, the UFO that I saw on the video looked totally different than the one I saw with the naked eye (which was a circular white object at that point). While the circular green object, I didn&apos;t even see! It was like there were three objects out there, and my video camera picked up three UFO&apos;s. The flashing, turning UFO, the circular white UFO - plus, a green UFO. I thought that the flashing UFO probably traveled closer (across the field) and changed into a white circular UFO. ...But I don&apos;t know. The UFO&apos;s were in sequence, one right after the other on film, so I didn&apos;t see all of them at once.

I believe these objects &quot; spheres &quot; are real. I could not determine a very definate shape because of its distances. I noticed that they always maintain their distance. I wanted to report it this time. The sky was clear with 10 to 15 not winds on the ground. The color appeared white. There was only one.

After about 7 seconds it seemed to morph into a green light that was super intense. The green light lasted only a second. At that time its airplane like pace changed to a warp speed.  Much faster than anything I can imagine anything on this earth capable of doing.I would guess in much greater excess of 1000 mph.  And yet no sound was ever heard. An aircraft would at least break the sound barrier.

It looked liked the brightest thing we have ever seen in the night sky. My older brother who is 28 years old said he saw something similar about 10 years ago. He also pointed out that if it was a plane we would have heard it and it didn&apos;t make any noise from what we tried to hear. My younger brother tried to take a video of it with his cellphone and didn&apos;t get any image from it. I also want to  point out that we couldn&apos;t see the reflection of it off the lake.

This is what I can tell you:  At about 7:50 PM, my friend and I went outside to smoke a cigarette. We were looking at an unusually bright star, concluding that it was probably a planet. We were discussing what planet it might be when I looked above it and saw a flashing light. I thought it must have been an airplane, but when I looked a bit higher, I saw two more. What was very strange is that none of the blinking lights were moving. They were very far away, so I couldn&rsquo;t tell for sure if they were just moving very slowly. Then, the highest one started to rise upwards, and we realize that it was coming towards us. We watched, and the weirdest part is that it was completely silent. There is a small-craft airport in town, and we are used to hearing planes. This object made no noise at all.It kept moving towards us until it was finally above us and then past us. We looked up and noticed that it was shaped like a triangle with a light blinking on each end, one light red. I thought they might be government planes since Palin was in Bowling Green today. But they were so close together that it just seemed off. The one traveling above us kept going, silently. We looked back to the other two- one was gone, the other (the lowest one, the first I saw) was still in the same spot.We kept watching the moving one and then the third reappeared (or a fourth appeared, I can&rsquo;t be sure) coming from a completely new direction. They were less than an inch away (from where I stood, it looked this way), slowed down a bit, and then kept traveling on.We watched for 4-5 minutes.I went inside to turn on the news and fire up my computer, but of course nothing was mentioned. I have never looked up anything online about UFOs before, and this was the first site I came across.I went back outside about 3 minutes after I stopped watching- the first object that I saw was gone, the one that moved over us was very far into the distance, and the third was also gone.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))I am correcting the date on my previously submitted form- I wrote that it was the 30th when it is, in fact, the 29th.((END ADDENDUM))", "Green fireball moving very low across the sky, throwing off sparks like fireworks.Last night, a friend of mine and I took our sons out Trick or Treating here in Westchester, California, just north of Los Angeles International Airport.  We ended up at our local park&rsquo;s Haunted House, and waited in the car for the kids to go through. We were parked facing North, and as we talked, I noticed a green flash of light streaking low across the sky. At first, I thought I was seeing fireworks, as the color was bright emerald green.  Then I realized it was ball shaped, and looked like a shooting star. Unlike a shooting star though, it seemed much lower in the sky, very close by, like fireworks would have been; and it was  moving horizontally through the sky, rather than the falling arc one usually sees with a &ldquo;shooting star.&rdquo;  There seemed to be some sparks coming off of it also, as if it were burning up in the atmosphere.

They also had a red light on it that would quickly blink on occasion.These lights were moving in all directions and were able to change direction very fast. These lights would go in circles around each other and drift apart. They would go as high as the moon was and drop to behind the Mountains in about 1 and one half seconds. When planes flew by these lights would dim so much that they could not be seen and as soon as the plane was gone the light would go up and start shining.

My younger kids and neighbor kids could not see them.   It was a clear day without wind about an hour before sunset. There was no sound emitted, lights or exhaust trail observed from the object.  I viewed the object moving from west to east directly towards STL at about half to a third or maybe at the height of jet airliners that fly over that path.  I contacted my wife and a couple of neighbors after i saw another object. They also saw about 8 -10 more objects intermittently for about a half hour. They appeared to go over the same path but not exactly, some higher some lower but not too different, but at a similar velocity and straight line path west to east.   The last object I saw was higher up which I pointed out to my neighbor.  About 30 seconds after that last object was seen 3 stealth fighters appeared in single file formation but spaced out, were directly behind the  path of that last object.  There was also a jet airliner  elavating toward the south that flew very close right underneath the stealths.  The last object I saw flying ahead of the stealths was moving about 2-3x the speed of the military craft.  It was a very clear day. Four adults and a teenager saw them and cannot ID them as birds, balloons in a jet stream or any aircraft we have ever seen.  They were fast, you could only view them for about 15 seconds until they faded to the east, whereas the stealths were visible for about 4 x as long and easily identified. The last object seem to be about a third of the size as the stealths and a little less elevated but on a similar path.  The stealths were barely audible.", "I was sleeping in the downstairs guestroom of our farmhouse since my husband was sick in our bedroom upstairs. In a partial sleep, I heard my husband clearly call my name. I quickly got out of bed and went up to check on him but he was sound asleep. I came back downstairs and as I got back into bed I saw a flashing light in the corner of the guestroom window. At first I thought it was lightning but I knew I hadn&apos;t heard any thunder and that a storm was not expected. I went to the window and pulled back the shade and stood in front of it and in the rear pasture (about 500 feet away) I saw very large flashing white lights and it seemed there were smaller lights that were trajected out from the larger lights that were flashing at a faster rate.  (From looking at photos on the internet of UFO sitings, it may been not flashing lights but a craft turning fast -- though they appeared to be flashing.)There was no sound at all. It seemed to be a craft but I couldn&apos;t see a craft -- only lights --if the lights were attached to something, it seems that the craft should have been round. I guess my first thought was that it was a helicopter but I soon knew this couldn&apos;t be the case as it was much too large and didn&apos;t make any sound at all. It moved across the pasture and closer to the house and at the end of the pasture (about 300 feet away) it appeared to come down and to try to land. It was only at this point I became frightened.  But then it quickly raised up into the air again and went off behind the house where I couldn&apos;t see it any longer. The smaller flashing faster lights continued to be on the side of the house where my window was for another 5 to 8 seconds. I went to the back of the house but by the time I arrived there, I could see no more lights and was too scared to go outside. The next day I went out to the pasture but saw no evidence of anything that was visible from a landing or an attempted landing. My impression was that it wanted to land, somehow detected me, and then decided not to! land. P erhaps an electrical or energy field that it created by being so close is what made me hear my husband&apos;s voice wake me up. It was clearly not my husband who was fast asleep upstairs and I still don&apos;t know why I woke up. I didn&apos;t contact authorities in the area as it is rural and no one wants the local authorities to think they might be crazy. I&apos;ve not been able to find any reported sightings in this area on that day other than a possible one in Canada and a possible one in Connecticut, but nothing nearby. And I &apos;ve not been able yet to find a description of a UFO siting that sounds like what I saw.

Then I saw it was in fact an object of some type, though I couldn&apos;t really make it out. I passed this figuring it was just some helicopter hovering perfectly above the road. Then, maybe 5 minutes later, I was still on New Circle between exit 5A and 5B (I was getting off at 5B, onto Versailles Rd.) when I saw a low flying object slowly come down at an angle towards the ground as if to land (though the airport is not over there and I don&apos;t know of any airstrip in that direction). I at first thought it was a plane but then the object stopped in mid-air, hovering. It had at least 3 bright white lights on it, and 1 red blinking light (thus I thought it to be a commercial plane at first). The shape of it seemed to be pretty thin, shaped kind of like a saucer. It looked to me like it had a flat top and the edges came out at slight diaganols pointing towards the ground. I was not able to get a very good look for long because I was driving and was literally just about at my exit, though I did brake to slow down and get a longer look. I have no clue if it made noise or not, I happened to be listening to my radio very loudly at the sighting. I believe that some others on the road saw it and thought it was something strange as well, as I noticed cars braking abnormally near the object.", "Two seperate orbs pass slowly over my house.I was standing on my front porch, I had just lit a cigar and neighborhood kids were trick or treating.  As I turned around toward the street my eye caught a red light in the Sky at about 2 o&apos;clock high.  This red light was approaching slowly toward me.  At first I thought it was a plane however it was moving too slow to be a plane.I stepped off the porch to observe the light as it was passing over my house.  It passed straight over my house at a height of I would guess to be several thousand feet.  Looking at the object straight above it had no flashing marker lights as a plane would have.  The object appeared to be round and it glowed orange/red.  As it passed over the brightness of the object suddenly changed to a faint red dot.  I could track this dot as it proceeded North East.  I lost it as it passed behind the neighbor&rsquo;s house. The object made no noise.I called my Father at 6:58pm after the object left my field of view.  He lives about 20 minutes in that direction and I asked if he would go out and look west.  Hoping he would see this object as it approached.  My Father noticed a white light moving slowly but didn&rsquo;t think anything more of it.While on the phone with my Father I looked up and another Orb was moving on the same trajectory.  I disconnected the call and managed to take one photo with my camera phone. The orb faded out as the first one did and I could track a smaller faint dot as it moved North East.  Second Sighting was at 7:00 pm, shortly after two older teens were walking in front of the house.  I asked them if they saw anything and the teens indicated that they saw what looked like a flying pumpkin.", "Bright single white light on a summer night sky in eastern N.C.I was at a friends house in the neighborhood I was living in. There was about five of us in a small children&apos;s pool in her backyard. I remember the time of night because at 20:00 my dad would always call us in for dinner, and maybe 30 minutes later would actually come out and get us. We were in the water and I heard my dad call us, but we continued playing anyway. I got out from under a pan we were playing with when I looked up towards the sky. When I looked up I saw a white light that was moving slowly from the right side of the sky. I continued watching it trying to figure out what it was because it was only one light, which I knew wasn&apos;t a plane, and it was also moving faster than a satellite would be plus it was much brighter. While I was watching this object I noticed that it had stopped moving almost as if it realized I was watching it. While this object was motionless I decided to get one of the others to look at the sky to see if they saw it as well. When I finally got them to look at the sky the object then did a zig-zag pattern kind of in up and outward way like what would happen  in a generated image, but as it was doing this pattern it was leaving behind a trail of light behind it. When the light was completely faded is when my dad showed up.

Im estimating the distance from my location to be around two to three miles. It looked like they came from the area of Wapato, Wa. It looked like they twsiting and wobbeling.They were scattered horizontally behind the light signals, it looked like they were above Union Gap, Wa. a suburb of Yakima city.

The light turned green and i proceeded east on Nob Hill blvd until i got to the college parking lot areas turned off in a north direction and stoped, got out of my vehicle, looked up and then noticed there were more above.I then got on to stewart, it is the first street that runs along side Nob Hill blvd on the north side it. I then went to my place which isnt very far from both those locations, after parking i got out then looked straight up, i then seen something that was much bigger and non metalic.

There are trees in this area all over, its hard to say what it did. I then looked for the other ones that i had seen before, on my way home. I did observe two of these metalic ones, to the north. They were very far away, and it looked like they were changing there direction back to the east, towards Selah, Wa. which is another suburb of Yakima, Wa.After several minutes of trying to identify these, they just disappeared, it was like they had split up and went up higher in oposite directions. The lower bigger one that was non metalic, im not sure where that one went. I was wearing sun glasses, up until that last few minutes, then i couldnt see them anymore. It seemed like these sun glasses helped me to see them better then with the naked eye.This could have something to do with the light spectrum, it seemed like they were more shiny with the sun glasses on, when i took them off and looked i found it harder to respot them. This could be a hoax, even thou the lower jet stream usually goes in the opposite direction. One of these looked like it could have been a transparent weather ballon with an instrument hanging under it, another one almost looked like it was a parachute out of control.Three of these objects i cant explain, the big one disappeared, the other two that were metalic, they looked like smaller connected clusters making it look like one object.

I travel this road everyday, taking it to school and to work. I am used to seeing airplanes fly right over the highway to come in for landings at the airport, which sits just off the highway. I also know what an airplane looks like when it is flying at night, and am aware of the blinking lights that an airplane has on its underside and on its wings. Tonight though, on my way home, something strange happened. I was coming up on the airport like I said, and I saw a very bright white light off in the distance to my left. I thought it was just an airplane that was on its way in to land, however; at times it seemed as if it wasn&rsquo;t really moving at all. Like it was almost hovering off in the distance, but the lights were very bright, even with it being a ways off in the distance. I saw it began making its way closer and closer to the highway eventually, all the while still thinking that it was just an airplane. But once I traveled past the airport on the highway, I realized that it was coming it at such an angle that it couldn&rsquo;t have been heading to the airport, because the airport was now behind me and this object was traveling perpendicular to the highway, not back towards the airport at an angle. As this object got closer to the highway, and was about to fly over the highway, I was making my way underneath an overpass and I was directly under the object and I looked up and knew immediately that this was no airplane, or any other aircraft that I have seen before in my life. It was traveling directly above the road that was the overpass and continuing to my right down that road over some trees. I believe it was Moon Clinton Road. It appeared to be rectangular, but also could have been a saucer shape, due to the brightness of the lights I could not tell. The best way I can describe its shape was maybe rectangular on the sides with roun! ded corn ers. It had very bright lights coming out of it. I became very frightened by it because I knew this was nothing I had ever seen before, and sped up. I looked away at the road, and when I turned back to look at it again, it was gone. I called 911 and reported it right away because I was freaked out by it, and knew it was not an airplane, and also due to its close proximity to the airport, I did not know if it was of any harm to anyone or any other aircraft.

A large, very bright ball of light dropped down into my field of vision in my windshield on the driver&apos;s side. It just hung there in the sky for several seconds before it suddenly zipped straight back up into the sky the same way it had come. It happened very fast. I stopped and leaned out to see if I saw it in the sky anywhere but it was totally gone. In my windshield, it was probably about the size of a big headlight but the light was very defined, edges not blurry at all. Not a very good comparison but that&apos;s about how big it looked. I&apos;ve seen this once before sometime around the fall of 1977. I was lying on my back in the pasture with the horses one night around 8:00 in the evening. I was looking up at the sky when suddenly a similar ball of light appeared to fall straight down into my field of vision. It hung there for a few seconds, then it started to move straight back up slowly. I sat up because I started to get a little scared. All of a sudden it took off almost straight back up but angled off to the right a little bit. Then it just disappeared. I lived in Mississippi then.", "Big Light in the West Sky over Leavenworth WashingtonI was taking the dogs out, and I was looking up at the sky toward the west.  I noticed a bright light that I first thought was a star, then it started to move, what looked like, towards me.  I then thought it was a plane, but could not hear any noise as the object got closer.  I called to my daughter to come look.  She also noticed the light.  It moved slow, in a straight line.  It would then speed up a little and then slow down.  It also seemed to quiver (move side to side) in small spurts.  It then turned, what looked from the ground, to move striaght up in the air as it turned the color changed from bright to pinkish then redish and disappeared.  I called a good friend of mine to tell her what I saw and she saw the same light.

The circle was not complete.The grass around the circle is green. The grass that makes up the outline of the object that landed is completely brown (killed) to the root.

These 2 objects were circular, with lights ringing the outside perimeter of their circumference.  Their movement was eratic, ranging from hovering, to then quickly darting about while flipping and rotating.As the objects flipped in abrupt directional changes, the top of the disk appeared to be a dark metallic.  The lights surrounding the craft would ocassionally flash brightly.  It appeared as if the objects were ringed with 8 white lights, and 1 larger red one; which by watching the movements of the objects, would indicate being the &apos;front&apos;.The objects were visible this entire time just barely under the low slung clouds.

Their shape was long but I could not tell if it was long and cylindrical, or long and flat. I do know however that they did NOT have a fuselage or tail section as there was no strobes or lights to indicate such, and were low enough (about 1,500 ft.) that I could tell they were not of any known recognizable aircraft.The lights are what first caught my attention. The first craft had bright lights like a jet would like landing lights. There was also a bright flash like a strobe that would come from the bottom center, but it was an inconsistent flash, and not the typical consistent strobe like you would see on a normal aircraft.Both aircraft had four dimmer white lights evenly spaced located in the front of the craft. The second craft followed behind the first at a 45 degree angle and moved from the left to the right side behind the lead craft as they flew overhead. From what I could tell they were spaced about 200ft apart. The second craft did not have the bright landing lights like the first had, nor did it have the bright strobe underneath but again they both were the same shape.The weather last night was a light drizzle. These craft emerged from the clouds and flew just below the ceiling until they flew past beyond my line of sight.I would not usually report something like this, but what disturbs me is what I found out today. As I drove in to my college classes this morning I heard on the news that a 6lb. chunk of ice had fallen through an elderly woman&rsquo;s home injuring her. This occurred in York, PA about 25 minutes from Hanover where I saw the craft. The ice had fallen yesterday morning at 5:30am, and I saw the craft in Hanover at 7:45pm.You can find the Ice story on the York Dispatch website:http://yorkdispatch.inyork.com/yd/search/ci_10677963?IADID=Search-yorkdispatch.inyork.com-yorkdispatch.inyork.com The ice is currently being examined at York College to see what contents the ice has. As I am a student here I am going in tomorrow to see if I can find out what they have found and get their opinion. It&rsquo;s a piece of evidence that could possibly be linked to what I saw. I&rsquo;d hate to see the government get a hold of this and have the Ice findings disappear.  Does anyone have any ideas as to what this could be and have there been any reports to you guys concerning this issue?", "nite round bright light  bouncing all over sky,week or so later daytime black sphere speeding threw skyWoke up to go to the bathroom @ 3:45-4:00 am. I looked out the window to see what the weather was doing. I saw a light in the sky. Thinking it was a plane with it&apos;s head lights on, but I didn&apos;t see any blue or reds on the tips. Also at this point I relized it wasn&apos;t going foward or away.It wasn&apos;t a helicoptor. It was dead silence outside. Now I was curious, so I kept staring for roughly five minutes. I watched it go from one side to the other in the sky. Then it went up and down. When this bright orb would go from one side to another it would disapear for a sec then reapear to a different part of the sky. Don&apos;t know why I waited so long to say something to some one. Also the following week I saw military chopers in the sky. One cargo looking one and a tiny one. That following week I saw something in the day time - a black sphere speeding through sky. I have never see anything move that fast befoere. This isn&apos;t the first time I&apos;ve seen things here in Vermont. I guess cause of the view I hav.

I was parked in a downtown parking lot facing north when this occurred.  I iniatially observed 3 lights spaced pretty equally apart, but at slightly different altitudes.  Because of the downtown horizon I was unable to ascertain if they were coming up from the ground or just a slightly lower altitude.  These lights appeared to be coming from the northeast east quadrant of Marion County (about 10 miles away from me).  After noticing and watching the first three lights, I observed 3 or 4 more about 20-30 seconds behind, ascending in the same manner as the first 3. I then observed approximatly 6-8 more of these objects floating or flying upwards from the same area.  After getting so high into the sky the objects disappeared.  There was a cloud cover on this night, as we did have rainfall off and on.  I am not sure if the lights or objects just burned out or I was unable to see due to the clouds.  The puzzeling thing was that the clouds were going from west to east, and these objects were floating upwards from east to the west, into the wind, but only at a very gradual change. Because these objects were going into the wind rather than with the wind, I quickly dismissed them as balloons of any kind but I could be wrong.  I have never seen anything like this before but there could be a legitimate reason for them.  I am just curious what they were.  I did watch the 6am newscast when I returned home from work and did not see any mention of the lights for legitimate or unknown purposes.  I did email the Indianapolis Star to see if they knew what the lights were, but so far I have not received a response. I also observed what appeared to be a commercial aircraft heading towards the lights, but the lights had cleared its path by time the aircraft arrived in the area.  I would suspect there was a good possibility the aircraft pilots observed these lights as well.  The aircraft was going from the west to the east ( I assume leaving Indpls. Intn. Airport).  Several hours later when I returned to that spot (where I sit until a run comes out) I did observe what is mistakenly called a &quot;shooting star&quot; in the area.  This one appearred to be closer and brighter then ones I have seen in the past, but this could just be coincidence.  I just figured I would report it in case anyone else had seen it and no explanation could be found for the lights presence.

It appeared to be getting larger as if it were an approaching aircraft.  Then it dropped altitude gained rapid speed and came to a stop approx. 500 ft. over the 101.  It was at this time that I noticed it had no aircraft beacon or navigation lights but was giving off one intense light that seemed to change color from yellowish to a bright white.  As traffic approached cars were slowing and pulling off the freeway, others were speeding up and trying to flee the scene.  As I travelled under the object I looked up and saw a dark circular edge around the light.  The object then accelerated vertically at which time the color turned a redder hue.  After reaching a height of approx. 3,000 ft. it headed west out over the ocean changing shape several times before dimming out as a foggy white light in a coastal low cloud layer.

My wife and I were watching television and we were engaged in conversation so I was looking her way which was in front of a window.  That is when I noticed an object come over the building and trees rather quickly.   I was looking south and the object was traveling south east.   First, I noticed the color which was very bright and green, almost like a neon green.  In my opinion I thought the light looked like a green stop light color but much more intense.  Also, the light was slightly pulsing big to small repetitions at a steady, swift rate.  Second, I noticed it didn&rsquo;t have any trails like a shooting star or meteorite plus I had never seen anything like this so close .  The angle was about 25-35 degrees.Lastly, the object traveling in a perfect straight line in that approximate angle, progressively got smaller and eventually vanished (all taking place in about 5-7 seconds).  This is the first unidentified flying object that I have ever seen.  I know that it was not man made, it was just to fast and the above description makes it impossible.  It was fast but not fast enough to be a comet or some type of space rock in my opinion.  I have not been able to not come up with a logical explanation for something like this.

The object was cylindrical with a height to length ratio resembling 3 steel barrels end to end but twice the size.  Object was totally quiet, moving too slow to actually be capable of flight, and had no aerodynamics to support flight at all such as wings or other control surfaces.  I even checked overhead for a helicopter or anything else that could be transporting the item.  Both ends of the item were blunt.  I believe some sparking was evident at the rear with a trace of smoke, but not like a jet or rocket as we know it.  Color was gray to metalic with a few blinking lights.I stopped my car so I could follow the item until it disappeared behind a hill on the Northwest side of Tehran&apos;s city limit.  The interesting thing is that the item passed 90 degrees over the Eastern end of Tehran&apos;s Mehrabad Airport main runway traveling due North.Arriving at work at the airport I checked with military and commercial personnel to see what was going on thinking someone else had to see it considering the location.  Apparently no one else had seen it and no reports were filed.  I never spent too much time thinking about it after that until 3 years ago when I saw the 1976 reports and thought someone had the dates wrong.  The smaller object in that report was similar to what I had seen a year earlier.For info, at that time I was a USAF Master Sergeant working at the MAC terminal located on the Eastern aircraft parking ramp at Mehrabad.  I was the ranking NCO and was a jet aircraft mechanic.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The streak was bright white and went from high in the sky to low behind the trees (which were about 50 yards away and 30 feet high).  I noted the streak was thicker than what I thought a shooting star to be and then thought that it was a meteor breaking through the atmosphere.  The streak of light disappeared behind the trees and a moment later a large rectangularly shaped patch of light appeared above us on our right (North-west).The vehicle we were traveling in was moving about 65-75 mph and the rectangular light was obscured by the roof of my car as I got close to it and it was directly on our right.  It is then that 4 of my passengers witnessed a second large rectangular light appear next to the first and together they traveled over the highway behind us and disappeared behind more trees.  The lights were very bright white, so much so that they were almost bluish, and my back right passenger said he saw the two rectangular patches as having bulges in their centers, leading us to believe they were cylindrical in shape, like two cans of soup.  The objects were pretty low in the sky and as far as we could tell close to us.There were six in the car.  The driver was the only one to see the &apos;shooting star&apos; ahead of us on the left, and all but 1 of us saw the rectangles.  The driver did not see the duo of rectangles or their movements behind the car.  All six are seniors at Fairfield University and in good academic standing and have never seen anything like this before.NOTE: About four miles north east of where we saw these lights is Sikorsky airfield, where they build and test airplanes and helicopters, so this may have been something from there, however the movements, shape and color lead us to believe otherwise.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I have been married for a little over 10 years to my second husband and a little over 8 years to my first husband. I graduated high school in the top 10% of my class. Over my lifetime I have spent a lot, or more than average amount, of time looking at the stars at night because they have always fascinated me.What I have observed I started noticing about two weeks ago but I cannot tell you when the events actually started. While going outside at night to smoke, I ovserved some bright lights in the sky. These lights were brighter than any I have ever seen. They were also closer to the ground than any I have ever seen. Upon seeing the first one, I scanned the sky and I noticed that there were more and they were all doing the same things. I guess what caught my attention more than anything was the pattern that they were moving in the sky and that they strobed a light which at first glance reminded me of a plane in the night sky. So, because some of them were so close to the ground and moving erraticly and flashing funny, I started watching them.I then observed that these lights were not and could not be planes. They seemed to be moving back and forth and up and down and sometimes in a circle pattern and flashing a red, blue, white, and green lights. They were fast moving as well. Faster than anything I have ever seen.After about a week of seeing them I mentioned the matter to my husband. Later that day I mentioned it to my 15 yr old son. That same night, I went outside about 1am to smoke and my son was still up. I can inside and got him. He came outside with me and I pointed the lights out to him and he sat outside for more than 2 hrs watching them with me. He observed the same things I noticed. I had him tell me the specifics about their movements before I told him what I was seeing in detail because I wanted to know that I was actually seeing what I was seeing. He also noticed the exact movements and flashes of light that I was and he also observed that they could not be planed due to the fact that they were moving too fast and not in patterns that a plane makes or even could make. I laughed at first because I thought I was dreaming or just was not seeing what I thought I was seeing.I could draw a picture of the shape of the objects but typing or trying to put it into words just doesnt do them justice. They are beautiful and seem to change shape.They are in different areas of the night sky and seem to be operating in pairs. For everyone I see I will see another one close by making the same erratic movements with the same flashes of light. And sometimes they just disappear and reappear in the same spot in which they vanished.That about sums it up. I could keep typing but I would just seem to be repeating myself, so I will stop. I would like to know what these strange lights are. They have me worried about what is going on and at the same time fascinated as to what may be going on. I know what I see and I know that it is different from anything I have ever seen before.", "3 illuminated oval objects spotted flying closely together.My boyfriend and I were at the Fleet Skating Center in Providence, RI, observing a chalk drawing art exhibit that was held earlier on. It was a perfectly clear nite, the stars were out and there were only a few clouds, if any. I happened to look up, and directly in my path of vision I saw 3 oval lights flying closely together. I alerted my boyfriend, who also observed the objects. I proceeded to point and shout, but others around us did not bother to look.

And while &quot;glide&quot; seems to be a bit inadequate, I am not sure how else to describe its motion other than with that word.After a minute and a half or so, 2 other objects joined it in flight...they had the same blue glow.All continued to head South.From my vantage point, I could not really tell if they were in any kind of flight formation or not.One thing that struck me was the flight path.Usually when I notice planes going overhead, they tend to follow the curve of the Earth, getting closer to the horizon as they move further away.These 3 objects did not seem to do that.As they proceeded South, they did not get lower on the horizon, but continued into the darkness of the sky, like they were going away from Earth.Please feel free to contact me if there are any questions.", "the fantastic and unique hour of the night that we have ever spent watching the skyupon going out to have a cigarette and look at the stars i noticed a row of what at first appeared to be stars. upon watching we noticed then start moving all around and flashing multi colors and dancing lights the 3 brightest formed a large triangle which encased a diagonal line of three ,another diagonal line of three which then split to six  the colors were very unique and flashed very rapidly .the three in a vertical line where blinking in numerical patterns .", "Huge black blimpe object hovering/flying over  Norcross Georgia!!I live in Norcross, Georgia.  This sighting was on Sept. 31 2008, I was walking down Holcomb bridge road coming from Peachtree Corners/Holcomb bridge rd. area  heading toward the intersection of Holcomb bridge rd. and Jimmy Carter Blvd.As I was approaching the plaza/parking lot where Blockbuster and Papa John&rsquo;s Pizza is located, I notice a huge black object in the sky directly in front of me.  It was hovering over the area where Peachtree Ind. Blvd. and Jimmy Carter Blvd. intersect.  The object was shaped like a &ldquo;Blimp&rdquo; but much bigger! The outline of this object was easy to see, but the actual body appeared like a &ldquo;ink smudge&rdquo; no real texture (wasn&rsquo;t solid)(The object was a little higher than tree level) As I was looking at it, I notice a young man coming toward me,and I stopped him and pointed to the sky and asked him did he see that and if he knew what it was.  I wanted to make sure I was not seeing things!  The young man turned and looked up (it was behind him) and he could not explain it either.  He was the one that pointed out something that was hanging down toward the back of it. We talked for a few second and he continued on his way.  Once I focused on the rear end of the object, it was then that I was able to see some sort of &lsquo;wavy like aurora&rsquo; somewhat smoky looking around the back area.  I continue to watch it as I was walking (not very fast), when I got close to the CITGO gas station I notice a small airplane coming south down Peachtree Ind. Toward the object.  I stopped and waited to see if the airplane was going to change directions or something to avoid running into this object also I wanted to compare the size of the airplane to the object.The airplane was coming from my left as I faced the object toward its front end.  I could clearly hear and see the airplane but when the airplane approached the object, (the objected did not move) it passed thru the top portion of the object!!  As it flew thru the object I lost sight of the airplane, but I could hear it and I stayed focused until it emerged from the other side.  The airplane continued south on Peachtree Ind., as if that big black object was not even there!!  By now, I am getting very confused about what this thing is and I wondered if the people driving could see it!  I start walking again still looking at it.  I was walking to the Chic-fila on Peachtree Parkway and I usually walk thru all the parking lots on Holcomb Bridge.  When I reached Holcomb bridge rd. heading toward Panera&rsquo;s, I start loosing sight of it because of the trees.  When I came to the first parking lot where RBC bank is at, I looked to my right and there it was!  I almost felt as though it was following me because I do not walk fast and I figured it would be gone by the time I get from the area with all the trees.  The object was now flying north on Peachtree Ind. Blvd., heading toward Duluth!  I watched it pass the Holiday Inn Hotel; at Holcomb Bridge and PIB it then started to pick up speed but continue flying along PIB.I watched this object until it looked like a black spot in the sky.  After it got up in the Duluth area, it appeared to stop at the bottom right of the sun!  The sky was blue and free of clouds this morning and this object was completely black.  I know people traveling up and down PIB had to see it.  Anyone in Chic-fila&rsquo;s drive thru, anyone coming in -out of Paneras had to notice it. It was large to miss!

This would be 30 to 60 mph, and with no flapping movement - not a bird. If it was a plane high enough so as not to be heard then it was flying without lights and would have been MASSIVE in size.

At Ohio Wesleyan University the campus is split in half, almost, by part of Sandusky St. As I was waiting to cross the road, I looked up above Slocum Hall and saw a little red light. I got really excited at first, because I thought that I may be looking at a planet. Yet, all of the sudden it was gone. I thought that my eyes might be playing tricks on me since it was so early in the morning, so I rubbed and blinked my eyes and then tried to find it. But, it was gone. About 30 seconds later it showed up again in the same place I first saw it in. However this time it got really bright, faded until it was almost gone, and then got really bright again and disappeared again. Almost instantly, it appeared again but this time about 50 to 100 or 200 feet to the left, now over University Hall/Gray Chapel, and then it disappeared for good, almost as fast as it had reappeared. I was wondering if anyone had anything to say about this mysterious sighting. Note that there was no noise which accompanied this sighting.

I immediately assumed it may be another balloon.Upon further focus of my eyes against the clear blue sky absent of any clouds, I began to notice about 10-20 more white &quot;dots.&quot;  They did appear to be stars, so I stared at them to see if they were moving.  Some appeared to be close to one another, they were in no specific pattern just sort of scattered.  I believe I perceived some of them getting really close to each other and then moving back apart.  They all were relatively stationary, not moving in any one direction but sort of holding their position.I was at a dog park, my and some other dogs where barking at the hot air balloon, so I kept having to look away.  When I looked back up, each time, there were less and less until I could no longer see any of them.   As I left the park I could see no stars or white &quot;dots&quot; anywhere.30 mins later, in St. Peters I observed 2 what I assume were military jets judging from the contrails flying in a SE to W direction.", "Unidentified object sighted east side tucsonDriving west bound on Broadway blvd I stopped at the light on Camino Seco rd. While at the light, I noticed a flat mettalic object, somewhat oval, maybe teardrop in shape. It wasnt too reflective but definately stood out in the sky. Hard to tell distance from me ( rough estimate 2 miles away, 10-15 thousand feet elevation). No noise was heard but if it was an aircraft, it was close enough to hear something. It was traveling west-southwest very quickly. The object completely dissapeared from my view in about 15 seconds. The path it traveled was completely straight.

Followed tree top blinking lights for 5 to 10 minutes.Use the Google Map at this URL for reference... http://tinyurl.com/conwayarufo  You can use the Google Map &quot;Street View&quot; feature to see the terrain and understand my view that night. I was heading east bound on I-40 at about 9PM CST on a clear night with star filled sky.  East of Menifee and west of Conway, AR, (Point A on Google Map) I noticed blinking green and red lights 2 or 3 miles ahead and on the right, just above tree tops.  My first reaction was a new tower had been installed (on a clear night you can see blinking red lights for miles from radio and cellular towers), but within 30 seconds, it was apparent that it wasn&apos;t a tower because it was moving, slowly, but it was moving.  As I got closer, (Point B on Google Map) I slowed down to 20 or 30 mph and rolled my passenger window down.  There was no traffic behind me, but there were a few cars passing on the other side of the interstate going west bound.  As I slowed, the object passed just above tree top some 50 yards south of my position right out my passenger window, approximately between hwy 64 and I-40 just west of what is exit 124 now.  Exit 124 was not open at the time, still under construction.  As low, slow and close as the object was, I could not make out any shape at all.  The only visible parts were 3 lights, alternating between red-green-blue.  The object was moving west, north west at about 20 mph no more than 5 feet above the tree tops.  I could not hear any sound from the object at all. I accelerated, took exit 125 off of I-40, 1 mile down the interstate, onto hwy 64 heading west (point C and D on Google Map).  I again saw the object north west of my position about 2 miles away still traveling west by north west.  By the time I got back to my position parallel to I40 where I had slowed down (point E on map), a 2 mile round trip, the object had crossed over the interstate and was continuing it&apos;s path right at tree top, slightly faster now.  I would guess the object was traveling at 50mph now on a slightly more north bound path than before. As I traveled west on hwy 64 for another 3 or 4 miles.  The object was still in sight, but was steadily getting further away, mostly increasing distance west but also north.  I was traveling at 65 or 70 on hwy 64 West bound, so the object had to have increased it&apos;s speed to something above that. When I turned off of hwy 64 at Hogan Ln, (point F on map) the object was 3 or 4 miles north west of my position and was still visible, though the line of sight was intermittent.   The object at this point was roughly a mile north of the interstate and 3 or 4 miles west. Upon reflection, I have to rule out an ultralight craft for 3 reasons.  First, it was an absolutely pitch black night, with no moon at all.  Flying an ultralight at treetop height would have been suicide.  Second, as I passed within 50 yards of the object, with my window directly facing it open, it made no sound.  I&apos;ve been around ultralights enough to know what they sound like and at that distance, I would have clearly heard the motor.  Third, the variety of speed the object was flying at was outside the parameters of an ultralight.  The object was at times traveling at no more than 20mph and at other times well above 70.  When I see ultralights flying around C. Arkansas, they&apos;re typically flying at about 30-40 mph.", "Blue/Red/Green flashing object above Mobile, Al.I was outside last night watching the stars when I saw one that appeared to be flashing Blue/Green/Red lights. I thought it was a plane or chopper, yet, after quite some time, it never moved. I watched it for around 30 minutes.

The craft was seen on the east side of I-5 traveling North, at a slow rate of speed.  At first, we thought it was a 737, but upon watching it, we noticed right away, the object was black, had an unusual white light traveling from right across to left side and back across-left to tight all the way across, right to left, all the way across.  It was the size of a dime, at arms length, guessing about 3,000 ft altitude, having once been a pilot.  Within 3 minutes, it had crossed from being south of us, to traveling north of us.  At this point we pulled off the freeway into a field, got out to observe.  The triangle was traveling with a wide face forward, pointy part in back.  The most beautiful amber orange light, and red light were on the rear.  At this point, about 3-4 minutes into the sighting, the rear of the craft lifted noticeably, and suddenly vanished as though it changed dimensions.  We watched in all directions, thinking the UFO detected something, but nowhere did we see any other air craft.

The speed is the only thing that the object shared in common with a shooting star.What I saw was a dark object in the shape of a cigar but more like a long egg.  There was no light on the craft it was only noticeable due to the light in the atmosphere caused by the city lights.  It traveled silently in a straight line toward the north; this was noticeably in a direct northern path.When I caught sight it appeared to be between 300 and 500 feet in the air, it was only about 2 blocks to the west of my position. I was facing the west.There was no sound.

These formations only lasted seconds compaired to yesterdays 30 minutes. I have no explanation. It started with one ball of light, then another spaced close together followed by a third light. All lights were white. Then they again went out in the same order they appeared. Then they reappeared about 30 miles away in the same fashion but not a straight line. It was more angled. Then that group went out and it reappeared over the radio tower. First one light then a second to the left of it and then a third over the top of the first to shape a triangle. Then it all went out. It did not reapear. My husband and my 14 yr. old son were present.  I have contacted the local paper to see if anyone else has seen anything. I have gotten no response.

I arrived about 1:40 AM. I parked my car with the hood facing the pier with the tail end facing the Seabee military base directly behind me.  I left my engine, headlight sand music on as I was only planning to stay for a minute or two.  I put the car in park and stepped out of the vehicle.  I stood up on the ledge of the driver&rsquo;s side door to get a better view of the waves.  I noticed what appeared to be a set of stadium lights facing the perimeter of the base over a fountain of water.After a minute or so I noticed the lights shift their angle/position out of the corner of my eye.  Shocked, I began to stare and then witnessed the lights move.  The first object consisted of five white/yellow lights.  There was no visible craft, just the lights.  They moved together at times and separate at times. The lights were able to move over the water independently of each other and collectively as a group.  They moved up, down, right, left, forward, backward--any way you could imagine.  There was no sound and no disturbance of the sand or water.  The lights remained completely static and motionless at times just hovering over the area and then were able to move slowly or quickly at varying speeds. The lights were low to the ground maybe 25 to 40 feet off of the surface.I observed this for a minute or two and was so startled I jumped in the car and took out my cell phone to take pictures and record video evidence.  I took a picture and then decided it would be best to record a video because it could capture the fluidity and motion of the objects.  I turned off the car engine, lights and music.  I kneeled on the driver seat and recorded the movement for twenty minutes out of the sunroof resting my arm on the roof to keep my hand as steady as possible.During this time a second object appeared, which was lower than the first and considerably closer to the base.  It was also comprised of the same five lights.  It also displayed the same characteristics and motion. However, it moved much more than the first object.  Suddenly, the first object disappeared completely and the second began to move toward my car.  I dropped my phone and it slid shut erasing the video.  I became concerned for my safety and started my engine, called my mother and drove away as quickly as possible.No sooner than I started my car the first object reappeared and then both retreated farther away.  Once on the phone with my mother, however, I became more curious and turned my car around in the direction of the lights to get a better view.  Both objects moved much more quickly then they had before in the direction toward my car.  I was so scared I stopped the car immediately in the middle of the road and turned around as quickly as possible and left the beach.  I am left with only one crappy cell phone picture, but a picture nonetheless.I saw no craft. Just two objects made up of five lights each, which could move collectively or independently of each other.  The objects made no sound and were able to hover very low to the ground.  Neither seemed to disturb the water or sand on the beach in any way.  They illuminated the area.  At one point one or two of the lights seemed brighter than the others on the first object, almost as if a light, beam or object was emitted.  But I cannot be sure of this particular detail as it was quick and hard to clearly observe.  I am unsure of whether or not it may have landed.  It was very near to the water/sand, but I did not witness it do so personally.They appeared on the perimeter of the military base!  There had to have been military personnel on duty who also witnessed the lights whatever they had been.  There are airplanes on the base none of which fit such a description to the best of my knowledge.  I did at one point notice what appeared to be a regular airplane far off in the distance, but was unsure if it noticed the objects.  There were three other cars parked nearby.  I am unsure whether or not they were occupied.  There are also a great deal of apartments and condos on the beach, in which other people may have noticed the lights.I am a reliable, lucid, sober, sane witness.  I am a recent college grad about to begin graduate studies. I have never believed UFO stories.  I am open to a logical military explanation of what I saw, as it was outside the beach perimeter of the CBC base, but I have never witnessed or been aware of any man made object with such properties or capabilities personally.  I watched the objects for about a half an hour myself.  I am sure they may have been there before I arrived at the beach and remained after I left as well.

To my left, (east) moving slowly from left to right (north to south) a black triangular shaped object was flying over the Hy Vee Store.  There was a single row of 5-6 round green lights on two sides of the triangle, underneath the object, forming a V pattern.  The lights were not pulsating or rotating.  I could see the object&apos;s shape clearly, as the glow from the Hy Vee parking lot lights illuminated the object from below. It was a dull black against a clear black sky and the stars were visible.

Just about a minute before seeing this light I saw a small propeller plane flying very low passed the same area where I saw the light. At first I thought it was the plan crashing because the light looked like the tail lights/night lights of the plane but because there was no noise (where the plane just before this was very loud) and just a greenish white looking streak I ruled that out. It looked like a firework to me but since it was coming down at a extreme angle and I heard no noises, and it looked very close.. I ruled that out too by driving around the neighborhood looking for a possible crash site or perhaps people launching off fireworks in some kind of celebration. Nobody was out. I just got a weird feeling about this, it was so random.. Using google to try to find some similar reports lead me to this site, which was really surprising. Looking at this check list of characteristics below, I did too notice there were a few planes in the same area of the sky where this object was at.. Gives me goosebumps now I think about it.", "Around the evening of January 2nd, 2008 I was driving home from my girlfriend&apos;s house in the countryside surrounding Shippensburg Pennsylvania.  I noticed an aircraft in the  distance around 10-20 miles away.  At first it did not seem out of the ordinary but I noticed that the craft began to move in ways that no human aircraft that I know of could move. It would hover over an area but then it would move instantly in another direction. It seemed that it could move in any direction and  be able to stop instantly. I am not an aviation expert but I do not believe that any human aircrafts could have been able to move like this one did. I was alone on a country road and I pulled my car over and stared at the object for several minutes. It moved throughout the valley in the way I described before it suddenly zipped far away out of site. At the time I did not know how to react to what I saw, but around 6 months later I was talking to  friend when he told me that he had seen an object while driving on the Pennsylvania turnpike that same night. By the way he described the object I could tell he saw the same object. Also he told me that the traffic on the turnpike nearly came to a complete stop as all of the drivers were looking at the object. I would not be surprised if other people reported seeing this object as well.  I do know that Letterkenny army base, which has been used as a testing zone for covert military activities was within 20 miles of where I was when I saw the object. The object appeared to be triangular in shape, but I did not get a very good look at the object since it was off in the distance. What stood out for me was the irregular way in which the object moved, I have never in my life seen an aircraft move in that way. I consider myself a rational person and I don&apos;t consider myself a believer of alien visitors or abductions. I do know however that on that evening I saw something that I cannot explain, I hope that this report can help us piece together the puzzle and someday be able ! to figur e out exactly what the UFO phenomenon is.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were talking about for a few minutes, trying to debunk what I had seen.Then we heard screaming.....it was very chilling.  We cracked our bedroom window and heard it over and over. it sounded artificial, not like a human, so we started guessing it was an owl perhaps?  i don&apos;t know what they sound like, but i have heard there are some that make wild ass noises.Then about 2 minutes later, we heard a swarm of sirens go past our neighborhood and off to the east, where the light had gone.I wish I was more prepared and had more than just a story to share.So question, where can I find out if there is to be a meteor shower?  Is there some website that records this information?   2ndly, is there any type of owl that makes a screaming noise like a human?

I&apos;m not quite sure if I have to tell my personal experience in this forum...considering the majority of skeptics on UFOs. But I feel that there is a need to discuss this subject, because knowledge of what really happens in our universe could be essential in determining where we should be heading. First of all, I would like to introduce myself. I am a lawyer in the Philippines. I currently holds a public office as the City Legal Officer of ______________, you can check this out in our website. I am the head of the City&apos;s Legal Department and had been a practicing lawyer for more than 11 years now. I had been a lawyer for many nongovernmental organizations. I am an experienced trial lawyer. As such, I know what &quot;facts&quot; means and what &quot;evidence&quot; can play as a way to convince people of the existence of a fact.When I was 16 years old (around March of 1987), about to graduate from high school, i was walking my dog around 8:00 PM. It was a bright night because it was almost full moon, with clear skies with some relatively fast moving cumulo-cirrus clouds (it was a bit windy). Our house was just 15 meters away from the seashore in ___________. I was used to stargazing, so I was looking intently at the stars as i walk my dog. I noticed some movement near the moon, i thought it was the cloud, but when i looked more intently, i noticed that it wasnt the cloud but a &quot;star&quot; moving very slowly. I first thought that it must be a night plane, but then the light wasnt blinking like most planes, so it suddenly occurred to me, &quot;could this be something else&quot;?  Immediately upon blurting that out in my mind, the moving light suddenly moved so fast in at least three circular paths, counter-clockwise.  Since I studied in a special science and math class since my elementary, I knew what the speed of light is, and i knew that that object was travelling at close to the speed of light (around 186,000 miles per sec).  I was shocked, because even at my age then, i knew there&apos;s no human aircraft that can travel at close to the speed of light. And after going in circles, it streaked the entire length of the sky in a semi-circle path.Two years after, I was again in the same place (we havent left yet our residence near the seashore). I was simply strolling and letting time pass by. It was past 8:00 PM, again, with the moon (more than half moon). The sky was again clear, with visible stars and clouds. As i continue to watch out for falling stars, as it has been my habit, I saw some movement of one &quot;star&quot; in the location of my first sighting two years before. I got so excited that it suddenly occurred to me this wasnt coincidence. This time, upon my noticing of its movement, the bright object with yellow star-like light moved in circular paths, this time clockwise, with the same speed as before, and crossed the sky with blinding speed.Four years later, i was already in my second year of law school in ___________, I returned home for a semestral vacation. We left already our old house near the sea and transferred to another rented house about a hundred meters away from our first hourse. Around 9 PM, i decided to walk at the boulevard near the shore. I feel some kind of anticipation that my experiences before would be repeated, and i was constantly excited of the thought that, &quot;is it an alien spacecraft&quot;? So every semestral break, I would go to the same spot hoping for another sighting. For a time, I got frustrated. But on that particular sem break of 1993 (around late October), it happened again. I saw that bright object moving, no longer in the same spot but still near, and as in noticed it, it again sped off in circles counterclockwise like the first time, with the same blinding speed. I thought, my God, can it read my mind, because everytime i see it and think if its a UFO, it kind of &quot;reacts&quot; to my thought and moves suddenly as if it was jolted by my thought. I told these experiences to my family, but they just looked at me, perplexed. But since they knew me to be very objective and reasonable since i was a kid, they never actually disbelieved me. The same was true with my my friends. I was a student leader at that time (president of various school organizations and had been the editor-in-chief of our college paper), so they saw no reason for me to tell something untrue. Since then, I would wait on the same spot whenever i had the opportunity, but i was never that lucky again. Until now, whenever i would visit my parents in _______________, I always try if i could still see it. i just keep telling my kid and my wife that someday, people, especially our political leaders, might be reasonable enough to take a serious look at these events as part of the circumstantial evidence of the existence of perhaps another life-form that has a much more advanced civilization. i dont know the answers, but Im testifying based on facts and my perso! nal know ledge of certain events where one can draw up some preliminary assumptions.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

He had seen it twice before during the summer so he quickly called the rest of us out to witness it.  We all quickly determined it wasn&apos;t an airplane because there were other planes in the sky at that time and this had no flashing warning lights and no sound like the rest of them as it came above us.  It was just an orange/red super bright object almost like a fireball but with no noticeable flames.  It was flying higher than the other airplanes but it was larger and brighter than them in the sky.  It traveled across the sky above us and when it reached the refineries about 2 miles away it stopped and it shot down a fireball that left a streaking orange trail like a flame but there was no smoke, just the same orange/red glow like a piece of the larger object just came off.  The smaller fireball shot directly down a couple of seconds and disappeared.  The big object then flashed a few times before it also disappeared.  Some clapped while others freaked out and asked,  what was that?  My brother who was not at this family gathering had told us about this strange light he has seen often in the sky.  He has seen it numerous times since 2005 and it&apos;s always traveling across Carson and always disappearing above the refineries.  He has also seen it shoot white lights and spin then disappear.

Inside one of the windows there appeared to be some kind of console. It appeared to be square and tall and the closest thing I can relate to it would be something the size of a file cabinet type shape. There were no beings seen inside these windows that we could see and the craft simply hovered above us silently for about another 20 seconds. All of a sudden this craft lifted and continued on what appeared to be the same course it was traveling before descending.

I noticed the lights because I frequent the area and had never before seen lights in the area.  The lights first appeared in front of the car, off in the not-so-distant sky.  They were evenly spaced, one on top of the other. At first glance the two lights looked as if they were on a tower of some type, but there was no tower in the area. I decided to try and get a closer look, so I started heading south on Gill Hall Rd.  As I crossed the Allegheny/Washington County line, we were on top of a high hill.  The two lights were still in the same spot.  I began to notice a slight orange color in the light on the bottom, which was slightly larger than the top light.  The lights appeared to be only a few hundred feet off the ground, just high enough in the sky to be clearly visible from many locations.  I was set on getting a closer look so I kept driving toward the lights.  Before I knew it we were on Rt. 19 in Washington, with the two lights still off in the distance.  Just in front of us a large meteor-like object passed in front of us, giving off a bright green light.  The lights and the shooting star do not appear to be related, because the lights were still there after the shooting star passed.  By this time it had long been ruled out that the lights were stars, since they were much too bright.

The objects were approximately the same diameter as an iridium flare would appear (we have seen and can easily identify iridium flares).  As we watched the objects sputtered and faded out.  We are 99% sure what we observed were flares.  They appeared very similar to the &quot;Arizona Lights&quot; that caused such a stir a few years ago and were subsequently identified as flares dropped from A-10&rsquo;s during a military exercise.

I enjoy looking up to the night sky especially on clear nights when clouds are at a minimum or none are present (the latter applies to this event) and visibility is excellent. On this night I was smoking my cigarette when I noticed a commercial and most likely civilian aircraft making its aerial maneuvers for approach for a landing at Miami Int&rsquo;l Airport. This is typical at the area where I live since aircraft traffic is directed through this area for landing approach. I did not think too much of it given the fact that I see aircrafts performing routine maneuvers on a daily basis. On this night, however, I noticed two objects flying through the night sky (no particular shape) in a constant formation on the background (relative to the aircraft making its northward turn) of the commercial aircraft.These objects were being displaced at a relatively high velocity (or speed, since their general direction and displacement seemed constant). At first I thought that I was seeing &ldquo;things&rdquo; and removed my eyeglasses and cleared my eyes. I went ahead and put my glasses on and saw the objects again. The commercial aircraft had a northward direction to while the objects had a general northwest heading. Military aircraft came to my mind in trying to identify the objects but no audible noises were emanating form the objects and no beacon/strobe lights were visible. Unless there are stop secret military stealth aircraft out there flying hypersonic with silent engines (especially at the altitudes these objects were flying) that the civilian population does not know about, I think this classifies as a UFO event. Furthermore, as they traveled in their direction (by the way, one object was leading the other by approximately a couple of thousand feet,  at approximately a 30&deg; elevation, measured relative to the trailing object) their emitted visible lighting was fading.I am very skeptical about UFO sightings and associated reports on the tabloids. The main reason is probably because I am an engineer and to me almost everything in life has an explanation through engineering and science. This is the first time in my life that I have encountered a physical event that I do not know what to make of it. By the way, I am certain that these objects were not satellites. I am becoming more convinced that we (habitants of planet earth) are not alone in the universe.", "Very slow moving object that made no sound.I was nearly home, approximately 3.5 miles south of Laurelville on St. Rte. 56. I noticed odd flashing lights moving very slowly north. I was able to pull over and get out and for roughly 5 mins. I observed absolutely no sound what so ever coming from the object. I was close enough to tell that it was not a balloon or anything like that. It was moving at about 20-30 mph. and about 500-600 ft. in the air. The lights were white and a reddish color that flashed intermittently almost in the shape of a delta or triangle.

CST I went out my kitchen door to take the trash out.  The door faces east.The moon is just about full this evening.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a strange &quot;cloud&quot; to my right. It was strange enough that I turned to look at it.It was moving from the south to the north very fast.  It was about 70 degrees off the horizon and dark grey.  The shape is what first caught my attention.  Imagine an iPhone lying flat but there was a large &quot;dome shape&quot; under it and in the middle of the rectangle.  The &quot;dome&quot; seemed to have several lobes on it so it was not perfectly smooth.   In fact the whole object was about the size of an iPhone held at arm&rsquo;s length. There was only one object.It did not make any sound.  In fact I would say the silence was &quot;deafening&quot; in the same way it is quiet after a large snowfall.The moon is quite bright tonight and the edges of the object seemed to glow from the moonlight rather than an internal source.  The object obstructed the view of stars as it flew by.I walked down the side path to the front of my house to keep the object in view.  It continued straight north.  The speed and altitude did not alter. I continued to watch it until it disappeared from view.The sky is clear tonight except for a few wispy, white clouds that are shaped more like long pencils.  I watched the object fly under the clouds and noted that the object was not only moving in the opposite direction of the clouds, but it was going much faster than the clouds.  It moved fast enough that I knew I did not have time to get my camera.  Plus the object was dark enough the I was not sure it would photograph.My dog was outside with me and he started barking when the object was in front of me.I watched the object for approximately one minute before I could no longer see it.

At the time, I did not know there was any place to report it so I just kept my notes.  At 6:05 PM on Nov 23rd 1998, I saw an object moving very quickly in the Eastern sky at about a 45 degree angle from Coon Rapids, Minnesota.  The object was a flatter oval shape from my perspective as far as I could tell, but it was quite far away.  The object had a light trail as you might expect from a falling star, but it was not moving as fast as a falling star and the light trail remained constant in brightness.  Falling stars, by contrast typically start out small as they enter the atmosphere, grow larger and then burn out.  Furthermore, you wouldn&rsquo;t see any object in front of the light trail with a falling star, you would just see the glow.  The object I saw had a definite solid part followed by a stream of light equal to about three times the length of the object.   I watched it for a good 3 to 4 seconds before it went out of site below the horizon.  Given the distance it appeared to travel, the speed exceeded what even a fast military plane could go.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was too low to be a satellite (about 249 miles too low!) and had no strobe or wing lights.  It made no sound as it passed overhead.  About 10 seconds after I sighted the object it got a bit dimmer.  I figured that it had passed behind some of the haze. This meant the object was probably around 5,000 to 10,000 feet.

At first I thought it may have been a plane flying in my direction at an extremely low altitude. Then the object began to descend straight down, a small but noticeable distance, and continue to hover over the residential area of Reseda. I turned to by boyfriend in the passenger seat and told him I knew what I was looking at.At this time a freeway sound wall blocked our view while I was driving in the inside lane. I quickly shifted to the fast lane and waited for the object to come back into view. The object had to be relatively low in the sky if the sound wall and tree tops could easily block our view. When the object was visible again, all the bright lights had been shut off and now the craft&rsquo;s anti-collision/beacon lights were blinking, and I could clearly see the outline of the unit under the full moon. Disk shaped, with a protruding top and bottom, with the blinking lights arranged around the widest part of the craft. It looked as though it was made of dark grey metal since it was reflective in the moonlight.We had driven around the craft, proving that it was stationary, and decided to circle back to get another look. In the 2 minutes that I was able to circle around back to the craft&rsquo;s original location, it had moved higher up in the sky and less than a half mile west. We followed the craft by street and observed it, now stationary again, for 15 to 20 minutes. Every now and then we would see the lights on the craft dim and brighten, then descend straight down and hover. On the crafts &rdquo;low-light&rdquo; setting; I could see multiple colored lights blinking at different times. When it began to move further west, we followed again until it was just a small speck in the sky. We decided to finish our errand in Reseda and head home.We were now driving on the 101 southbound through Studio City, California at about 9pm when I looked up and saw another similar-looking craft with bright lights hovering over the freeway a little higher than the treetops. As soon as I pointed in its direction, the craft took off heading north over my vehicle. Again, we turned around to head north and follow but the craft had traveled a considerable distance and we decided it was too far.I believe that I may have witnessed two separate spacecrafts. It is also possible that it was the exact same craft that I saw in two different locations when considering its speed capabilities and the time in between spotting the craft(s).", "Glowing panels flying over desert between Needles and BarstowI was driving west on I40 somewhere between Needles and Barstow CA around 1AM or later.Something passed over my head with some weird lights on it and I can say what the shape really was, but the back end of the craft was very large and had 4 to 6 very large rectangle panels that were glowing blueish white. Kind of looked like a giant window pain flying across the sky. Very &quot;Star Wars&quot; animation like with glowing engines instead of flames.The panels were vertical to the road, or 90 degrees to the earth, and looked as if I was looking at the propulsion system of something.

The objects then stopped in mid &apos;flight&apos; (flight was somewhat erratic- they would come close to each other, and then separate, but would always stay within a finger-width (from my perspective) apart), and then reversed direction and headed South.  I lost sight of them when they moved past my effective field of vision- they moved very quickly- the whole sighting lasted about 30 seconds from when I first spotted them above my house.  I thought at first they were high flying birds, but the strange flight characteristics (sudden direction changes, and what appeared to be terriffic speed (if they were as high as they appeared to be)) convinced me otherwise- I&apos;m a college educated person who is extremely skeptical- I would not be writing this if I didn&apos;t truly believe that what I witnessed was something very odd indeed.", "IT MOVED SLOWLY ALMOST IN A SMALL CIRCLE TO GET IN THE RIGHT SPOT, AND DROPED SOMETHING OUT TOWARDS THE GROUND.LAST NIGHT MY NEIGHBOR CALLED ME TO COME OUT AND SEE THIS THING IN THE SKY.

I have seen shooting stars before and this was larger and much brighter and closer to earth than a star.  The object was a bright blue color that left a trail.

It is a very twisty winding road for just a few miles to the lake.  About a mile before we got to the lake, my son, sitting in the front passenger seat, said &ldquo;dad, is that a full moon out?&rdquo;  I leaned over to look and saw a brilliant white light about a quarter mile away across a canyon and behind the trees on the ridge.  I thought it must be a full moon and told my son &ldquo;looks like it&rdquo; and kept driving not thinking anything else about it.  Around a minute later, we turned to go across the small dam at the lake, drove maybe 100 yards and almost hit my friend Frank who was walking fast towards us in the middle of the road.  I stopped fast, and could tell something was wrong.  Franks eyes were wide open, and he was yelling something before I could even roll my window down to ask him what he was doing in the middle of the road.  The first thing I heard him yelling was &ldquo;Did you see it?  Did you see it?  Did you see the F***ing light?&rdquo;  I had known Frank about 7 years at that time, and had never seen him act anything like this before.  I shut off my engine, and turned off the lights on my jeep, got out and said &ldquo;What light?  I saw the full moon.....&rdquo;  I looked up to see the full moon, but it was a moonless night.Just then, Frank said &ldquo;LOOK&hellip;&hellip;.there it is&rdquo;.  That&rsquo;s when we all 3 saw it going away from us, going slightly right to left through Long Valley, just North of the lake we were standing at.  It was silent, and very bright white.  It moved slowly, perhaps 10 MPH about 100 feet above the ground lighting up the surrounding hills as it moved along.  From there it just moved towards the West and within a few minutes was gone.Catfishing was good that night after all.Frank told us that it was a ring of lights, some different colored ones, and mostly white lights all around the circle, and came across the lake towards him with the circle or ring standing vertically, and made absolutely no sound.

The sky was bright to the south due to the setting sun, with some high altitude clouds in the background. Visibility was very good. There was a slight breeze from the north, which was slightly bowing tall palm trees in the area. I became aware of a stationary black dot just above the skyline directly to the south of my location. I first took it to be a tethered advertising balloon, but soon realized it was too high in the sky, and would interfere with aircraft. After several minutes I went into the house and got a pair of binoculars to get a better look at the object. With the binoculars I could see the dot was actually oval shaped. There were five or six smaller circular objects spread out below the oval in a semi-circle. These objects were not visible to the naked eye. I watched for several minutes, periodically fiddling with the adjustments on the binoculars to get a better view. The large object seemed to remain stationary, while the smaller objects slowly moved about beneath, seemingly grouping up with each other in various configurations. All the objects were opaque black, backlight by the bright light of the setting sun. The oval looked like it might have had a reddish spot near the top, but it could have been due to the lighting. I watched for about five minutes until I received a phone call. I tried to locate the objects when I finished the call several minutes later, but they were gone. I cannot estimate how far away the objects were but feel they were fairly distant. There were general aviation and commercial aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. I rule out balloons due to their not reacting to the wind and the regular spacing that the objects maintained in relation to each other. Balloon I have seen released into the sky quickly dissipate and follow random paths following the direction of the wind.I am no computer whiz, but I have made two drawings which I will attempt to attach which illustrate my observations.", "Observed triangular object moving over house.I am submitting this now because I just came across this site.  The date is approximate as I remember the time of year because I had just finished building a deck on the rear of my home and that was in mid-September of 2004.  I am a high school debate teacher and had only started school a few weeks earlier, so that also reminds me of the approximate date.  But I cannot recall the exact date at this time.I woke up around 1:00 in the morning for no particular reason and could not fall back asleep.  After sitting in the living room for a bit, I decided to go out on my  deck to have a cigarette.It was a completely clear night.  I do not recall if there was a moon or not.  As I was smoking, I spent time just staring up at the stars.  I am not much for astronomy, but there was nothing else to really do and I was trying to get myself back into a mode for sleep.I first noticed something in the sky to the west of my home.  I was sitting in the back of the house which faces northeast.  I had been sitting outside for about 20 minutes at this point.  I did not identify what I saw as an &quot;object&quot; at first.  There was a triangular shape, but my first thought was that it was a flock of Canadian geese.  I continued to watch only because it was something to look at.  The shape continued to come slowly from the west heading roughly southwest at what seemed to be a rather slow pace.After what felt like less than 5 minutes of watching, the shape was pretty much directly over the back yard of my neighbor to the immediate west.  This is where I had my first impression that what I was looking at wasn&apos;t a flock of geese.First, as it was coming toward my yard, it seemed far too rigid lines to be geese.  The shape seemed fairly low to the ground too.  I estimate it was no higher than 1000 ft, but likely less.  As the shape moved over into my yard, I noticed that the stars didn&apos;t seem &quot;right&quot; between the two lines of the &quot;V&quot; shape.  By that I mean they seemed a bit fuzzier and dimmed.What really convinced me that I was not seeing geese was when I noticed a straight line connecting the two ends at the rear of the &quot;V&quot; shape, making it a triangle.  As I tried to &quot;come to grips&quot; with what my brain was saying I was seeing, I also noticed a strange distortion along the outer edges of the triangular object.  I would best describe it as being like the heat waves one sees coming off of hot pavement.  This distortion was visible on all three sides, but I am not sure I would have noticed it if the sky hadn&apos;t been so clear otherwise.There were no noticable lights coming from the object and absolutely no sound.  Any other time I have seen geese flying in a &quot;V&quot; formation, I recall usually eventually hearing a goose call or two as they fly overhead.  Here, it was total silence.The object continued to move in a straight line to to the southwest.  As the object moved past my yard I could no longer see the outer edge distortion, however there were still three distinct sides to the object.  After about a total of 10 minutes or so of viewing the object was out of sight again.(NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I know the dates are important to you but this is the closest I can come.I was living with my grandparents in Concord so that is where this story ends. It begins however on Rt 3 (the highway) in Billerica.  I was coming from Lowell and approaching the River Road exit.  I think that is what it is called, the jail is/was there.  Not sure if it still is.  It was 7 to 8 PM I would say and the traffic was not heavy, thank goodness because I would have caused an accident.To my right, hovering above the trees was an object, cigar shaped. It had 3 lights as I can remember, one blue, one red and I believe one white.  The light part is the vaguest of my memory, but there were lights on the bottom area. The object was dark, but there was enough light out to see the shape.  I watched it as I was approaching it and it did not appear to be moving so the closer I got the slower I went.  I almost stopped beside the spot but just drove slow.  I was very excited to see this.My father and I had a few discussions about UFO&rsquo;s and he said if I ever saw one that I should mentally talk to them because they would be advanced and could be telepathic.So that is why I was excited!!!  I was 21 and eager to explore.  I asked them to pick me up and take me with them, mentally.  I kept watching to see if it would move as I passed it and as I took the exit I turned to watch but saw nothing.  I drove over the highway and took a right onto the River Road going towards Billerica and to my surprise on my right hovering over a house set way back off the road (now a church) was this object or craft.No traffic, so I pulled over fast.  As I opened my car door a spot light went on from this plane/craft hovering the house, it shown a path for me.  I started walking around the car towards it and saw another car coming down the road so I rushed back into my car and just sat there. The spot light from the plane/craft also went off.This happened 3 times, each time a car coming to interrupt me going towards the spotlight.  It was dark but I could see the space over the house between this plane/crat thing.  I sat in my car, not afraid at all and then the plane/craft just swioohed up and over me as though it were tired of waiting.  It was silent!!! Complete silence, jaw breaking silence. I opened my window and watched.  I heard nothing.  I also think I yelled &quot;wait&quot;!!!  I was so excited I could hardly breath.  I took off in my car towards Billerica Center, took Rt. 3a South towards my parents house.  Driving down that road I look up to my right and there it was again following my path, or just ahead of me, so I went fast trying to chase it.  It disappeared though.  I began thinking maybe it was following the river for some reason.  This all started near the river. I don&rsquo;t know why the water idea came to me but somehow I felt they liked water.I felt angry afterwards that I was so slow getting out and back in my car and caring if any other cars saw me, because they finally flew off.  I think though that I did not want to share my experience and I think I felt that other people being there would interrupt them taking me.  That is why I kept getting back into my car and pretending nothing was going on.  But the plane/craft did the same thing with the spotlight.After visiting with my parents and telling them the story I had wanted to drive around with my father.  I believe we did drive around, but also went to visit my brother on the other side of the town.  I was so distracted though, just looking up unable to pay attention to anything else.  We had a nice visit, which is important in my story.Later about 11 PM I arrived at my grandparents house in Concord, went upstairs and got into bed.  As I lay there I heard a plane.  Not uncommon for that area either because the Bedford Air Force base is close and they fly by. Not over, but close by.  But this plane I heard stopped right over the house and hovered, the house shook. The motor was very loud this time, it was not like a plane flying by, it stayed there.I knew it was them.  I spoke to it mentally and told it I had changed my mind.  I felt that if I went with them I would be lonely for my family which I had not considered earlier being young and impulsive.  I was also a little scared by then since it seemed to have FOUND me. Then it flew off.This was one of the first of many unusual   experiences I have had in my life.  I have had other encounters.  Thanks for listening, I have wanted to write this at your site for a few years now.  Every world of this is true, except perhaps the dates.", "A bright red ( round dot circle bubble luminous) UFO sphere splits into two, then travels in opposite directions after splittingA friend and I were watching stars and night sky after an exciting night of fire works. It was the day before my 16th birthday, and my friend was about the same age.  I&apos;m male, my friend was female. I lost contact with her not too long after the encounter.  I am educated and a Science teacher now. As for the what we saw that night. My friend and I were talking about teenage things when we both saw one bright red round dot - circle - bubble (words to describe it) which seemed very far above us.  It was not moving at all.  We discussed, was it a planet reflecting red? A laser pointer? Was it a satellite, because it did appear to be far away? A plane?  Lastly,a UFO?  Anyway, since it wasn&apos;t doing anything while we were talking about it, we continued socializing about other topics.  We would look back at the red luminous sphere every so often, but it wasn&apos;t moving.  After about 20-30 minutes, we started looking around the night sky again, and again the attention on the red brightness brought us back discussing the object.  At some point, with our attention on it, the red dot split into two identical red round objects; like cell division division had taken place, the two bright red objects started traveling in opposite directions at a steady, medium speed.  Freaked out, my friend and I became scared, and tears welted in my eyes, because I didn&apos;t understand what I was seeing.  We both watched with tense anticipation watch the red spheres travel apart.  Within 2 minutes of the splitting, the separated red Unidentified Flying Objects disappeared.  I don&apos;t know what we saw that night, but it was something I cannot explain. From time to time I think back to what I saw and it still makes my eyes welt with uneasiness.", "Military planes chaseing UFOI was outside of my house smoking a ciggaret.  There were no clouds in the sky and I was looking at all of the stars. Then something caught my eye.  It was a triangle shaped object with 3 orange bright lights on each point.

Then all of a sudden a milatary style formation of planes were heading in the direction it went.  There was at least 6 planes in formation, and it was very loud after they flew by.

When it was 9:17 P.M., I first noticed 3 orbs, but then they multiplied to 6 reddish-orange orbs. The three that came out of the first three were blinking, unlike the original orbs. They seemed to be making strange shapes or symbols in the sky. We quickly pulled into the Publix parking lot, which was practically vacant. My father, my brother, and I walked out of the car while my mother stayed in the car.There was another man there too. He was going down the same road and noticed the same lights. A bag boy from Publix seemed to notice them, too. They were completely silent and left no steam or smoke. My brother tried to take a picture of them, but they were probably too small to show up on camera. The man who was there watching with us was trying to take pictures of the strange crafts with his phone. They did not show up once he captured the image.My brother, one of the witnesses, and I heard ringing in our ears.  It was strong in our left ears, but faint in our right.  After the event, I decided to do some research on UFOs, and realized, this sighting is very similar to a series of lights sighted by thousands over Arizona.  I would estimate the orbs to be about 15-30 feet in diameter.While I was staring at the orbs, I felt a knot in my stomach.  They were slow moving, yet got to each other very quickly.  They moved faster than our car which was traveling about 35 mph while heading down the road.  It was easy to tell they were not part of one orbs.

I then thought it was the reflection of the sun setting behind me, although I could not account for a reflection from the sun, as the sun was falling behind the mountains at this time.  Its downward trajectory then sped up and I thought it was a plane going down.  It stopped floating hung for a few seconds and then disappeared.

They were stationary and we did not hear any sound coming from the lights.We went inside and tried to find some information on the internet about the evening sky, but didn&rsquo;t find anything.So, my son and I went back outside to view the lights.  This time we went out the front door and observed the lights from our front porch.  The lights were no longer behind the tree branches.  This time, the lights were to the right of the tree at the same altitude and intensity.We went back inside.About ten minutes later my daughter and husband came home from the store.  I asked them if they saw the bright lights outside.  My daughter said she saw the lights as they were walking to the car to go to the store.  She said she tried to tell my husband, but he was talking on the cell phone.  I asked her if the lights were still there, and she said she still saw them as they walked back into the house.I went back onto the front porch to take another look at the lights.  Both lights were gone!  I called my husband, son, and daughter to see that the lights were gone.  We were baffled.  We went back inside and shared our observations with my husband.I went back outside the front door, but this time I walked about 20 feet out onto the front lawn.  Further away and about 10-20 degrees from the horizon, I saw what I think may be the same two lights.  They were located south-south-west of me.  Their lights were smaller and dimmer.  The bottom light seemed to be rotating as different colored lights were being emitted.  (yellow, orange, green?) I went back inside and called my son and daughter.  They also believe that the two distant lights were the same lights that were previously much closer to our house.  We watched the two lights as they very, very, slowly descended into the horizon.  The lights did not get smaller as they descended.  They seemed to make a vertical descent.  It took about 15 minutes for both the lights to descend out of view.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.

As I was driving home this past Thursday evening (November 20, 2008) after work, and at around 10:15 pm I spotted an object that I cannot identify, so I am filing this report. I believe it was probably a meteorite or meteor, but as you will see below it does not fully fit into this category.I work in Ft. Myers, Florida, and live in Cape Coral, about a 10 mile drive from work to home. I take a back route most of the way,, which is dark, with very few  street lights. All of a sudden I noticed a bright light going up from my right to high overhead, in front of me. My first thought was that someone was setting off fireworks, and this is indeed what it looked like at first. When fireworks are first ignited and shot off, they can ascend with a bright light and with a little wobbly motion. Then they burst when they reach a certain peak. Well this light started out like that, a bright light ascending, with the little wobbly motion like fireworks. However, when it reached a peak, instead of bursting into a fireworks display, it shot straight across the sky at very high speed flaming or flaring up as it went, as a meteorite would burning up in the atmosphere. Then it went out and disappeared.So it appeared to be going up at first, then across the sky accelerating to a very high speed. I am not a pilot or very familiar with height or speed, but even when it appeared to level out and shoot across the sky, it really didn&rsquo;t seem to be very high up in the atmosphere at all. This is one of the inconsistencies with the meteor theory. The other inconsistency, of course, is that it appeared to be going up at first, maybe from the ground.In short, I don&rsquo;t know what this was, but I was looking in the paper and listening to the radio for reports or a meteor or an unidentified flying object in my area for that night. I haven&rsquo;t heard anything, but I am sure of what I saw. The sky was clear, and anyway it was low enough to be under any clouds that did exist. If anyone else saw anything in this area on that night, I would like to hear about it.

The contrail seemed much wider and denser than a normal contrail, and had no gap in the center as is typical of normal airliner trails.  It was moving at about the normal speed of a high-altitude jet or perhaps somewhat faster, and seemed to be at the height of a normal jet at cruising altitude, but possibly higher - very hard to tell with no reference points.  At the head of the trail was a small but very obvious fiery reddish ball.  It may have been the reflection of the late-afternoon sun on a plane, but I&apos;ve seen many, many airliners under these conditions and this looked different.  It twinkled and at no time did it appear to change intensity.  Usually a strong sun glint on an airliner will vary as the reflection angle changed, but this didn&apos;t.  It looked exactly like a giant reddish road flare making a dense smoke trail heading more or less toward northern New Jersey.  I say giant because of the size of the trail.  It is impossible to estimate the size of the object but it appeared comparable to the size of Venus or Saturn when they&apos;re at their largest and most visible.  A twinkling, starlike reddish road flare with an immense and persistent white smoke trail.  It was unusual enough that we stopped to watch it until it disappeared behind buildings. It didn&apos;t change speed, heading, altitude or intensity, and the motion was very steady.  The smoke trail remained for at least several minutes.  My thought at the time was that it was a reentry of some satellite, or an unusual meteor.

This was not a satellite, a helicopter, an airplane, a meteorite or northern lights.  I have seen many of those and the behavior of that light was nothing like it.  This was not Venus or Jupiter.

Around 9:14 P.M, my brother pointed out three redish-orange, spherical objects in the sky, which we soon discovered three more to reach a total of six. We pulled out our digital camera, but the objects were too small to be considerably noticeable.  Frantically, we pulled into the parking lot of Publix, just down that road, where we stopped and witnessed the six objects.  We sat there, befuddled, trying to determine what it was.  I remember rolling down my window, trying to determine if they were radio antennae.They appeared to be slow-moving, however, it moved faster than our car, which was traveling at about 35 miles per hour.  In the parking lot, another man pulled off of the same road to witness these objects.They stopped in the sky and appeared to align themselves in regular patterns.  The formation was as followed:  Four lights formed a square while the other two slanted in a line below the square.  They seemed to be midway in the sky, not near the horizon, but where you would expect to see radio towers.  They appeared to be the size of a planet in the night sky, but smaller than the moon.  From where we were standing, they looked to be about 10-30 feet in diameter.We stood in the parking lot watching them line up and move along for about 2-3 minutes.  During this time, an airplane flew below it, however, records at the Hollywood International Airport state that everything was as it should&rsquo;ve been, and no special aircraft were in the air at that area or that time. The quantity and formation of the lights changed, however, the color did not.  They seemed to be heading west, towards the Florida Everglades.

We were visiting friends after attending a midnight Christmas service at a local Church. At approximately 12:30 am we entered the A47 perimeter road into Earl Shilton, which is under construction.Just before entering the road entitled &ldquo;Carr&rsquo;s Hill&rdquo;, I observed a large reddish light towards the northeast. The light was stationary or moving very slowly. I did not mention it to my wife at the time as she was driving. Suddenly the light became slightly brighter and from beneath the light appeared a smaller light, which immediately descended to the ground and disappeared The smaller light seemed to be controlled as it descended very slowly.I mentioned it to my wife and she confirmed she had also observed it. We drove to the other side of Shilton, which opens up to the soar valley and we would be able to see the night view of the countryside stretching to the light haze of Leicester, however both light sources were not to be seen.Due to observing only a light source in the middle of the night, I am unable to give a true perspective of size, the light source did disappear behind the hill of Earl Shilton village and therefore the light source would have been of considerable size.   Using this perspective I would estimate that the light descended toward the area of small village called Thurlaston.  My wife and I can only rule out a Meteor, as the light was all but stationary, with complete cloud cover.

The lights traveled in a straight line toward the south (there was a bit of very slight variation in the formation - they were not following the leader with exact precision - the spacing between them varied slightly and there was also some very slight variation side-to-side as they moved south.

It passed between Anguilla and St. Martin for a duration of 90 seconds, V shaped with extremely bright orange on the bottom, bright red in center and startling white at the top.It appeared to actually waver back and forth due to air resistance as it passed between the two islands, it was not moving at all like meteorites which we have witnessed many times in the past.  It may have had a flat surface which would cause this wavering.  We watched it pass just fifteen degrees to our North and headed out to open ocean to our South West.  It was obviously burning up and started to get smaller and smaller until it burned out before crossing the horizon.The conditions were perfect, cloudless, the moon had already passed over the horizon, very little light polution, we have a video phone, video of it and are trying to enhance it because of the low quality.", "Small saucer camouflages itself at dusk and speeds off&quot;All I can tell (from what I managed to see) is that it was a small saucer coming out from behind a tree.  The saucer sort of turned itself invisible in the blink of an eye, and blurred my eyesight for about 10 full minutes.  From what I could tell, the saucer details were very complicated.  It looked a lot like a stretched out black and white picture of saturn under a shadow.&quot;  The above description is what my daughter said she saw.  It happened while she was walking her dog in the greenbelt near our house.  On her way back home at dusk, she saw this UFO and she also said that after it became shadowy black to blend in more with the sky, it shot off at a very fast speed away from her, which would have been in a southerly direction.  She said that her cell phone stopped working for a few seconds so she could not call me immediately after the incident.  She made a drawing of what she saw very soon after getting home so I will scan it and email it.  Would be nice if you can email me with a case number so I can reply to your email with the scanned image.", "White bright light seen performing incredible movements over a small village in Reading, Berkshire, UKI would like to report a UFO sighting that took place on the 6th of January 2009.It was around 10:00pm UK time in the evening when I went upstairs to my bedroom to look out the window to see what the weather was doing. It was a very clear night, the moon was shining very brightly and so were the stars.However, as I was looking into the sky something caught my attention; my eyes were immediately drawn to a bright object behind the trees. At first, I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what I was looking at, to me it looked like a bright star, however, it was the brightest object in the sky with the exception of the moon.That theory was quickly ruled out when it began pulling off incredibly fast movements behind the trees. It suddenly started moving from behind the tree in what I could best describe as fast short burst movements. It would suddenly move quickly and then just as suddenly stop dead in the sky. To give you an idea of the location, where I live we have a lot of trees surrounding our house, with two large trees at the front of our driveway. The object moved from behind one of the trees we have and settled in position between the two large trees.What amazed me was its variety of movements, it was moving up and down left and right and even diagonally and at times all within one movement and very quickly. The object appeared as a strobing bright whitish light that wasn&rsquo;t really round, the way the light was in appearance suggested to me it was more of an oval shape object. But it appeared to be strobing very quickly, almost to a flicker kind of rate. I was absolutely mesmerized by this object; it was pretty amazing to observe what it was doing. This object didn&rsquo;t appear to be very close; to me it was a typical size of a star, but maybe just slightly bigger.Another thing I would like to add to this sighting was the fact that while I was observing this object I was getting a kind of an emotional response to it. Wasn&rsquo;t sure if this would be of any help or if indeed it has any relevance but I thought I would mention it anyway. It was strange to me.The actual sighting lasted for around 25 mins or more, I couldn&rsquo;t keep myself awake any longer and had to go to bed. I can&rsquo;t really say how long that object was in the sky, but it seemed to be lingering for quite a while.However, this morning I had another surprise on my way to dropping my wife off to work. Our local radio station announced a UFO flap that&rsquo;s been taking place in the Reading area I live in and even stretching as far as Oxford as well. I thought I would mention this, as it might help you verify more on the report I am giving you today.I really do not know what is was, but I do know what it wasn&rsquo;t; you can rule out blimps, flares, aeroplanes, and helicopters etc. What I saw was nothing related to conventional explanations and I am absolutely convinced it was very much out of the ordinary. I wished I had got it on camera, but unfortunately none of my equipment was charged up, so frustratingly I couldn&rsquo;t use anything to capture the object.This isn&rsquo;t the first time I have witnessed a UFO, I have had previous experiences with them in the past also, but this has been the best one so far.I am a regular listener of the Jeff Rense radio program here in the UK and always listen to your reports of UFO activity. God bless everything you are doing in getting the truth out about what&rsquo;s really taking place around the world.I hope this report helps you in your investigations.Very warm regards.", "Orange Fire Balls headed East over Atlantic OceanTwo low flying fire balls traveled from the Northwest in an Easterly direction out to the Atlantic Ocean.  The approximated altitude is estimated at 5000 feet and climbing intot he atmosphere as it approached the ocean. The orange-colored fireballs took approximately 3 minutes to travel the entire landscape over me.  The lights discipated as they distanced over the ocean. It was very difficult to focus on the objects. They traveled in nearly identical patterns.", "Fireball craft spotted in Maumelle, Arkansas heading South East.I was traveling North on Maumelle Blvd.  I saw the craft to my right moving in a South Easterly direction.  It appeared to be a fireball type of craft, changing  Altitude dramatically.  I turned East onto a side road to get a better look and took another right and was now headed in a southerly direction. The object appeared again to my left, and seemed to move parallel with me for about 20 seconds. It then proceeded to gain altitude and I lost sight of it behind some trees. The craft appeared to be spherical with a sort of fire flicker to it.  I saw and chased the craft for several minutes and was never able to identify anything distinguishing it from a plane or helicopter. There were no colored lights, no blinking lights, and it changed altitude too fast for anything terrestrial. The object also did not make a sound from what I could tell.", "20:05 hrs., Dallas, TX, wedge shaped object passing approximately 150 feet above house, moving NW to SE at approx 15 mph.At exactly 20:05 hours on the evening of December 5th, 2008, I was in my back yard walking my dogs along with family cats.  Only lights on was backdoor light.  Dogs were running around yard as usual.  What drew my attention to object I witnessed, was one of my cats, who would normally stay distance from me, ran towards me and stopped right by my right leg.  She sat down and was looking up over the roof of house.  I looked at the cat, thinking she was probably just looking at plane lights or maybe a bird so something.  She kept looking, so then I looked up to see what she was seeing.What I believed I saw at first, was a mass of bird flying over, and more than likely geese, since the formation was sort of looked liked a shape of geese migrating.  But then reality hit me.  It was moving at approximately 10 to 20 mph, almost parallel to my street, but when I focused on it, I then could see, that it had mass, and structure of a wedge shape.  It was close enough that I could get a base size from comparing it to the roof of my home.  The overall length was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and height was approximately 7 to 10 feet, and it was only 100 to 200 feet from the ground.  I was looking at the right lower quarter, from bow to stern.  There weren&rsquo;t any lights or any sound what-so-ever emitting from the craft. The right side was visible because of the lights of homes and a few street lights carried to that height.  I also had a small private aircraft flying at one to two thousand feet at about 2 miles southwest of our location, so I could get some variable and we have high pecan trees which also gave me some comparison to height from the ground.What was apparent, the side wasn&rsquo;t a smooth surface.  I say this because you could see dark and then somewhat lighter shades.  This to me could have been either two assumptions:  1.  The surface was painted, as we do some of our military aircraft, so it will blend in with the sky (clouds lighter and darker) or 2.  the surface had angles on it which would show lighter for the parts protruding out and dark for the area that was indented. This is similar to our stealth aircraft for displacing radar.  The light of homes and street lights were barely hitting the surface of the object but it was enough to make out the details.I yelled at my wife, who was inside.  When she came out, the object had only moved &frac14; of our block down the street.  I tried to have her follow my arm movement to look down the length of it to be able to see it.  By the time she was in sync with my movement the craft had gained some altitude and was moving away.  The rear of the craft seemed sort of blunt, not the shape appendage you would expect from a tails of an airplane.  It then moved away out of sight, not at an accelerated rate but at a constant speed.My background is journalism.  I&rsquo;ve spent over 6 years on U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and 6 years on Navy Air Stations, documenting Navy fighters and bombers in flight.  I also was piloting Cessna 150 and 172 aircraft years ago when I started pilot training, so I&rsquo;m used to aircraft design, determining what you visually see before me in order to navigate and anything associated with flight.  And being a photo journalist I&rsquo;m very good when it comes to attention to detail.  I wasn&rsquo;t mentally rattled and didn&rsquo;t lose my composure but the event left me with allot of questions.   A male friend of my wife at her work, who lives in north Dallas County saw something similar, same design, but with more than one object just a few months ago.", "A multi colored brightly shining star it was not!It first appeared as a bright star in the night sky, but after closer observation &amp; taking pictures &amp; video we realised it was something more.  It was circular in shape &amp; had multiple colors, from the video it was obvious that is was spinning &amp; had a pattern to it.", "UFO Sighting in Harbor City, CA areaAround 6.40 pm last night, we were driving east bound on Anaheim ave. as we saw something in the sky. It was a purple light that kept moving from left to right and than up and down, in very fast motion. As it moved it also changed colors 2 times. The person sitting next to me said that it had multiple different lights on it. We can explain this sighting other than it must have been UFO. We have never seen anything like that. It couldn&apos;t be an airplane because it moved very fast and in a strange motions. This would be impossible for any aircraft to move like this. We believed this lights were above the park near by so we drove that direction. There was no one at the park, it was very dark already, but the lights disappeared.", "Silver disc sighted in the afternoon, Mumbai, India.I&apos;m a 35 yr. old Indian (resident of India). I live on the outskirts of the city of Mumbai in a newly developed township known as New Mumbai.  I have my own business and I also work for Vacuum Tech. India, the Indian representatives of Alcatel, France.On the said day, I had been praying in my room with my window open, as i usually do, when all of a sudden i saw a silver disc coming into view from the left side. I immediately got up from my mat and ran outside calling for my mom. Both of us ran to the balcony and saw the UFO. (We live in a 3 storied apartment).The UFO was moving very slowly with a slight wobble, and as we stood on the balcony, we watched it move to our right. By now the wobbling had stopped. There were markings on the body (like something etched), and i&apos;m sure i could have read at least some of  it with my naked eyes, had it not been for the glare caused by the strong sunlight.While we were still watching, it stopped in midair for about 5 mins., and then began to move in a perpendicular direction towards an uncultivated area about 20kms. away from the place where we stay.Since it was quite close and very slow we had ample time to take note of a few things. For one, there was absolutely no sound. Second, it was not a helicopter. It was not an aircraft of any conventional make that i have ever seen. I didnt notice any windows (perhaps because of the glare). I could only make out a few grooves that ran across the body of the craft. It was certainly not a balloon because it stopped and changed direction. That&apos;s all i&apos;ve got to say. I dont know if anyone else noticed it. Indians are not really crazy about UFOs except in the cities.N.B. Before this, i have also seen a black triangle in the night traversing the same route. It went really fast so i couldn&apos;t see much except that it was black and had very subdued lights at the three corners.", "As a 76 year old photo hobbyist and a former Navy aerial photographer for ten years I stopped by Washington Park Lake in Denver to enjoy the tranquility and take some autumn pictures.  While there I saw a pulsed contrail.  Above the pulsed contrail was a small object darting about making extraordinary sharp turns and darting to &amp; fro.  Not a bird.  It rapidily disapeared behid the cloud cover or I would have a photo of it.  I did get a piture of the unusual pulsed contrail.", "2 unusual flashes of lightWhile driving on the old road from Laramie, WY to Wamsutter, WY, I saw a flash of light that was not related to a car, airplane, light tower, etc.  It was like a hologram.  The first one was a neon blue and bright pink with a horizontal pattern-the way blinds on a window are and it was as if it buzzed into view and then quickly went away.  A short distance later another light flashed but not as large and it was a bright bluish white.  My husband said he saw the same thing as a small boy on the same road but did not ever tell anyone until he saw the way I reacted after seeing the light.  I&apos;ve never ever seen anything like these lights.  I would not have submitted a report but I noticed that someone saw something very similar to what I witnessed a while back so I know I&apos;m not crazy and it makes me feel like I saw something that was unusual.", "While driving on Sanibel Island, Fl, 4 of us noticed a large formation of 30 - 40 lights moving slowly across the island.We were driving south on Periwinkle Dr on Sanibel Island after eating supper on Captiva Island, when 4 of us in the car noticed a couple of light orange lights crossing above the road.  As we continued, several other similar lights followed the first two moving at exactly the same spead and in an apparent formation.  There was no sound coming from these lights and they were certainly not birds and did not appear to be flares.  The evening sky was clear and dark.  As we went down the road, we also noticed many other people along the road at business locations looking at the same lights.   We went off the Island and pulled off the road on a causeway and we could no longer see the lights.Later that night, the lights were reported by the local Fort Myers Fox News.  I called the Sanibel police the next day and asked if these lights had been reported by any others.  They indicated there had been reports, and they asked if I knew what they were.  Of course, I could not answer that question.", "Large spherical craft with 2 lights rotating around the objectOn December 31st, 2008, at approximately 9:15 A.M., I watched an object, originally thought to be a balloon, drift from the NW sky to the SE sky over Ogden, UT.  As the object moved slowly toward my location, it&rsquo;s shape and detail became larger and more visible.  It was spherical, orb-like in shape.  It had 2 visible bright lights that appeared to go AROUND the object, 1 red, 1 white.  I watched this object for about 5 minutes before it instantly disappeared.  Soon after the sighting, military jets were witnessed travelling in the same sky area as the object.", "Shiny, oval shaped object in the sky, hovering above San AntonioI was driving northbound on I-37 entering the southern part of the downtown area in San Antonio, TX.

A family friend who tends to stare up at the sky while he smokes outside called to our attention to bright lights in the cloudy sky to the south-southwest of highway 5 and 380 in the general direction of Dallas.  One was very bright and was accompanied by a lesser shining light above and to the left of it like (&#x5C;) this. They both shined white and were the ONLY things visible in the sky. It was too cloudy and too bright out for any stars to be seen. They kept falling out of our view due to passing clouds but did not move in the sky and did not have any tails or trails.Another important note of this is that the flight path of commercial planes coming down toward DFW airport was smack right in the middle of the two lights. Several planes took the standard flight path but after a while the planes DEVIATED their flight paths to the west of the lights and avoided them completely.Tonight we stood outside and looked for anything. The stars have been visible but we DID NOT see anything near where we saw the two lights and the planes that regularly pass are back on the normal flight path. (We saw 4 or 5 planes go straight through the area where they had been flying between the lights yesterday night so we k now that must be their standard flight path.)  Several other people including some other friends and family saw it as well and acknowledged that the lights seemed strange seeing as there were no visible stars yesterday (Nov.27) where we were.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was kind of a triangle shape and had 3 very bright white lights on the bottom of it one in each corner of the craft that was it there were no blinking lights of color and the craft did not make a noise what so ever. You could see the bottom of the craft and it was black with a weird design on it. It was totally light up form the 3 white lights.

Looking up to the west we both saw a very brilliant sphere sorrounded by a clear halo. It was moving west to south with uniform speed. While travelling, it seemed to be spinning on its own axis, because we could see it shinning for a moment, and then the shine went very opaque, almost invisible against the sky, then  again, this shine came back. Seemed like it was partially reflective and partially opaque.At some some point, it crossed just below of the morning moon and and aircraft passed at the same time. It continued moving towards the sun and it became very difficult to see because we had the sun in front of our face.I guess the clear halo was 2 or 3 times the size of the sphere.", "ALASKA UFO VIDEO TAPED AND WITNESSED IN 2003.As a police officer working for the City and Borough of ((temporarily deleted during investigation)), Alaska in 2003, I was dispatched with the Chief of Police to respond to a report of a low flying object over one of the residential neighborhoods.  The day was sunny, cool (about 60 degrees), and not a cloud in the bright blue sky.  When we arrived on scene, a local resident pointed to the sky approx 30 degrees up off the horizon, approx 5 miles away (estimations), there was a silver ball slowly moving across the skyline.   As we observed the object, the resident shouted &quot;No s(*%, a real UFO&quot;.  We video taped the object for approx 15 to 20 minutes before disappearing over the horizon.  The most surprising observations were the inexplicable ability of this object to change shapes from circular to diamond, and back again.  It appeared to vibrate and blur its borders while conducting these shape changes.  The absolute strangest observation was my attempt to zoom in on the object where I observed symetrical smaller diamond shaped patterns in &quot;the hull&quot; (for lack of a better term) but the object immediately speed out of view in a looped, non-linear manner when I apparently was getting too much detail on the cam-corder.  Most unusual.  I still have the video tape.  This object is not anything conventional or seen before; not an airplane, no propeller, no &quot;nose&quot; or &quot;bill&quot; or &quot;tail&quot;.

While I was sitting in a chair on my patio the dog looked up, and I did also.  Flying overhead at a tremendous speed was a brilliant, white ball of light about the circumference of a hula hoop.  A basketball size would not be quite large enough.  It had come from the West over my house flying East at the same height of the wispy clouds above me.  I do not know how high that was.  In seconds it disappeared into the distance.  It was a clean, concise ball of light.  No vapor, or tail, or distortion.After it had disappeared, to my right in the sky was a small plane that was flying higher than the ball of light did. In a few more minutes a commercial jet plane came over my house and it seemed to be crawling in the sky compared to the speed of the earlier ball of light.  I am on the flight path of planes heading north from Bergstrom/Austin Airport, and I watch them often from my patio, and my dog is used to looking up at them.

It was moving rather slowly from due north to due south.  It consisted of three yellowish lights in an equalateral configuration.  These lights seeemed unusually bright to me and I followed them as they crossed my field of vision.  When they had crossed a point perpendicular to my point of view they remained very bright.  This caused me to feel that these lights were pointing downwards, not forward as a landing lights would.  There were no navigational lights associated with this &apos;craft&apos;, there was no sound involved, nor was there any vapor trail visible.  There had been a couple air-liners that I had already seen that morning and their trails were very evident.  Beyond the pattern of lights there is no other description I can provide.

The object stopped moving and appeared to be an oval shaped pale blue light through the clouds. I then ran down the stairs to my front yard and noticed that it remained still, with a coloring like the moon through thin clouds, it was a little cloudy that night.I then returned into my, went back to my bederoom window with binoculars to watch the still unmoving object.  I noticed that it had a lot of lights flashing in different colors it now appeared to be more disked or saucer shaped with lots of lights.  I saw a plane pass right in front of it from my view.  The object  was very large and i&apos;m sure it was at a much higher altitude than the plane.  I called my daughter on the phone and told her about the sighting.  My daughter lives a short distance away, about a couple of miles from me.  She looked out of an upstairs patio, and was able to see it along with her husband.  As i continued watching, it began to slowly move toward the north west,then stopped.  There were at least 6 rows of about 10 red lights flashing alternating from the left side of the craft to the right side of the craft very rapidly for abou 5 minutes.The flashing red lights gave way to rows of pale green lights in the center of the craft for about 2 minutes. The ofject then reverted to a pale blue and slowly moved toward the north west.It was not a plane, blimp or helicopter, it no sound.

Since the surrounding mountains are 3-500m with peeks up to about 1300m. I remember the clouds to be about 800-1000m above the sea. We kept a speed of 80km/h or 50 miles, so we also got kind of a 3D-perspective of the course.If my altitude-estimation is about correct, this object where flying way too slow to use conventional aerodynamical wings. My first thought was a helicopter, but the flashes where on a much higher frequency, and appered much brighter than I have ever seen on a conventional aircraft. (and I&apos;ve worked as airport-groundpersonell for two years!)  And out of nowhere. When the object was about the middle of the fjord, hundreds or maybe thousands of flashes, in an area of at least 200 meters in diameter (if all my estimates are somewhere close to accurate) kept on fireing for about 2 - 3 seconds(nothing systematical or symmetrical about them) And then it was just that single flashing light on the same low-speed steady-corse crossing the fjord and finally dissappearing behind the mountain towards Sagfjord.If you are interrested, I can mail you a map of the area and draw things like the objects course, our possition(s)((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was flickering red and orange and I noticed a moving aircraft near it, possibly a helicopter or small jet.  What really caught my attention was the fact that the object I was looking at did not move at all.  If it was a aircraft, it would have moved either to the right or left or something but this light was just in the sky with no movement.  I watched it for about 1 minute outside and then it just faded away!! The object was north of the base and looked close to the coast if I had to estimate its location.  It was close enough that I could see the two distinct colors of red and orange but far enough away that I could not see any type of shape to the object except that it reminded me of a planet or something like that.

I c an&rsquo;t imagine I was the only person to see these lights, especially the initial series of 15 as they were very close to the highway.  The lights didn&rsquo;t move from that horizontal or diagonal line except for the one.  I looked to see if there were any news reports of these lights but didn&rsquo;t find anything.

There was no other source of light that would have caused it. We did a laundry list of things it could possibly be, and none would have produced that light that close to our window.  In terms of arrangement he describes them in a line, not a perfect line, but basically one after the other.

We live in the mountains of Western North Carolina, out in the woods. There is no light pollution, so when the nights are clear the stars are all there for the naked eye to see. We went to take the dogs out around 9pm. There was a very bright light due south hanging behind  the ridge line. It was very, very bright white  and pulsating. Moving  horizontal and vertical, sometimes on the diagonal. An aura of changing colors,blues, reds, greens around the center of the light. It cast light on the ridge.  Not an aircraft........No sign of a beam coming from the ground anywhere....It was casting light................We grabbed the video camera and got about 5 minutes of footage.  It looks like it is something 3 dimensional and spinning on an edge.  There is a dark side to it.  As we watched the light it started moving back away from us and then back towards us.  Then all of the sudden it started to throw what looked like a large six sided spider web light formation.  It appear suddenly like an explosion.  At first the webs of light appeared to propel the light away.  One web had vertical lines of faint color.  Another had diagonal lines of another color   A third had horizontal lines.  We have these on the video.  Then the light began to move away from us.  So far away that our camera could no longer pick it up but  we could see it with out naked eyes.  As we watched this for a few minutes, moving back and forth across the sky,  then hanging out in the eas, two more appeared with the first one.  There were aircraft in the area at this time.  We think the planes  were in front of the lights because the lights looked to be very far away now.  Watching the video later we saw that the light explode into the six sided shape and then back into a light.  We also discovered that we ha accidentally left the camera on and picked up more of the web shapes while we were looking at the 3 far off in the distance.  We called the local police  and TV stations to ask if  any other reports of strange lights had come in. The TV station said that in the last couple of months there were other reports in the area, but none like this.", "White Light Object appears in the sky and speeds away below the horizonWhile driving south on Interstate 65, a bright light in the sky off to the left and up from the horizon about 25 degrees appeared.

Its trajectory seemed to be from west to east and possibly proceeding downward slightly. There was no sound. It was in my vision (through a clear windshield) for probably less than 0.5 sec. The light extinguished suddenly and completely while it was high in the sky. It was a very clear night, very dark, and with a yellow crescent moon practically on the horizon. I was driving on a dark stretch of road with no street lights and no traffic lights. As I continued driving home, I searched for any further signs of activity, but found none.

At the time I thought it was a small Cessna or a small plane of that type.  I did notice a lack of wings, but at the time I thought the plane was tilted to that the wings were hidden by the body.  The object was high enough that I couldn&rsquo;t see any details, except that it was brilliantly white and had 2 dark bands (no idea of the color).  I didn&apos;t hear any sound at all.Well a cute young lady drew my attention away for 5-20 seconds approx. and when I looked back the passenger jet was still there, but the object had completely disappeared.

I called to my wife who came immediately and saw the object just as it began moving east toward Lake Charles Municipal Airport. We got into our car and followed the object, which had to have been moving close to 100 miles per hour. I distinctly remember the object passing in front of an airplane descending onto the runway. Afterward, the object moved too quickly out of our range to keep up with it. The local television station, KPLC, reported that there had been multiple sightings. The next day, our newspaper, &quot;The American Press,&quot; reported that what people were seeing was a blimp with lights inside of the inflated part that was illuminating it. I was within three miles of the object and got no impression that it was a blimp, but I cannot say for certain what the object was.", "2 HUGE BRIGHT STATIONARY LIGHTS IN THE SKYI was driving to the west on a gravel road around 6:30 pm, and noticed 2 VERY HUGE and bright lights (nothing blinking) in the SW sky. (abnormally larger and brighter than stars)  It was a very clear night and many stars were visible.  Also noticed a few aircraft (lights blinking) in the skies.  These 2 bright lights were obviously not moving like normal aircraft, but in a stationary position.  Could see aircraft (lights blinking) flying around these 2 bright lights for about 15 minutes like they were keeping their eye on them. Towards the end of the observation, noticed the lights seemed to be more in the distant than before, but still NOT moving.

These lights covered the distance that about 4 to 5 commercial jetliners would have covered and constantly made different patterns. I got out of my car because i couldn&apos;t believe my eyes.  I called everyone in my cellphone as quickly as I could but no one answered until it was all over.  The floating lights, because that&apos;s the only way I can describe them, stayed close together. They finally formed a straight line with one of the dots leading them all and they drifted slowly into the overcast night.

Anyways I was just about to the gate when I saw a very bright blue light out of the cirbir of my eye. I looked up at the sky and there was this blue oval looking object.  The object was I would have to say less than a half mile in the sky. It was there and gone as soon as I looked up at it. It appeared to be moving downward into a field right across the street. I was very scared of the fact that it moved so quickly and seemed to vanish before getting to the ground. There was no noise at all from the object. I would have to say I was less than 300 yards away from it as well.  As soon as I saw it vanish I felt chills.  The area where the object was has a lot of dear that roam around at night. I didn&apos;t see any dear in sight. It&apos;s about an hour after I have witnessed the unidenitifief object.  I still don&apos;t see any deer, and they are always coming into the field around this time from across the street where I spores the object.

The sky was clear and it was fairly cool at ~60deg. F. I was looking in the sky for the usual planes landing at FLO Airport.I noticed that where a church had been pointing search lights up in the sky the week before, there was a totally black triangle shape with its base toward me.It was so black the ambient light in the sky made its shape out very crisply.It was SWW of Florence (to my reckoning it was about on a line from Florence to Shaw AFB that some military craft use occasionally). I figured it to be at least 2-3miles away and about 2000ft up. It did not move, nor did I see any light emitting from it. I would estimate its size to be in the 100ft wide range and twice as long, as well as about 20ft thick. This estimate is based on the lack of atmospheric scintillation. It could have been farther or even closer.It did not reflect any light that I could discern and that made it so black it stood out in the sky like a black nothing.As I put my thumb up to measure it, which was about 1/4 the width of my thumb at arms length, it seemed to just wipe itself away, from tip toward the base in about 1/2 a second.That was the first time I could say I saw a UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Witnessed by my daughter and I.12/23/2008   I&apos;m sorry it  took long to report this.I would say this happened early  2008 around the afternoon hours. I just happen to find this site while watching a  National Geographic channel on UFO sightings. It was being narrated by the late Peter Jennings.I live in a 15 story building in which I&apos;m located on the 5th floor. We happen to have a great view of the New York City skyline. This was an overcast day but the view was clear for miles. One could see the skyline quite clearly from where we are; some 5-10 miles from the city.My daughter, who was playing with her dolls near by yelled out to me to look out the window. I in the mean time was on the computer finishing up some papers, when I turn to look out and we see this oblong shaped object some 3-4 miles away. It&apos;s difficult to discern exactly the distance because all this lasted some 15-20 seconds. But as we looked outside, this object floated some 600 feet/plus from the ground, just  hovering when it began to move upward slowly and then disappear.The shape was obelisk with some sort of protrusions sticking out from the side in a horizontal  form.  It was dark black.  I would guess the object was rather large. Roughly  some 70-100 feet long vertically. It made no sound. Wasn&apos;t a helicopter, or  blimp that just happened to stand on it&apos;s end. It was very weird.This is something I will never forget. The odd thing of course is that no one that I know or I don&apos;t know reported this except my daughter and myself. My daughter is 5 years old.

This object appeared to be 1.5 miles South of the Highway, traveling parallel to it and was solid gray in color. At no time were we able to see through it.For 25 minutes, we had a visual on the object, with the only lapses being caused by us driving through wooded areas which would block our view for a few seconds.After 25 minutes, the object appeared to change to a more elongated form, with the aft section beginning to droop. At this time, we started noticing more detail. We would estimate the length to be 300-400 yards in total. At the top portion, there appeared to be an object protruding out. The protrusion was black and gave the general appearance of a small fixed wing aircraft in a gentle climb. The middle of was still gray, and the drooping section appeared silver in color.At this point, we lost visual and sped up to try to get through the tree lined area.

The visibility was greater then 10 miles, the cloud layer was scattered at approximately 5000 feet and the winds were out of the south east at approximately 10-15 knots on the surface.At 8pm eastern time, I observed a lighted object roughly 3 miles to the north west of my position about 60 degrees above the horizon, moving south paralleling the west coast of Siesta Key.  The object initially appeared to be a plane with an engine fire but as it approached closer to my position it became apparent that it was more of a spear emitting light similar to intensity and appearance of a common marine flare, flickering yellow and orange/red in color.The object traveled from its position north west of me, almost due south, paralleling the coast for about 2-3 miles.  At its closest point of approach it was due west of my position by approximately 2 miles, or about 1.5 miles west of the beach of Point of Rocks.  At this point the object appeared to stop moving and began to climb.  I was unable to determine if the object actually stopped moving, or turned its motion directly away from me.  Either way, the object climbed into the cloud deck and began to fade from sight as it passed through the 5000&rsquo; scattered cloud deck.  As it began to climb and fade from sight, another object, identical in appearance to the first, appeared approximately 2 miles to the north west of my position at approximately the same altitude taking an almost identical flight path as the first.  The first object had faded completely away by the time the second object made its closest point of approach to my position.  It also appeared to stop or turn away from my position like the first, climb and penetrate the 5000&rsquo; cloud deck and fade from sight.  The entire event took approximately 4 minutes from visually acquiring the first object to the second object&rsquo;s fade from sight.  My best estimates of their velocity would be in the 60-120 knot range.  I estimate this based on the position of the object above the horizon in relation to the cloud deck which I estimated to be at approximately 5000&rsquo;.There was no sound associated with the objects, as mentioned above; they emitted a tremendous amount of light energy with flickering similar to a flare. I was able to train a high power telescope on the second object and saw nothing but a pulsating light that I would have reported as a flare if the trajectory had not been what it was.I currently work as a professional offshore pilot in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.  I have seen flares, fighter jets afterburners at night, oil rig burn offs, boat fires, large shooting stars breaking apart, plane crashes and countless other night time lights and phenomena.  I am convinced that this was none of these.Doing my best to confirm that I did not witness the flare of a vessel in distress, I spoke with the local Coast Guard Sector.  As I was explaining what I observed, the Petty Officer Cut me off mid sentence and asked if I think I saw a UFO.  I advised I was not sure when he told me that he just received a report from another source in the same area of an identical sighting and it was being reported as a UFO.  I placed calls with all of the local Air Force and FAA airspace controllers, who all reported no operations in the area.  I followed up with the Coast Guard on the December 26th, who advised there were no further developments with this case.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we suspect that the person is a superlative witness.

As the lights moved closer together, I assumed it was an airliner, even though I could not see a wing structure or fuselage; it seemed to be moving away.  The only major discrepancy was that the lights brightness and size remained the same.

I was watching a movie, when a strong noise, like that of a helicopter, appeared all of a sudden over my building (very close to Washington Square) I went out to the balcony and saw a big object standing still, flying very close to the last floor (the 17th, I live in the 3rd) Actualy I would have said it was a helicopter, but my mind was saying to me &quot;no, it isn&apos;t&quot;, as there was a wierd light belt surrounding the structure from the bottom to the top, with white, blue and red colors. I went downstairs to follow the object, as it was disappearing to my eyes whenever it crossed to the other side of the building or was geting closer to the roof. As you can imagine, I wouldn&apos;t have gone downstairs a regular monday at 4AM for something that wasn&apos;t wierd enough. I have to add also that, as a sciencetist I use to be kind of objective and sceptic. I took my camera (regular old digital camera) with me, but the only one picture I could make was a very vague light in a dark sky, which equals nothing. The object finally slowly flew towards the west side, I tried to follow it, but disapeared between the buildings. I went from 3rd street/Laguardia Place  all the way to the 7th avenue, and from there I could just slightly hear the &quot;helicopter&quot; noise, but couldn&apos;t see anything else.I want to imagine that it was a helicopter that, because was dark and the long shaped structure, I was confusing with something else, and that&apos;s all. But could you please let me know if you have been reported from anyone else or you can find anything like this today?((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

WE WERE FLYING F-94A&apos;S AND F94B&apos;S. OUR GROUND RADAR CONTROL STATION WAS CODE NAMED CRANE CONTROL. I HAD BEEN SCRAMBLED OFF ABOUT TWO AM WITH MY BACKSEAT RADAR ORSERVER. WE HAD MADE OUR INTERCEPT AND WERE RELEASED BY CRANE CONTROL. AS WAS THE CUSTOM, WE WERE FLYING ABOUT BURNING UP FUEL AS IT WAS UNWISE TO LAND WITH MUCH FUEL LEFT IN THE WING TIP TANKS. WE WERE ABOUT 50 MILES NORTHWEST OF LADD WHEN WE WERE RECONTACTED BY CRANE CONTROL. THEY SAID THAT THE ANCHORAGE RADAR CONTROL STATION, WHOSE NAME I HAVE FORGOTTEN, HAD CONTACTED THEM AND THAT THERE WAS AN OBJECT FLYING NORTH AT ABOUT 1100 TO 1200 KNOTS PER HOUR. THEY HANDED OFF THE CONTACT TO CRANE CONTROL. NOTE, THIS WAS 1954. NOTHING FLEW THAT FAST IN 1954. BY CHANCE WE WERE IN THE FLIGHT PATH OF THE OBJECT. THIS WAS FEBRUARY AND AT THAT LATITUDE IT WAS BITTER COLD AND VERY BLACK. CRANE CONTROL GAVE ME A VECTOR FOR AN INTERCEPT. MY RADAR OPERATOR SOON PICKED UP THE OBJECT AND WE HAD A HEADON INTERCEPT OR VERY CLOSE. NOT THE BEST SITUATION, BUT I PLOWED RIGHT AHEAD AND KEPT THE BOGEY DEAD CENTER. IT TOOK ONLY ABOUT 30 SECONDS FOR THE INTERCEPT SUCH AS IT WAS. I WAS SURE I WAS DEAD. NOTHING HAPPENED. NO VISUAL, NO TURBULENCE, NO STATIC OR ANY THING.

At first I thought the lights were stars but then I could see other stars in the sky and they were not as bright and big.  As I waited outside the bar I noticed that the two points of light had moved slightly to the right.  To make sure I planted my back to a tree and used a distant tree branch as a reference point, and the straight edge of my lighter as a guide.  I walk away and waited for my friends-about 5 minutes.  I walked back to the tree, planted myself in the same place and noticed that the lights were not in the same place. Each light had moved as if they were connected, although I couldn&apos;t see any structure connecting them.  Ten minutes later I returned to the same spot and the lights were noticably moved away from my intial reference point.  The streets were mostly empty as most of the people have left town for the holidays.  I also noticed a red blinking dot, like a helicopter flying in the area of the lights.  My friends pulled up and I showed them the lights and they stared for a while but the lights were fixed and outside of there brightness there was nothing spectacular to them-I&apos;m sure.  One hour or so later we returned to the bar and the lights were gone.  I usually stare at the sky and I have noticed how with time stars change positions in the sky.  Specifically I have observed the constallation Orion change position on many evenings.  The difference is that it usually takes hours for this to happen.  These object were moving very slow, but to fast for stars-due to the Earth moving. Another thing is that while I was staring at this thing I felt like something was communicating with me (this sounds nuts, I know).  As my friends husband looked at it I noticed that he was also grabbed by something, almost in a hypnotic state for a brief moment.  On the somewhat empty street, earlier, for some reason, I found I couldn&apos;t stop looking at it.((NUFORC Note:  Given the long duration of the event, we suspect that the witness may have been observing the two planets, Venus and Jupiter, which currently are quite prominent in the southwestern sky, at the time of night indicated by the witness.

My 13-year-old son and I were sitting in our Jacuzzi this evening looking at Orion&rsquo;s belt when my son suddenly pointed up at the sky.  He had spotted something flying and asked me to identify it.  The object was flying overhead coming in our direction from the east and heading westward in a straight line.  It was triangular in shape and had a relative size of about one quarter of a full moon (if you cut the moon up like a pie).  I would estimate its altitude to have been about that of a conventional, single engine propeller plane, or perhaps even as low as a helicopter.The object had a dim but solid orange glow to it and there were no blinking lights (red or green) as most aircraft have when in flight.  Although I cannot estimate its speed with much accuracy I can say that from the time it entered our field of vision from the east to when it disappeared to the west took no more than three to four seconds.  Thus, I would say that it appeared to be traveling quite fast.  What astonished both myself and my son, however, was the fact that the object made no sound whatsoever.  No buzz of props, no rumble of jet engines-nothing-not even after it had passed.It was a bizarre and surreal feeling watching it seemingly &quot;glide&quot; at such a speed over us.   The absolute silence of the craft and its flight is what got us to report it.  From the time we first saw the craft in the east to the time it left our field of vision in the west the craft had traveled approximately 110 degrees (180 degrees being from one horizon to the other on a perfectly flat plane).((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the father, and he seemed to us to be unusually serious-minded and credible.

My boyfriend thought it was a plane or jet fighter since it was so loud but I said the sound was too loud.  So we looked out the balcony and into the sky and saw a flash of light beam fast across.  We then went to the front of the apt to follow the light.  When we looked to the sky we saw about  10 flashing, sparkling lights in a row and above about 3 more but a good distance from each other.  That lasted about 30 seconds or so and then it hid behind the clouds and we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.", "Multiple sightings in Central Texas (Freestone County area)We live on a farm/ranch in Freestone County between Fairfield &amp; Palestine near Highway 84.  We have very dark skies and are used to seeing bright stars, satellites &amp; multiple air traffic.  I am going to report the multiple sightings that we have had in the last few months.  My boyfriend&apos;s family has had this land for 4 generations and he grew up here.  He and other members of his family have seen strange things over the years but this year there has been lots of activity.  We are only about 120 miles Southeast of Stephensville &amp; 65 miles from Waco.  There are several airbases and strip mines (lignite &amp; coal) in this area of Texas. I mention the mines because lots of activity seems to occur near them.  I am going to give a description of each sighting over the last few months.  We really believe something is going on possibly military, possibly not. If it is military - it is something unbelievable and the technology is very different.10/20/2008 - We (my boyfriend and I) had just arrived home and stepped out on the back porch of the farm to look at the beautiful sunset. We noticed 3 long pencil shaped cylinder objects due West of us toward Limestone County (Mexia/Waco) somewhere beyond highway I-45 above highway 84W. At first we thought they might be jet trails. They were suspended at a 40-45 degree angle from the ground. They did not break up like trails and we realized they were solid and very reflective. You could see the reflection of the sunset in them. I ran inside and got my digital camera and snapped a few shots. They were in perfect formation. With the naked eye, nothing showed up on the camera screen but when I downloaded onto the computer we noticed you could see 3 white orbs or ovals in the picture when amplified by 200+. The strange part about this is with a naked eye these objects looked very long and solid like pencils or telephone poles in the sky but on film they were round or oval shaped. We told some friends later in the week what we saw and they admitted that they saw them too and had commented how strange they looked. They were in their car on the way to a restaurant at I45 &amp; 84. They also saw them due West/Northwest. I will try and include a picture with this report. The incident lasted over a 1/2 hour.10/28/2008 - We had just gotten home and went out on the back porch to feed our 4 dogs at 8:20 PM. I observed a dull orange, red glowing sphere with a whitish glow in the center. It looked like it was hovering or floating just above the tree line in the Southwest sky somewhere between our land and Jewett (near the mine). My boyfriend ran inside and came back out with his rifle which had a high powered scope. We took turns observing the object until 8:33 PM when it either flew over the horizon or descended (we felt like it descended). The next day we saw a report on the Dallas news that the Stephensville lights had returned so I decided to send them an account of what we saw. I contacted the Stephensville paper and reported the object. They asked if they could use our description in an article so I gave them permission. The next day they published the article and there was a picture that had been submitted by an East Texas woman. Our verbal description matched the picture exactly (but we did not take any pictures that night). Others saw what we saw! 11/25/2008 - Almost the exact same sighting as mentioned previously - orange, reddish glowing sphere with white center...almost dull like a halo around it. It was in the same Southwestern area and we saw it around 9:00 PM and watched it for 15 minutes - again it looked like it descended or went over the horizon. Other air traffic could be seen and this looked nothing like the normal air traffic in the area. Since this was the second sighting of this kind we began to investigate our surrounding (helicopter landing sights etc.) but we found nothing.12/3/2008 - Again, almost the same description as above - we documented it at 8:05 and watched it until 8:22. We could not get pictures because nothing would show up.12/7/2008 - (This is our strangest one yet and involved three different sets of lights). This sighting started out as the one above. We had just gotten back from Dallas &amp; Waxahachie and went out on the back porch to feed the dogs at 8:19 PM. I saw the strange orange/red object and called out to my boyfriend to come take a look. We watched it do it&apos;s normal thing (descend or go over the horizon) but this time as soon as we lost sight of it this bright white light appeared above it. This came on as if someone had turned on a lightbulb. This object began to flash bright multi colors in sequence. The colors were amazing - blue, orange, pink, green, red. It was so bright it was hard to tell what shape it was. We got the rifle scope out again and my boyfriend looked at it through the scope - he said it was hard to tell it&apos;s shape. As soon as he handed me the scope the light went off, again just like a light switch. I told him something was still there - right when I said that, 3 small piercing white strobe lights came on in a triangle formation. They kept strobing back and forth as if communicating or sequencing. A high flying jet came into the airspace where this was going on and the strobe lights began to almost cartwheel over each other off to the North at a very high rate of speed. The next thing we knew, we were just looking at the regular air traffic (jets) on their route to Dallas. This sighting really shook me up. While it was happening, my boyfriend called his mom who lives in town, she went out to see if she could see anything and she could not because of the tree cover in her neighborhood (very large Post Oaks).I reported this sighting to MUFON ( I had reported the previous sightings to them). The MUFON investigator contacted me and said that he had received almost an exact report of our sighting from a man that was driving home from Dallas back to Waco with his teenage son (they had been at a football game).12/11/2008 - This is our last sighting. There is a well being drilled due South of our farm and we can see the rig lighting very clearly beyond our barns. I had gone out on the back porch at 10:00 PM and saw the strange multi colored bright light about 55 degrees above left of the rig. We watched it for 40 minutes, I tried to film it but nothing appears on the video. It was not a star because we know our night sky and there has not been a star there before and there has not been one since.Please consider investigating this area of Texas if you are already investigating the Stephensville incidents.

North Shields, North Tyneside, England.   21:20.I was walking home when an incredibly bright object flew over my head from approximately East North East to West South West.   It was incredibly fast.   It left a solid tail light behind which remained behind it.   At first I thought it was a &ldquo;shooting star&rdquo; but as I stared at it I realized that it was not like any &ldquo;shooting star&rdquo; I had ever seen.   It flew horizontally.    It came to an abrupt halt and remained stationary.    It was circular and flat (like a hockey puck) and incredibly brilliant and fast.   There was no sound whatsoever.Then another object appeared sort of slowly.  It was much higher up and much much bigger.    It was odd shaped &ndash; seemed to be angular and outlined by pin prick lights.   The centre of this object was in darkness.    The pin prick lights got a little brighter and then the object hovered.     Again there was no sound whatsoever.Both objects hovered for several seconds and then the brilliant &ldquo;hockey puck&rdquo; just vanished which took me by surprise and then I realized the other object had also vanished.   The thought occurred to me afterwards that this was a rendezvous and the &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; ship had come for the reconnaissance craft.     Does this sort of thing happen?  The sky was black at the time with no stars visible.   The weather was cold and dry.   This was a residential built up area and as I walked home I saw few cars.I am retired, have lived in many places, travelled to many countries and camped in remote areas, and this is the first time I have ever encountered anything like this.I live about 15 miles from a small International Airport so I am used to seeing planes flying overhead or coming into land, both in daylight and in darkness.

Then I noticed a very bright light that looked like a star way above the air plan.  As I thought in my head, this cant be a star, it started to move slowly to the east. Then I saw another light or star blink on in the same path as the first one but it was moving towards the west.  I was blown away at what I was witnessing, There were no wings or any airplane or helicopter features and no sound coming from the lights.  The only way I can describe them is they looked like stars or very bright points of light. The one moving to the west suddenly disappeared.  The one moving to the east was still moving slowly and then just stopped.  It stayed still for a few minutes and then started to move to the west.

Also the shape of the object was very similar to a shooting star as well.  The thing that really caught my eye was at the slow speed it traveled.  Most shooting stars are gone in a flash not too mention the altitude of the object was in our atmosphere, not outside.

It was a beautiful night and warm for winter here in East Naples, FL.I would gaze at the moon, marveling at how beautiful it was as it was rising into the night sky and then pay attention to my dog. My dog is an elder fellow and is blind so I need to be careful to keep an eye on him and give the correct &lsquo;signals&rsquo; to help him navigate.I noticed groupings of several people, some were talking around a golf cart and some were partying, or at least that is how it sounded. Both groups were far enough away from me that I could not converse with them nor did I know who they were so therefore I was unable to ask them if they had seen what I just saw in the full moon night sky.I gazed up and saw two pulsing red/white orbs circling each other to the right side of the moon. They were pulsing light objects with red in the center with bright white around the perimeter of each one. They moved in unison and always parallel to one another. They seemed to be equidistant from each other. If one moved up, the other kept the same distance or so it seemed to me.It took me a few seconds to realize what my eyes were seeing. These pulsing orbs of light were playing with each other and then suddenly the pulses started to dim and they were gone.

If it was a private jet in the pattern, they&apos;d be at ~1500 ft - and that&apos;s about what it looked like.I did start to notice that the &quot;airplane&quot; seemed to be &quot;downwind&quot; longer than normal, as it didn&apos;t turn right, to base, as it should have done - so, I started watching it more closely.Maybe it was a helicopter? But, a helicopter doesn&apos;t have widely spaced &quot;landing lights&quot;. Maybe it was a helicopter with an advertising grid below, with 2 large lights? It seemed odd to me - and since I&apos;d never seen a helicopter with a lighted advertising display, that would have to been pointed towards me so that the &quot;directional&quot; landing lights would stay a brightly white, from my viewpoint.Then, oddly, the two lights, that were level, seemed to bank and turn left (to my right, as it had seemed to be heading towards me).What was odd, is that the two lights, didn&apos;t change in intensity.&quot;Landing lights&quot;, are &quot;directional&quot;. If they aren&apos;t pointed at you, they, basically, go out.I&apos;m a licensed pilot with quite a bit of night flying experience - and being based up north of San Francisco Airport, you can watch the landing lights of the passenger jets take off at night and watch them wink out as the jet makes it&apos;s turn after takeoff.So, when this &quot;thing&apos;s&quot; right side light seemed to drop, and it seemed to turn &quot;left&quot; (my right), back south(ish) towards central Vallejo, it really stood out that the 2 lights didn&apos;t change in intensity at all. That would infer a non-directional light - and that wouldn&apos;t be on an airplane - as a non-directional light that bright, would blind the pilot&apos;s vision. Then, as it seemed to still be at about 1000-1500 ft, I saw a string of 7-8 dimmer lights tying the two bright light together.What was odd, and different from my first impression, was that the right side bright light stayed ~30 degrees lower than the upper left light (as if &quot;it&quot; was still banking) - but, the two lights stayed offset and the pair of bright lights (and the 7-8 dimmer lights connecting them) began obviously traveling east, at, I&apos;d guess, at 40-50 mph. (as in def not 10-20 and def not 60-70) It wasn&apos;t turning anymore, it was traveling east over Hwy 80 up the Auto Mall &quot;valley&quot; - still with the two lights offset in height.I&apos;d been watching it over the Napa River Bridge, through Vallejo (on 37), past 6 Flags Amusement park.I lost sight of it while taking the 37 / 80 west offramp. behind the overpass. I caught a brief glance of it looking backwards on 80 - Then I couldn&apos;t see the 7-8 dimmer lights between the 2 bright lights, but traffic was a bit hectic there.I took the first offramp and doubled back on Admiral Callaghan, I couldn&apos;t see it, but caught a momentary glimpse of a lighted spot 1000 to 1500 ft up on the valley ridge, right about at the Target store shopping center.I&apos;d guess that it was 80% to 90% of the way to the top of the hills (I could see the outline of the ridgeline). The lighted spot was reflected light, and I couldn&apos;t see any particular point of light, just a very brightly lighted area 50 to 100 ft wide up near the ridge.I lost direct line of sight behind the auto dealers and when I got to the top of Admiral Callaghan, I couldn&apos;t see the light on the hill anymore.I went down to Auto Mall Parkway, turned right and kept looking up to find the lights again.Nothing.In recreating my initial view, what I first had thought was &quot;downwind&quot; on Rwy 6 at KAPC, was wrong. The lights were over the northern edges of the town of Vallejo, a few miles south of the airport, about inline with the Napa / Solono county borders.I&apos;m 100% sure of the 2 non-directional lights, the 7-8 dimmer lights and the slow speed, the altitude and the light on the hillside. No smoke, no flicker, no pulsation.On January 4th, at about 6pm, I called the FAA tower at KAPC and asked the controller if they had had any other sighting reports on the 23rd. He didn&apos;t, and he checked with the controller on duty that night, and he didn&apos;t see anything, either. The lights would have been to the south of the tower, behind the controller&apos;s visual operating area (runways are north of the tower).Duration of observation, about 10 - 12 minutes.If someone else describes a similar sighting, feel free to contact me.", "fading lights in formation over Fort Gordonfor the record i&apos;m still not convinced this wasn&apos;t just some weird training exercise, but tonight 2 soldiers came up to me when i returned to the barracks after dinner, claiming to have seen &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot;.  Soldiers had obviously been drinking, but i decided to humor them and listen to their story.  They claimed to have seen 3 reddish-orange lights appear in a triangular formation and a fourth a little ways off that flew around the (clear, dark)sky, and then faded out of sight.  As I was in the process of listening to them, suddenly one pointed at the sky, where I saw a single light had appeared in the sky, it remained stationary and then faded out after 10 seconds or so.  I tried to dismiss as a flare, but then realized their was no noise or smoke trail, and it was too high.  after another two minutes 4 lights appeared, 3 in a line and one lower to the right.  As i watched the furthest right light in the line faded out, just a 5th light appeared on the left side of the line, almost as if a giant cylindrical object was slowly turning. after 15 secs or so this display faded out completely.  myself, the two initial witnesses, and 2 more soldiers witnessed this.  afterwards at roughly 2 min intervals, the single light would reappear. this happened 3 more times or so.Background of reporter:  22 year old male, intelligence analyst for the US Army, completely sober at time of sighting, (am sipping a beer as i write this report however), highly skeptical about aliens, but willing to admit that this was a flying object I could not identify, and am familiar with most of the worlds aircraft due to my job.Location:  Ft. Gordon is the signal center for the US army, lights looked like they were possibly overhead of the new NSA expansion being constructed on post.PS: one guy did videotape incident with his phone, however its such poor quality that lights are not visible, all you can see is people pointing at the sky and yelling.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))", "blinking lights, silent, moved rather quickly.I was called outside by a family member of mine, he told me to look at these lights in the sky, we were on the back step when i first saw them, I thought they were planets because they shine bright in the sky, but there was two lights, and they were relatively close to each other, after looking at them they also were blinking like a camera flash, and some time passed and one went to the left, and the other light almost looked like it started to rise up for about five seconds, the light that had went to the left was a good way in front of the rising light, I watched to see where they were going because they were out of my view once they went over the house (silently) and they were both going in the same direction one behind the other in almost a straight line.I went out maybe ten minutes later and saw maybe three more of these lights, all blinking in the sky, they also were going in the direction the others had went.  While all of this had happened there were three planes (clearly planes) that had went through my view also, two in the opposite direction and one went in the direction the blinking lights had went.", "Red/orange glowing ball low on the horizen then climbed until out of sightThis is my second email and third sighting of red light. Object was witnessed by myself and 2 other adults. Object again came from the SE moving NW. What was witnessed at first looked like a full moon behind trees but was a very bright reddish orange color. At this time I ran inside to get my camera and my wife stayed outside and watched. I was inside for no more than 15 seconds to get the camera. When I returned outside the object had gone from approximately 100 - 200 feet to about 500 feet and had lost it&apos;s glow but was now a bright light about as brighter than Jupiter appears in the sky. The object then moved north and climbed to about 1000 feet. sat there for about 2 minutes then climbed until it winked out. This is the third sighting of the object. First was 8/18/08/. second was 8/29/08. and tonight 11/26/08. The pattern I have noticed if you are to take the first two sightings they were 11 days apart. Counting on a calendar by 11&apos;s, 11/26/08 fell on an 11th day. The craft again made no noise. My son living 3 blocks away on a third floor apartment was out on his balcony and called me to tell me he was seeing the object. I didn&apos;t have my cell phone on me and he left me a voice mail saying what he was seeing. The time the message was left was 8:45pm (CST). He saw it before I did because he was higher up and didn&apos;t have an obstructed view as I did with it behind trees. He described it the same as I saw it. The were Three others with him at the time and they also witnessed it.", "A &quot;parked&quot; 737 in the sky accompanied by an orbYesterday morning at around 9 am when I was driving to Huntsville, I saw a stationary 747 or 737 passenger plane parked in the sky about 100 feet above a field just to the right side of the road.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me at first because the car was in motion and I was definitely driving towards the nose of the plane, but as I got closer I realized that it was truly just sitting there parked in the sky. To its right (my left) was an orb dancing around in the sky.  It seemed to reflect the sky on all its &quot;sides&quot; and appeared perfectly round and solid.  It was no bigger than a person would be if they were curled up in a ball. When I realized that it was indeed parked in the sky, I pulled over and snapped a photo with my digital cell phone camera.  It isn&rsquo;t that great but I have it if anyone wants to see it, and I will try my best to get it to sharpen in photoshop, but the actual raw photo taken at 9 am on 1-9-09 is in an email I just sent to this site.  The exact location of the craft was approximately &frac12; mile north of the Toyota plant in Huntsville on Pulaski Pike Rd.  I don&rsquo;t know why it chose this location because there is only a field full of llamas and alpacas, some donkeys, horses and cows.  There is also a stream near by with fish in it.  Maybe it was surveying the area or something I don&rsquo;t know. But after I took the picture I was beside myself.  Back in 2000 when we lived in Texas, the whole family (kids, me, hubby) saw the exact same thing.  A large passenger plane parked in the sky, about the size of a 737 or 747, and it too was parked so low you could see every detail of its wings, engines, windows, paint job.  This one yesterday was painted with a silver grey bottom and orange on the sides (like a Northwestern Airlines plane).  It had no &quot;underbelly&quot; rocket boosters or anything, there was no way in the physical world it could have been hovering because passenger planes that are made to stay in flight while moving at 600 miles an hour simply drop to the ground if they are! motionl ess.About 30 seconds after I parked the car, it started to go away (I guess the occupants saw me?)  It went slow for about 5 seconds then disappeared going in an upwards north easterly direction very fast. Also, the sphere that was dancing around everywhere disappeared.  Oh and the weather for the sighting was perfect, 100% clear sky, no clouds anywhere.  9 am, broad daylight.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere, and quite credible.  We have looked at the photo, taken with a cell telephone, and the objects is reminiscent of a swept-wing airliner.  It is ambiguous, we believe, but the witness has volunteered to send NUFORC the same photo, after it has been &quot;processed&quot; by a photo lab.  PD))", "It was a strange light that was followed by a mysterious noise.On January 7th 2009 at approximately 12:45 A.M. (Eastern Standard Time) I was sitting in my bedroom at my computer desk working on a music project.  There is a window about 2 feet to the left side of my desk which I tend to glance out occasionally.  When I looked out the window I saw a flash of blue, which I initially thought was lightning.  Then It appeared to be getting closer and closer.  About 3-4 seconds later the light fully consumed my bedroom window and my whole room was lit up by this light. I quickly jumped out of my chair and ran into the hallway, closing my bedroom door behind me.  Even when I closed the door and looked back the light had not subsided.  As far as I know the light was there for about 5-10 seconds.  I have seen my share of power lines going down and transformers exploding, but they flash and go out.  This was different than anything I have ever seen. After leaving my room, I immediately went to knock on my sisters door.She came out of her room in a panicked state and said, &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;We both ran downstairs into our moms bedroom and called 911. My sister then explained to me that the sound she heard was like a compressed boom, almost like a shockwave.As a side note I would like to add that 2 nights prior to this occurrence I looked out my window up into the sky and saw a bright light which was flashing red, green and blue. At first I thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but then I realized that the object was not moving. It was not a star and there is no way a helicopter could reach those kinds of elevations. I went to grab my camera which was on my desk and not even 5 seconds later the object was gone. From my window I have a really good view of the nights sky and there is no way a helicopter or plane could have disappeared from sight that quickly.((name deleted))Philadelphia, PA((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be quite serious-minded and credible.

It was a bright blue day not a cloud in the sky. I Was Talking To My Friend On The Phone Lying On My Bed. my bed is against the window running parallel with it.  It was like 10:30 am Sunday morning December seventh 2008. I Happened To Look To My Right Out The Window which is west towards Dunnellon or the golf of Mexico. I Noticed Three Round White Circles That Were Stationary. It Looked Like They Were In A Triangle Formation. Kind of Like The Blue Angles in the air shows. At First My Mind Didn&apos;t Register What I Was Seeing. I Kind of Thought Are Those Stars In The Day Sky? They Were Stationary For About Another Three Or Four Seconds And Then All At Once They Started Pulsating. It Was Like They Were Mirrors Flashing and reflecting The Sun big and Bright And Then small dull White Circles again. It Seemed Like Every Time They Would Stop flashing Big And Bright They Would Shrink Or Implode On Themselves.My Friends Daughter Who Is 13 Happened To Be Over At The Time. She Was On The Computer In The Living Room, So I Excitedly Screamed Come Here Quick, Quick, I Think I See A UFO!!! Well, She Didn&apos;t Run Fast Enough And When She Came To The Window They All Disappeared. I Got Really Mad At Her at first For Not Coming Fast Enough And Missing It. She Kind of Gave Me This Face Like &apos;&apos;whatever&apos;&apos;, so I Told Her To Keep Looking Just In Case And All Of The Sudden They Reappeared. This Time They Got Huge, And Then really, really small again Pulsating And Weaving In And Out Of Each Other. It Was Kind of Like There Was An Imaginary Person Juggling Them In The Sky. I Couldn&apos;t Tell If They Were Changing Size because They Were Actually Changing Size, Or If They Just Were Getting Closer And Moving Further Away At High Speeds. Then They All Went Different erratic Directions But Continued To Pulsate. It was like they were playing a game of tag with one another. This lasted for about five or six minutes until they disappeared again.I kept watching just in case. Well sure enough, two to three seconds later they came back but this time there were only two of them. They were a lot bigger and brighter this time and were flying erratically again. Like it was some kind of a game. There was also a commercial jet going north to south in they sky at the same time that was pretty close. The whole reason I even noticed the plane amongst all the chaos was I thought &apos;&apos;Man, I wonder if the people in the jet can see this also?&apos;&apos; It seemed two be so close to it. Well the craft that was closest to the plane seemed to wait stationary again until the plane passed it by like three or four inches in the sky. as soon as it got just enough away from the plane to build up momentum it shot straight across the sky back in the direction of the plane it let pass. faster then I have seen any other thing fly in my life, but comparable to a fast shooting star. I started screaming oh my god it&apos;s going to hit the back of the plane. Right when it was about to collide with the tail of the plane &apos;&apos;which it had no room for error because I couldn&apos;t really see the sky any more between either object.&apos;&apos; it went straight up at a perfect lateral angle, Excelerated so fast, and then both objects disappeared completely.Know keep in mind I am still on the phone at this time my friend on the line who was almost deff from all the screaming, and the thirteen year old was historical and  in tears. She keep screaming I want to go home know I want my mom know, know, know! I just keep saying I&apos;m so glad I am not the only one who saw it! So I decided to call the local law enforcement being this thing almost hit a plane. But they had not much to say but &quot;It could have been an air show being held today.  My response was &quot;is it a costume for a plane to chase down a commercial jet at an air show?&quot; Especially after 911 right? I lived like not even a Quarter of a mile away from the Dunnellon air port and they fly trick planes all the time. I know they have strict regulations and air spaces. As close as I lived to the air port at the time they were not even allowed two do there tricks over my property. I also living in Florida have seen all kinds of planes, jets, helicopters army air craft of all sorts. again nothing has ever moved like that. Not that speed, not that shape, not that erratic. Not until today. All I can think is UFO.

At approximately 9:30 pm this evening, I witnessed a series of four square lights above the Atlantic Ocean.  They were quite large and were yellow-orange, reminiscent of the color of a candle flame. They were evenly spaced with the two outer squares tapering off slightly as if the panel of lights created one round object.  The image caught my eye due to its gravity in size, its odd height above the ocean, and its very closeness to the shoreline.  The sighting lasted approximately seven to ten seconds before fading into the night sky.  However, the lights were apparent when I glanced over the ocean rather than appearing out of nowhere. The lights remained stationary even while they &quot;winked&quot; out.

Though they all had an orange glow, they also had a dark casted circular appearance around the outside of the shape.........As we zoomed in to see them, one looked more of an egg shape where as another seemed more of a boomerang shape as daft as it sounds, we were zooming in when all of a sudden the light just disappeared, so we ran a little further up the road in order to get closer to the next one as we stood there my daughter spotted another was moving towards us from the far left at the end of the street, at this point we couldnt beleive what we were seeing, having no explanation for this we were obviously quite excited, then another appeared.......They all seemed to be following the others ones previous path, they would get so far up the street, only then they stopped and seemed to turn back and upwards a little,before they stopped again, this could not of been planes of that we are all very sure as they werent that far apart from each other and it was like they were hovering in motion, it was a very calm night, yet there was no engine noise or even propeller sounds, no humming etc in fact nothing at all, seriously it was very silent, the air was echoey, yet to look at they seemed so close, they were very bright to look at beautiful even, until eventually one by one the lights just dissapeared as you would expect if a light was simply switched straight off.....Now on saying that 3 of them actually appeared to be pulsing lights at one point so im not sure if the others did the same before hand, during this time there were also neighbours that had come out onto the street because of all the fuss to see what on earth we were doing only when we pointed it out they were bewilderedand also stopped dead in there tracks, they stood with us watching and taking pictures, one even climbed up onto a wall to get a better look, everyone was very loud and excited by what they saw because it was so unexpected, I mean you hear about it but as the saying goes, you never expect it to happen to you!!!!  I swear to you all now this is the truth with not a word of deception, none of us have any explanation for what we saw and even after there dissapearence we sat in the freezing cold on the wall just waiting to see if anything else happened, though to our dissapoinment it never did, we have all discussed it and firmly beleive between us, that they had to be a type of U.F.O, as none of us have encountered anything even remarkably similar ever and we are all of different ages ranging between 18-50, we would like an explanation if possible but on saying that it has left us all even my very sceptical husband beleiving that aliens or another life form of some type definately does exist for sure...We will be keeping a close watch from now on!!!!", "5 bright gold an red colored lights in arrow formations.

I returned to my upstairs bedroom on the front side of our house, and resumed watching television. I had my bedside window opened approximately 6, though my shades covered the gap.At 2:05 exactly, my (almost 15 year old) daughter and her friend were in a nearby bedroom talking.  Her bedroom faces the rear of our home.  There are no shades or blinds on her windows.  The girls remarked that there must be a storm coming, as there were flashes visible in the upper edges of the windows, and appeared to emanate from the clouds/fog over the house.  They then realized that the flashes were stationary and occurred in fixed intervals.  As the girls looked more closely out the window, they were looking upward.  They noticed that a large dark shape was moving over our 2 story home toward our backyard (west to east).  The dark shape then dipped downward as it moved over the crest of our home toward our backyard (eastward), and was visible below the cloud/fog level, approximately 30 feet off the ground.  As it moved slowly away, it became clear that it was triangular in shape, and had 3 lights along the back, flashing blue, red and green in varying patterns.  The object emitted a low, pulsing hum noise that was audible from the girl&rsquo;s window.  There were no loud or airplane/jet noises, or I would have heard them with my window open. I can only surmise that between my tv and my husband&rsquo;s snoring, I was unable to hear the very low noise.Behind our home is an open field that is used for farming.  It is a large, open area with the nearest houses at least 1/3 a mile away (guessing - not an absolute distance).  There is an old barn within ~200 feet of our home that sits in the southwest corner of the open field.  As the object moved away from our property, it reached the area of the barn and hovered briefly.  It then slowly moved away toward the northeast, and suddenly disappeared.  It appeared to the girls that the object was approximately the width of 2 houses in size.At 2:08am, near the far east edge of the field, 2 similar objects suddenly &quot;winked on&quot; and moved around one another for a brief period.  They appeared to be the same types of objects as the one that moved over our home. Just as suddenly as they appeared, they seemed to &quot;wink off&quot; and disappear.At 2:10am, a new set of flashes were visible over the house, and they were similar in nature to the first set. As the girls watched, a much larger, and louder (humming) object moved over the crest of our home, following the same path that the first one did.  This one appeared identical in every way, with the exception that it was so large that as it dipped over our home, the edges were not immediately visible.  It had to move beyond the barn for the entire object to be seen. It was easily double or more the size of the first object.  As it moved west to east, it slowed over the field, and then slowly seemed to rotate over a fixed area, and remained there for approximately 3-5 minutes.  It was possible to see strobing lights on all 3 corners of the object, but the 3 lights in color were only visible on the &quot;back&quot; edge of the object. As the object sat in place, the 2 objects that had been sighted at 2:08 suddenly lit back up and began to move around, as if in response to the larger object close to our home.  This continued for the last couple of minutes that the large object hovered. With no warning, all three objects just disappeared. It looked as though the smaller objects streaked away to the left and right of the large one, and that the large object lifted straight up, out of sight.The two girls described their thoughts and feelings as though they were transfixed and unable to really do anything but watch.  They debated whether to wake either myself or my husband, but were concerned that they may not be believed, especially after time had passed and no more objects were visible.  The one thing that they did notice was police sirens in the vicinity (I did hear those), and they wondered if they were in any way responding to the objects.The open field is sort of unusual in that it is sort of &quot;land-locked.&quot;  It has very busy roads on 2 sides, and has houses and suburbs on all 4 sides.  If you didn&rsquo;t live next to it, you would not be aware that it is even there.  Considering it&rsquo;s size, that is really unusual.A very short distance from the field, near the south-eastern corner are at least 3 bar/club businesses and a bowling alley, all of which would have closed at 2am.  If anyone was leaving them (this was a Friday pm/Saturday am time period) they should have been within eyesight of  some or all of the objects.  The only variable that I am uncertain of is the cloud cover/fog placement.  Even when the objects were above the cloud/fog line, the rhythmic strobing was visible.I have repeatedly asked questions of my daughter in different ways to verify details (and to a lesser extent her friend - she had to leave), and the story has remained consistent.  I believe her - and that was before I had a chance to read/learn about all the other sightings near our area.  We are very interested in verification of the sightings, and if anyone else saw anything similar.  PLEASE get back with us if you learn anything, or we can do more.[Please Note - Though we don&rsquo;t want it posted publicly, entering our address into Google Maps will show you the field in relation to our home.  In the lower left corner of the field is the barn and a dark, teardrop-shaped pond.]", "oval object moved horizontally across mesa, then vanishedOn Thursday, December 4th, 2008, my husband and I were walking our dog at twilight, 5pm.  My husband teaches elementary school, I am a writer.  Our town sits at the south foot of a 75-foot mesa in Southeast Oregon, and we often see jetliners and their contrails bisecting our skyway.  On this evening we observed a smooth silver oval object flying silently along the top of the mesa.  It moved at a rate slower than a weather satellite or a commercial jet, and left no contrail. We had been looking at the planet Jupiter to the southwest, and commented that this object was larger than that, with a brighter magnitude.  We watched, thinking at first it was a meteor.  But the object traveled horizontally and left no tail. It traveled along the mesa top approximately 300 feet at a steady rate and then vanished, disappeared into a cloudless sky.I then remembered a sighting of a similar object on Thursday morning, January 17th, &apos;08, at 0730.  This object was also a silver oval, and descended at a similar rate of speed behind another mesa to the south of our town.  When I first observed this object it was approximately 300 feet above the horizon, shining like a star, but with smooth margins.I watched as it descended at a slow rate behind the southern mesa, taking about ten minutes to go behind the rim.  I thought it was an odd meteor, dismissed the sight, and went about the day.  At 0830 I was sitting at my kitchen table when I saw the silver object rising again from the same spot, ascend to the same altitude, and vanish from sight, disappear.  The sky was cloudless; there was no wind at that time.", "Craft without normal aircraft lights in Irish skiesAt circa 18.15, I was getting out of my car at a house 5 miles SW of Carlow town ( ie Carlow, Co. Carlow, Ireland ) and observed to the west a rectangular ( slightly fuzzy, dimensions not clearly defined ) craft rising up from beyond a line of beech trees in the West. It was gold/orange/red in color - no sound, no strobe or red/green lights. I would guess it was distant  a 2 &euro; coin held at arm &apos;s length. It moved slowly up along the line of beech trees from west  to the southwest, never going above the top of the trees. I would guess it was 5 miles distant from my initial view point and 2000 feet in the air. As it rose up slowly behind the beech trees  I took some items out of my car into the house i was staying in and was gone for a minute. When I came out it must  have accelerated at unimaginable speed and was visible high up in the SW sky - which was clear of cloud -  and disappeared from view totally within a minute. Shortly after, a commercial jet appeared in the NW with strobe / red and green lights and clear sound of engines high in the sky going E to W. Clearly distinguishable from what I saw. Maybe I saw a helicopter disobeying flight rules but I would surely have heard some noise/seen lights.", "bright lights fast percise in movement no noisethere were six of them very bright round blue and white like led lights. at first they lined up all six for afew seconds then one would turn to the left and the rest would follow to the left . then they would go in circles around each other then back to six in a row then to right and go into circles. then there would be two then three then four then none. i am not sure what we saw over the mountains towards ocean. we have never seen anything like this. no noise and very fast and so bright.", "We were at the sturgis motorcycle rally that year and were sitting out on our deck late at night.

It now seems rather absurd to assume that what I saw had an extraterrestrial explanation. I am sure that I was mistaken. And, as so many helpful people have contacted me over the last 6 months telling me what it was that I saw, I am now inclined to believe that they are right and I am wrong. I can now see that the notion of alien visitation is laughable. It is clear to me that people three thousand miles from the scene of the sighting are more knowledgeable than I am. And, then there is Mr. Davenport, with his light touch and keen wit, who never met a man he couldn&apos;t browbeat or make to feel like a worthless toad. Such a breath of fresh air!

Being outside in downtown Elk Grove, I saw two illuminate orbs similar to stars, but unusually bright to have been stars. I had observed this strange phenomenon for about almost an hour, and from this observation I had noticed that it had not moved one bit from its original position, which in fact looked to be very close to a large, tall, radio station antenna in Elk Grove, observing it at a vantage point about four miles away. The two orbs of light could have been connected to form one spacecraft or separated as two different spacecraft because it had looked like they were in a straight, diagonal line above the ground. The bottom orb was brighter than the top orb as they both were hovering just above the tip of the 15 story-tall antenna; the illuminate orbs being about 100 feet separated from each other.  At the end of the hour, both orbs had disappeared, as I went outside again from my house to check on it.

He compared it to the moon focus which could not totally fit in the scope but when focusing on the bright light it became clearly centered in the middle of the scope and was distinctly a link of round lights making up two seperate rings.In the middle of the inner ring, it appears to be straight lights/beams of light toward the center of the circle.  Kinda of like wedges formed in the center of the ring.  At one point, three lights equally became brighter than the rest.We all witnessed the sighting through the telescope and at first I would say it was the bottom of a huge space craft but not sure if the beams were lights all towards the center of the ring like a gateway.Additionally, for a breif moment towards the end of the sighting, small white dots appeared to be darting to and from the main object.Clouds started to obscure the sighting and I saw a blue flash behind the clouds and when then the object was gone.Tonight, returning from dinner, the bright light was seen from the front of our home and when we went to use our telescope, the clouds blocked the vision again.

I thought that it was the sun reflecting off of a airplane cruising eastward.  I pointed it out to my group.  As it got overhead, I could not make out the shape of an airplane.

When they got overhead and the reflected light no longer reached us, the object(s) disappeared.  No contrail was present.I said, &quot;Hey look, it&apos;s a UFO!&quot;  But deep down, I really thought it was possibly a satellite or the ISS in orbit.

The lights were visible through his back patio door, which faces east with about 15 miles of visibility into the horizon.  The object was hovering about 1.5 miles off of the ground and was about 3 miles away.  It was over a residential neighborhood.  Initially, I thought that it was a reflection of Christmas lights through the patio door from a neighbor&rsquo;s house across the street.  We opened the patio door and observed the object, which emitted no sound and what looked like white lights coming in towards the object.  The object changed shape from a distorted diamond shape, to oval, to circular, to arms of light outstretching from the middle to one giant ball of bright light.  We witnessed colors such as blue, green, amber, red, purple, and almost every color of the rainbow coming from the object.  The light patterns were completely erratic and random with no steady pattern.  The image maintained position for about 15 minutes but changed shapes and colors frequently.  As earlier stated, there were white balls of light that looked like they were being sucked towards the object and at that moment, above our heads, a comet shot in the direction towards the object.  This comet was low and extremely bright, and unlike any I have ever seen.  We went into the house and turned out all of the lights and watched the object change formations.  Then, it just started disappearing into the east, like it was being sucked up into a vacuum tube.  The momentum seemed very quick, and within a second, it was gone.  We sat there in amazement, trying to figure out what we just saw.  As we were watching the sky, the object came back in the same sucking type motion back towards the west.  The patterns, such as color and shapes, remained the same erratic pattern as before, but the object was higher into the sky.  It stayed for only about 7 minutes this time, and then disappeared in the s! ame fash ion as before.  After disappearing the second time, the object did not return.

Was outside to see if there were any early meteors, facing the direction from which they were supposed to arise.  It was only about 12:30 a.m., too early to expect to see anything much.Then low, just on the horizon, I saw a bright light.  I remember thinking, &quot;wow, this is going to be a heck of a meteor shower,&quot; when two boomerang-shaped things - one slightly &quot;ahead&quot; of the other but in tight formation, flew over.  The 2 objects crossed the entire sky, from the horizon to a point directly overhead and then over my building (disappearing from my view) in about 1.5 seconds... maybe it was 1 second...  maybe 2.

I pointed it out to my sister and we began discussing how that could be possible.  I said that it couldn&apos;t be a star, because the axis of the earth doesn&apos;t move fast enough to change our viewpoint on stars overnight. As we were talking about this, the object moved sideways very quickly in the sky, and the light started dimming, until it looked as if it were trying to mimic a star.  We kept looking at it and were in disbelief, when suddenly the light went completely off, leaving only a faint reddish-blue point in the sky.

Brightly shaped craft has been observed by many co-workers for about 3-4 months off and on. Last night 12/29/2008 at approximately 20:00 hrs.

They were hovering in the Southern, Southwestern, and Northwestern sky separated from one another of about 2-10 miles apart as a best guess.  At these heights I would guess they could have been the size of a commercial airliner if not smaller.  Obviously they were not, nor exibited typical flying aeronautics of Earthly aircraft. Considerly the earth rotates along with the moon moving, these craft were observed at different heights as well as different locations throughout the evening.

I remember calling out, &quot;I do not have anything in my hand.&quot;  The voice said again, &quot;DROP THE TUNUG.&quot;I started running.

I will always serve you no matter what, so PLEASE help me.&quot;  I remember this horrible pain going through my legs, and I fell to the ground.I heard a clicking noise.I remember someone walking up to me. They put handcuffs on me. I was told to get up, and not to move, or I would be shot with a taser.I know a LOT about tasers. I remember that I was taken to a building.It was a building, that i had never seen before.When I got in, I heard the building making a low pitched humming noise, and there were several machines with lines, and other thangs going across their screen.I was told to sit down.I sat down in a little chair which had several buttons and cranks on it.I saw a red button that said, &quot;For emergencies only.&quot;  I remember I was told to sit and be quiet or I would be tased again.I complied.I was hooked up to a pulse oximeter, which monitored my oxygen levels, and a mask was put on my face.I remember them saying my oxygen was VERY low.I was taken to a little room, and was hooked up to an EKG machine which beeped to my heartrate.I was then told to put my face up against this machine.I remember my Mom had told me before NEVER to look into something unless I knew what it was.I refused to do as I was commanded.They tased me again.I told them that I was going to do whatever my Mom said, and that I WOULD NOT do that.I was told that if I did not do what they said I would be put in a green light.They said the green light would not just flash.It would shock me.I did NOt put my face up to the machine.You see I am visually impared, and I have to have A LOT of tests, and i am VERY curious when it comes to tests, but I resisted my curiousity.I was taken into a room, and placed in a little machine.I prayed, and as I was in the machine I sang praises to God who I KNOW would help deliver me from this machine.I saw a green light come on.Someone outside of the light screamed.I remember someone grabbing me, and taking me out of the light, and they told me that if I did NOT do what they said, I would be tased.I was then unhooked from the machines.I was taken outside and told that I was free to go.They put this blue light on me, and everything went black from there.I then remember waking up in the craft again, and was told that I was going to have a device called a tunug used on me.They hooked something up to the wall, and I heard this LOUD noise.It sounded like a machine that is used in the eye Drs.

So I went to my parents house down the road where I was headed anyway but when I got them to come outside it wasn&rsquo;t in sight from there house and that&rsquo;s where it ended.

I then thought either military jet or shooting star, but the light kept getting brighter and brighter then started to move in the southern direction.  As it was moving south the light became dimmer and dimmer until all that was seen was a small black object.  Almost as if something had a thruster attached to it?   About 5 seconds after the dark object had dissapeared, I saw an object for a brief second much further south than where this object was first seen.

The sighting originally took place as we were driving down Ocean Avenue in Northport,Suffolk County Long Island. Whenever we drive down that road, which is practically every night, I always look out at the view because it overlooks the water and is very scenic and beautiful. I was startled immediately by it because it was very unusual and there isn&apos;t a huge amount of plane traffic especially in that area. It appeared to be very very bright shining lights in the sky. I was unsure at first whether or not they were some kind of man made lights on some kind of building because of how bright they are but I know the location and there are only residential homes in the area beneath the road by the water and the lights were clearly not a part of anything. I pointed them out to my fiance who was driving and he couldn&apos;t tell what they were either. It did not look as if they were in any precise formation. They all seemed very close up, way to big and bright to be stars and definitely not planes. They seemed to hover or stay in one place. They were at all different heights in the sky, some lower some higher but in the immediate vicinity of one another. As we continued to drive I could continue to see one in the sky. We drove from Ocean Avenue to 25A and when we stopped at a light at the corner of Waterside and 25A there was that one huge bright light still visible in the sky. I frequently look up at the night sky and admire the stars and watch planes, it is something that has always stunned me. This was definitely NOT a plane. In fact there seemed to be quite a few planes in the sky which added to my suspicion that it was something unexplainable. Seeing the light in comparison to the planes really showed me how distinctly different it was. When we stopped at the light I wanted to make sure it wasn&apos;t moving, that it was hovering or stationary. I wa! tched it for about 30 seconds between two tree branches to see if it was moving even slightly. It seemed to stay in place perfectly and maybe move very very slightly to either side. It was shining like nothing I have ever seen in the sky almost like it was a light that was rotating or oscillating. I then called my sister and parents who live right up the road in Fort Salonga. They kept asking me to take a picture of it but whenever I would try to with my cellphone the quality was so poor that it did not look like anything significant. I was able to take a video of it on my phone but again it looked barely visible and it was very frustrating. As we continued to drive I lost sight of it but then it was visible again when we were driving down the Sunken Meadow state parkway. We pulled into our friends neighborhood in Commack Ny and the one bright light was STILL visible outside of his home. We told him to take a look at it and he said that he has noticed it before but couldn&apos;t tell us what it was. When we went inside I could see it through his bedroom window and I noticed an extremely low flying plane in the sky while we were looking at it. ( Maybe trying to also see what it was?). I did not look out the window for about 15 minutes or so because my fiance was having a panic attack or feeling really anxious for no apparent reason. When I looked out again it was totally absent from the night sky. My mother called my Grandmother who lives in Ridge Ny which is about 20-30 miles East of where we were and she also spotted it in the sky. The whole experience/sighting lasted about an hour and it was visible from a pretty impressive radius throughout Long Island. There are six witnesses I know of who have seen this particular light in the sky. I wanted to report this to see if possibly anyone else had noticed anything bizarre or strange. I have a very poor quality video of it on my cell phone but it is not distinctive and it looks so small on tape when it was so massive in real life. I am guessing this is due to the quality! of the lens and camera on the phone. I wish I could have gotten better recorded proof but 6 people throughout four different towns saw it so I am at least glad I wasn&apos;t alone in seeing it. It did not seem to be descending or moving around at all. When I originally saw the 4 to 5 other lights I lost track of them behind the trees and only the one light was visible the duration of the sighting. My fiance does suffer from anxiety but we were fine the entire way there and I thought maybe there could be a correlation between him feeling that way and what was in the sky. We had no car troubles and I only saw a white light. My mother claims that while she was watching it it was changing colors but I did not notice that. Since there were more than one maybe it is possible that she was looking at something different than I was. She said she thought it could maybe be a star dying but that wouldn&apos;t explain how many I originally saw and the light was so bright.", "high speed red/blue lights extremely fast and maneuverable with the ability to disappearA blue light with a red tail shot out of the sky down to a field, stopped and appeared to land then shot straight up and disappeared.

She stays very close to the airport, so I am completely used to seeing airplanes flying close overhead and am quite familiar with what an airplane looks like, how they fly, how fast, etc.  I was driving along a road called Airport Dr. where planes normally fly over the road to land on the landing strip nearby.I saw what at first I assumed to be a plane about to land considering it was quite low to the ground.  At first I was worried, because although it still had a good stretch to go before landing, it was lower to the ground than the planes I normally see preparing to land.  I watched it as I drove along, waiting for it to fly overhead to it&apos;s assumed destination (the landing strip).  However, it never flew overhead.  There were still a couple other cars on the road at that time.  Then as I continued to drive, eventually I was alone on the roadway, which is when I began to panic, because that&apos;s when I realized that the craft seemed to be following me (although not completely obviously).  It was dark, so I couldn&apos;t see anything but it&apos;s lights, which where 3 white lights in what looked like a triangular formation.  I started to freak out when I realized that the way it was flying was not anything a plane could be capable of.  It was following alongside the road, too close overhead to be a plane but not close enough to get a really good look.   It was also slightly behind me and to the left, so I had to keep turning my head back to see it, than to the road again.  I turned on to Marine Dr. where it continued to follow me.   At this point, I was scared ((deleted)) and going at least 20-30 mph over the speed limit, nearly vearing off the road several times.Finally after what seemed like forever, but considering the distance I will guess was probably around 5 minutes or less, the lights/craft seemed to separate slighty as it sped off very quickly.  As it did this I noticed at least one, possibly more, red light(s) as a glanced as it sped off.Basically the most frightening experience I have ever had, and I never want anything like that to happen to me ever again.", "15 Glowing orange orbs slowly travel across the los angeles sky then disapearSaturday December 13th I was driving on the 101 heading east around the Balboa exit at 11:30pm when I noticed brake lights coming on in front of me.

As the helicopter flew past I noticed what I thought was a large swept-wing aircraft flying south to north. It was much further away than the helo, at a much higher altitude. It was also moving south to north. As I began to concentrate on it, it became clear it was not a single aircraft. It was a formation of maybe ten to twelve white or shiny objects. The edges of the objects were not clearly defined,but appeared to be round or oval in shape.As the formation moved to the north it began to change shapes. The objects would form a line and then transition to a circular formation and back to a v-type formation. I thought maybe it was a flock of birds, but based on the perceived distance from my location(maybe one mile), they were moving too fast. The formation began to move in slightly different directions, even stopping at one point.  The changes of direction were not drastic, but certainly enough for me to notice. The objects moved in a very &quot;mechanical&quot; fashion in that the movements were smooth yet deliberate (if that makes sense).Weather conditions were clear and sunny except for some faint remnants of morning fog.  I eventually lost sight of the formation in a low-lying cloud north of my home.  I tried to point out the formation to my wife, but she could not see it.

There was a low, fog layer, with the base about 300 feet above our head. The object was directly beneath it. It was also lighting up the fog above it.

Looks like what could best be described as whitish headlight beams but facing outward at all times as if something was rotating.  I continued to watch for about 10 minutes and it didn&apos;t move at all from the spot where it originally was (like as if rotating towards something) but stayed circling the same exact spot in the sky.This is my second time seeing something like this, but the first time (about a month or so ago) it was about 15 miles north of here.  Like now, I had stepped out to get a cigarette and it was just circling just above the clouds right next door to the north of my position.I am unsure on duration, as with both instances the phenomenon had already started when I stepped out and was still continuing when I had to go inside.

There were quite a few ice fishermen out on Lake Owasso but most people were in their ice houses. The sky was cloudy as is typical in winter, except that the horizons were clear just a little over the tree tops. I was facing west and my buddy west/northwest. As we stood around talking, something caught my eye just above us and to the south. I looked up expecting to see a shooting star. Instead it was a green-ish/blue-ish egg shaped light streaking through the clouds. It lasted for about three seconds and then vanished. I initially thought that it was a shooting star because of the speed that the light moved across the sky. I immediately concluded that it was not a shooting star because the dense clouds overhead prohibited our view of any stars. Winter clouds in Minnesota are low to the ground and shooting stars occur high in the atmosphere.The light appeared to be the size of a large airplane (like a military cargo plane) but it was tough to gauge its size because it was hard to judge distance between the clouds and the ground.After initially thinking that the light was a shooting star, my next conclusion was that it was a flare. However, the light was much bigger than a flare, and was traveling horizontally at a constant rate and altitude. Flares also don&rsquo;t travel as fast as a shooting star. The light also did not look like any flare that I&rsquo;ve ever seen and was not red or white.The light was moving just inside of the clouds. I could see bits of cloud between myself and the light. This makes me think that it wasn&rsquo;t a flash light, strobe, or other projection onto the clouds since that type of light would not penetrate the clouds. It would reflect off of the clouds and not appear to be inside of the clouds as this light happened to be. It also did not have any of the normal attributes of northern lights, and appeared in the sky just to the south of our position.There was no noise created by the light, no trail of clouds or exhaust, and it disappeared just before reaching a clearing in the clouds. I suppose that it could have been some sort of bright gas ball, but I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like that before. This light shot through the clouds and seemed to have defined edges (egg-shaped). The light never changed direction, speed, or altitude that I could tell. It just vanished at a certain point.I can&rsquo;t say that it was a craft of any sort because all that we saw was a fast moving light. Instantly though, we both knew that we had seen something odd. I don&rsquo;t have an explanation for what we saw but can describe it quite well. My fishing buddy saw it for the last second or so and couldn&rsquo;t come up with a good explanation for what we saw either.", "Unexplained object in photograph of the skyI took photographs in my friend&apos;s back garden while on holiday in Los Angeles.

It was also at a very low altitude and made noise.  It was right over our house,so I ran to get my camera but by that time it was blocked by houses.  Then I saw it over some houses in the east far from where it was not 5 seconds before, so I ran out front to get a picture of it.  I was able to but it was far away.

I position myself at a Tungku Beach facing the hotel from far so that I can frame the fireworks and the hotel all in one frame. When I was there and the fireworks exploded and I started firing shots with my camera using a cable release connected to my Canon EOS 5D digital camera + Canon 70-200MM F2.8 IS (L) lens and a Manfrotto tripod stand. The firework started exactly 12.00AM (+0800GMT) at The Empire Hotel and Country Club and lasted for about 20-30 minutes. Without checking my LCD screen on my camera as most of the shots were burst frames, I left the area. When i was processing the RAW images captured from the camera I realise there was one shot which had something appearing on the left side of the screen so I zoomed in to see what it was. I was shocked! In the image, the object seemed to be hovering above the water and it looks as if it&apos;s not too far away from us. Strangely...the object wasn&apos;t being seen with my naked eye when I was there. Thousands of people gathered around the same area to view the fireworks. If i were to see it , probably the others would have saw it too however it wasn&apos;t visible as it was quite dark from our view.

We watched the light for about ten other minutes. It changed it&apos;s postion several times.  It lowered it&apos;s altitude and then would slowly raise back, it also slowly floated back and forth across the sky. Then a plane flew by and it dimmed itself rapidly, when the plane past it grew very bright.  I thought this was caused by the cloud cover but at that moment it was in a clear patch of sky.

I would also like to preface my report by saying that over the past few months, I have taken more of an active interest in the UFO phenomenon and its associated conspiracy theories. I find myself looking more into the skies as my belief system is changing as more and more reliable sources and disclosers are coming forward. Also in this report, I make no speculation as to what I might have seen; it is simply a report of my observation at the time.On Friday, November 21 at approximately 7:30 pm, I and my wife were driving to Seattle from the Eastside. We were driving east on I-90 across the floating bridge between Mercer Island and Seattle. The skies were clear that evening and the brightest stars were appearing. On such on occasion, I look more carefully into the skies. I was driving and my wife was riding. I noticed the heavy flight traffic as many airliners were landing with a southerly approach to SeaTac airport over downtown Seattle.As I was watching the planes come in, I noticed that in the approximate vicinity of the airport, at about 10 o&rsquo;clock from my perspective somewhere between 35 and 40 degrees in the sky, I noticed a reddish light strobing slowly on and off (at intervals of 1-2 seconds on, 1-2 seconds off).  I could make out no discernible shape, and it seemed very far away, perhaps over the airport, but extremely high in the sky (I noted the object relative to the altitude of incoming aircraft).  It was a static object and reminded me of the red strobes of construction cranes.  However, there are no cranes in that direction and it was impossibly high in the air for a land-based construction.  My impression was that it was unlikely a helicopter, because relative to the air traffic it was higher than any helicopter flight I had witnessed.The drive across the bridge, on which I had a great view (traffic was light that evening, allowing me to look around a bit).  I kept watching for the two minutes across the bridge.  Once in Seattle, we made our way (5-7 minutes) to Capitol Hill where we parked and went to a concert.  Once out of the car, I could see at one point along the streets that the red blinking light was still in place.I did not mention it to my wife as I wanted to think through it before blurting out what I saw.  Today, we happened to meet a friend and the topic of UFO&rsquo;s came up, which brought the memory back.  I decided to report my impressions hoping that others might have seen the same thing.  It was early enough and clear enough skies that there would have been plenty of opportunity for others to see the same thing.

During the Halftime Home coming events on the field I witnessed a 2 foot diameter orb traveling horizontally from north to south over the field.  The object was not like the 2 dimensional translucent orbs seen in most pictures after development.  This object was a solid 3d Sphere, not a light.  Its color was a bluish green.  It was traveling between 80 and 100 mph. The entire sighting lasted a little over 2 seconds. It traveled over the eastern hatch marks on the field and was slightly lower than the Field Lights. Nearly ever person was focused on the Homecoming court down on the field. Upon seeing the orb I immediately notified my friends. Two of the three were able to see the orb before it rapidly faded out of site. The object had very sharp defining edges no blurs or fuzziness, the inside seemed to be made of plasma, it was not extremely bright and flew in a perfectly strait and flat trajectory. The most interesting part of the story came later.The next day upon seeing my neighbor in his yard I related the events of the previous night. To my shock he had a story of his own. He told me on the night in question at app. 1:30am He and his wife was up late watching TV, when all of a sudden he had an urge to get up and walk outside. He claims he had not heard or seen anything to make him go out. As he proceeded outside his wife also followed suit. They were both drawn to look westward towards my house.  An oak tree stood just south of the southwest corner of my house. Upon first looking toward the southwest corner of my house they saw nothing, then a small solid orb about 1-1/2 to 2 feet in diameter came floating out from either my bedroom wall or behind the west wall of my house.  The orb floated up into the oak tree maneuvering around the large branches.  After a few seconds the orb floated clear of the tree then stopped perfectly still app. 35 feet off the ground as if to let them get a good look at it. Then all at once it flew upward and away in a southwest direction at a very high rate of speed until it could no longer be seen. I asked the wife if she had got up to follow the husband outside, and she said No, she had been drawn by a mysterious urge of go outside also. These are professional college educated people. The only discrepancy between their two stories was the color of the orb. He said it was bluish, she said it was greenish. I saw it as blue green. The orb made no sound and left no visible trail. There is nothing openly known in the industrial or military complex that can fly with no open ports or wings that we currently know of. The orb is particularly similar to the orb recorded on NASA TV  STS Mission 37. Only the color is different.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Eventually, a majority of my family had made it to the top of the boat and were conversing while a still gazed at the sky.  Although many individuals in my family had been drinking that night, I had not been. A fireworks show had just ended and as I continued looking at the stars, I saw what I assume was a satellite moving across the night sky.  At the instant I let a breath out to tell my family to look at the satellite a grey object slowly flew over my field of vision which was much closer.  It was directly over the boat and was moving south.  The object was triangular in shape (more like an elongated crescent) and was completely silent. At this time, all the members who were on the boat were looking at the object, as my Aunt stated she thinks it&apos;s a bird.

She asked me to come look at this.  I looked up and saw what looked like bright stars moving from northwest to southeast across my night sky. She pointed out three of the lights in the middle of the group that were moving in a diagonal row.  There were scattered clouds that night moving west to east. The lights just kept coming and coming. There had to be at least a hundred of these lights in all. They were all moving at the same speed and direction, maintaining the same distance from each other, across the night sky. The lights were slightly different in colors and brightness, some were pure white and bright, some were slightly orange-red, and some were blue-white. To us they all appeared to be at the same altitude moving swiftly, taking over a full minute to cross over our entire night sky. It was just amazing how many of them there were, and the speed they must have been going. I&rsquo;ve seen many satellites in the past moving across the night sky and these lights were moving at twice the speed of them. Once the fleet had moved past us there were no more lights trailing behind.The next morning I thought about the three stars that my wife had pointed out to me when I had first joined her outside. Then it hit me, Orion, the constellation of Orion, the belt!  That night I showed her the constellation of Orion in the sky; I asked her if anything looked familiar?

All of a sudden i saw an extremely bright light in the sky ahead of me all of a sudden shooting down diagonally extremely fast. to me it seemed like it was a white dot of light that all of a sudden popped out of the sky and immediately shot down towards the ground. i could not see where excatly it landed or anything because it shot down and went behind this hill hill in the distance. When i first saw it my first insticnt was that it was like maybe  firework but i quickly realized that it could not be because fireworks go up, then i thought maybe it was some sort of missle but i dont think that i would not have seem something as bright as that coming from higher up in the sky because i just saw it pop out of nowhere. then i started to think. after around 30 seconds i said &quot;wait hold on.. did u guys see that???&quot; and immediatelly my girlfriend said &quot;yeah, what was it?&quot; then i said &quot;i dont know what did you see&quot;  and according to her she saw a bright white line coming from the sky diagonally but she says she only saw it with her perifiral vision. i assume that it was a bright dot that was moving so fast that it seemed like a line coming down diaginally in a perfecly straight line. i knew that it could not be lightning because when i got out of the car i looked up at the sky and saw that it was a very clear night without a cloud in sight. also it could not have been lightning becuase it was way to bright. and also lightning comes down straight to the ground  but this came down diagonally  and in a straight line. I know that it was not a shooting star either becuase i have seen many and this was way brighter and bigger than a star and faster. after that we were all pretty s! cared an d confused.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

There was no indication of an upward projectory and the whole incident was much larger than a flare incident.  after the light burnt out, the vapor trail was still very  much obvious.  this also indicated to me that the object was much bigger than a flare from a flare gun.  this display took place in what I thought might be an Army training area near Delta Junction which is also south of Fairbanks.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The light looked white, and was not moving. I watched it for about 5 minutes to make sure it was not moving. Then i went inside my house to get my girlfriend to come take a look at it also. It was very cold so we went back inside and I checked on it again about 15 minutes after I first seen it. It was still there but it was getting pretty cloudy and the light was getting dimmer, I am not sure if it was the clouds making it dimmer. But when i went to look if it was still there about 30 minutes after i first seen it, it was not there. But it was really cloudy by then, so i think maybe the clouds was hiding it. The reason i find this light to be so interesting is because this is not the first light I seen like this. Sorry my computer does not have Microsoft word any more. Around this time of year, last year I seen a light just like this one, only this one was close and i knew exactly where it was. I lived by a Mountain i use to run up all the time, it has those towers with red lights that blink at night. One night around 3 a.m. at night i went outside to have a smoke, and right above those towers there was a huge bight white light. I say its huge because it looked way closer then this last one I seen, but i did not think &quot;UFO&quot; at that time. But I knew that there is no reason a light like that should be there at that time of night. It took me about 10 minutes to finish my smoke, but i watched a little longer to see if it would move. By then I knew this was not normal and wanted to go grab my cell phone to get it on camera, so i could show my girlfriend and others. So I went inside my house to get it all the way down stairs, and went back out and it was still there. I was able to get it on video, I could of went on forever but i can only send 15 seconds of a clip to my girlfriend that lived in Minnesota at the time. I sent it to her, but the light was very smal! l on my cell phone cam and did not look like anything i was looking at. Now since I watch UFO Hunters I know these type of lights are while known, and would like to know what it is i am seeing. I wish I knew what I know now or i could of simply called 911 and drove over to that light and got really close to it. The one that i just now seen looked pretty far away and I did not want to drive in the ice we got out here. This one I don&apos;t really know what it could have been since it looked so far away, I am thinking maybe a planet may have been really close, but I don&apos;t know. The other light I seen was a &quot;UFO&quot; for sure. But I will keep watching maybe I will be lucky and see a light like my first one. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?

It simply vanished.August 1979 Late evening XXXX ((deleted)) Street Wenatchee, WA, 98801  I was sitting on my front step just before full darkness facing due north when I happened to look up and saw an UFO passing directly overhead, traveling north.  The object appeared to be metallic silver in color, triangular in shape, basically flat underneath with clearly visible joints and rivets.  Also visible underneath were what appeared to be either lights or portholes lit from within.  Nothing was visible inside.The object was extremely large and appeared to be quite close.  A line of poplar trees to my left rose nearly 150&rsquo; from the ground and the object cleared them all, blocking out nearly the entire starlit sky.As for speed, the object was very slow. It took seven or eight seconds to disappear from view behind a row of trees across the street.  A jet liner could not have stayed airborne at such a sedate rate of speed.  I have seen 747&rsquo;s up close in flight and this object was much larger and more massive.  There was no discernable fuselage, no wings or other protruding control devices evident.There was absolute silence, as the object passed overhead; no sound whatsoever came from the ship nor did its passing disturb tree tops or leaves.My immediate thought was that a monstrous crash was imminent, as a significant natural obstacle lay in its path and without accelerating soon, that huge ship was going to plow into Birch Mountain, immediately north of the Wenatchee River.No crash occurred. The object, once out of my line of sight, for all intents and purposes, had simply vanished.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I noticed two bright lights on what appeared to be a very large, low-flying plane that, based upon the light positions, seemed to be making such a turn that its wings were vertical. In specific terms, I would estimate that the object was no higher than two hundred yards above the ground.However, as we turned right from the stoplight, and I was able to get a better view of the object, I noticed that it had not been turning, and that the effect of vertical wings had actually derived from the positioning of two of the lights with one closer to me than the other. As I looked attempted to observe the object better, which was difficult considering how dark it was, I noticed a third light, completing a triangular shape.At this point I exclaimed to my friend, who was driving the car, about the object. He took a very quick glance, and assumed that it may have been a bomber plane. As unlikely as that would have been, what completely ruled out that possibility was that fact that the object had not moved throughout the two minutes that I had seen it at this point.So we continue to drive, while I am watching the object, waiting for it to move and at the very least do away with certainty that it was a non-human object (I knew as a fact it was not a helicopter). However, as we approached yet another stoplight between a mile-and-a-half and two miles from the first stoplight, my friend decided that he would have a look at the object himself. He took a quick glance back, and said something to me, at which moment I took my sight away from the object to respond to him. We had a very brief transaction of words, and upon looking back at where the object was we found it no longer visible.The area that the object was over was that of a neighborhood, which was bordered on one side by a construction zone. At first I thought that maybe the lights were from a crane or construction lights from the frame of a multiple-story building that was being worked upon during the early hours. However, returning home that evening I noticed that not only were there no cranes, but the building that was being built only had about five floors. Large cranes for such a small building would be unnecessary, and the building itself was not tall. At least, not tall enough to match the height of the object I saw in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

From a bright red to a green,orange,purple then blue. From where we were the object seemed to be a sphere and kept a spherical shape even as it changed size and color but when I first seen the object as I stated it was a bright red and  I guess then it was about the size of a dime on the horrizon but when changed to green it got smaller to about half the size of a dime then it went to a amber-orange color it expanded to about the size of a half dollar on the horrizon then it turned to a brilliant violet-purple and it went to the smallest size witch was about the size of a BB then the last color was again a very beautiful brilliant blue and then was just a little bigger than the BB sized purple and that was what it looked like as it went up through the clouds the color was so bright that as it went through the clouds it also lit up the surrounding clouds. But as it was moving upward and changing colors and size it made a few really fast zig-zag moves then went straight up through the clouds. All of this sighting happend in a matter of 45 seconds to a minuite after pulling the car of the road.But what I think is really strange and you will too is that in 1992-93 me my father and my sister whitnessed an object exactly like the one I saw last night. And it was very near the same place just back in 92-93 my family and I saw it from a different location witch was on Fish Hatchery Rd. in Gaston,SC  but a good mile from my then home the object hovered and changed size and color but what is interesting is that then it was over a area that is the Lexington County Lanfill and when we saw the object last night it was over the same landfill my girlfriend and I were just on the hwy 6 side of it but back in 92-93 my family and I were exact oppisite on Fish Hatchery Rd. side.Now there have been for years talk in the community that there may be Millitary Weapon Sylos on the Landfill complex witch I guess is about ten miles squared in a heavily wooded area. I really do not know if there may be missiles or nukes or any other thing there that anyone or anything may find interesting on this landfill property but I know what I saw and this is the second time I have saw it above this area and whatever it was it must have been interested in something there. Both times I got this feeling that whatever this thing was intelligance was there.

I race off road dirt bikes and was checking the weather report for the Madison, Florida area on March 7, 2008, at 4:40 pm ET. I was looking to see if the area was going to get some rain; since we as a whole hate it when a race is dusty. I found this radar image that one can find on www.weather .com.   I put the map &quot;in motion&quot; and there was a section of movement that had this &ldquo;straight line&rdquo;, in like two or three frames.It caught my eye and I was like what the heck was that, so I paused the motion and advanced it frame by frame till the image came up. I say a straight line cause it was &quot;more straight than a cloud clearing of sorts,&quot; and low and behold there is this line that looks as if something flew through the cloud and made a trail. The end of the trail is round and looks as if the clouds move away from the end in uniform distance.  I first thought that it must be a jet fighter or something coming out of the military base, that I think is up there, but then I start to think about the scale of which the radar image is covering.It is this thought that makes me wonder to myself what I have I have a picture of, I mean the radar image is in the middle of the slider scale which scans in and out from I guess ; city view all the out to multiple counties.  I have the scale in the middle when I printed the image. I have shown it to friends and no one has a clue as to what it might be.I know weather can take on any form and it can take shapes that make us as people go huh, but this image is, in my opinion not a clearing of natural origin, but more of a picture of a wake so to speak. I would be happy to email a picture of it if can get it to scan clearly.Well in conclusion, it could be said that it is an airplane, but some one would have to prove to me the scale of the radar image is that small and show me other weather radar pictures of airplanes that have been imaged and recorded.  I feel for know that this is an unidentifiable flying object that has been picked up on a weather radar loop swing.Other questions that cross my mind are 1) how fast does a radar loop move and how many frames does it take to make one loop swing. This entire image lasted for three frames at most, before it was not visible in the radar loop  &quot;in motion.&quot;Thanks and get back to me via my email if you would like to see the printed out color copy of the image", "Close observation of hovering saucer shaped craft about 75&apos; above the ground.I was 10 years old in 1967.

The sky was very dark with high cloud cover.  We live in a semi rural location with very little light polution.  At first I thought it was a plane, however, it was a very strong orange glow with no other lights evident and no flashing lights.  It also appeared to be travelling quite fast.  I ran into my house and asked my wife, 2x adult children, and 2 x family friends to come out and look.  I had guessed the object would need to be observed from the rear of our property due to its speed and direction of travel.We observed the object travelling west initially and then it appeared to travel in a north westerly direction.

I am from Hawaii, born and raised, my family and I moved from the big island in 2000.  I was visiting the big island on university  winter break from WWU during my freshman year of college.  I was staying at a friends house in the Agricultural lots above Keaau.   We were swimming in my friends backyard pool and playing around.  I pushed myself out of the water and lay on the edge of the pool on my back.  There were almost no clouds in the sky that day that I can remember.  It was 3 in the afternoon, super hot and sunny.  On my back, I was getting a little blinded by the sun shining in my eyes, so I put my hand up to block the sun from my eyes.  We were just chilling and after a short while I noticed there was something in the sky not far from the sun.   With outstretched arms in front of me blocking out the sun,  I could see something 2-3 inches from the sun(not literally, but 2-3 inches from where the edge of my hand was blocking out the sun).  The first thing I thought was &rdquo;this is unusual, the sun is really, really bright right now, how can I see this thing right next to the sun?&rdquo;  I told my friend about it who was on the deck as well.  He looked up and saw it, and didn&rsquo;t know what to think.  We both yelled to our friends and family in the house to come outside and see the UFO.  My friends parents came out, but didn&rsquo;t spend long looking up and couldn&rsquo;t see anything.  Me and my friend watched it for a while, it did not move at all.  As we were looking we could almost see the detail of the thing.  It looked super big, but really far away.  You could see that it was either made of light at times or was metallic and reflective.  It would kind of shine like a star, reflecting light, but you could see that it was metallic like as well, definitely round looking, could have been saucer shaped but was too far away to tell and we were seeing only the underside.  The really weird part is this:  after around 5 minutes of watching this thing, I asked my friend if he had ! binocula rs or a telescope.  He said he had binoculars in his car.  He ran to get them as I was still on my back keeping an eye on this thing.    The whole time he is looking for and bringing these binoculars I was watching it.   He returns 30 seconds later, and he hands them to me while I&rsquo;m on my back, hand it the air blocking the sun, with my eyes on the object.  I put the binoculars to my eyes and try to focus to find the object but I could not find it. All the while my  friend is asking me what I see.  Nothing through the binoculars, so I put them down to try and find the object with my eyes.  I couldn&rsquo;t find it after that.  It had disappeared right when my friend gave me the binoculars, not before or after.  We were unable to find the object after that.  Pretty weird, something was watching us that day!  I am Hawaiian Chinese and Caucasian, grew up on the big island, went to Keaau and waiakea public schools.  I graduated high school in 2000 and was attending WWU in Bellingham WA at the time.  I have graduated since then and am in Bellingham WA with my family at the moment. We have known each other  since we were 7 years old.

I was looking out the back seat window and was sitting behind the driver.I happened to notice something just out of the corner of my eye and turned to look at it more fully.  At first I thought I was seeing some sort of reflection in the window, so I adjusted the way I was sitting.  It didn&rsquo;t change.  It was still there.I watched it for maybe 2 or 3 seconds in total before it disappeared.  It was a silver/chrome colored, highly reflective/metallic, circular shaped object in the sky.  It was moving completely parallel to the ground at a decent rate of speed, since it seemed to be keeping up with us.It did not appear to be a traditional air craft since it was the wrong shape, there were no additional lights, it was flying too low considering there was no airport near us, and it was completely silent.  I noticed no additional noises of any sort and my experiences with airplanes and helicopters when they are close by has lead me to believe they are normally quite loud.Just when I had determined that this might not be something normal, the object reached a patch of trees and vanished.  I say it vanished because the trees were completely bare.  So even if the object had simply gone behind the trees, I should have been able to see some of it between the branches.  But I saw none of it; it was just gone as soon as it touched the first branch.It was a bright, clear, afternoon and while there was a breeze I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was particularly strong.  It couldn&rsquo;t have been a balloon of any kind since those tend to sort of bob up and down in an irregular path when they are pushed in the wind.

Scale wise, it moved from one side of some tree branches to the trees opposite side in the slow time of approximately 5 minutes.  Too slow to be a jet, yet much too fast to be stars moving across the horizon.  The flashing light was so high up it was about the size of a very tiny star.

The father at the time worked for the family junkyard where cars were cut up and the metal sold to the U.S. for scrap for the war.  This summer night the father was in his workshop cellar in early evening when he saw a basketball sized ball of light come in through the open cellar door, slowly traverse along each wall, stopping at the workbench where tools were hung and then sending out &apos;electric sparks&apos; to the tools while the father backed away in amazement.  The ball of light was silent and gave off no noticeable heat.  The ball then slowly exited through the same open door and disappeared outside.  This was approximately 60 years ago!

It did not when it went past me.  I was approximately 3 linear miles from the town of Ionia, and the object appeared to have the halo around it when it was over the town.I would estimate that the object was visible to me for about 45 seconds, and traveled roughly 6 to 7 miles in that time.

I telephoned RAF Benson in Oxon. who informed me that they did not think it was anything weather related, but they gave me the telephone no. of the headquarters of the meteorological office in Exeter.

As if something was annoyed at me for being so reckless, sitting in the cold while sick.It suddenly got urgent. &apos;Go home&apos; I literally heard.

It was a saucer shape, had some lights... that blurred in my eyes so I cannot say how many but some were larger than others... and I suddenly felt like it was lookingfor me, expecting me at the park, and that I HAD to get indoors. It made no noise, even though it was low down, we have planes that cross over much higher that we can hear (They don&apos;t follow the path it took and they are much much higher, always the same route for them.)... it was close, low, and it was upwind, but I still heard no sound from it.I got inside as soon as I could and even though I felt scared, I for some reason went to my room.

The object was visualized by two individuals on a return trip to Tennessee from South Carolina, traveling towards Asheville.  Following this occurrence a call was made to  911.  The call was taken in two counties as the object was witnessed while traveling across county lines.  The dispatcher showed great interest in the observation and transferred the call, after many questions, to the adjoining counties dispatcher.  The dispatcher reported that he would contact local airports to inquire about planes or possible crashes in the area.The object itself was large, green in color, and moved quickly, dropping from high in the sky, no tail, no other colors, and made no sound.

I drove home for about 3 minutes and when I parked my car and got out I could still see the light.  It was still moving west and was lower in the sky since I had moved about a mile north of it.  I went inside my house and changed out of my clothes.  About 5 minutes later I went outside looking south and the light was still moving west.I watched the light from my front porch for about 2 minutes then it moved up really fast and disappeared into the overcast cloud layer.", "Meteorite object appears after what I thought an aircraft dissappeared.8:53 PM 1/1/2009 exact time- observer location on ground approx 34deg.-38min.N, 080deg.-52min.W (Hartsville, SC) duration 20-30 secs In NW sky about 45deg up from horizon: Appearing to be high in altitude, I saw a few short irregular flashes of what looked like a small moving object. It appeared in the one spot, I do not think I just found it as it was moving. It was moving from North to South nearly directly. I would guess it could have been 10 to 20 miles from me. Its speed was like that of a high flying jet. I was not sure but I thought it looked as if it was slowing down! It looked like it may be an airplane very high up, but it quit flashing after about (4)four flashes (dull-bright-dull-dull flashes), and then I could not see it.About 3 seconds or so after I could not see it any longer, an object that acted like a meteorite shot to the NE from the same spot the flashes quit. The meteorite object was very brushy in its halo and tail, as if a lot of material was burning up very quickly, but it was not very bright. It had a reddish center with a yellowish corona and was very wide,also the tail was very long.The trajectory lasted about 3 seconds and had a pronounced arc as if it was slowing quickly.

In binoculars, appeared to be a brightly glowing object (not flickering like flames would do) of orange/yellow coloration that seemed to eminate from 2 side-by-side sources, close enough to appear as one object.Weather Conditions:  Very Cold (zero or below zero degrees F), Clear, Ground Frozen Solid, Snow Covered.  No Moon, but Starlit Sky.Circumstances/Description of Sighting:  In January of 1977 I was 24 years old and I worked in construction, but for the winter I took a job as a security guard at Wild Acres Lake in Dingman&rsquo;s Ferry, Pa.  This was and still is a gated homeowners community in a rural wooded area.  In January of 1977 it was being actively developed with new lots being sold and new homes being built, while many homes were already occupied in the lake community.  My duties were to patrol the roads of the community at night to watch watch for illegal or unusual activity.  As background, I had been in the US Army from 1972 to 1974 with MOS of 95B, Military Police.  I had been stationed in Kaiserslautern, Germany, working with the enlisted rank of SP4 in 15th MP Brigade Headquarters in the S-3 Operations Center working with war contingency plans, a job which required a Top Secret security clearance and required a background investigation.The mid to latter part of January 1977 was very cold in Pike County Pa and most of the northeast, which was one of the coldest Januaries on record.  I don&rsquo;t recall the exact date of the sighting but it was in the mid to latter part of the month with a moonless sky, very cold, very clear with bright starlit sky, the air crisp, the ground frozen solid and snow covered with at least a foot of crunchy powdery snow.   The night of the sighting I was patrolling the roads of the development routinely, looking for anything unusual.  At this time, the developer had been clearing one of the swampy areas to create a lake, and this entailed logging off the larger trees, bulldozing the stumps into big piles, and burning the piles openly.  At night the piles glowed brightly as the fires continued from the daytime burning, and I kept an eye on them in my rounds to make sure the wind didn&rsquo;t send embers into surrounding woods and start another fire.  (they didn&rsquo;t, the piles were in the middle of the frozen swamp removed from the surrounding woods, and the ground was frozen solid and snow covered).  On the night of the sighting I was driving slowly south on Wild Acres Drive between the Long Lake on my right and a low lying frozen swamp on my left.  Across the treeless swamp at a distance of about 1200 feet was a road called The Construction Road in 1977 but now shown on maps as &ldquo;Luciano Rd&rdquo;.  At the time the construction road was used for exactly that, for construction vehicles to enter the property instead of entering through the gated main entrance.   Just beyond the Construction Rd the ground rose in elevation above the swamp to maybe 20 or 30 feet.  At the top of the rise, through the leafless trees, I thought I saw a large fire burning on the ground.  As I mentioned above, the size was about the size of my closed fist at the end of my extended arm, at a distance of about 1500 feet.  From my position I was looking towards the east.  Since this was not in an area where the developers were doing any clearing, I was conc! erned th at the woods were on fire, and I stopped my car, rolled down the window and looked at the fire through a good pair of binoculars I had in the car.  Through binoculars, I could see that this wasn&rsquo;t a fire, which puzzeled me because I was expecting to see a fire.  Instead I saw two side-by-side brightly glowing lights the color of bright fire, but not flickering like fire does, but rather glowing steadily.  The lights seemed to be side-by-side but overlapped, close enough together to be one light with two sources.  I still didn&rsquo;t know quite what to make of the lights at this point.  However, as I watched through the binoculars, the lights suddenly rose off the ground though the trees which I could clearly see, and actually rose above the top of the tree line about 10 or 20 feet and hovered there for 15 seconds or so.  As the light hovered, I could clearly see the trees underneath, the light was above the trees.  Then after about 15 seconds of hovering, the light ascended at an unbelievably rapid speed not quite straight up, but at an angle just a few degrees off vertical, and left a light trail as it did so, as you see when you quickly waive a light wand or flashlight in your hand in the dark.There was no noise of any kind during the sighting, it was quiet.  No cars in sight.  The area is adjacent to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, a wild and scenic nature area, very rural.  No military bases nearby.Unfortunately I did not think at the time to investigate the site at close quarters, I cannot explain why.  I had never seen anything like it before, nor have I seen anything like it since.  I wish I looked at the site immediately afterwards.The location is approximately -74.90 lon, 41.22 lat.   On a Google Map, I was on Wild Acres drive to the east of the long pond and to the west of the now-wooded swamp area and about 500 feet north of the T intersection.  I was facing east looking across the now-wooded swamp area and across what is now known as Luciano Ln to the wooded rise just to the east of Luciano Lane, at the top of which I saw the light on the ground and saw it rise above the trees.  (It&rsquo;s about 500-600 feet west of the dam at the end of Wild Acres Lake).  I haven&rsquo;t been back to the site since, and it might be my imagination, but on the Google satellite image it looks like there might be a bare spot on the ground where I saw the object.  I&rsquo;d like to go back and have a look.(NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

My dad, mom, and my 2 brothers and I all seen this object.  I have kep&apos;t this under my hat for about a month now.  We all looked up, and noticed this light moving across the sky.  Can&apos;t really remember the direction it was traveling, but I know it wasn&apos;t going the opposite way from us.  It was just a light moving across the sky at a very moderate speed.  What got me is when we all seen this light it started to dim out, and flicker off.  So at this point of me being a local community ufo investigator I stopped to think of any explanation for this light.  First I eliminated the plane/jet theory.  No way possible that this was of these two.  Next I eliminated the planet suggestion.  This light/craft was moving, and it flickered off.  We was moving in our van about 80mph, but I know this light object was moving.  I look in the sky&apos;s alot I know this stuff.  There was a alot of clouds out.  Almost whole sky was covered.  This object was under cloud level.  So this means that the flickering, and dimming was not due to the excessive amount of clouds in the sky.  There was no way this was a satellite, or shooting star just by examination of the object.  I finally had to come to a conclusion that this object was most likely extraterrestrial.  I mean this object/light would flicker on and off, dim a little then become real bright again.  My mom had the best view, and she said that this was the most bizarre ufo related event that has happened to her.  I agreed right along with her.  I have reported other reports to you guys.  Not to long ago I reported a report to ya&apos;ll about the orange like object that turned into a what looked like a star zooming across the sky.

From the time that I first saw the trails till the time of the flash it was about 6 or 7 seconds.By the time I could pull over to get my camera the remains of the trails had started to dissipate and are not as sharp in the photo as when I first saw them.As close as I can tell from my research, the object was coming from the valley east of the small town of Monte Nido, California , near Piuma Rd. Note: The Valley is called Dark Canyon&hellip;  As a young child and as a young adult I have also seen other things in the sky but, to me, I have always been able to dismiss these other sightings with some kind of rational explanation, (weather balloons, shiny silver planes at sun rise or other things...) but not this one. I have attached the photo and some Google Earth images to calibrate the location. My photo and the Google Earth photo image are as close to the same location as I could get Google earth to get me there. I have also included several Google Earth, &quot;top down shots&quot; of the valley, were I think that the UFO took off from.The first top down is from the opposite direction of the original shot and shows were the picture was taken from, the second one shows an area (to the best of my calculations) the place were the UFO took off from. In this area you will notice some buildings and some other objects that are of interest. First you will see a large area at the top of one of the hills near the buildings that has been whited out (by Google) or covered with a white covering of some sort. (Not sure) Also you see a circular shape that is very large and has some interesting shadows around it. I don&rsquo;t think that this is a pool, maybe a horse corral. Maybe it is a large door or cover of some sort. Your guess is as good as mine.With all the UFO stuff that is surfacing I thought that I should send in this shot.", "Oval light (the size of a five story building) sighted from shore had no reflection on water, no sound and traveled at breakneck speedsIntro: I am a 59-year-old retired clothing manufacturer and designer.  I am not one to claim UFO sightings at every turn.  My dad, brother and I did see a meteor fly over the west side of Los Angeles back in 1962 and thought that it landed in our neighborhood but in fact it landed in Canada, according to the news report.  I concluded that things in the sky are illusive, after seeing that.The sighting: In late August of 1967 I was enjoying the warm evening with my girlfriend under a blanket on the west facing Dockweiler State Beach at Playa del Rey in Los Angeles.  It was about 11:30 pm and the beach was closed to the public by this time.  The beach is directly under the take off path of the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) but this night the planes were diverted to take off to the east.  This is a practice reserved for windy conditions but there was no wind that night.  The number of flights at the airport was down to a minimum by late night back in those days.I had noticed a light due west from us at the horizon when we walked up to the area where we set the blanket on the sand.  I figured that it might be a usually seen tanker on the way to the docks in San Pedro.  We started smooching and an eerie feeling came over me, like someone was watching us but when I looked around I noticed the light on the horizon had begun to move closer to the shore at a swifter than natural speed.  It was at sea level, I figured, but some things were missing.  No reflective light and no sound.  This made me stop and pay attention.  As the object closed in toward the beach it&rsquo;s size and altitude became more apparent.  I sat up when the light seamed to be about a mile off the shore and could clearly see that the object was actually about 2,000 feet in the air.  (I often frequented the Hawthorne airport and became accustomed to object altitude.)  I &lsquo;guestimate&rsquo; that the size and shape was oval and the volume of a five-story building.The light emitted from the object was not painfully bright but it had a glow or halo around it as though I were looking through a frosted glass.  It came directly toward me and slowed to a halt at maybe 100 feet from the shore.  I slowly moved to the right over the coast line to about the area of Venice Beach (about 12 miles from our location.)  This took less than a minute and then it returned in a flash.  It hovered over the are where it began to browse for about two minutes.The object then rose straight up to about 4,000 feet and quick as a click it shot off toward the southeast.  I could not see it after it passed out of view beyond the sandy hill at Pacific Coast Hwy.  Perhaps it traveled as far as Disneyland in Anaheim.  I was not terrified but disturbed and uneasy about what I had seen.I was trying to convince myself what had just happened when as quietly and quickly as it left it had returned to the position where it began it browsing just off the beach.  It sat there for about 15 seconds and began making its way back to the horizon.  At some point near the horizon it began to ascend at break-neck speed.  In an instant it rose what appeared to be in an outward arch and disappeared into the night sky.  The entire episode lasted less than 5 minutes but left a lifetime of excitement.((woman&apos;s name deleted)), my girlfriend, did not experience what I saw but was equally uneasy by what she did see.  I believe she saw the light as it left the area the final time.  She was lying down with her face up during the episode and for some reason I felt that I had to protect her from whatever I was looking at.  We left the beach, tout suite, and never spoke of the incident to each other for fear, maybe, that we would know for sure that something was there.

It first appear as a shamrock-likeshape.  It would then change into a &quot;V&quot; shape,  Then the shape of a staple. The reason why i believe it was not balloons is because it changed into a tube or snake-like shape. it drifted into the clouds. The weather was overcast and clouds were abundant.

I was paying attention to the sky at that moment because I was admiring Venus and another planet.  My husband and I noticed as the objects got closer to us that the lights were definitely not an airplane or helicopter.

I was there for the Xmas Eve Carol Service.  The photos were part of a steetlamp experiment that was inspired by Miceal Ledwith and Klaus Heinneman&apos;s book The Orb Project.I was fascinated by Miceal&apos;s theory on Orbs as fluorescing beings and had similar observations myself.  I wanted to take the experiment into a different direction - that of shooting straight into fluorescing streetlamps.  I have been astounded by some of the results.But the biggest discovery was before I shot the photos.  I was aiming the camera at the streetlamp when I saw the UFO materialise.  I didn&apos;t even have my finger on the button to activate the infra-red or flash. Like looking at the UFO in a live movie, I noticed something interesting.  If I tilted the camera left or right, up or down very slightly, perhaps no more than 5 to 10 degrees, the Orbs came into view or vanished, or demonstrated a partial materialisation as can be seen in the selection of photos.The UFOs were perfectly still! If I moved the camera slightly left or right, I got the phenomena I&apos;ve documented above.  When I moved the camera back to its original angle, they were there again in clear view.

At first, we thought it was just some kind of low-flying aircraft, but, with no sound, we decided that it might be flying very high.  If so, it had to be enormous.

Over motorwayOn Saturday 20th December 2008, at approx. 18:00 my husband and I were travelling along the A11 motorway just past Le Mans in France, when I looked out of the window and saw what apeared to be a weird cloud formation (fog like) travelling at the same speed as our vehicle (80mph). Then all of a sudden a circle of lights, about 10, with an inner circle of lights, crossed in front of our vehicle, from left to right and then back again. At this point my husband who was driving also witnessed this. Although no solid body of a ship could be seen the formation and movements of the lights would be as if they were part of a solid moving object. The lights indicated an object that would have been the size of 4 lanes of the motorway, they came across the motorway low flying, stopped, rotated and shot off  at considerable speed, until they could no longer be seen. I thought this would be the end of our encounter, when suddenly the lights were back, crossed in front of us right to left,  rotated and shot off, again disapearing from sight. They returned again and I could see them from the left hand window of our vehicle, slightly lagging behind. The whole incident lasted about 10-15 minutes before I could no longer see them. My camera was not handy, so I did not get a photograph. I did not want to take my eyes off of the lights for one minute. I should have written every detail down at the time but did not. I counted the outer ring of lights, sure that I would never forget how many there were, I am fairly sure there were 10 but it is amazing how even when something truly amazing happens if you don&rsquo;t write it down imediately, you doubt yourself.

The object moved silently across the sky, approx. 1/2 to 1 mile above us. The craft was long in shape, with a box shaped nose (front), a long bridge-like narrow middle and a tail that flared wider than the middle portion then tapered down to a point. The object did not streak by, but instead floated slowy across the horizon line, arriving from the south, moving in a north, northwest direction. The sighting lasted about 2 minutes before the object disappeared in the distance.The object was covered with many different colored lights, which highlighted its spatial qualities. In a frenzy my friend and I drove home to tell others about the event. The DJ on the radio station that was playing stated that he was receiving a lot of calls about a UFO sighting. The next day or so the newspaper had a small article dismissing the event as a &quot;russian satelite burning up in the atmosphere&quot;. Sorry folks, but this object was crystal clear in appearance and moving slowly, not a streak in the sky.Another poster here described the object like a cruise ship in the sky and that description accurately captures the incredible nature of the experience because it was about as freaky as a cruise ship flying overhead. I cannot fully impress upon others the extreme size of the object... much bigger than any man made object known to fly at low speed and low altitude.FYI, The other poster mentioned here described what had to be the same event, but recorded an approximate date of June, 1987.

We were headed off to see a 10pm movie in town and were sort of in a hurry to make it. As we came to a stop sign at HWY 290 to make a left turn towards Austin, I noticed a larger-than normal ranch light looming above the hill country/woods across the highway. I was staring at it, wondering why a ranch light was suspended so high up. My wife began asking me what I was looking at, and after I showed her, she calmly said.. &apos;What is it? I honestly didn&apos;t know. We kept looking at it which seemed for minutes, but no movement. I thought maybe it&apos;s a jet or plane on a extended flight path into Austin International coming straight at us with a landing light on or something making it appear to be stationary. Shortly, the Bright blueish-white ball or cicle of light began to fade down in intensity and sort of move slowly to the left ( East ) kind of parallel to our highway. Along the back of the circle were two blue rings one atop of the other. My wife and I had opened her moon-roof to try to hear better or get a better view while all of this was happening, but we never could hear any sound whatsoever. The night was a typical &apos;Texas evening to where you could have heard a pin drop. Not one sound, except for an occasional car passing out on the highway. No one else on the road stopped,slowed down, or appeared to notice what we were looking at. My wife and I were not sleep deprived, drunken or under the influence of anything. We had only been in a hurry to get to a movie in town. As our object began moving, I started the car back up and took off in dirction of town as we both tried to keep track of it. With my wife and I both reasonably excited, &apos;her telling me to turn on my lights as well as to watch the road, the object shot fast for what appeared to be several miles, then turn at sharp angle, super fast again and then straight-up disappearing from sight. It all happened incredibly quick and within a few seco! nds if t hat. It was like watching an old episode of &apos;startrek when they would shoot off into space suddenly. It truly was the strangest-weirdest thing I had ever seen, and I&apos;ve seen a lot of stuff in my life. I had been in the Air Force as a crewchief on fighter jets and other planes and had never seen any aircraft/jet/plane etc.. to do what I saw. Also to note, I am a very-realistic person about things and have always been a sceptic of &apos;UFO&apos;s in general. My wife and I DID see this object as we&apos;ve told. That night, we both decided to forget the movie as we planned on seeing for as we were both excited/upset from what we saw. I was really thrown by the whole thing because I couldn&apos;t make sense of just what we saw. We drove back to our that night with me constantly asking my wife, &apos;Did you see that?, Did we really just see that??  I think she was more scared than anything, because she knew by looking at me that we saw something that wasn&apos;t right. After getting home, I did call the Police Dept. in town assuring them that this wasn&apos;t a prank or that we were not drunk or anything asking them if any one else had called about a strange light over the southwest Austin area, they said no, but it sounded interesting. Get this, they told me I might get a hold of the &apos;Air-force base or project blue book if it&apos;s still out  there. I assured them that it wasn&apos;t and told them that I worked on the Air force base( Bergstrom AFB at the time ) and didn&apos;t know of any numbers there to call. I thanked them for their time. Interestingly enough, when I called the Airport and spoke to a very-interested and nice person in the tower (APP-CON) they had asked me all the times and location of my event and then directed me to our local &apos;Travis-county sheriffs dept. The only traffic they (APP-CON) had noticed or had been with that night was a small cessna inbound over the Lake Travis area at around 9:15PM. After calling the &apos;Sheriffs dept and again ensuring them this was not a prank, they asked a few questions about the incident, like time/our ! location etc.. followed by, &apos;No we don&apos;t think your crazy or making it up, ten or so other people have called us as well about some strange lights over your area. The sheriffs deputy said we can send an officer over if you would like us to make out a report, it&apos;s up to you. He said, what ever we saw sounded interesting, and that they had a small incident reporting checklist he would use. My wife and I both agreed, and within a few minutes, a very nice-concerning officer appeared on our street and began looking at us both, asking questions. Before the officer left, he did say, &apos;Whatever you saw sounds pretty cool, you and a lot of other&apos;s seem to have saw the same thing tonight based upon what you guy&apos;s described to me. I have told a few folk&apos;s here and there about what happened that night, mainly not to forget that evening, but mostly to share a very &apos;real experience that happened to myself and another person. For many night&apos;s after that one evening, my wife would say what&apos;s wrong? as I would stand back looking out our windows. I would tell her that I felt really strange, &apos;Like I saw something that I shouldn&apos;t have and it&apos;s going to come back or something.

Before getting outside I noticed that half the house was without power, not just my room and the heater, when I got outside there were NO breakers thrown, baffled, I went back.  Before getting back inside I looked up at the clear night sky, only to find a flying star, &quot;shooting star,&quot;  I ask myself? Not possible, it moved extremely smooth and consistent, almost unreal, nearly straight above me moving east to west,  solid white light (like a star), it slowly faded so faint I thought it disappeared, but it was still visible.I continued tracking, then it became strong again (about 10 seconds of strong light and 10 seconds of faint light), it shifted direction and disappeared again, but this time I could not see it any longer (it did not go off into the horizon, it simply disappeared), so I turned around looked up to see the rest of the sky, AND LOW AND BEHOLD, ANOTHER!!!   That&rsquo;s right, almost brighter than the first, now I am watching another one flying north to south.  I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore, it was about 5:30am, I quickly went inside and got my wife, it took about ten minutes to get her outside, daylight was approaching, and when we looked up scanning the sky we couldn&rsquo;t see anything, she looked down on the horizon facing North, and she sees one!!!

It first appeared to be in a corkscrew type trajectory, then seemed to emit clouds of smoke, and then travelled in a straight line although appeared to be descending at a shallow angle.The strange thing is that it emitted no sound whatsoever and was travelling extremely fast.  We regularly have aircraft passing overhead at both high and low altitudes from Coventry and East Midlands airports so are used to the relative altitude, speed and sound.  This object did not seem to be like anything we have seen before and myself, my wife and my son all witnessed it.

I live on ((deleted)) ave. in Marion,Oh and was walking to my dads house the next street over on patterson st.

It had green lights on each point and a whiteish blue flame coming out of the very center of the craft. The reason I knew it was&apos;nt one of ours is because it was way way up in the sky and a jet or plane would of looked alot smaller at that altitude. It was heading west but the way it looked it was going strait up. It flew up until I couldn&apos;t see it any more. The lights did&apos;nt blink they stayed lit. I found it very curious when I watched unsolved mysteries and some police officers in bulgaria or something seen triangular crafts floating really low to the ground and they had red lights at each point.

The stars were separated by a distance equal to the width of my thumb at arms length.  They were as bright as Venus, and equal to each other in magnitude.  I knew the stars were out of place, and thought I was witnessing some strange double supernova.  The sky was crystal clear without a hint of clouds.I was thinking about looking them up and finding out what was going on when, as I was looking at them, they both faded simultaneously to the point of invisibility in about 4 seconds. I never took my eyes off of them through the whole event. I would say that I had been looking at them for about 30 seconds. They didn&apos;t belong there in the first place.I could not make sense of what I was seeing, and still can&apos;t. The stars were stationary the whole time. At first I thought I might be looking at a couple of geosynchronous satellites that were rotating through a position of reflecting to non-reflecting, but the position was too far north of the Celestial Equator. I don&apos;t think we can place geosynchronous satellites in orbits that far off of the Celestial Equator.I don&apos;t know what I saw, but I definitely saw it.

I was outside in my backyard on my deck for about 10 minutes. During that time I noticed how beautiful the sky looked and began to gaze up at it while I finished my cigarette. I noticed planes in the sky and I am fairly familiar with the different lights used on commercial and private aircraft, and what I saw in the air was strangely disturbing.

At first it seemed to maintain a steady flight pattern, but soon the object (at this point I had a feeling it wasn&rsquo;t any plane that I was familiar with) began to make a very random, quick yet smooth motions that omitted absolutely no sound. It almost looked as if it were making cursive motions that one could associate with the writing style. However, even with the awkward motions the object continued to move in the general direction of NE-SW, until I looked away again. When I looked back to same area it once was, the object had moved surprisingly to a position higher in sky (not altitude but degree &ndash; altitude seemed to be constant) and was now heading more for a NW route.

Again a few minutes later it blinked straight out in front of us to the south and we could see that it was 5 or 6 lights that looked sort of like strobe lights. It was blinking a redish orange color and was a very lazy blink. It was not fast or slow but a very lazy light up and dim back down. It was also dead silent and was obviously hovering because as it would blink it was stationary and not flying by like an airliner.

My father and three relatives were on their way to a lodge meeting one Monday evening in 1947, near Lewistown, Montana.  Dad was excited as could be the next day relating how they saw the lights of the &quot;flying saucer&quot; (I&rsquo;d never heard the term UFO at that time.) and they pulled the car into an approach, shut it off and all got out to observe the gyrations these lights were performing, close by--and without a sound.  I was thoroughly embarrassed for Dad, his two brothers and nephew, and didn&rsquo;t relate the incident to ANYONE.  That is until some years later, when strange things were happening near Great Falls, when a TV newsman caught several UFOs circling around Great Falls; and later incidents at Minuteman Missile sights in central Montana.I believe the year was 1990 or 1991.  I don&rsquo;t remember but it likely late spring to early summertime.  I went to the &quot;coffee shop&quot; near the viaduct in Whitefish, where I met the retired GNRY workers I enjoyed having coffee with, and listening to their stories of &quot;steam railroad&quot; in years past.  I was sitting with three GNRY retirees.  I was facing Big Mountain, the local ski resort.I observed a very shiny (shinier than chrome) &quot;airplane&quot; coming into sight above Big Mountain, approximately 15 miles from where we sat.  (I used to have a friend who owned an old 140 Cessna aircraft, which he used to polish and buff.)  Since it was confusing to me, I mentioned to the three others at our booth, &quot;I see a UFO flying toward Whitefish.&quot;  I was kind of kidding, but it soon proved quite true.  By this time it was probably about 5 miles?   We watched the &quot;airplane&quot; descending and the closer it got, it was obvious at the slow cautious speed it traveled, that it was no &quot;Cessna aircraft,&quot; but rather a very thin disk.  (It appeared as though one took two &quot;cymbals&quot; and placed one atop the other, it would replicate the shape we were seeing.  There was slightly more &quot;cabin&quot; underneath than on top.)   I would estimate the width of the total craft to be 75&rsquo; in width.I went to the kitchen and told the owner and his wife we were observing a UFO nearing Whitefish.  The 6 of us went outside to watch this situation.  The UFO came to a stop about &frac34; of a mile from us, hovering above (best guess?) Wisconsin Avenue or the east edge of Whitefish Lake when it began hovering about 250-300 feet above the ground.  We observed it in a noiseless, standstill hover for approximately 5 minutes.  Then it took off in a northeast direction, although approximately straight up.  I&rsquo;d estimate it was out of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere in less than five seconds.Sadly the three GNRY retirees have passed away.  The restaurant owner and his ex-wife are still living.  We discuss that day every time I see him.  The incident was reported in the main Kalispell newspaper the next day on the front page.  Now that I&rsquo;m retired, I plan to go to the Montana Historical Society and go through those years of newspapers on videotape and try to find that story for my own satisfaction; now that I have to defend my status as a former skeptic.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As we were traveling I noticed a odd light in the sky just above a mountain. I stared at the light for a good 5 or 6 minutes before coming to the pre-mature conclusions that it was the top of a blink tower. Then as we drove closer and closer I realized that it was really bright. To bright for a light tower. I asked my boyfriend what he thought it was and he said it was a light tower. I agreed and then a couple of minutes later I looked again and saw that it was definitly not a light tower. I saw there wasn&apos;t a poll grounding the lights. I started to get confused and focused harder on the lights. In doing so I realized that it was hovering. By this time we where very close and when my eyes focused I saw that it was a man made jet airliner. However, what was so odd about this was that it was not on top of a mountain it was right next the interstate bridge inside of a deep valley. Hovering there it seems to teeter. All the lights where on, I could see the windows to the plane. There was absolutly no markings on the plane accept for a blue stripe and a red stripe. I had already rolled the window down and in total shock I stuck my head out the window in order to try and beleive my eyes better, completely ignoring the pooring rain. The airliner wasn&apos;t more than 3 or 4 hundred off the ground and slightly tilted forward towards the ground. There wasnt any sound whatsoever. That was what blew my mind was the absence of sound. I know this isnt a UFO because I definitly identified what the flying object was I just cannot find an explanation for a hovering passenger jet. H", "11:00 am, clear sky, three of us saw a disk-shaped aircraft fly by, about as high up as an airplane would be.I was walking down town with my older brother at about 11:00 on a Saturday morning. I am not sure of the year or date, but I would guess I was probably around 6 years old and the weather was nice, making it around 1969, probably in the middle of June. I remember looking up and both of us seeing what I remember looked exactly like a flying saucer. At the time I did not think it odd that we were seeing something that was not supposed to exist. I just remember asking a man who was passing by, &ldquo;Excuse me, what is that?&rdquo; I recall him saying the strangest thing&hellip;something so strange that I repeated it over and over again until I could go home and ask a grown-up what it meant&hellip;he replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! It looks like a U.F.O.&rdquo;  He looked at it some more, then continued on his way. All the way home I kept repeating to my brother and myself, &ldquo;UFO. UFO,&rdquo; so I wouldn&rsquo;t forget those letters.  I came home and asked my eldest brother what those letters meant. He explained, and then of course nobody believed us so we let it drop. However, all of these years I have wondered if maybe the US Military had some kind of aircraft that looked exactly like a flying saucer? I would love to find out. I know I saw one!((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

While we were traveling East down HWY 80, my husband noticed several orange lights coming from the South heading North.  As we stopped at a red light at the intersection of Hwy 80 and Hwy 280, my husband finally asked me if I could see the lights too and if I knew what they were.  At first these were seen through the trees and resembled street lights in the distance but as we sat at the red light I noticed these lights were actually moving at a slow pace.We continued East on Hwy 80 and tried to keep our eye on the lights as they became more in to view. Soon we noticed more and the few lights we were seeing were actually 9 or 10 so we were a little intrigued as to what would be flying over in this number, but then I was able to count about 19 or more. They were appeared large and seemed to be very high in the sky.  They changed direction from going North to moving East in front of us.  This acutally looked as though they just started moving sideways. We tried to keep up but kept getting stopped by red lights.  We then could only watch as they continued to get farther away.  At one point it appeared that there were more appearing from the atmosphere and looked to be almost dropping slowly.  At this time my children  began asking if these were meteors or something else falling from space.Once they got to the horizon, they seemed to disappear.  We tried to catch up a few minutes after they got away from us, but there was nothing at all in the sky.  By the time we got to the last place we saw them over the sky was very clear and we could see it very well from this new location.  This was on Hwy 85 in Columbus, GA traveling Norteast.We live near Ft. Benning so we realize this could be explained as something else, but there were just too many and they were maneuvering in ways that I have never seen.   We waited so long because we were trying to see if anyone else that night witnessed the same thing.  The other people in cars around us did not seem to notice but surely someone else saw.  It was very scary and all of us were shaken up for quite awhile that night. If you can get any other information to explain this phenomenon we would greatly appreciate it.", "Just before walking into the house I looked straight up and saw a small white object which was moving very slowly in a N-NW direction. Rate of speed was such that the object took 15 minutes to travel from a point directly above me to a point @ 45 deg. N-NW where I lost sight of it due to haze in the atmosphere and wispy clouds moving in (very quickly the sky changed from nice and clear to grayish and scattered clouds).The clouds came in from W-NW moving E-SE. I don&apos;t know if the wind at higher altitudes ever travels in opposite/different directions than the wind at lower altitudes. If it does, then the object could have been a balloon(s).If it was traveling against the wind then I don&apos;t know what it could&apos;ve been. I&apos;ve never seen a satellite travel from SE to NW, but maybe there&apos;s one that does.I did manage to snap one photo but it only adds confusion since the object in the photo appears to be four orange lights arranged like a + (plus sign) but so tightly packed that the general shape is circular.  I don&apos;t know if this is what it really looked like or if this is some &quot;digital camera anomaly&quot; or a result of being improperly focused.Anyway, I just wanted to put it on record in case anybody else saw it. Not a real big deal. Just a flying (silent) object that I could not identify.PS. I did notice that when my camera was struggling to focus just before I pressed the button fully to snap the picture, the image in the viewfinder did all kinds of funny stuff, it showed a faint crescent shape that expanded and then a flash of light and then as it shifted the focus out toward infinity I just snapped it because I didnt think it was going to ever find it. (Hope that makes sense)  Thanks for the opportunity to record these events, Mr. Davenport.  You&apos;re doing a great job.", "A massive flaming/glowing eyeball floats by then min later a streak of light from space making a 60* angle above us.I have never told anyone of this sighting other than my wife.The exact date is unknown to my memory, but it took place in late 97 or early 98.  In those days I drank and abused soft drugs.  As I and my friend were under the age of 21 and our parents did not condone this type of activity, we participated in a classic American teenage ritual known as &quot;road tripping&quot; where you drive around all evening drinking and listening to music.One place in particular where we liked to stop was at a small tree nursery off the Iola black top between Farina and Iola IL. I was parked facing east.  We liked to stop there because it was out of the way and it was very unlikely, if not impossible for any John Q law types to be patrolling, or concerned with.  It was here that our route, which started west of St. Peter IL, reached its&rsquo; intermission.  This means, it is where we finished half of the case of beer and always felt the need to peak the buzz w/ soft drugs in the form of a, marijuana joint.  The custom with my friends was if you couldn&rsquo;t roll a J then you had to break it up.It was a winter month in 1997 at 22:00 to 23:00 hrs, when my friend completed his task of preparing enough marijuana for a joint.  He then presented it to me to roll.  I took the plate and all my concentration was on the rolling process.   Just as I am finishing my task I hear him belt out &ldquo;what ((deleted)) was that&rdquo; I look up off of the plate but see nothing.  My friend was a nice guy, but always had a reputation for pulling our legs or being reckless with the truth. What was what I asked?  He said &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t see that?&rdquo; see what I asked? He was some what hysterical and clearly not acting for a gag or joke. A big f/;&rsquo;ing flaming eyeball just floated by. I laugh and give him some pretty heavy static.  He said &ldquo;no way man not this time a big f&rsquo;;.ing flaming eye ball just floated by it zipped this way and then slowly floated across the horizon.  I still look at him like he is crazy ((deleted) I said.  He continued with his rants of the flaming ball or &ldquo;eyeball&rdquo; flooded with the heavy use of superlatives. I by this time have finished the joint giving him more shit saying the weed wasn&rsquo;t that good and so on.  I never saw the first sighting that he did but soon learned he was clearly telling the truth.I left the tree nursery and turned left on the Iola blacktop back towards Farina IL.  Just after the turn onto the blacktop as if whatever it was could hear the shit I was laying on my friend, we both see a glow way out in the stars above us. It happened in slow motion, like a car wreck but was instantaneous, because I only had started pointing at it. There was no time to say do you see that, but we both could not take our eyes off of the glowing reddish, purplish, aura, that was way out there, like a star itself, kind of spinning or flickering.  In the same instant it was glowing and we were looking at it. It streaked from that fixed point right over us off to the right in an acute angle it seemed to remain in the sky but didn&rsquo;t, like the shutter speed of the mind was slower than what happened. It made an acute angle and nothing made by man could do what we saw.  I never saw a craft per-say but the effect of one. The streak it made was elongated in blue red and finally yellow it made an acute angle roughly 60* and again, it was instantaneous.  We both were speechless &ldquo;now do you f*(%ing believe me&rdquo;  he yelled.  I stated that two people could not experience the same graphic hallucination. The government might have experimental craft but nothing could defy physical natural law like what we saw.  &ldquo;No f*#ing shit&rdquo; he said definitely an unidentified object.  We both clearly agreed it was not of the material realm we are apart of, because it did not observe physical laws.He wanted to tell the other friends when we got back to town.  I made him rationalize that people already had an opinion of him as a bullshitter, and I didn&rsquo;t want to be perceived as crazy, or a liar seeking attention, so I told him if he told any one I would kick his ass. He and I had a falling out but I have never told anyone what we saw that clear winter night.   I was instantly transformed from curious skeptic to believer on that night.  Since, doing pot and drinking and driving are illegal, I knew this story would never be taken seriously anyway. However, the sighting was very real. It made me think about the possibility of inter-dimensions rather than linear travel of them they it or whatever. Due to the way it was there for him, and then way out there like beyond the distance of the moon and instantly over us and so forth. Thank you for your time this is no joke or hoax.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Around 06:25 p.m. my friend told me he just saw three orange lights perpendicular to the ground in the sky, just above some trees.  He said the lights dimmed out from top to bottom.  I had him explain what he had seen to me since they dimmed out and I was unable to see them myself.  A few minutes later he said he had just seen the lights again but they had gone out already.  I looked in the area of where he was saying he saw them.  I saw a red light further to the right of where I thought he was pointing, from a tower, and he said that was not the light he saw.  At 06:32 p.m. he told me the lights were back.  I looked over and saw two orange lights in the sky above the tree line, parallel to the ground.  I saw a string of orange light that was not as bright as the lights, shoot from each ball of light in an upwards arc back down to the same level as the one it originated from.  When the strings of light would come back down to the same level of the ball of light, a new ball of orange light would appear.  The ball of light it originated from would dim away.  The string of light would then dim away from the originating ball to the new orange ball of light.  The two lights were the same color and the distance of the strings appeared to be the same but the lights were not arcing/forming new balls of light at the same time.  The lights repeated this process about eight times each and lasted approximately 30 seconds total before both lights went out completely.  The lights were moving from North to South.  I am unsure how far away they were but they appeared within a mile distance from where we were.  I have never seen anything like this before.  It was definitely an UNIDENTIFIED flying object.  Very cool to experience.", "Large boomerang shaped invisible object blocked starlight while flying across skyI have a sketch and noted the year was 1999, but did not write down the day.  The sighting took place in the late evening when it was completely dark and the sky was clear and full of stars.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed movement in the sky from the north moving to the south.  When I looked closer, however, it wasn&rsquo;t an object that I was seeing move, rather it was the disappearance and reappearance of stars behind an object.  The object itself was black or invisible with no lights.  Given the area of stars that were blocked out, I would say the object was five times larger than a jet.  It was completely silent.  It was shaped like a boomerang only a little more rounded in front rather than triangle and a slightly sharper points on the &ldquo;wing&rdquo; tips.  Since the object was invisible, I can only suggest the shape based on the black area absent of stars like a silhouette as it moved across the sky.  If the object was indeed five times the size of a jet and flying at about the attitude of a jet, then it was moving much faster than a jet.  I blinked a couple times, looked away and looked back, and then followed the object across the remainder of the horizon until it was out of sight.  In all it took about 8-10 seconds to span the sky and flew at the same altitude the whole time.Given the triangular shape, I suppose it could have been a low-flying Stealth Bomber that just appeared much larger if flying low.  But is a Stealth completely silent?  Also, Stealth Bombers have three triangles pointing backwards from the mid section.  The object I saw did not seem to have any mid section as such.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "sauntering lights across the night sky left me woundering what this could be....I was about to leave for Hockey that evening when out of the sky I noticed a shooting star so in my curiosity I preceded to look for more.  On my view of the night sky there was an object with three lights across a disc like craft, with a red light circling around the other lights.  This object was cruising at a low altitude at a slower than normal speed for a plane, which crosses the air traffic from our local airfield.  Normally you can clearly hear the roaring sound of these planes approaching the airport as the fly around the front side of my house a few hundred feet above. This object was not a plane, there was no sound from this craft as it sauntered across the night sky in what was a south easterly direction.  Watching this object for ten minutes I came to my conclusion that any plane flying out from the nanaimo airport would have clearly left my site as it faded into the black with the sound still lingering in the distance though the ten minutes or so.There was also a second much smaller craft that was higher above which seemed to stay in a perfect parallel in relation to the bigger craft.  With planes you notice the opposite flash of a green then red light on either tip of the wings, two bright landing lights usually are turned on for visual during night landings.  This was not the case in my sighting.", "Very slow moving huge black triangle shaped object, no sound, crosses in front of me.It was sometime in August 2000.  I am a drummer and had just packed up my gear and was heading home.  We had played at a place called &lsquo;Rosie&rsquo;s&rsquo; in Harrington.  I lived in Wilbur Washington. I have not drank nor done drugs since May 28th, 1998.  I have a full time day job, music is my hobby.It was about 2:30am and I was traveling toward Hiway 20 ((sic.  Route 2)) on a back road from Harrington that comes out by the power transformer station (I guess that&rsquo;s what it is) onto Hiway 20 west of the Davenport Refuse Transfer Station.  I think the back road is called Rocklyn Road.I was in my Ford van which had a big windshield.  I glanced out the driver side window and noticed a huge jet black triangle shaped object outlined against the clear night sky.  It had one small red light in the very center.  This red light did not blink.  This object was moving very slow towards Spokane, Washington.  I pulled over to get a better look.  Even though it was dark out, I could distinctly see this object.  It was huge.  About 300 feet long, maybe 200 feet across the back.  The sides went straight up about 40 feet.  I rolled down my window (I did not get out of the van because I was pretty freaked out by now) and it made absolutely no sound.  I sat and watched as it slowly passed in front of my van.  It was about 200-300 feet off the ground.  It took about 15 minutes to pass in front of me if that tells you how slow it was moving.As it passed my van I saw 5 very big square lights across the back of it.  They spanned the full width across the back as well as went almost from the top to bottom of the object.  I am absolutely sure there were five lights because there was a dark line between each of them.  These lights were intensely bright.  Even though they were bright, they didn&rsquo;t seem to give off light outside the object itself.  They didn&rsquo;t seem to light anything up.  I thought to myself, &quot;Llights that bright should throw some light onto the ground,&quot;  but they didn&rsquo;t.  I watched as it silently disappeared from my view.  My heart was pounding and I was scared to death.  The next day I told some friends.  They immediately told me I was seeing things.  I know what I saw.  I have no reason to make up story like this.  I don&rsquo;t care if anybody believes me or not.  I know what I saw.  I will never forget it.  I was going to send this report in several years ago, but could never get myself to push the send button.  Seeing  that you are now located at Davenport, I thought if nothing else you should know.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hi Peter.It&apos;s hard to pinpoint where I actually was that night because of the darkness.  I was probably 5-6 miles out of Harrington heading toward hiway 20.  ((sic.  Route 2))   I know I had passed where there is a Y in the road.   For the life of me I can&apos;t remember how long it was untill I came upon one of the old farm houses after I watched it.  Like I said I was very freaked out by then.  We usually played every other weekend at Rosies.  We always played the first and third weekend of the month.  My best guess would be August 19, 2000.  Rosies has closed since then but I could talk to to the other band members and see if they remember the exact date.I kept running it through my mind the rest of the way home and do not remember much of the surroundings after that.  I kept asking myself things like &quot;could it have been a helecopter?&quot;  Then I would remind myself just how big this thing was and how it made no noise.  So then I thought maybe a balloon.  Again, it was so big and so quiet with absolutely no blinking warning lights, just the small red light on the bottom in the center.  I ruled out balloon.  Maybe a big plane from fairchild?  It would have fallen out of the sky it was moving so slow. I have always had this missconception that UFO&apos;s were round, saucer shaped objects.  That UFO&apos;s darted about then hovered, then darted about some more.  This did not fit that category at all. In my wildest dreams I would never have thought of them as being triangle shaped.  I always thought of them as being lit up with multicolored lights.  Again, only the small red light and the 5 sqaure lights across the back.  This object was totally black.  No lights on the sides.  I thought they would make humming or whirring sounds.  There was complete silence.I kept questioning myself about the 5 lights across the back.  They did not fit the norm for lights that bright.  If you were to look at 2 bright headlights that are 2-3 feet apart, you would see two distinct bright points of light.  The light from those two headlights would join at a distance and you would probably not be able to see a distinct gap between them unless you were standing right next to them. From a distance they would blend together.  The gaps between the 5 bright lights on this object were very distinct.  Even at a distance.  The light formed definite edges that were perfectly straight.  I mentioned in my letter to you that they were square.  Actually they were more rectangular.  Taller than they were wide.I am 51 years old and have never in my life seen anything that even remotely resembled what I saw that night.  It defied all logic.  The only thing that could move that slow and stay in the air would be a balloon.  This was not a balloon.  I can not tell you exactly how big it was because I had no reference points.  In the darkness I could not see buildings or trees, just the outline of the hills.  I can tell you that my Ford Van was a 1989 E250 Custom van.  It had a big front windshield and that at one point this object completely filled it.  This object was probably 400-600 feet directly in front of me and 200-300 feet off the ground at that moment.  It was very, very big.This expierience has changed the way I think. I don&apos;t take things for granted anymore.  I don&apos;t believe that just because the Theory of Relativity states we can not travel  faster than the speed of light, we can&apos;t travel faster the speed of light.  I am full of &quot;What If&apos;s and Why&apos;s&quot;  What if we simply do not have a calculation that would prove that theory wrong?  What if a life form millions of years older than ourselves had the capability to travel through space at speeds we can&apos;t begin to imagine?  Only 500 years ago people would have said you were crazy to think it possible to talk to someone  5000 miles away instantly in real time.  Why do scientist&apos;s and engineers continue to develop ways to travel faster if it&apos;s not possible to travel faster than the speed of light?  Even at the speed of light things are simply so far away it would do us no good.  I believe they are hoping the Theory of Reletivity is also wrong. The universe is huge. Just because we can&apos;t do it, does not mean another  much older inteligent life form can&apos;t. As humans I believe now that we are self centered and very, very small in the grand scheme of things. I believe that we have conditioned ourselves to think if we can&apos;t do it, it can&apos;t be done.  I believe if we can imagine it, eventually it will be done.  I also believe something, a life form or entity, whatever, just beat us to it.As I stated, I don&apos;t care if anybody believes me.  I know what I saw and nobady will ever convince me otherwise.  I know in my heart that the object I saw that night, was NOT from this planet.  As for my credibility... take a drive to Wilbur, go into Sandy&apos;s family foods.  I worked there 10 years as a shift supervisor, ask them.  Everybody in Wilbur knows me.  I am not a publicity seeker and have nothing to gain by making up a story such as this.  I have palyed music proffesionally for over 30 years and have had all the publicity a person would ever want.  My wife and I are very private people, almost to point of being hermits.  I just wanted you to know what I had seen in your area.  I will draw you a picture of what I saw if you would like and attach it to an email.((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and he has appeared on the Jeff Rense Radio Program, to tell his story.

Our building is near a rock quarry so I assumed the noise was from an oncoming truck carrying materials to/from the quarry.  I initially ignored the noise thinking it would pass and I could fall back asleep and not worry about the noise awaking my young child.  But the noise did not stop after 5-10 mins.  Finally, I went out onto my balcony and looked for the oncoming or idling truck, but there was none.

We live within two miles of Epply Airfield and have seen a lot of airplanes and this was no airplane.

It may be intended as disinformation, but we cannot be certain; it is our best guess.  PD))Received call from parents at 8:34pm from parents who live 2.5 miles away.  They were seeing strange lights in the sky.  We looked outside and the lights were also visible from our house.My account: Sky was mostly dark.  The sky was overcast.  My guess is that the cloud ceiling was 5000-10000.  I saw 6 red lights moving very slowly across the sky.  They were due west when I first viewed them at about 35 degrees above the horizon.  The lights were in a formation resembling two opposing triangle.  The two triangles were separated by roughly 5 or 6 times the length of the side of one of the triangles.  They were not in a tight formation, but stretched over what appeared to be a large distance.  My feeling was that the six lights were not part of one object, but they were independent of each other.  This seemed to be true based on what was observed later.The lights had a &quot;blurry&quot; look to my eyes, not crisp.  I do not wear glasses.  There was no unusual noise to be heard.  The lights moved from the western sky to the southern sky slowly.  At a quick glance they might have appeared stationary, but they were indeed moving.  After watching for ~90 seconds, the lights were in the southern sky and the three lights of the triangle to my right independently broke from the formation and seemed to move away from my vantage point.  The lights got smaller and smaller until they were not visible.  It appeared they ascended into the cloud cover and were no longer visible.  Within another 15 seconds or so, the other three lights in sequence did the same thing and vanished.I am 39 yrs old and have never seen anything like this.  It was completely unlike anything I could imagine.  Honestly, as it was happening, I was convinced I was seeing something from an extra terestrial world.I called the police about 45 minutes later to report this and they said many other people were calling with the same report.  He went on to say they heard from a neighboring police department that the lights were caused by weather balloons with road flares tied to them.  After hearing this, I doubted my first assessment.  However, the police report was not definitive.The day after this happened, Jan 6, this appeared on our local news station website:  ###### source: http://www.news12.com/NJ/topstories/article?id=223402#  (01/06/09) MORRISTOWN - It was something out of a sci-fi movie Monday night in Morris County when residents spotted mysterious lights in the sky.Residents in Florham Park, Hanover and Morristown saw the hovering red lights in the sky. Some are even wondering if the lights were a UFO, leaving some to think we&rsquo;re not alone in the universe.Some who saw the lights called police. The authorities contacted a local airport to scan the sky with radar, but found nothing. According to police, the lights were possibly helium balloons attached to road hazard flares.####  To me, the balloon and flare story is plausible based on what I saw.  When the flares went out, this could have been perceived as the lights moving away from me and then vanishing into the cloud cover.  However, I would like to know who set these balloons afloat and why they had flares tied to them.  Until then, the jury is out for me.One last note: from my parents vantage point, they saw 5 lights and not 6 like me.  We both claim the lights were clear as day to see so I can&apos;t explain the discrepancy in our accounts.Thank you.", "3 strangely colored (bronze, copper, orange red) very bright, began very small, and grew to very large, disapeared, and then reappeared((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was stroking my cat at the window of my dining room, strange yes but I like animals. I decided to check the skies, literally in the hopes of spotting something like this. I spotted a star, and looked up at it for a while before realising something: it was rather bright considering no other stars were visible, and appeared to be flickering slightly. I looked closer, making out what I think to be the shape of a disc. I looked around to see if there were anymore, to my relief and dissapointment I saw none.However, when I looked back I glimpsed as another seemed to shoot straight out of it and dissapear in moments. Of course, at this I knew something was awry.It dissapeared for a while, at which I thought I was imagining things. But, it returned, along with another, brighter one flying lower to underneath the other with flashing lights. I disgarded it as a helicopter, thinking maybe all was well.

At 6:05pm I was driving west on SW Taylors Ferry Rd. toward SW Washington Drive when I saw a strange set of lights fly overhead.  These lights fit almost perfectly the description of a &quot;Black Triangle&quot;, three white lights creating an equilateral triangle with a single red light in the middle of the other three.  I could not make out any structures on the object.I slowed down and almost stopped my car as I watched it go behind the trees.  I felt the urge to follow it but the speed was too great to match in a residential area and it was traveling in a direction I could not easily follow.  In all I saw the object for about 10 seconds before it went out of view.  I immediately drove to my brother&apos;s house a few blocks away and told him what happened.  We went outside to look but did not see anything else.My Thought Process:  At first I thought it was a low flying plane and thought nothing of it.  Then as it flew overhead I thought, Hey, that looks like the general description of a black-triangle UFO,  I should figure out what type of plane has those light patterns so I can debunk it, and began consciously trying to make out a conventional aircraft shape and patterns.  As I failed to make out any familiar aircraft to go with this light pattern I began to realize I might be looking at something much more unique.Object Description:  Four lights total; three white lights creating an equilateral triangle and a fourth red light at the center of all three.  All the lights were steady with no flashes or pulsation, constant brightness.  They did not move in relation to another.  These lights were pointed down toward the ground, they were not pointed forward (as might be typical of an aircraft flying at night).The white lights appeared around the same color temperature and appearance of a typical halogen bulb.  The red light appeared to be white light that had been filtered to red.  Although vivid, it was not monochromatic (such as a red LED or laser light), it looked more like a red-filtered stage light.  There were no strobe or marker lights.I cannot say for certain what the body/structure of the object looked like.  It was dark with little ambient light surrounding it and none of the light emitted was self-illuminating.  I would like to say I saw a black triangular structure but I cannot be certain.  However, I was consciously trying to match a airplane shapes and patterns to what I saw and failed.Size was approximately 30 ft between each white light.Object Flight: 10-15 degrees West of North traveling with constant speed, direction, and elevation. Approximately double the tree height, so around 200 ft above ground.  I would estimate speed between 60-80 MPH. It seemed to keep perfect alignment with the horizon with no visible rolling.  Object was leading with an edge of the equilateral triangle created by the white lights, while the final &quot;point&quot; of the triangle was pointing in the direction opposite of travel.Other Notes: I was in the car with the music on and windows up.  I did not hear anything unusual as it went overhead.  I have a Camaro with T-Tops, so I could watch it fly overhead through the t-tops. There were no electrical or any other disturbances as it flew overhead.My Background: I am a 23 year old male. Graduate of Mechanical Engineering.  Native of the Beaverton area in which the sighting occurred.", "Several UFO&apos;s sighted near the big dipperI was deer hunting on the morning of the aforementioned date and it was still completely dark when I got to my deer stand.  The deer stand is a 12&rsquo; tripod that has a 360 degree swivel chair and can be covered by a canvas; except the canvas was off and only the metal frame was around me. While sitting, at chest height there is a square bar that goes all around me and is connected to the floor by four vertical bars. Four metal bars are connected to this chest high bar at each corner and extend up where they are connected at the top by another square bar. The very top has two bars that form a cross, connected to each other in the middle and topping off the entire frame. This cross of the bars forms 4 &lsquo;quadrants&rsquo; that I separated the sky with as I was looking at stars.I was facing the northwest looking at the upside down big dipper and a group of stars below it. The group of stars (I&rsquo;ll call reference stars) occupied about the same space as the big dipper, but is shaped as such: two stars lined up on a horizontal axis between the ground and the big dipper at about the same distance away from the big dipper as the width of the top of the pot on the big dipper. Two other stars sit on a vertical axis off to the right of this; the top star is about underneath the second star of the handle of the big dipper at about the same distance as the stars on the handle of the big dipper are from each other. In between the vertical stars there appeared an object about halfway between them and to the right. The horizontal stars &quot;pointed&quot; right to this center object. Again, the vertical and horizontal stars were the reference points I used to verify movement.As I was looking at the big dipper and seeing &lsquo;twinkles&rsquo; of stars and some shooting stars all around me, I saw the twinkle of the object that appeared to be a star. As I stared and focused on this twinkling star I noticed it was slightly moving in random directions, but maintaining its presence within a very small area. If you were to look briefly at the &lsquo;big picture&rsquo; it would just appear as a regular star. As I watched this object to continually verify to myself that this object was indeed moving, I saw another twinkling of an object just to the left of this one and another tiny &quot;star-like&quot; object appeared. This object darted to my lower left in a straight line as a shooting star would do and slowed to a near stop next to a couple of very faint stars. It moved randomly as the first star was doing and then disappeared. I strained for a few minutes to see it, but it was definitely gone.As I looked back at the first object I identified I noticed that it was still moving ever so slightly in a random fashion, yet maintaining its presence in a very small area, relative to my eyesight. At that point I saw another twinkle in about the same place as the previous one and yet another star-like object appeared. This object flashed as a twinkle and its glow went back to the same brightness as an &ldquo;average&rdquo; star. It then traveled in an easterly direction in a not-so-straight line. As I was looking at this object and looking back and forth at this one and the first one I lost it because it picked up its speed, got very dim and then disappeared. I lost it when it got about the same distance away as the one that moved in the other direction from the point of origin. Several times I focused in on other stars and verified to myself that they were indeed staying still, and the objects in question were definitely moving.At this point I got my binoculars out; Bushnell 16 x 32 (188ft. at 1000 yards). These are small binoculars so it was difficult to focus and maintain a steady position. At a couple of points I was able to focus in on the object for a couple of seconds to see what I would describe as a spinning &lsquo;ying and yang&rsquo; symbol. It was spinning counter-clockwise. I lost focus on the object and couldn&rsquo;t regain focus so I leaned my head back and rested it on the corner bar behind me to get steady without the binoculars. I stared at this object for a long time, thought deeply about it and witnessed continual movement in an area tiny enough to conceal its movements; if I stuck my arm out in front of me and made a one inch square it would have stayed within that one inch square. It almost got out of alignment a couple of times in reference to the other vertical and horizontal stars, but still maintained its presence in a very small area.This activity continued until it started getting daylight and I lost sight of all stars.  I eventually shifted my focus back on hunting and later told my friend in camp about my encounter.  It was as if these objects came in through our atmosphere in a flash all in the same general area, and then moved in their respective directions.  So I just continued to look at the first object. It not only helped to have the stars as reference points, but the bars that crossed at the top of my deer stand also provided a stationary reference.  The wind was calm, and the morning was absolutely clear.  I had Lasik surgery in my left eye about 7 years ago that vastly improved my vision.  I witnessed several shooting stars that morning, but there is no doubt in my mind that what I witnessed, by definition, was several unidentified flying objects.  It wasn&rsquo;t a close encounter by any means, but it convinced me that someone or something is among us either as a hidden residence or as a visitor.  I now believe and I will never look to the sky in the same way ever again.", "in january 2008 i reported a sighting to your website. I just read that you called it a hoax.  Now who is the genius who makes that  call, hoax or non hoax.  If its hard for you to believe what i said to be truth, then you are  definitely not ready for these visitors.((NUFORC Note:  Source does not indicate which report is his/hers, so we are unable to review it.

We were facing south and although it was quite high in the sky, there were noticeable red and blue flashing lights. At first we thought it might just be a chopper, but it was completely silent.  It hovered there for a few hours and then seemed to just vanish.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius?  PD))", "Red Light seen in Lawrence, Kansas, during Johnny Carson&apos;s MonologueI don&apos;t remember the exact date since it was over 20 years ago but I saw something that I could not find any reason to exist save for being a UFO of some sort.I saw a light appear in the sky while I was watching my small (about 10-inch) black and white TV as I was getting ready to go to sleep.  The time is about right because I was watching Johnny Carson&apos;s monologue.  An ad break came on, so I just glanced outside and this is when I saw an orange-red ball of light &quot;hovering&quot; in the sky.  I stared at it for a moment, then leaned up to get a better look at it.  At that point, it zoomed away toward the left side of the window (which would equate to a northerly direction of movement) but returned when I lay back down on the pillow.  I looked around my room to see what might be causing a reddish reflection in the window but there was nothing.  I looked back at the window again and found that the ball was still just hovering there.  Testing again that it was something in the room, I leaned forward again and it zoomed off again, as before, and returned when I lay back down.  I tried it again and it zoomed away yet again but not to the left (north).  Instead, it dashed away nearly straight up and did not return when I put my head back on the pillow.  I tried sitting up and down a few more times but it didn&apos;t return.  At that point, as I had missed most of Johnny&apos;s monologue, I shut off the TV and went to sleep.The next night, during the monologue, the object returned.  We went through the same ritual again but for less time this night: on the second sit-up from the pillow, it zoomed off and away again.This repeated for the next few nights but then never returned.There were no street lights that could explain this as there was only one light in the area and that was almost directly beneath where the sphere was seen.  It couldn&apos;t have been someone with a laser pointer since they were not common two decades ago and it would not explain the type of motion that I witnessed.  Further, I did hold up my hand to see if it was broadcasting a confined beam of light, such as a flashlight might project and nothing of that nature was in evidence.  I also made sure two of the nights that everything in the bedroom was shut off and unplugged.  (At the time, that included only my TV, which had no LEDs as it was an old-style dial TV with a built-in antenna, an alarm clock/radio, and an Apple //c computer with external SupraModem 2400 dial-up modem.)  The bedroom door was closed, so no light sources from another room were possible.I have no idea what it was but am convinced that it was not something as easily explained as a reflection or a terrestrial aircraft, not with the flight characteristics that the movements implied.  Thus, this, to my mind, equates to an unidentified flying object.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "it was dark and i was standing outside in front of my house and all of a sudden i saw a bright light coming towards me i watched it as it got closer to me so i called out to my family and they came running to see it only for a few seconds as it dissappeared into thin air i couldnt make out what shape it had because the light was so bright. i always ask myself this question what would happen if no one had come to see what i was talking about.i know i was being watched by someone in that spacecraft, i hope i never have that experience again.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We lived there until my father got a promotion in 1985. We then moved to Warren, OH, where I lived until the beginning of 2000.  I was an above average student in High School (class of 1995), but never aspired to go to college.  I started work at a local pizza shop in the beginning of 1996.On December 31 1997,  I got off of work shortly after 8 pm.  I already had several guests waiting at my apartment on the other side of town to celebrate the New Year.  It was an over-cast night with no precipitation at that time.   I always took the outer-belt Route 82 East to get home, that night was no different.  I was just past the Elm Rd exit on the part of the highway that goes north-south when I looked up and saw it.It was approximately 8:30 pm.  I saw what at first I thought was a row of floodlights slowly heading west across the sky in front of me.I looked closer because the lights were a different color and quantity than the floodlights I usually saw in the sky on cloudy nights.  What I was looking at was a giant boomerang shaped aircraft with a dozen large blue lights across the rear.  More interesting was the fact that it was just above the bottom of the cloud ceiling, and I could see the clouds rolling under it and around the front out-lining the shape of this &quot;UFO&quot;.The blue lights were round in shape and a hazed blue color.  The lights alone were the size of the Hercules C-130 airplanes that fly out of the Vienna Air Force base on daily flight patterns over the area (at least at that time).  One of my best friends at the time, his father was a mechanic in the Air Force at that base.  I went to many air shows with them and saw the largest military plane at that time and it was nowhere near as large as what I saw that night.  It covered the sky from the top of my windshield to just above the horizon.  It had to be at least 2000 feet across but probably larger.The experience lasted about 15 seconds, so it had to be moving slower than current physics would allow to keep something that massive aloft. The highway is hemmed on both sides by tall trees and hills making it difficult to see the sky beyond.", "floating light over ashtabula county, ohioAt about 6pm on a cloudy evening, While driving to my home, I saw an oblong-saucer shaped pale white light, about 5-6 ft. long over route 20, west of Conneaut, making  very wide circles.

Coming right at us overhead was a beautiful silver cylinder, about 100 to 150 feet long at about 8,000- 10,000 feet.  It was perfectly round, in the shape of a big jet; no cockpit, no wings, no engines and no noise were noticeable. We watched it for about 20 to 30 seconds and right above us it entered into a small cloud bank and never exited.  It was gone! All of this happened so suddenly and unexpectedly, we were shocked and since there was no one else nearby; we did not ask if anyone else saw what we had seen.  We were pretty much speechless for a while.", "I also just previously logged my first sighting. I was not going to document anything until I seen what I had seen tonight.(I had also written a log for 12/06/2008 in Front Royal.)  My husband and I were sitting in the living room watching Comcast on Demand, and from the bay window, another fire ball like object, like the one I had seen before, streaked across the sky and downward as though it were falling.  This Object was much closer then the last fireball like object I had seen, only it was not green.  It was a bright white with a tint of yellow.  It&apos;s tail was also longer.  It only remained in my view for about 5 seconds or so, not long at all.

I was outside smoking and watching highflying planes flying from west to east, I like to watch planes late at night coming out of Memphis or going into Memphis to land.This morning though while watching two jets that were miles away and could only barely be seen an object with &quot;swirling&quot; (the only way I can describe them) red lights on it&rsquo;s ends swooped through my field of view.It was a cylinder but flying long ways, not straight along its axis.  It had to be less than a half-mile away and was very fast yet silent. I could see it&rsquo;s outline and could tell it was under control of something, it was flying with a pourpose and not just falling or streaking through the sky.  It seemed to make a sloping turn during the short time I saw it.It flew behind a tree in my backyard and did not emerge on the other side.  I scanned the sky for a long time afterwards looking for it but never saw it or anything similar again.Over the past 5 years I have nightly gone outside to smoke, since I don&rsquo;t smoke in the house.

As we sat and waited for my car to get warm, I noticed a peculiarly bright light in the Western sky. The light caught my attention initially because it was the brightest light in the sky, much brighter than any of the stars. But then as I sat and watched it, I noticed it was traveling incredibly akward to be a plane. First off, it was traveling left to right, then remaining stationary (hovering like a helicopter), then continuing to take off again, sort of zig-zagging. As it proceeded this routine, I ran back inside and grabbed my digital camera and batteries (nothing substantial seemed to come out, but they&apos;re open for review). I did notice, however, as i tried to focus on the object with the camera, i could clearly see a purple, cyan, blue alternating color pattern (this could just be coincidental, but even with the naked eye an alternating strobe could be seen).All in all, I&apos;m not saying it was ever close enough for me to say it was an alien craft or UFO. I am, however, asking for an explination for the object I most certainly witnessed in the sky.

Then, I saw a bright orange light ascend from the ground in the distance, as if a firework, prompting me to say, &quot;Dad, look, there is a firework.&quot;  However, this &lsquo;firework&rsquo; did not set of, but continued to rise, prompting me once again to say, &quot;Maybe it is a flare instead?&quot; However, the light quickly diverted to the left, towards the sea and continued to gain in height and in distance. We stopped and I opened the door hoping for a noise of some sort, only to hear a nearby plane, to which this light had increased its speed and quite possibly travelling up to, if not faster than the speed of light.  Another surprising issue was how bright the light was in comparison to stars and lights from planes nearby.  No sooner had 3 minutes past, when the light faded and disappeared in the distance.   Seeing it the air alone was weird, therefore, seeing it &lsquo;take-off&rsquo; from land or somewhere below skyline and then continue to fly away seemed even more of an intriguing suspicion of it being a UFO.", "Sphere accelerates at high rate.I was coming home from morning work along on I-40 headed east.

I might&rsquo;ve thought they were jets if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that they left no trail of exhaust.  They both simply appeared in the sky and dropped down on the vertical plane of vision while changing shape and floating down, kind of like a feather does.  The first one disappeared outright, just fading out of the sky.  I may have lost sight of the second one only because it flew further west(?) behind a cloud.

I was walking with my best friend from my house to his house in a subdivision outside of town.  We stopped in the middle of the street to look for shooting stars.  We found a few lights in the far distance that looked like airplanes without the flashing lights, but their behavior was strange.  The first one we found while looking to the north.  It moved a few degrees through the sky then stopped. A smaller light came from inside of it and went the same distance from its parent.  After a minute it returned to its parent and it continued to fly away.We continued to look around and we saw a bright white light over the eastern tree line.  At first we just assumed it was a light on a tower, but after walking a bit more then turning around again it was noticeably brighter.  We stared at it as it got bigger and bigger until we realized it wasn&rsquo;t growing, it was approaching.  We ran westward down the street to my friend&rsquo;s driveway, just a few hundred feet away. By the time we got there the object was above the street coming toward us.I told my friend to run inside and find a camera.  He ran inside screaming and his 5 year old brother came running outside to see what was going on.  A few seconds behind him was their mother who was in her late thirties.  My friend came back out without a camera to see what the object was doing.  By this time it was hovering directly above us at the height of a two story house.The object was hovering above us long enough for us to discuss it&rsquo;s attributes.  It was a black triangle shape with four lights, 3 white and one red.  The white lights were at the corners and the red light was centered on it&rsquo;s underside.  There was a low humming sound, but nothing more.  No wind, no engine noise, and no movement.  We knew it couldn&rsquo;t be an airplane because it was hovering and we knew it wasn&rsquo;t a helicopter because it was almost completely silent.  After about 2 minutes of hovering it simply tilted up slightly, probably about 25 degrees, and flew away at a very fast speed heading straight west above the tree line.((NUFORC Note:  Witness suggests  that date of incident may be approximate.

Maybe it was just a plane, but if it was, I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s any plane the public is aware of. Plus, the light was constant.  It never blinked or fluttered.

It looked as if something was entering the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.

The black object continued to move in a westward direction. I arrived at a stoplight and kept watching as the black object slowly moved across the sky towards the west until I could no longer see it behind trees and buildings.

I was really trying to get a good look at it, but unfortunately was still driving a car and couldn&apos;t focus on it that well. It may have even been moving to the side left to right-right to left a little, just the front of the object (from my view it seemed like it).When I arrived home, I rushed inside to write down all that had just happened. My little sister suggested that it may have been a balloon, but I do not believe that a balloon could move across the sky the way that this object did. We went outside to see if we could find any trace of it but couldn&apos;t. The only thing that we noticed was towards the west we saw a stream of smoke which looked like the remnants of an airplane passing through.Later that night, on the News, there were people reporting sightings of fireballs in the sky and there was a photo of a stream of smoke which was left behind by the &ldquo;fireball&rdquo;.

In those days I drank and abused soft drugs.  As I and my friend were under the age of 21 and our parents did not condone this type of activity, we participated in a classic American teenage ritual known as &ldquo;road tripping&rdquo; where you drive around all evening drinking and listening to music.One place in particular where we liked to stop was at a small tree nursery off the Iola black top between Farina and Iola IL.  The truck was facing east.  We liked to stop there because it was out of the way and it was very unlikely, if not impossible for any John Q law types to be patrolling, or concerned with.  It was here that our route, which started west of St. Peter IL, reached its&rsquo; intermission.  This means, it is where we finished half of the case of beer and always felt the need to peak the buzz w/ soft drugs in the form of a, marijuana joint.  The custom with my friends was if you couldn&rsquo;t roll a J then you had to break it up.It was a winter month in 1997 at 22:00 to 23:00 hrs, when my friend completed his task of preparing enough marijuana for a joint.  He then presented it to me to roll.  I took the plate and all my concentration was on the rolling process.   Just as I am finishing my task I hear him belt out &ldquo;what the f/;&rsquo; was that&rdquo; I look up off of the plate but see nothing.  My friend was a nice guy, but always had a reputation for pulling our legs or being reckless with the truth. What was what I asked?  He said &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t see that?&rdquo; see what I asked? He was some what hysterical and clearly not acting for a gag or joke. A big f/;&rsquo;ing flaming eyeball just floated by. I laugh and give him some pretty heavy static.  He said &ldquo;no way man not this time a big f&rsquo;;.ing flaming eye ball just floated by it zipped this way and then slowly floated across the horizon.  I still look at him like he is crazy &ldquo;bullshit,&rdquo; I said.  He continued with his rants of the flaming ball or &ldquo;eyeball&rdquo; flooded with the heavy use of superlatives. I by this time have finished the joint giving him more shit saying the weed wasn&rsquo;t that good and so on.  I never saw the first sighting that he did but soon learned he was clearly telling the truth.I left the tree nursery and turned left on the Iola blacktop back towards Farina IL.  Just after the turn onto the blacktop as if whatever it was could hear the shit I was laying on my friend, we both see a glow way out in the stars above us. It happened in slow motion, like a car wreck but was instantaneous, because I only had started pointing at it. There was no time to say do you see that, but we both could not take our eyes off of the glowing reddish, purplish, aura, that was way out there, like a star itself, kind of spinning or flickering.  In the same instant it was glowing and we were looking at it. It streaked from that fixed point right over us off to the right in an acute angle it seemed to remain in the sky but didn&rsquo;t, like the shutter speed of the mind was slower than what happened. It made an acute angle and nothing made by man could do what we saw.  I never saw a craft per-say but the effect of one. The streak it made was elongated in blue red and finally yellow it made an acute angle roughly 60* and again, it was instantaneous.  We both were speechless &ldquo;now do you f*(%ing believe me&rdquo;  he yelled.  I stated that two people could not experience the same graphic hallucination. The government might have experimental craft but nothing could defy physical natural law like what we saw.  &ldquo;No f*#ing shit&rdquo; he said definitely an unidentified object.  We both clearly agreed it was not of the material realm we are apart of, because it did not observe physical laws.He wanted to tell the other friends when we got back to town.  I made him rationalize that people already had an opinion of him as a bullshitter, and I didn&rsquo;t want to be perceived as crazy, or a liar seeking attention, so I told him if he told any one I would kick his ass. He and I had a falling out but I have never told anyone what we saw that clear winter night.   I was instantly transformed from curious skeptic to believer on that night.  Since, doing pot and drinking and driving are illegal, I knew this story would never be taken seriously anyway. However, the sighting was very real. It made me think about the possibility of inter-dimensions rather than linear travel of them they it or whatever. Due to the way it was there for him, and then way out there like beyond the distance of the moon and instantly over us and so forth.

I was driving on Nevada Avenue 10-days after my sighting.  I noticed a craft moving from West to East over the mountain &amp; then move back from East to West at a very calm speed.  It keeped going in the direction towards Alamosa Colorado (Northwest).   In 2007 when Colorado was hit by a massive snow storm for Christmas 2007 &amp; the New Year of 2008.  Several witnesses including myself observed a craft hovering Northwest of Trinidad, over a-little town known as Hoehne 10-miles out of Trinidad.  The craft seemed to be studying our weather that fell on our town.  It hovered in the same spot for about 3-5 minutes.  It moved East to West, then it was gone.  The area I had seen the first sighting is closed off to the public.  No one is allowed up there, only certain vehicles &amp; people are permitted up there.  I was curious to go up &amp; see if I could find anything from the first sighting.  But they didn&apos;t allow me up there.

I looked down and it appeared just beneath Orion as if it just winked into existence.  It was just above the tree lines and very large, I can not judge distance and size very well, so this is just as close as I can figure... Above the tree tops but way too low to be at helicopter height or airplane height.  It was just above a 12 story tall building.  I hope you understand this, I&apos;m still really shaken by it.  Freaked.   All of the above, I&apos;ve never ever seen anything like this before.Anyways, it was a perfect triangular shape (the lights from the street illuminated it slightly and it was darker than the night sky behind it), black in color, with three very large lights on each tip of the triangle.  It moved at a very steady pace that I could easily follow with my eyes, above the tree line, and for about two-three blocks down  the street.  The lights were very, very dimmed... like they were on the lowest they could go without being turned completely out but they were illuminating absolutely nothing. the lights looked like they were slightly bulbous and not streamlined with the rest of the .. craft?   It flew straight down the street, didn&apos;t spin, nor did the lights come on and the entire thing, during the entire time it was completely and utterly silent.  I could hear the highway in the background, cars a few streets over but it was like someone pushed a mute button on this thing.I watched it fly down the couple of blocks and then it just went completely black again.  Just gone.Also, about 3-4 minutes later, both my sister and I witnessed two helicopters in the vicinity; one flying toward where the object disappeared and one that was circling around the area.  It was too dark to tell what kind of helicopters they were.  I did not see them again.Both my sister and brother-in-law have seen this same object.  One just the other night on highway 85 from Denver, Colorado and my sister saw the same thing on the same occasion.I&apos;m going to go out tomorrow and sketch the area from the point of view where I was sitting and draw in the object how I saw it from that point.  Maybe that will help determine the size.My background?  I do paranormal investigations.  I can handle ghosts, intelligent and residual, nature spirits, poltergeist activity and even the nastier things that go bump in the night... but I was always afraid of 2 things that get lumped into the paranormal category and one of them is UFOs so I never study them.  I was much happier when I was in denial, thank you very much.Directly afterward I called my friend, who is a paranormal investigator and reporter and left him a voice mail message on his cellphone (freaking out) telling him to call me right away.  About 15 minutes later he called me and told me that he thinks I saw &quot;what the British call a Silent Vulcan&quot; and to go to this website and file a report with Peter Davenport.  And since he&apos;s into the UFO side of things and I&apos;m not, I listened to him.", "2 light shapes moving in a pattern at incredible speed.At about 22:00 on the night of 12/6/08 I was walking on the West side of Los Angeles when I saw 2 oval like light shapes in the sky first moving in a crossing pattern around each other at what appeared to be tremendous speed.  Occasionally, the pattern broke off in to what appeared to be random movements and then returned to the pattern.  At one point 2 additional identical light shapes appeared in the sky, joined the criss cross pattern and disappeared shortly after.At first the lights were visible in the sky to the south and east of me, but at one point moved north and west for a brief time, continuing in the same pattern. But then returned to the south and east of me and remained there.The sky was partly cloudy that night, and the lights stayed behind the cloud cover.  So when I first saw them, I thought they might be the kind of spotlights that you see in the sky at big events.  But these were different because there was no beam of light from the ground that you usually see with those. And they were moving exponentially faster than the typical spotlight in the sky display.  They were also not ciruclar like the spotlights usually are.  When the 2 light shapes were moving through the sky, they would occasionally change direction, appearing to basically turn on a dime at incredibly high speed.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like it and am at a loss for what it could be.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Just sitting talking, I noticed that these objects were in a strange tumbling appearance and no sound, no blinking, just red lights that moved in a strange silent geometric pattern.  We see plenty of aircraft, both military &amp; civilian, and this looked like none of that.  Neither of us could make out just how these lights were attached because of the way they &apos;tumbled&apos;.  The other witness thought the lights looked like they were rotating in a circle, but I thought they looked sort of like tumbling cubes with each red light at the cubes corners.  We could not see any body, just these slow moving silent oddly tumbling lights crossing the sky.  It took several minutes for the lights to go out of view in the SW sky.  They moved very steadily and with no obvious perpective (like wings or landing light).  They were very large looking together, but with no sound at all, it was difficult to tell how far away they were.  They moved so slowly we had time to discuss what we were looking at and over the course of minutes, we couldn&apos;t figure what it was we were lookint at.  From top to bottom there was a large span and from side to side as well, but they looked like they were equidistant from each other at all times.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

For the duration of the cloud cover I saw the same lights.  They look almost like what would be car headlights in fog but they rotated stationary over the house - lights facing outward.  No actual craft/vehicle/source can be seen, only the lights reflecting from above the clouds.

This is my third sighting of this strange light in the skies above our park.  It traveled from East to West very slowly with no sound.   I watched and took pictures of it for 30 minutes as it passed over my head and out of view into the distance.  My Dad was with me this time and brought his binoculars.  Looking through the binoculars I could see some type of light around something moving.  It appeared to change colors from blue to white.  In the photos you can only see a small point of light.  I tried to zoom in on the photos to see if I could see more details, no luck.   One of the pictures surprised me, it shows at least 7 lights or orb&rsquo;s.  This picture was taken when the light was above my head and I was under a tree.  I remembered that moment because when I looked at the light with my eyes it appeared to change color and shape or something.  It was so high up and you really couldn&rsquo;t see a lot of details, but something was different.

It happened when I was an early teen, but I remember that I still didn&apos;t have my drivers licence yet (I got it at 15 years old). That narrows it down to 1976 to 1978. Sorry. It&apos;s the best I can do. The month is also an estimate. I remember it being a moonless warm night.)  My friend and I were about 14 and 17 respectively and on a clear night we were outside in his back yard looking through his telescope.  To our north, we saw five pale green spherical lights that were in a chevron pattern traveling due south at about 100 MPH, or less (estimate). At first, it seemed like lights outlining a single craft; but as they passed directly over our heads, we could clearly make out stars in between the &quot;Spheres&quot; of light. We realized that we were looking at 5 separate craft. We were both (and still are) aviation fanatics. Both were taking flying/glider lessons and I was a later a member of the Civil Air Patrol. These spheres made no sound, had no exhaust traces or trails. They were not aircraft of any kind as we knew them. To estimate their size, I would say that if you held up a baseball at arms length, it would approximate their size (each) to the eye. My friends yard is on the highest hill in the area. So, as they passed south of us, we could get a better estimate of size/altitude. It was late night so this is still very much an estimate: They were about 50-60 feet in diameter each. They were about 50 feet apart and were about 600 to 800 feet in the air. As they passed over the next neighborhood south of us, one of the spheres lit an incredibly white light. It first pointed out to the right (east), then immediately aimed (snapped)down at something on the ground. We were astonished! As we watched, the spheres continued to travel south and the beam stayed &quot;locked&quot; on whatever it was it was being aimed at. That is to say, the beam stayed &quot;locked&quot; on one position on the ground as the spheres continued to move away. We could see it (the light) changing angle and broadening as they (the spheres) got further away. It (the light)then snapped off as fast as it had came on. Within 2 minutes, they had passed below the horizon/tree line to our south and we lost sight of them. Then all hell broke loose. 2 F-4 Phantom fighters came screaming in from the Gulf of Mexico just to the south of us and we heard a double sonic boom. The following few days had various reports in the St. Pete Times about jets going after an unidentified &quot;small aircraft&quot;, people seeing strange lights in the sky along the coast and the windows in a Grants Department Store in New Port Richey, Florida had its front windows blown out by the sonic booms. My friend called Macdill AFB the next day, which is a TAC base and asked about the goings on. He was told by a gentleman on the phone that the jets came from Tyndall AFB in Panama City. When asked why from so far away when we had the same jets at Macdill, his reply was something to the effect of: &quot;We just wanted to get there the fastest, with the mostest.&quot; He gave no further help. These booms also caused a crack in my friends ceiling that remains to this day. I&apos;ve searched the St. Pete Times archives and can find nothing about the windows being blown out, or the sightings up and down the west coast that night, but I distinctly remember these events and the &quot;shaken&quot; locals of my (then) small seaside town.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

I did though contact the local police department to inform them of what I had seen as well as to inquire as to if anyone else viewed this activity. On the evening of Thursday, October 9, 2008 I was on my way home from the store and noticed in the southern sky 3 white lights in a row. I immediately called my father and he informed me that it was most likely a blimp as one had been seen in the area earlier in the day. Assuming that was the case I pulled into my driveway fully expecting to see the outline of the blimp as it was a clear night and the lights were very close to the ground. In an instant the lights moved westward and then seemed to disappear in the western sky. Due to the speed in which the vehicle reached a blimp is discounted. It is important to note that there was no sound when this happened yet the movement was quick and fluid.

In less than 10 seconds it dropped and came directly at us, almost straight on. In what seemed like only a very few seconds it was on us covering literally miles in only a few seconds and it&apos;s emense size literally covered and engulfed our 1979 Gray Chevy pickup. The first fear was of a head on collision. The absolute shock and fear was indescribable. At this point we were both covered in a brilliant and unbelievable lime/florescent green light that completely blocked out any view outside the truck. We were both completely illuminated in green light. At this point I was in complete un describable terror and total shock like I have never known before or since. I turned to my now ex wife literally screaming with out hearing myself, wondering if I was personally going insane or God knows what only to see her in the exact same state I was in. The look of terror on her face was some thing, much like the entire event, that is so vividly etched in my memory.Ok now this is the part that haunts me every day of my life since. My next memory and hers seems like literally a second later from one of shear terror is one of &quot;Hmmm that was weird&quot;, and looking at her being totally calm and myself the same way. Our truck was in the exact same place on the highway going 60 miles per hour just as it was when we were in total terror what seemed like only a split second before. There was on my part no swerving or even time to react before we went from complete shock to Hmmm that was interesting. We both watched the green oval object fly off in a south west direction, more southerly than it had approached, over the trees and off into the far distance and up into the sky disappearing from sight as it seemed to climb far off in the distance. We continued the last 3 miles to our house on Loop rd.We did not have a watch or a car clock. When we got home it was 9 o&apos;clock. Then I was even more confused. Where had the near hour gone?

My mind heard the words, not my ears.I backed off the accelerator and slowed slightly while the creature completed its brisk upright walk across the road from right to left (south to north) and up the cut bank on my left.At no time did the creature break stride or exhibit any difficulty managing the steep terrain, especially going up the man-made and much steeper cut.  It was as it stepped onto the pavement that it regarded my presence and sent its order not to hurt it.Had I so desired, I could have run it down.

It was clothed in a neat double-breasted tight fitting or tailored suit with matching pants and a flat-brimmed hat. Exposed skin was exactly the same color as the clothing (sky blue). I could see no wrinkles or folds as the creature progressed across my path.The creature had almond-shaped eyes and a tiny mouth but otherwise was basically human size and human shaped.During my next trip through that stretch of road, two days later, I parked and examined the spot where the creature had emerged.  The terrain is steep with native trees and Chaparral, which makes a difficult hike for anyone, yet this creature had no difficulty climbing it. I also tried to climb up the 5-6 foot cut bank but could not scramble up without clawing and grabbing handholds and footholds, yet the creature easily strode up the angled hillside upright without straining.I felt no fear at the time and I wish I had taken the time to try to communicate with it but driving at that location takes concentration.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My view was partially obstructed by trees, but I clearly saw some distinct lights quite low to the ground.There were three white lights in a horizontal row, the middle light was the largest and brightest and most directly focused toward me.  The shape of the object was difficult to discern completely because of the brightness of the lights and the fact that the lights were reflecting off of some kind of slight smoke or haziness.  It appeared to be either a stunted oblong shape or a slightly rounded diamond shape.  It stayed practically stationary the whole time, but would occasionally sway horizontally to one side or the other.

I got scared and came inside.", "Night sky lights up entirely for brief moment then returns to normal with no explaination.I was in the passenger side of a vehicle, parked to the side of a gravel road, in the middle of nowhere. The driver and I had been parked there for about 1 hour. It was shortly after midnight on a cloudless, moonlit, night. Directly outside the passenger window, about four feet away, a medium height, wire fence, ran parallel to the vehicle. Beyond the fence is an open meadow for about 150-200 yards and after that a distant treeline. There is a single tree, approximately 25 feet high, visible to me through the passenger window, about 50 feet ahead of the vehicle and 40 feet behind the fence.I was looking out of the passenger window. Instantly, the entire world lit up, plain as day. all around. I could see everything, in bright color, as if the noon sun were shining. This may have lasted one second at the most. I don&apos;t remember if I could tell where the light came from as it happened, but afterward I could. It was like when someone takes your picture in a dark room. You have the after image of the flash in your eyes. You see purple and red and blue spots for a few seconds and then they&apos;re gone. Well, after the flash I could see a large after image, further into the field than the single tree, and higher in the sky. It lasted for about three seconds. The after image itself resembled a prismatic tear in open space, stretching about 45 feet in length, and about 30 feet off the ground. The image got smaller every second it lasted until it vanished all together.There were no sparks, smoke, thunder, flames, heat, sound, electric equipment around, no power lines, no way to explain it away and it left no traces that I could see. It was not particularly scary, but it was definitely intense. As soon as we could gather our wits we left.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

They then went out.  The whole time taken was about a quarter hour, more or less.

This is my first report of an unidentified object seen in the sky.On 11-25-08 at about 7:15 p.m., I was shutting my backyard gate in the dark, facing west towards Elk Ridge (in the Blue Ridge Mts., about 1400 ft. elevation) which runs roughly southwest to northeast.   As I looked up, I saw a lighted object rapidly descending at about a 45 degree angle below the ridge line at a very rapid rate of speed.  I only saw it for about three seconds before it dropped behind the roof line of a neighbor&rsquo;s house.  The object&rsquo;s speed was much faster than planes, helicopters, or fireworks that are occasionally seen in the area.  My estimation is that the lighted object was in the valley, about &frac12; to 1 mile from my house.The lighted object was oblong in shape, wider at the end headed downward, like an elongated teardrop.  In relation to how the moon appears in our sky, the length was about the diameter of the moon, with a tail of more diffused light extending further out.  The width was about a third of the moon&rsquo;s diameter.  The color reminded me of a Halloween glow-stick, so it had a florescent look.  The only sound I noted was that of distant barking dogs, off to the northeast towards the ridge.I have never seen anything like this before.  The lighted object was seen with the mountain range as a back drop.   I am frequently outside, day and night, caring for horses and have a familiarity with the sights and sounds of the area.

They flew across again and then straight upwards again, then across.  The objects then went out of view, due to a Tower block.

I was looking toward the Southwest and my wife was looking toward the Northwest. It was light enough that the sky still had blue color in it. All of a sudden I saw a single round white-glowing object with a whitish tail going at a very high rate of speed from the East going towards the West. The object looked about the size of a pea at arms length and its tail length was approximately 10 times the size of the object. The tail size was the same as the object at its start and tapered to a point. In other words, the tail was cone shaped. It was just a glowing white object without any other features.The object was at about a 35 degree angle from where I was sitting. It was traveling at such high rate of speed that by the time I told my wife to look, it was gone. It was traveling in a straight line from East to West.I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of &ldquo;shooting stars&rdquo; and satellites in the California Mohave Desert near China Lake and their behavior was entirely different from what I saw yesterday evening.

I was only about 12 years old.  The UFO, had yellow and orange lights on it.  I haven&apos;t seen anything like this since; except for pictures on the Web.  The object seemed to appear out of no where. Later on I would read about cow mutilations and thought it was pretty strange because there were cows over there where the UFO was at. I can remember this very vividly in my mind. It was sort of like a disk; but it&apos;s like I could tell how it was moving. It was dark outside and a good distance away from me so I wasn&apos;t able to make out details. I was so completely astonished I didn&apos;t know what to say. I remember thinking, the flashing of the lights reminded me of the ships from the movie Close Encounters. I didn&apos;t tell anybody I saw it at the time. I didn&apos;t think they would believe me and accuse me of making things up for attention or something. I went inside real quick (my parents and I were visiting our neighbors) and then stepped back out... And I was gone. I remember feeling like they wanted to see me, like they were checking up on me. After that I was consumed with an extreme urge to do advanced math, and discuss so many things which were beyond my level (Supposedly) I felt like I had this mission.

Prior to this I haven&apos;t ever reported any of my sightings except one and got no response or acknowledgment for it. So to this day I still don&apos;t know to make of it. I have 3 more sightings if your interested, email me anytime. I can only guess when this 2nd sighting was, which I attempted to describe to in the form I filled out to the best of my ability.  I was still in Elementary school at the time, so it had to have been about 1994-95.

I was between Spalding Rd. and Holcomb Bridge Rd around 2 pm.  I saw a large rectangular object about 50 x 100 ft. in length and width but no discernible thickness and was maybe 2-300 ft. in the air.  It was difficult to determine its speed (since I am not familiar with the speeds of flying objects) but I would guess around 100 mph. The object was very white in color. It was traveling East to West and would have been somewhere above Peachtree Corners Circle (maybe a little further North of that). I watched it for approximately 2-3 minutes before it disappeared behind some trees that blocked my line of sight.  As I moved further South on the road I kept looking for it but I never saw the object again. This was not the 1st time I believe to have seen a UFO.  Around 1963-65 I was at the construction site of Durham Memorial Baptist Church on Freedom Drive in Charlotte N.C.  Further West on Freedom Drive (maybe 2-3 miles) I saw a large cigar shaped object (definitely not a blimp) hovering in the air for 10-15 minutes. It was many feet above the ground, but at that distance it was impossible to tell how high.  It was much, much longer than a blimp and had short stubby wings.  It had an iridescent glow that varied in color - pink, blue, red, green - the colors were undulating (mixing, washing back and forth over the object).

There were about seven of us sitting in the front of my residence.  The group consisted of a brother, children, in-law and relatives.The neighbors started the fireworks about mid-night. The continuous exploding of fireworks last for about 9 to 11 minutes.  At the end of the firecrackers exploding, our attention was drawn to the southeastern sky.  Flying in a westerly direction were several unknown objects.  The first formation consisted of four objects. Three of these appeared to be in some type of symetrical formation and the fourth one of this group was alone.  These four objects were red in color and we could not see any blinking lights nor could we hear any noise coming from this group.  They objects were low enough that we should have been able to hear whether or not they were of a fixed wing aircraft or rotor aircraft.Behind this group of four we noticed two others and either a single or a third group of two objects.  All of the objects were similar in nature in that they all displayed a red light, none displayed any flashing lights. We could not see any color that would be visible on an aircraft; green on one side or a solid white when viewing from the rear.The sky was clear as we could see stars and a partial moon.  The wind was blowing from the north.  We had a small fire in an outdoor pit and we were sitting in a semi-circle.  I myself was sitting with my back to the north, viewing the objects coming from the east, heading westward as if to say they were followig directly over I-10.As the objects moved slightly to a point past 180 to 190 degrees, the objects seemed to just disappear.  There were no clouds that would obsecure our view of these objects.   The objects in the second and third group disappeared as did the ones in the first group.Members of the viewing group includes a 63 year old registered pharmacist and his wife who is a college graduate and her daughter; my 25 year old son, a college graduate and his wife who is a registered nurse; my sister-in-law who is a photographer; myself, a 55 year old retired state police polygraph examiner and my wife a Licensed Practical Nurse.There was no-one in the group who was intoxicated.  I had only had two drinks all night.  The only explanation I can give for not hearing any aircraft noise is that our ears were ringing from the fireworks.  However, no one in the group could hear any aircraft engine noise nor could we see any flashing lights.  As we verbalized our observations.I also submitted an email to a friend of mine who is a dispatcher with the local sheriff&apos;s office.  The content of that email was to ask him if any other reports concerning these objects were received by sheriff&apos;s office.  At the time of this writng, I have not heard from him.", "White lights in a V shape traveling at a constant speed.I observed what appeared to be one craft traveling in as easterly direction.  It was at least 6 bright white lights in a shallow V shape.  I had binoculars with me and could see the individual lights clearly, but could not make out the body of the craft.  It moved at a constant speed and did not appear to change direction or altitude.  There were no red and green strobes that you usually see on normal aircraft at night, just the white lights.", "followed by flying silent vehical for 45 minutes in wyomming  I have been wanting to report this incident for almost 40 years now.  It occurred while my friend and I were traveling from our school in North Dakota to California where he was to be married.  To the best of our recollection, on or about June 20th, 1970, we were passing through Wyomming driving through to Colorado late at night in his Volkswaggen Beetle.  To the best of our estimates, we were proceding south on I-87 about 100 miles north of Cheyenne.  It was very dark and there was little or not traffic on the road and no houses, buildings etc as we drove, very desolate.It was my shift driving and I noticed a lighted craft immediately in front keeping pace with the car and passing from my right to the left.  It caught my attention because it appeared to be traveling with the car.  Approximately 10 minutes after that I again noticed what appeared to be a similar lighted craft again passing from left to right the same distance from the car at the same hightg and again appearing to keep pace with the car.  My friend was sleeping at this time and I did not wake him until about 10 minutes later when I again saw what appeared to be the identical lighted craft in the same position.I told my friend what I had been observing and that I thought that this craft appeared to be following the car.  We decided to stop the car and got out to better observe.  The craft then passed directly above us and hovered maybe 500 feet above us.  We heard no noise whatsoever. It was a very clear night with no clouds etc.  As we watched the craft turned out its lights and we then became quite scared feeling that it was watching us and might mean us some harm.  We jumped into the car and started down the road and at that point the entire car lit up.  That was the end of the event as we remember it and did not see the craft again.I have thought about this incident many times and after hearing of similar stories have wondered if there was any connection to some unusual objects that have worked there was from my body including a &frac14; inch piece of crystal that came out of my right index finger many years ago.  About three years later an identical piece of crystal came out of my gum.((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Triangular craft hovered with car for aprox 10min, then moved forward, up &amp; dissapeared fastWe were driving from Orlando to Daytona on I4 East-bound.  I would say it was approximately 00:30-01:00 hours.  I was in the backseat of the car, staring at the skyline as we drove home. My best friend was in the back with me, but she was sleeping soundly.  There are lot&apos;s of tree&apos;s to the sides of I4, so I had my face kind of plastered against the window so that I could look at the stars. The night was very clear.The driver had his eyes on the road, but his friend in the passenger seat was fiddling with a CD.  I remember he put it in and it was some music from The Phantom of the Opera so I glanced at them for a few seconds and went back to looking out of the window.I noticed something different in the distance and started paying close attention.  There were three very bright lights hovering above us, they were not stars because they were moving in unison with us.  They started getting bigger and MUCH closer.I didn&apos;t want to look away, I was sort of in awe and wondering what the heck I was looking at.  I ran through all of the things it could be... a jet, a military plane... hmmm, but it hovered down even more so and now I could see it was a triangular object and since it was now so close the middle of it looked pitch black, you could only tell it was triangular because of the lights -- they were close the the edges of this massive aircraft, and because it was so dark it looked like there was a triangular whole in the sky -- (for lack of a better description)  There was NO sound.As we drove the thing hovered along with us for a good ten minutes.  The guy in the passenger seat was watching it too but neither of us really said anything at first.  I think we were both kind of shocked and silently curious.I couldn&apos;t tell you how high up this thing was.  The gap between it and the tree&apos;s wasn&apos;t huge to the eyesight, but the angle was a little strange so I have no way to measure.  It was definitely high up, but it still looked SO LARGE.Finally, it moved away by going up, slightly forward and then in a flash it was gone.The friend and I both spoke then, wondering if the driver had seen it.  We were glad that the both of us had watched it so carefully and talked about it only for a few minutes afterward, but our reports were identical.  We knew then we had definitely seen something that was not normal.  We were silent the rest of the way.I told my brother when I got home.  I was only 20 at the time and thought everyone would think I was crazy, well, everyone except for my brother.  He thought I should report it and see if anyone else did, but I felt weird about doing so.  I found this website a while back and thought about report it several times, but because it was so long ago I didn&apos;t think it would matter now.I can&apos;t give you any background information on the guy in the passenger seat. He was a friend of the driver and I had only met him twice before and very briefly.  I know he was a serious kind of guy, but that is about it.At the time, I was a florist and wedding planner. Since then I have been very interested in UFO&apos;s and I keep my eyes open all of the time, but sadly I have not seen anything strange since.  I wish I would have had a camera.None of us had been drinking at all. The car was not affected at all.

I did not notice if other people pulled over, but I was more curious and worried to find out what this object was.  I really paid no attention to my surroundings.We saw this object for approximately 10-15 min. We decided to go home and called 911, just to report it and find out if other people had called.", "Bright falling object with a blue trail.Hi, I am a 15 year old sophomore in high school.  We had the day off from school since thanksgiving is tomorrow.  I woke up at eight for wrestling practice, came home ate and pretty much laid on the couch the rest of the day.  I took a nap around five and woke up around seven thirty.  I was sitting on my couch watching the movie X-Men Three. The way the room is set up is that you walk in and there is a couch on your right, and a chair to the left.  The television is in the far corner of the room against the wall. So directly in front of the couch is this big window. I don&rsquo;t know why but I looked out the window and at that moment there was this bright object.  It was circular I think. It was bright yellow kind of golden. It left this beautiful blue trail. The object was going down diagonally like it was crashing but it went behind the trees so I couldn&rsquo;t see it land. I don&rsquo;t know how far it was away but it fell to the east of my house pretty close I&rsquo;d say within 25 miles. It was at 8:55 PM. I know this because I looked at my cell phone right away. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like these before. It could have been a meteor or UFO.

It seemed to not move for 3-5 seconds then turned to a black line going the opposite direction of our aircraft. I showed my wife the triangle and tried to get some pictures with our digital camera, but only show the black streak.

A non-military helicopter heading southwest flew near and past the object, but didn&apos;t seem to notice it,  We heard the helicopter, but no noise came from the black object after the helicopter was gone.

This is a routine procedure I perform in cold weather to keep the water circulating to prevent freezing (in lieu of winterizing).After switching on the motor, I noticed in the western night sky a very bright light slowly moving eastward. Since we live about 20 minutes from a regional airport, I at first didn&rsquo;t think this was unusual. However as I watched it&rsquo;s motion, I noticed it had no blinking aircraft lights. As I continued to stare, it suddenly halted movement and then began to move backwards. Eventually it stopped completely and became fixed (now appearing as the brightest &ldquo;star&rdquo; in the sky).At this point I ran inside to get my video camera and to notify my two young children of what I had seen.  When we came back outside the object was still there, but was now accompanied by a second star-like light (albeit less bright) off to the lower right.  I began to record as best as I could through the backyard tree limbs which somewhat blocked my view.  Eventually the cold weather forced us indoors, where I continued to film through my upstairs screened-in porch area.  For the next half hour or so my children and I watched in amazement as the two objects alternately moved closer to each other, then moved apart.  In addition they would continually fade in and out, at times becoming completely dark (appearing to us to disappear completely), then suddenly reappearing in full brightness.  At times the second object would become brighter than the first.  Eventually the objects went dark permanently.", "5 burning slow moving objects phtographed in englandI was locked inside my house and was speaking to my sister through the kitchen window whilse i waited for my step-dad to open door. i seen moving slowly above the houses a very bright orange fireball! it seemed to flicker but only slightly. it caught my eye an i looked closer and noticed it was being followed by another then another. the objects all moved at the same speed but at different heights they then formed a straight line with what seemed the exact same space between them they continued moving slowly then dissapered.", "Bright flashes of changing color light filled the sky.I was on my computer at my relative&rsquo;s house in Port Orchard around 2:00am on January 5, 2009 and noticed outside that the sky had lit up like daylight but the whole sky had also lit up the color red.  As soon as I noticed this I rushed to the window and the sky had already changed colors to blue or green and then was changing colors again, each color lasted about 2-3 seconds, and filled the sky completely, the entire thing lasted about 20 seconds.  I had a clear view of the sky from the window and there was no visible cause for the lights.  It was very cloudy outside however with a low lying cloud layer and lots of snow.  I have read about a similar case of this happening in Melbourne, Australia, exact same details, so this most likely is a natural phenomena but I decided since I don&rsquo;t know what it was I should probably report it.  This could be fireworks reflecting off the clouds, except no sound of them, could be a low lying airplane with its lights reflecting off the clouds except again no sound of it.  It could also be a meteor.", "Cloud like object streaks through sky at tremendous speed - for one second!I walked out my door, looked up at the sky and saw a brilliant white, circular type object float through the sky.  As it flew down towards the earth it was just as white and big at the bottom as at the top.  (As if it was producing a flash that lit up the area it was just in too!)  The funny part was that I sensed that it really was not that far away.  Perhaps a small craft just 1 mile away.  The thing that was most remarkable about it was the tremendous rate of speed.  In just a second it appeared, flew and then disappeared.  What also was remarkable was the brilliant white, milky light surrounding it.  Almost like it has cloak itself to appear as a cloud, and then started to travel. Remarkable.  One more thing, there was light around, the sun was up.", "As I was in the car, I saw a white object in the sky which wasn&apos;t moving, just hovering there.

Then formed into V. We watched this for 20 minutes and tried to call our local news station from cell phones after looking up their numbers. I finally emailed one of the Memphis stations just to see if anyone else saw what we were seeing. I haven&apos;t heard anything back. It was something I&apos;ve never seen.

The figures or entities inside the aircraft were about 3 or perhaps 4 but nor more than 4 and the jet sound came from the aircraft was not making any air waves of any kind as a normal jetliners does I could compare them because just a few seconds after this craft has gone a jetliner approaches my area and I could notice and compare the differences between the previous sight into the regular and normal jetliner.After few seconds of this sight the aircraft disappeared over the near by buildings leaving me kind of shaking due to this one of the kind experience even thought my dog does not known what was it she acts weird before and during the sight and only became a normal dog after the flying thing disappeared thru the distance.At the front I did not noticed anything odd at all beside the strobe lights since I begin to noticed that it was something not normal only after the aircraft was almost flying over my head.Hope someone could explain to me what was it of perhaps someone has see something similar before.", "Two blue egg shaped objects floated past our campground, about 200 feet above the ground, moving about 25 mph; lasted about 3 min.My son and I saw two blue egg shaped objects float past our campsite at 5:15 am sunday on laborday weekend.I had just gotten up to use the outhouse and on the way back to the tent I stopped at our camp table.    Thats when I saw a blue reflection in the trees coming towards us, (my Son had just come outside of the tent and saw these objects also.)  My wife and other son remained asleep in the tent.I had a camcorder in the tent but I didn&apos;t think I could retreive it before the eggs were out of sight, so I just stood there with my Son and watched them drift over this small clearing nearby.Both eggs glowed blue,they were incandesent, glowed from inside like a lightbulb.They were about 200 feet away and moving maybe 25 to 30 mph.The were following each other about 100 feet apart and about 200 feet or so above the ground.The lead egg had a black line moving around a few feet from its tail,and it slithered about like a snake as it moved around the rear of it. The other egg did not do this.  Both objects lit up the pine trees around them,and also the ground.  I had a pair of binoculars on the camp table so I took a look using them.  I could not see any windows doors or seams in either object.  So my Son and I just watched them float away over the trees and out of sight.  Also no sound from them.

Had faintly illuminated geometric pattern on at least one side.Having just returned home to the dark desert from light-polluted San Diego, I got out of my car and observed the night sky for a moment. Looking high towards the west, I was gazing upon the Milky Way when I noticed a circular part of the star field (approximately the size of an extended hand) begin to shift slightly.The stars in this circular area appeared to slowly swirl about, almost as if they were being passed over by a lens. This occurred for a total of approximately 10 seconds.Then without warning, the circular area began to slowly tumble, revealing that it was what appeared to be a nearly flat disc. As it began its tumble, it shifted its appearance from that of a refracted star field, to a grid-like geometric pattern, very faintly illuminated on a completely black background. The disc tumbled for about 1-2 seconds before stabilizing and speeding off toward the southwest.I was unable to determine the size or distance of the object.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was standing on the front porch of my parents house in Upper Gwynedd, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.  I was catching a smoke and I looked out straight off my porch to the horizon where I saw 3 solid red lights in a triangular formation.  To give an idea of size, if I put my thumb up, I probably could&rsquo;ve have covered all 3 from site.  I know this doesn&apos;t give a clear idea of size since there are too many variables.  There were no sounds from the objects.I am disheartened as I definitely dismissed this as nothing at the time and now I don&lsquo;t know when it happened.  I really always thought it had to be something that I just didn&apos;t know of.   But, I just finished watching an hour long show on the Chicago Tinley Park siting, which had supposedly been seen around the world in a matter of days.  Chills ran down my spine watching this as this is exactly what I saw.  And while the lack of date of occurrence, it is definitely possible that it happened in 2004, around the same time as the Tinley incident (which also happened in the summer.)  I will say, the minor differences, the lights in my case seemed to be closer together, and they unfortunately fell slowly below the horizon which has a high tree line.  However, this very well could&rsquo;ve been the objects moving away from me, but I just don&apos;t know.  I can also say with certainty, that the objects moved in perfect unison and the lights were perfectly solid (no flickering/dimming).  There is NO way these were flares or aircraft lights.  There is a great deal of aircraft traffic in my area from Philadelphia International Airport.  Their landing pattern goes right over the Landsdale area.  There is also an innumerable amount of small plane airports in the area.  I&apos;m used to seeing commercial aircraft, small planes, military aircraft from Willow Grove Air Base, helicopters from Merck, helicopters from Medivac Hospitals.To add to my credibility, I have never seen UFO&rsquo;s before, and even after this incident, I was doubtful that I saw anything unexplainable (only I couldn&lsquo;t explain it).  I am an audio video technician so I know the intricacies of video and the differences of seeing something with the naked eye vs. an image or video from a camera&rsquo;s CCD or film.  These objects very well may have been the same as the videos from Chicago.  And one thing the show did not touch on is this eye/camera differences.  I can say the lights were probably the same because they were perfectly solid, and there&rsquo;s little doubt in my mind that the lights seen in Chicago were just as solid.  Most people don&rsquo;t realize that a camera will never see a solid light as perfectly solid.  And judging by the videos I just saw, they seemed like they very well could&rsquo;ve been perfectly solid, made seemingly flickering from camera abarition.Well, that&rsquo;s it.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m just one in thousands with this siting, but I wanted to add my two cents.

Also. it was going on a downward angle from my vantage point about 15 degrees I would guess.  All I can say is that it was a fireball of sorts, orangish in color, not blue or white.  And, it was going relatively slowly compared to a shooting star.  In the few seconds I saw it, it had moved accross the sky about 8-10 inches at arms length.  I don&apos;t know how many degrees that would be.  All I can say is that if you stetch your arm out and point to the sky,move your index finger about 10&quot; and that&apos;s about how far I saw it travel.  The size is also hard to judge or determine.  Again, if you hold your arm out like before and make about a quarter inch gap between your index finger and thumb, that would be about how big it was.

This light would pulsate and flash brighter, almost like a strobe light, but much slower, about one pulse every 2 or 3 seconds.  It was completely silent, and just pulsed every few seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It finally just disappeared.", "Strange lights sighted over Deerfield Beach, Florida May 8, 1998 at 9:40 PM for 5-10 minutes.During a sighting which lasted in total no more than 5 to 10 minutes, I initially saw a very bright white light beginning at 9:40 PM on May 8, 1998, while I was driving northbound on I-95 about 2 miles south of the Palm Beach County line near the town of Deerfield Beach, Florida, which is a few miles north of the town of Pompano Beach, Florida.  There was good visibility with few clouds while the Moon was also visible and approximately 2/3 full in the night sky at an apparently equivalent elevation but well to the south of the bright light. Having seen something unusual looking,  I pulled off on to the right shoulder of the interstate and got out of my car to better observe what was occurring.  This bright white light appeared to be a few miles north of me and was slowly moving in a southerly direction parallel to and somewhat to the east of I-95 coming towards my position.  At first, the unblinking white light appeared to have a short contrail which later disappeared when the bright white light changed into a less brilliant unblinking red light which then appeared to split into 2 such less brilliant, unblinking red lights that moved apart but remained side by side and separated by a some distance from each other.  Both continued to move slowly in a continued southerly direction. At about this point, I noticed that there was a third, unblinking, dimmer red light which preceeded the other two by some significant distance, perhaps one hundred to a few hundred yards, which was also slowly moving in a southerly direction and to the east of I-95 towards my position.  Eventually the 2 following red lights dimmed to the level of the leading dim red light and shortly thereafter, the pair of following red lights continued to become dimmer until they quickly became too dim to be visible while the single nearer red light, though dim, continued to be visible for another couple of minutes until it also disappeared as it approached my position. It should be noted that even though a short contrail was seen at first, at no time was there any sound associated with these lights as there should have been if what had been observed was merely a jet or an airplane, (the latter of which don&apos;t produce contrails).  Also, jets usually leave very lengthy contrails that remain visible long after they have passed which was not apparent in this case in the night sky that was well lit by the Moon.  I believe that what was seen could not have been a rocket or space shuttle launch from Cape Canaveral (which is a couple of hundred miles to the north) due to the close proximity of what was observed and the slowness with which the lights moved only a few miles over a period of 5 to 10 minutes.  Also, all planes, jets and helicopters have some blinking lights, but none of these lights blinked on and off. Finally, although these 3 lights appeared to move synchronously with each other, the background of the well lit night sky could be seen between them, so that they ultimately could be seen to be spacially separated. As an addendum to this report, I would like to state that I had attempted to contact a few police departments local to the vicinity of the sighting at that time in 1998 but that I was then unable to obtain confirmation that anyone else had seen or reported a similar sighting until ten years later in 2008 when I first learned about this web site of the National UFO Reporting Center.  Whereupon, having checked my original written account of the sighting and searching this data base for the same date, time and location, I finally discovered that one other individual had reported a sighting that matched mine with exactly the same date, time and a very nearby location and although his description differs somewhat from mine there are overall quite a few elements in common between the 2 accounts.", "Thought it was a shooting star but it was way too low to be oneI was unloading Christmas presents when i saw what I thought was a shooting star but it was too low and looked like it was pulsing.

My 16-year old daughter was in the car with me. She noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of us and asked if it was the North Star. I looked for a few moments, then told her that no star was that bright. I then racked my brain to see if any planets were visible this time of year. The light was approximately 250-300 feet above ground. As we neared closer, we could see that rather than one bright light, it was actually two white lights and two red lights that were blinking intermittently.I said to her, &quot;Must be an airplane.&quot; As we neared even closer, I wondered out loud to her, &quot;But airplanes don&apos;t hover.&quot; The lights were remaining still in one spot directly in front of us. We could see, too, as we neared, that the lights were lower than first appeared, or perhaps had moved closer to the ground. The lights were not moving at all, other than blinking.

The object was still hovering in one spot.What happened next is unimaginable and outlandish. We passed under the object, which took 2-3 seconds at my drive of 30mph.  As we passed underneath, we could see that the object was triangular with round corners, the body was metallic, and corner of the triangle had a brightly colored light.  One light was green.  One light was red. I believe, but can&apos;t be positive, that the third light was white.  Directly connecting the large corner lights were smaller red and white lights that blinked in a row.The front of the triangle (the longer side) had an amazing glow from it, as if from interior lights.

The sky was perfectly clear, except for the very beginnings of a small wispy cloud. The objects were in no clear formation, but close together in the sky. (an area smaller than the palm of your hand, perhaps two inches square) They looked metallic to me, as they seemed to shimmer. They were about the size of a pencil (softly dulled) point at this time.  They looked to either be white, or red. There was one that was definitely red. While trying to keep track of them, it looked like something was swinging from below them, kinda back and forth. I thought maybe paratroopers, but i dont see how i would be able to see some one that small that high in the sky?  Two of the objects seemed to stay in the same spot. I was looking through wires going across my yard, and they stayed in that same position for approx a min.

Again, they drifted, till they were too small for me to see.  About 20 min later, I took notice of a silver tubular object that crossed the sky from west to east. I continued to watch this object watching for wings or something to show it was a plane. Again, nothing was visible. I looked away for a sec, and back up, and it was gone.

Another possible reason I thought was that it was a light shone through the window however the building I live in is the highest and largest building on campus and in Morehead, not to mention that I live on the 11th floor. Therefore it is impossible for something to shine in perfectly horizontal as if it were right in front of the window.

My house was in the last row of the development, and there were plans for extending the housing development to include hundreds of new homes in what was the wooded area over the fence of my back yard.  The construction companies had finished the main asphalt road, and the street lights had been installed and were operational.  Other than the road itself, there were only woods on all sides for miles.One clear summer night, I was watching bats catch moths underneath one of the new street lights.  The moths would be attracted to the lights, and the bats would be attracted to the moths.  My friends and I would pick up pebbles and throw them into the air, and watch as bats swooped down and approached them before breaking off the pursuit after realizing they weren&apos;t prey insects.I was kind of lost in the pleasure of just finding pebbles and throwing them up in the air to watch the bats chase.  There was a large full moon overhead.  That&apos;s what I was doing when I had a life-changing encounter with a small UFO.It was too small for a person to occupy, approximately 2.5 feet in diameter, and it moved so quickly that it could not be seen except when hovering motionless at different points. One moment it was in the night sky directly between me and the full moon, lit so that it was perfectly camouflaged against the moon behind it, perfectly still and silent. But as my binocular vision adjusted and it came into sharp focus, I felt a sudden shock as it appeared that the moon was very much closer than it was supposed to be. At the moment it registered in my mind as out of place, I became slightly disoriented and it instantaneously moved to within inches of my face.It was so close that I could see a mirror image of my own face displayed on its convex bottom surface. If I hadn&apos;t seen it so illuminated before, I would have guessed that its coating was a perfectly reflective polished metal. There was a soft humming electrical arcing sound coming from inside it, like statically charged particles being sucked through a very quiet vacuum hose into some other place entirely. It surprised me so completely that I was literally frozen in the deepest visceral fear that I&apos;ve ever felt. It was as though I had been in the jungle blithely examining an innocuous plant, and out of nowhere a 9-foot-long man-eating tiger had pounced on me. The part of the brain that registers fear is the amygdala. When it is active there&apos;s normally an urge to fight or flee. In this case, it was so directly stimulated that I felt only a primal, overwhelming, paralyzing fear. I remember thinking, &quot;Oh my God! This is really happening to me.&quot; The next thing I remember was &quot;waking up&quot; walking on my way home about 50 yards from where I was before.This level of propulsion and active material technology might be representative of advanced nanotech. While there is a slim possibility that some elite and secretive humans had that in the 1970&apos;s, it seems much more likely that it was of a non-human or post-human origin. Given the probable scenarios that are described by futurists such as the inventor Ray Kurzweil, it seems inevitable that we will eventually modify our own biology and become vastly different than the species we are now, with many orders of magnitude greater intelligence and computing power. When we reach that level of advancement, it is quite likely that we will no longer need the large, cumbersome, inefficient bodies that we have now. So different will be our physical structure that it&apos;s not unreasonable to predict that our minds and machines will be structured on a scale too small for modern humans to sense, even with our most sensitive instruments.This must be the case for the advanced civilizations that came before us. Just as we may find it desirable in the future to return the Earth to its pristine natural state, free from human structures and pollution, so too may those who came before us. We have no evidence of their existence precisely because they were so thorough at cleaning up the mess that they made on their way up the evolutionary and technological chain. They were simply very efficient at disposing of the evidence of their earlier civilizations.So that UFO I came into contact with must have been a machine of their design. Perhaps they monitor and manage us, in the same manner that we manage wildlife in nature preserves and zoos. Perhaps they prefer to remain undetected as they intervene in our affairs only in the most subtle ways, such as steering our ideas or dreams from within our brains. Perhaps we are their grand experiment, or maybe even their toys or their pets. Rather than communicate with us through left-brained verbal symbol sequences such as speech, they prefer to communicate in a much more efficient way, which is to choreograph our behavior, interactions and culture. Perhaps they are responsible for our more complex dreams. For example, my dreams often include higher beings that demonstrate nearly unfathomable powers within the simulated reality of the dream, and complete telepathy in terms of understanding my thoughts and intentions immediately as they occur or even slightly prior to my awareness of their occurrence. Perhaps we belong to them, and they own us, while most of us remain ignorant of that reality.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

One of the aircraft made a closer approach to the object than the others.  Eventually the object moved slowly westward toward the French Creek park area, as did the aircraft circling it.

I felt nothing pa! rticular ly threatening about this object, but definitely felt it was not a conventional craft.", "Incredible reddish green UFO sighting over Lac de la Sucrerie, 115 km northwest of Montreal, Canada.I noticed a bright light on the northern horizon over Lac de la Sucrerie (46 degrees 07 minutes 00.23seconds North, 74 degrees 54 minutes 11.88 seconds West) that I thought was a star, however it started to get brighter and bigger after a few minutes of staying still.  After a few more minutes the &ldquo;star&rdquo; began to lower and fluctuate in intensity.  This is when I realized it was a UFO.  As it got closer I could see a red and greenish glow under the object, which by now was moving slightly erratically left to right, up and down.  At this point it was in front of the mountain, about 50 feet above the lake, and about 1 kilometer in front of me.  It just stayed there, silently hovering above the lake for a couple of minutes, and then slowly rose back into the sky, and further behind and above the mountain until it was looking once again like a bright star, like venus looks like. The light grew with intensity, and then faded.  This happened a few times until it disappeared.  About half an hour later, I went back outside to see if it was there, but it wasn&apos;t, however, after a minute of looking around in the sky I felt a sort of vibration that vibrated the whole cottage, and even the ground, (kind of like an earthquake, but more of a vibration than a shaking), which was followed immediately by a sound high overhead like a fighter jet would make, but not quite as loud.  Unfortunately I did not have my video camera because I forgot it at home!  It would have been one of the best UFO videos ever!  I&rsquo;m so sorry I forgot it!", "Boomerang object with no sound seen in night skyOn 29 Dec 08 at about 20:05, I&rsquo;ve noticed a brownish / tan object in the northeast night sky just above the tree tops.  The object at first was distorted but came into focus as it moved from the northeast to southwest.  As the object moved over my head, I noticed that it was in a shape of a boomerang with a light gray to dark silver color disc in the center.  The rest of the object was a light brown/tan.  As the object moved over head, there was no sound and it disappeared out of sight.   The object did not have an appearance of any military aircraft that I have seen.   I&rsquo;ve called Marine Corps Air Station, New River to see if they seen anything on their radar and I was told no and was advised to call the County Sheriffs Office to see if any one reported seeing a UFO.  Again I was told no.", "Orange colored very bright flying object in the sky low altitude, pulling up.Orange colored very bright flying object in the sky (40-45 degrees angle from me).  The object flew from south-west pretty slow and low altitude without flashing and it was totally silent.  There was no trail after it. It started changing direction so it finally seemed heading south-east.  (About 90 degrees change)  At the same time the object pulled up high altitude so it vanished behind clouds.  The clouds were very high and thin because of cold weather, -9C (15.8F).There were many observers present there in the cemetery because it was Christmas eve and people leaving candles to the tombs.I took a picture of the UFO with my canon digital camera.  Because the object was far away and it was dark it just seems to be an orange spot in the picture but it is real.  This was definitely not an airplane nor a helicopter.", "a white egg shaped light with a trail of blue-aqua colored streak behind it moving in a downward motion towards the ground.My wife and I were turning down the street, and I was sitting in the passanger seat. We started to turn into our driveway when I noticed, to my left, a white egg shaped light streaking in a downward motion towards the ground and then dissapeared.

It stayed in front of me for approximately a half-hour, then quickly moved off, holding its diagonal position, and in seconds had shrunk out of sight.I lived in Illinois at the time, returning to army duties after a weekend leave.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Then it stopped for about 2 seconds and disappeared.. I was hysterical when I realized what just happened.  The object was bright but it had a circular gray out- line and center. Also, we were on a back rode that was in the woods.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide little personal contact information.  PD))", "Me and my wife witness. Three lights in a triangluar shaped formation floating over horizon for a good two hours.I was driving to Prescot from Green Valley, on high way 8 with my family for familly dinner, when suddenly my 8 year old son said &quot;Daddy!, theres&apos; a ship in the sky!&quot; Me and my wife then looked up to see three green lights in a HUGE triangle, or V formation.  The object moved about every 5 minutes, from side to side, or up and down.My wife, who was frightened said &quot;Call the police! Call the Police!&quot;.  Sadly, we had left our cellphones in the baby bag at home.  So i stopped the car to look up at the strange object.  The lights were flashing green and they didn&apos;t seem to be connected to each other.  But they stayed in a straight line and continued to hover.  About 20 minutes into watching it it climbed a few 100 feet into the air and continued to hover.  It moved vigorously up and down from side to side.  As it climbed, thats lights became whiter and whiter, and soon became pure white. For a moment, we couldn&apos;t see it because of the tree&apos;s.  But soon enough it hovered over our car.  It was at a high altitude, so i could not say if it was directly above or not.  But then it started slowly moving west, turning counter clock wise [ which was odd, because it was a triange shaped air craft ]. It then sped off at almost the speed of light maybe 50-60 miles west.  It was just above the horizon when it stopped.  Then another 5 or ten minutes later, it sped off into the horizon disappearing completely.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I am referring to the November, 08,2008 sighting I reported of a basic &quot;foo fighter&quot; that was following a small private airplane along the coast. I think the plane was spooked as a couple of minutes later it appeared to have turned around and was heading apparently home. The next week, as I am a college English teacher, I told the story to my students and honestly by chance one of my students happen to be in Dana Point at the basic time and date I saw the UFO. She and the ones she was with saw the same object as it seemmed minutes before I did. It is a very lucky situationthat we may have seen the same thing, but she claims to have seen the same thing. Dana Point is just north of the city of San Clemente, and as the object was moving along the coast, I surmise that she saw it a few minutes before I did. That would make the total of people that saw this at least five. Most interesting is the security guard I witnessed the UFO with (I saw this at a wedding reception where he works) and he said that he had seen stranger one night in the past. I was at Ole Hanson in San Clemente. It is an older place that offers a place for weddings and has a pool for public swimming. Anyways, he told me that during one wedding reception everything stopped, including the music, because in the sky there was something he described as an organic, moving like a fish swimming, object that moved across the sky. He said that was much wilder than what we shared. So, I know this is not the best encounter, but I hope you mention it as maybe others have seen both my experience and the one the security guard did in the past.", "I was driving northbound on I-35, and was around 5 miles south of Austin when I noticed an intensely bright white light far ahead on the horizon line, directly in front of me.  It was the brightest and most white light I&rsquo;d ever seen (and still have ever seen to this day, some 12 years later).  After a few minutes I realized it was still there, directly in front of me, maybe 20 miles ahead.  It was very low on the horizon and now I started to wonder what it might be.  I discarded aircraft because there are no headlights this bright, and even if they were, they&rsquo;d have to be flying directly southbound over I-35, which I doubt they&rsquo;d do.  I thought it might be a commercial spotlight that somehow had been pushed downward, aiming straight at me, but I couldn&rsquo;t see any beam projecting from the source.  I was traveling around 70mph and getting closer to it by the minute.  After about 10 minutes I realized that the light was not stationary.  It was slowly moving westward, to my left.  I was really mesmerized by this thing now, and couldn&rsquo;t for the life of me figure out what it could be.When it got much closer, I pulled the car over, turned off the engine and got out.  The craft was triangular in shape, and maybe the width of two to three 737 planes wing-to-wing.  What first struck me was that it was completely silent.  If the light hadn&rsquo;t attracted my attention, you never would have known it was there.  It was slowly moving, almost drifting, south-westerly, maybe 500 feet off the ground.  The other thing that struck me is that now, from underneath, I could no longer see the white light, but instead saw 3 different colored lights, one on each top of the triangle.  One was red, one was green and the other yellow, all solid.As I stood in awe, a patrol car pulled off the road onto the shoulder coming southbound.  The officer got out and stood looking up at the craft, just as I was doing.  I jumped back into the car and drove right thru the grass, crossing the median and onto the southbound side.  While this was completely against the law, the officer and I didn&rsquo;t even discuss it.  We just stood there staring at the craft.Now, as it was moving away from us, we could no longer see the 3 colored lights on the tips of the triangle.  All you could see from the back was a much larger, round red light in the center of the craft that was slowly pulsating.  I couldn&rsquo;t make out how tall the craft was, just the approximate width.  The slowly pulsating red light was almost hypnotic, but our attention was broken by the arrival of a 2nd patrol car, this one the State Police.  He too got out and watched the craft moving away.  I asked them if they&rsquo;d already checked with Austin-Bergstrom airport, and they had, reporting now commercial traffic anywhere near here or anything like what we were seeing.After a few more minutes of the two officers discussing their confusion and fascination, I jumped in my car and headed back down I-35 from where I&rsquo;d just come.  I chased the craft for a few more minutes, driving about 70mph again, as it was now getting further and further off to my right (westerly).  I finally pulled off the highway and tried going down a side road to head more westerly, but by then it had disappeared from sight.I didn&rsquo;t see anything about it in the papers, despite looking thru the Austin American Statesman for days afterwards.  I wish I&rsquo;d gotten the names of the officers who witnessed this with me, but I didn&rsquo;t.  I was too taken by what I was seeing in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was in second grade and the planets were out my next door neighbor James had his telescope out.  We were trying to focus on the rings of Saturn.  It was a cool night, with a dark blue sky and along the horizon a orange line ran across.  I was at the end of James drive way with him, his sister Kerry was also with us.  The road we were on was North Virgina Ave.  It runs east to west.  We were in the middle of the block near Boundry ave.  So our gaze was to the left.  The 135 Seaford Oyster Bay express way is at the end of the block.  We could see the tree line from the express way.  Just above the tree line suddenly the object came going North to South.  It was moving very slowly, it did not stop and it did not pick up speed. From our view we see the houses on the north side of the ship, as well as the houses on the south side.  Trees as well on both sides.  Coming from out of nowhere out of these trees I am the first to see it.  I scream something a long the lines of &quot;Ah!&quot; or &quot;Oh!&quot; Kerry then said, &quot;What?&quot; She then looking up saw it and screamed very similar to me.  Next James said &quot;What?&quot; He sounded more annoyed at us both, then he saw it screamed as well.  Next James and Kerry ran into the house to get their mother.  I watched the object and when it finally crossed the street and was behind the trees and homes I ran inside next.  I was scared to move and I couldn&apos;t move till I could no longer see it.  I then ran inside and got my own mother, and both me and my mom came out to Kerry and James outside with their mom talking about what we just saw. I was in second grade, I was seven about to turn eight I believe.  My birthday being in June.  I only remember that I was in second grade.  I do not have the note book I wrote my experience in anymore or the picture I drew.  My mom told me that she had called Grummen and that they said it was a new plane to pick up the people in the Gulf who were at war.  This I found out many years later was false she did not call at all, she told me this so I would sleep at night.  Kerry was a year younger then me, and James was a year older.  I have not seen them since I moved in the fifth grade.  So I am not sure if they still live there. The Object was just a light, and it was massive.  It wasn&apos;t one small light but huge.  It was a few inches in comparison to everything in the back drop.  So it was more then likely a hundred feet in length at the most I&apos;d say.  I am not a good judge of distance.  But if I were to close one eye and use my thumb I would say it would reach my knuckle from the tip.  It was along the tree line of the horizon.  It was hexagon in shape.  With in the hexagon were shapes, triangles and circles.  The triangles were coming from the top part pointing down, while the ones on the bottom pointed up.  They met in the middle and in the middle is where the circles were.  The whole shape was a bright light.  That was the most confusing part of the object noticing the shapes with in the light, each shape seemed to be it&apos;s own piece as well as it&apos;s own light.  As if each piece was luminescent on its own. Though I am much older now and I&apos;ve always wanted to report it, this memory is one of my most vivid.  I remember it so well because it is why I am a believer. Why no matter how much the subject scares me I watch programs, look up articles because I wish to know more.  And more then anything I wish to see the shape one day in a picture so I can show everyone I&apos;ve told that this is what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

It looked like a faint white ribbon.  As it got closer I could tell that it was several seprate faint white lights shaped like a boomerang with a little bit of a nose on the front of it.  I would estimate at least 12 lights on the front of it.  It flew over my head very fast,no noise what so ever.  This thing was huge,very eerie. If a 747 was flying over my head at 100ft,thats how big this thing was.  I dont know the altitude of it,but it seemed to be very high in the sky.  I could make out the shape of it on the front edge but could se nothing behind it.  As it flew over my head it blocked out the stars, then I could tell it was a gigantic boomerang.  It proceeded to fly south and dissapeared in the southern sky."]
