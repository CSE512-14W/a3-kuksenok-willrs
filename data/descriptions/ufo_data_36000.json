["orange light drips in LONG BEACH CAi live on the second floor so i have a pretty good veiw of the sky.i live near the long beach airport and see planes fly by from there and LAX and sometimes the police helicopters. well anyway, iwent out to smoke about 11:15 pm i took a few drags and noticed an orange light coming from the north and i thought it was weird cause it didnt have any safty flashers on it and it didnt make any noise!at first it just looked like a round light in the sky but as it got closer it looked like an oval saucer type of light.i didnt want to say it was a UFO right away but when i saw it drip  thats when i knew some thing wasnt right! it dripped twice.it looked like it was goning to drip again but the drip paused right under it so it looked like two lights. right after that it switched directions it started to move west at a slower speed, so i ran in the house and got my girlfriend, by the time we got out there it looked the same as when i first saw it but not so clear cause it went through a thin cloud and i shouted in exicitement &quot;do you see it,do you see it&quot;she said &quot;yeah but it s just an orange light.&quot; i said &quot;can you hear it?&quot; she said &quot;no.&quot; i showed her my goose bumps and we went in the house. i told her the whole story.5 min later a helicopter flew by, 20 min after that a second flew by. i dont know if its because of the UFO though. i know i couldnt  have been the only one that saw it!!!((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

While returning home from my daughters horse lessons, I noted two lights to the west that seemed to be standing still.  From my vantage point on Browns Lane, I have an unrestricted view of Narragansett bay, Portsmith Island, and South Kingstown.  I often see lights from aircraft in this area that are heading into T.F. Green or Quonsett airport.  What made these lights stand out was the fact that they didnt appear to move and they appeared to be at the same altitude.  The distance between the two lights appeared to be maybe a hundred yards, and did not have the staggard appearance of distance that aircraft in a landing pattern do.  Having read the report of 28 Feb, I can also add that these lights would have been in the direction of the area that the report came from at a distance of abot 10 miles.

We stopped to watch also and saw a disk shaped object moving very slowly at a height of roughly 500ft. about 1 mile away.  It had flashing white lights, was silent and after moving back and forth over the trees and feild shot off at a vertical angle at an  unbelieveable speed.

The tail ended in a point at the back and it had no visible rear stabilizers. When I saw it the craft was making a slow right hand turn going up in a corkscrew style.

No object outline was seen. Its apparent speed was slow, but in a South Direction.Object &quot;strobed&quot; approximately once every 7 seconds, as it moved in what appeared a straight line. I asked the Captain if he could see what I saw, but from his seating position in the aircraft, and the height of the sighting, he could not, and did not get out of his seat. We turned down the &quot;DU&quot;s...(Data display units) in the aircraft to rule out any reflections from inside the cockpit.  I called NY Center and asked them if they had any traffic or military traffic 20 to 30 thousand feet above and behind us and he indicated that he only had a Falcon Jet behind us going North...  &quot;Center&quot; asked other aircraft in our general area, if they could see any other traffic on their TCAS, or visually if they had any other reports. I think we were talking to NY Center, as our position was about 40NM south of KBGM (Binghampton, NY).  As the object passed above and behind us, I was indicating to the Captain where to look out his rear Clearview window to see the object.  He did not see it, as we were flying Westbound and the object was proceeding Southbound. We were out of range visually.All Aircraft reported nothing.  I think they asked Southwest and American, and possibly United. At the end of the sighting the time was 0020 Zulu or about 19:20 Eastern Time local.  I don&apos;t believe it was a satellite, as the sun was down, and satellites dont have strobes.  I have not run Nova Satellite prediction software, so I don&apos;t know if satellites were in the area.  http://www.nlsa.com/index.html Air Traffic Controller indicated that he was not surprised at the sighting as he receives them from time to time. To Clarify:  In my report I refer to &quot;object&quot;.  I could see no object just a visible strobe.  No position lights. I also thought when I first saw the strobe that it could be a distant star going supernovae.  Just a thought, as I was trying to figure out what it was.

Since there was no electricity, after the sun had set, sleep came quickly to my family. Me and my brother were still up, listening to the radio.I got up during the break and looked out the window at the sky and I saw a strange dot of light hovering over downtown in the east. It was bright yellow and moved up and down, and in generally peculiar directions for an aircraft. Suddenly the craft began moving westward. It came nearer and nearer to wear I was located. I was generally disturbed by the aircraft but, nonetheless, watched it diligently. I called my brother over as the aircraft neared. Eventually, the I realized the craft did not have one light, but was triangular shaped with three bright lights. It continued westward, and as it got closer, the radio started giving off strange sounds. It was a strange high-pitched static-like sound. The craft continued westward constantly, we watched, mystified and yet paralized with fear. As the craft passed our home and eventually our field of vision, the radio returned back to normal.Keep in mind this happened the day after the hurricane, our infrastructure was obliterated and no airplanes had been flying (or flew) for days afterward.", "It was as if it wanted me to see itThis was my second sighting within a 6 week period. I live in the foothills of NC. For the first sighting, my neighbor witnessed it also. It had white, red, and blue lights. Our eyes could not focus on it very well, almost as if it changed from oval to triangular. It was close to us, not &quot;way up,&quot; but just on top of the hills. It sat motionless at first, that is how it got my attention. Then it started moving slowly over us, my neighbor and I. The blue lights were moving, like in a half circle.  This was about 8pm. About an hour or so later, I saw it again, only much higher up.  My second sighting, last night around 11pm, was even more bizarre. I was lying in bed, trying to relax, and my eyes drifted out the sliding glass door, and there was the light again, white with hints of colors, but this time it was as if it was &quot;drunk.&quot; It bobled around AND sat still periodically. We live in a fairly isolated area, so it was very dark but the sky was clear. This thing seemed to be hoovering just on top of the hills. There was zero noise for both sightings. It almost seemed as if this thing was trying to get my attention, and how strange for me to notice it in the first place, the way the blinds were nearly completely pulled, and the porch banisters and trees were in the way. It seemed to have personality. Was it a persons toy remote of some kind? I don&apos;t know.

Over the course of 45 minutes we watch it change colors split into seperate light balls, saw the equivalent of small shooting stars coming from it, and watch &quot;flares&quot; come from the main light source and smaller round lights orbiting in a very random fashion.  At one point in time the light source split into the shape of a triangle in which the lights would literally move between each other.  At one point in time all the lights converged and dissappeared, instantly.  Approximately 3 minutes later, a new small light appeared from our point of view 2 inches up and 3/4th&apos;s of an inch over to the right.

I have experience in aviation, and this dot did not have wings that could be seen. Aircraft pass over all the time; however, you can always see their wings and they frequently leave contrails across the sky. This was a UFO, although I doubt that it was extraterrestrial.

The writer dated the event 5/12/1980 but said he wasn&apos;t sure.  I think the event was approximately September of 1978 or 1979.  I was 16 or 17 and driving home from work on interstate 70.  I was headed east from Indianapolis to Greenfield.  I would say somewhere between the Mt. Comfort Rd. exit and the Greenfield exit, I saw 3 lights in a triangular shape.  The lights were primarily white but I do remember some occasional red and blue.  It would have been around 9:15 based on where I was on my trip home.  The lights moved in relation to each other and formed different sizes of the same triangle. I exited interstate 70 at Greenfield and turned north on highway 9.  I then went approximately 1 mile until I reached 300 north and turned west. (I was still headed home)  Very shortly after I turned onto 300 north, I could see something above me.  I have always described it as a &quot;density&quot;.  It was too close above me to make out a shape.  When I looked up, it was big enough that I couldn&apos;t see sky on any side of the object.  I have also always said it was probably bigger that two 2 story houses.  I have also said it would be like standing under a large passenger jet, that is on the ground, and looking up.  You could just see the underneath.  I couldn&apos;t see the lights at that time and I could not make out the color of the object, just that there was something above me. There was no sound. I am guessing this lasted for just a few seconds until I drove past it.  I went home and made it by my normal time which was approximately 9:30.  I told my parents and they could tell I was visibly excited.  The next morning, I was sitting in my high school home room and they came over the intercom and said the National Enquirer was in the office and wanted to interview anyone having seen a UFO.  I did not go because I was too embarrassed to get up in front of the home room.  I do not know if anybody went.  That evening, the Greenfield Daily Reporter ran a front page article.  In that article, it reported finding markings in a field.  These markings were found somewhere on the opposite side of highway 9 than I had turned.  I turned to the west of 9 and these were found on the east of 9 and at about the same area as 300 north.  I feel it must have been headed east when I saw it.  I match my dates due to where I was working.  I really felt it was in the fall because of feeling new in the home room class.  I did go back to the Hancock County Library a couple of years ago and tried to find the paper.  I was unable to find any article, but I did concentrate on the fall only.  I will make an attempt to go back soon and start checking all of 1978 and 1979.  I will also check to make sure that all of the papers are there.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We had been talking about strange light activity my aunt has been seeing in the sky over the mountains of the region (most of the area is mountainous) when we noticed a strange set of lights moving towards our position from above the tree line approximately east of our position. The craft was shaped like an egg except it was wider than it was tall, it wasnt as round as an egg rather more flattened. At first you couldnt hear any sound but for some reason as it came closer we could hear wind as if the craft itself was causing a disturbance in the air with its motion through it. The craft as it approached was about 40 to 50 feet off the ground, just above the tree tops. It was comprised of what seemed to be gun metal colored panels and had blue and white lights in succesion around its entire circumfrence. Im not exactly sure if the panels were gun metal colored but they appeared that way in the light that the craft itself was emitting (it was dark and the only reason we saw it was because the lights on its sides illuminated its shape enough for it to be seen). Id say the craft was maybe 250 to 300 feet away from us and appeared to be quite large, probably the width of about two and a half black hawk helicopters side to side. The craft was silent except for the sound of wind moving through trees under the craft (I know what helicopters sound like and this thing did not emmit such a loud sound, rather literally the sound of wind moving through trees). It flew in an easterly direction away from us and then over the mountain. Id estimate its speed at about 35 to 40 miles an hour because i was able to get a good look at it as the event happened. My mother, my aunt, and myself looked at each other to make sure we had all seen the same thing because during the event we were all speechless. Thats something my mother doesnt like to talk about (shes quite christian and doesnt want to believe its something unexplainable) and my aunt stays adamant that she sees crafts like that and strange lights in the mountains on an average basis and im inclined to believe her, she claims that the lights have been a common occurance since she was a child. Im inclined to believe her because when i happened to mention me seeing strange lights in northern new hampshire to her once she told me about her personal experience with seeing lights in the mountains.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My mother and I were walking to the Falls along with dozens of other people and directly above us we witnessed a hovering  object, It appeared round from our view with circling lights on the bottom. It s hard to say how high it was but my mother and I and a crowd of people including a police officer who shined his spotlight on the object stood there spellbound for at least 2 full minutes until it slowly drifted off to the side and out of sight.

As I approached, I realized the lights were standing still.  I slowed way down in my right lane to get a better look because as I passed the bright white lights, there were about ten neon blue strips of lights in triangular and pentagon shapes just hanging there in mid air above the trees but back into the woods.  I started to pull off the road to get a better look but I was A) shocked at what I saw and had a little bit of fear B) concerned that the cars behind me would be staring at the same thing and would rear-end my car instead of watching the road and C)I didn&apos;t want to be late to pick up my daughter from the movies in Warwick.  As a result I only got a 15-20 second close look at this &quot;thing&quot;.  I found it odd that only about 2-300 yards away there was the usual police officer parked on the south side of the road looking for speeders and he obviously didn&apos;t see anything (but he was facing north looking for the cars.

We put on some music and drank a bit more, suddenly i heard a loud pop or a snap as if something busted throught the Earth&apos;s atmosphere, it seems I was the only one of us three that heard the loud snapping sound. Anyways as soon as I heard the extremely loud snap I immediatley looked up towards the sound and there it was, a white dot quietly soaring throught the air.  After I looked at it my friends yelled out, Holy Shit!&quot; look!  while I was already looking, we all watched it for about 10 seconds and it disappeared.  The way it was moving was like not possible, it was literally teleporting in front of our eyes in a triangular motion then it disappeared.

In 92 my wife and I had recently bought a new house in a rural area of our home town. It was a very hot sumer and our newly planted outdoor plants were suffering badly with the days heat. We were both working by day and watering plants at night on our return home which on this occassion was very late. The area we lived in was a no fly zone as it was military controlled airspace and our local airforce base was responsable for that zone. I should also mention that I have and have held a pilots licence for 27 years. I have flown in both fixed and rotory winged aircraft many times, both in the civil and military situations. Roughly between 12 and 12:30 I was watering the plants and my wife was taking a shower. I was enjoying the cool night air and marvelling at the clear night sky when suddenly a strange craft lifted above the nearby tree line. It appeared to glow a kind of yellowish colour over all but along the sides there were what I can only describe as roundish areas that glowed orange, 3 or 4 of them. This craft was teardrop shape but in a horizontal aspect, slightly higher though at the wider end. It lift off in a corkscrew effect and made no sound. I have no doubt that it was not a helo. I know their flight paterns and the way they operate very well, this was not a helo. At this point a started kicking the way and yelling to my wife to come look at this thing, not wanting to take my eyes off it for a moment. I then realised that I was not the only one who had seen this as a very dark coloured car raced past our house in the direction of the craft. I was releaved to know that I was not the only one who was seeing this. My wife came out and asked what the problem was. I told her the stroy and then after what seemed like an eternity of searching the sky I resigned myself to the fact that I was the only person who saw it and was frustrated by that thought. It was my trun for the shower and her turn with the garden hose. I was no sooner in the shower when in she came and said with a trembling voice....you better get out here, that thing is right over the house and there is some sort of stuff coming out of it. Grabing a towel I bolted for the verander. Again I searched the sky to no avail. I asked her what she meant by stuff coming out of it. She said &quot;It fit the discription you gave me but from underneath I could see sparkly stuff that trailed back from the sides. It was then I became aware of the dark colourd car moving very slowly along the street and come to a spot out front. I thought this was a good sign that we were not alone in this so I started toward the car. At roughly 30 yards on a moonlit night and raped in a white towel I don&apos;t think I looked inposing but the car suddenly dashed off again. I went back inside and straight to the phone. I called RAAF base Townsville and the following conversation took place.... Yes hello, can you tell me what aircraft you have flying in the area of *********** currently please?  Response &quot;What, at this hour, nothing, you would have to be kidding&quot;. Well I&apos;m not kidding, there is something flying around here right now. Response &quot;Can&apos;t be, thats military zoning, we would know about it if there was. Yes I know it&apos;s military, thats why I&apos;m calling you. Listen there is something out here and I&apos;ve gotta tell yuh, I am a pilot with both fixed and rotory wing experience and this is nothing like that. What have you got on radar?

The sky only had a few clouds in it.these clouds could be seen clearly due to the moon was high and bright.I came to notice the lights in the sky due to the fact they turned night into day...These where large white lights, Not like the flames of a rocket...As well as they appeared in the sky, Not launching from the ocean.. As I stated I was fishing,[There was nothing blocking my view}.. To me the lights seem to be almost conected as if part of one object. These lights seemed to be several miles off the coast of sebastian..These lights overpowered the moons light. I would clearly say these lights where brighter then a night time shuttle launch as well. They did not seem to move at all.Just stayed in one place,not moving like rocket..No sounds at all.The only sounds was of everyone on the jetty trying to figure out what it was..No rumble sounds like a rocket,no flames,no smoke. It seemed to me when the lights where going out they { Rolled Up }..They did not turn out..This is when it seemed to be one object to me. The way it just seened to roll up as if it was turning to the southeast..This is when things got loud. Several fighter jet {I would say comming Patrick Air Force Base} where not wasting any time heading in the direction where it the was..I had counted two groups of around 12 planes.. They where moving very fast, Yet I could see the flames coming from the jets.The planes came back by about 30 to 40 minutes later..This time flying much slower..I remimber people joking that they didn&apos;t get there in time,Or seen what it was and ran...The only naval operations I believe took place was to try to get a look at the object or odjects..Why would you send US jets to a test sight if they where launching missles? There is a no fly zone every time they have a launch at KSC...My farther was in the navy for over 25 years.I grew up in a navy life style I have see many launchs in my 36 years of life...This was no launch...This object I would say was the biggest thing I ever seen in the sky ...This is something my friend and me tells everyone we know..", "I saw a UFO in the early morning.I woke up to my dog whining to go outside at about 6:12 A.M.

Two of them were red and the other lights were white. The object was very metallic looking. I know it wasn&apos;t an airplane because it was too low to the ground and too large.

I got my friend&apos;s attention and pointed out the object to him.  It was moving very slowly, in the opposite direction of the bus.  We dismissed it as nothing at first but then we saw a second one.  This time the object had four lights and was flying in a square shape.  It was also just one entity.  Now we knew we had something odd on our hands.  It was doing the same thing as the first object.  Then, about ten seconds later, at the same distance between the second and first one, in a straight line from the first one, was the third.  Now we were getting excited.  I leaned over and woke up another one of my friends.  I pointed the objects out to him.  He was amazed at this.  Another kid on the bus overheard us and started telling the little kids.  We told him to stop so not to scare them.  About every 10-12 seconds, we would see another one go by, containing 3-5 half-orb lights and being in various shapes.  This continued for about ten minutes.  They were all in an exact straight line.  It was amazing.  I don&apos;t know how many exactly saw the objects.

It might have been 1983, but I am pretty sure that I had just completed my first year of college and I have a vague memory of feeling irresponsible about missing too many days of work at my part-time job. I have to admit that I can&apos;t pin this down exactly. I know it happened no earlier than 1982 and no later than 1984. There were green leaves on the trees; the temperature was neither particularly hot nor cold. I had a close friend who was several years younger. I think I was 19-20 years old, so she was 16 or 17. Her father was a boy scout troop leader, and he, her mother, and other adults were taking their troop camping at Swallow Falls State Park, near Oakland, Maryland. (Here is the url for more information: http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/western/swallowfalls.html.) She was a bit of a problem teen, and there was no way that her parents were going to let her stay home alone while they took the troop to Swallow Falls. She had to go, but they told her that she was allowed to bring a friend. She asked me and I agreed to go along. Looking at the Swallow Falls camping maps, I believe that we camped in the Youth Group Loop. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly where on the loop we were positioned (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/msfmap.html), but my gut tells me we were in camp site number 2 (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/sfyg.html). I am sure that no one was in camp site 3, but I am not clear if any one was in camp 1. I have no recollection of seeing any other campers outside our party during the entire trip. The camping loop went fairly deep into the forest of huge old trees. On the first night, there was a heavy rain storm. My friend and I were sleeping on the ground in a small two-man tent. We were utterly miserable; our tent was damp and leaking. It kept raining into the next day, and in fact, by the evening, it was absolutely pouring. We decided to spend the night in her father&apos;s car. It was parked facing the loop road, next to the encampment. My friend, who was a tiny person, took the backseat, and I planned to sleep in the driver&apos;s seat in recline. I recall that we sat in the car talking for hours while the rain pounded the car. I don&rsquo;t remember thunder or lightning, just driving rain and some winds. I don&rsquo;t think the car had a lighted clock. (Now that I think about it, I&rsquo;m not sure cars had lighted clocks in the early 1980s.) But I guess it was around midnight. At some point while we conversed, I noticed a light through the front windshield.  I can remember that it illuminated the hard streaks of rain hitting the glass. We both stopped talking, so I assume that she also saw the light. I never turned my head to look at her in the back seat as the light wended its way toward us. It was yellow-greenish and about as bright as a car headlight pointed full on very bright. It did not have a defined shape because of this brightness, but I assume its core was round. It moved smoothly, about 3-5 feet from the ground, swerving gently a few times to avoid trees. I remember wondering whether it was a car on the muddy loop coming from camp 1. Then I thought, &quot;Maybe it&rsquo;s someone walking with a really bright lantern.&quot;  My last memory of the light is as it reached the front of our car.  I retain an image of it crossing in front of us, as if it was going to follow the loop out of the woods to the parking area.  But I can&rsquo;t recall it actually doing that.  I think I saw it start to illuminate the tents that were to my right. The next thing I remember is disorientation then turning around to my friend to say, &quot;That was weird.&quot; The two of us immediately picked up our conversation from before the light appeared. After that night in the woods, I didn&rsquo;t think about the odd light for years. I don&rsquo;t recall ever mentioning it to anyone until the early 1990s, when I read a description of ball lightning.  How it can glide and make unusual maneuvers. I decided that was what we had seen and mentioned it to my husband and friends. When I was in my 30s, my friend visited from Arizona, where she then lived. I asked her if she remembered that night in the car. She did, except for the light. In her memory, we sat in the car talking in the driving rain until we fell asleep. Now, after another decade of consideration, I&rsquo;m no longer sure what I saw was ball lightning and lean more toward a UFO-type experience or that I am simply misremembering an event with a rational explanation: a car; a camper. I have to rule out it was a vehicle for several reasons. First, there was only one light, not two, although I concede it could have been a car with one headlight. But I don&rsquo;t remember a car. Second, the only source for a car would have been camp site 1. From where I sat, site one would have been at approximately 1 o&rsquo;clock. I would have been at roughly 7 o&rsquo;clock. My memory is of the light coming toward us from about 10 o&rsquo;clock, out of the woods. I don&rsquo;t remember seeing camp site 1 occupied. If it was, and this was a car from that site, why would they drive the long way around the unpaved, muddy loop in the storm to exit into the parking area?  Was it a person with a lantern? It might have been someone armed with an incredibly bright light, but I don&rsquo;t remember a person. I&rsquo;ve wondered if it was someone from camp site 1 walking to the toilets. I personally have no memory of the bathhouse that is shown on the youth group loop detail, however, a site 1 camper would again be taking a very long route to get to the toilets, through driving rain on a muddy trail. I also wonder about the disorientation I felt. I don&rsquo;t know exactly what time it was when the light appeared, so I don&rsquo;t know if we were missing time, but something felt wrong. I also wonder why my friend and I never discussed it, and why I barely recalled the incident until I read the description of ball lightning years later. I don&rsquo;t remember any other experiences that could be construed as abductions. Perhaps they were coming for her? We had a falling out in the late 1990s and no longer are in touch or I&rsquo;d ask her if she has had further experiences. Aliens? A one-headlight car? Another camper? Ball lightning? I don&rsquo;t know what I saw that night and I never will, I suppose. It&rsquo;s been bothering me so much recently that I thought I should file a report.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We all stood up and, when one of my friends looked up and said hey look at that! I looked up and to my surprise was three star looking objects in a triangle. the wierd thing is that this tringle of three star looking objects were so high up that they looked to be up in space, and also that they were moving at a slight angle straight up into space. As far away as they were ( if you held out a marble in your fingers that&apos;s about how spaced they were), the triangle had to be so far apart I can&apos;t even begin wonder how far apart they were to make that triangle.

Two flickering balls of light hovering for hours.For the past two nights around 10 pm, there have been a number of light formations appearing in the west sky.

They did not decend in the least bit and their glow dwarfed the tiny flickering of aircraft that appeared off an on in the same area. I also realized that there was no military base in that area. They did appear like flares would though- simultaneously igniting and then vanishing in the same order and timing sequence in which they appeared- so they could just be a special type of training flare that would behave differently or parachute slower... but the more mysterious lights came later. I was doing a search for them when I came across the article of the person below me from the same area in Indiana. We saw the same type of lights, only I saw 2 and on a different night; tonight.

They are not planes because they haven&apos;t moved left or right, or gotten bigger or smaller in hours. They are not planets because I know where venus and mars are located, and these are not them.

Helicopters do not hover for hours on end. The only other strange event of the evening is that a friend who also witnessed the lights said tonight that her business, which was toward the direction of the lights, began to suffer electrical surges when the lights came. Her store lights flickered and her computer shut off. She said she witnessed the flares, only once they dissapeared, it was only for a 2 seconds and they re-appeared and then was also told that other businesses in the same area were having power troubles. I&apos;m sure there is a reasonable explaination for this, but at the current time these are lights that belong to an aircraft which are not identifiable to me.

As we turned a corner on a dirt road, in front of us was a round circle of light about 12ft in circumference. I stopped about 15ft away and the car stop running. When the car would not start I got out of the car and stood with the door open, &quot;the guys were yeiling to get back in and lets go&quot;. The object went straight up, stop and moved straight out over the lake and then it went into wrap speed. It was amazing how fast it was. I got back into the car, the guys yeiling &quot;lets go, lets go&quot;, I turned the key and the car started, one guys notic the time and said he would be in trouble for geting in late, we had been there 35 minutes but it seem like 2 minutes. THE 4TH WITNESSES: I worked at the Village Supermarket and when I was taking a break with some other guys this co-worker asked if anyone saw anything flying out over the lake last night, I said, a bright light? He became excited when he found out someone else had seen this and gave us his version of what he saw; the brightness, how it changed directions only horizontaly and diagonaly.

It caught my attention first, because of its strange shape which i would describe as a single object made of 2 long, thin, white ovals connected at ends.  Second reason it caught my attention was the fact there was no noise of any kind. No buzzing of an airplane, no screeching/soaring of a jet, nothing.  Third there was no chemtrail/contrail behind object.  I cant really give an estimate as to the altitude but it seemed very high and moving fast for that altitude. It was heading in the general direction of south west but more west than south if you no what I mean.  I saw it briefly then lost it as it moved over the woods across the street.  Yesterday I saw 3 white objects in the sky which flew straight then circled each other in a triangular pattern.  I assumed them to be birds but Im not so sure now.", "Color-Changing Light Appears in SkyDuring the afternoon in Summer 2004, I looked into the sky and noticed a small white light hovering above me.  There was a clear cloudless sky that day and it couldn&apos;t have been a cloud.  It was very distant, but it didn&apos;t seem to be moving.  I continued looking at the object when it changed colors: first to green, then to orange, then blue.  It began to float eastward, still changing colors, and then almost immeadiately turned south, an immeadiate 90 degree turn that no craft I can think of could handle. It floated away, southward, and eventually reached the horizon where it was out of view.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There was only one spotted at first, which was a white-blue color.  Then after further observations, several more were witnessed of similiar color as well as different colors.  They blend in with the night time stars rather well.  The objects move unlike stars however.  Some are closer than others.  It is not possible to determine distance nor shape of the objects, as the reference point is the night sky.  At approxiamatly 22:30 on 03/01/2006 a low altitude jet had a set course to one of the objects located South by South east of the location of observation.  As the jet approached, the object&apos;s movements was similiar to that of a bumble bee, very quick and in various directions.  A college (which has not witnessed this but was told about it) reported today, 03/04/2006, that he overheard conversation refering to the same details as described above about the objects being in the area. I would like to note that the objects are holding a &quot;static&quot; position, meaning that they are NOT rotating with the stars, rather staying in particular locations.  Sometimes they will leave the location they are in and then return shortly afterwards.  The movement is a slight but steady bobbing in multiple directions.  They range in colors from white-blue to redish orange.  Attempts were made to make visual verification by means of Cam Corder, 35 mm camera with zoom lens, as well as a telescope.

We then looked at it with binoculars, and noticed that it was a saucer. It had the rainbow affect to it, as if you were to hold an etched crystal to the sun. Further looking, we saw green lights on the side, spinning so fast the lights looked like they stood still. It faded in and out several times, then proceeded to radiate multi colored lights from the bottom (hence the rainbow affect) Pink, green, blue, purple, red, yellow, orange, and white. When, a plane flew under it, red was the promenint color. It was going from horizontal and tilting up enough to see the back, to almost vertical.

I went outside and there was a large, three-pronged thing in the sky.  There were three big lights, in the shape of a triangle, and a light that kind of went around the thing that changed from blue to red and some green.  I went to tell my husband about it, and it moved up, but was in the same horizontal position.  He confirmed that I&apos;m not seeing things. I got in the car to drive a little closer and saw several more just like it.  They would get brighter and more dim, but mostly stayed stationary, although there was some minimal movement.

I went to where my uncle was an advised him to look up and pointed to where the lights were and he also observed them of a few seconds circling each other and right after that the two lights shot away from each other in opposite directions at incredible speeds and then they faded away.

As we watched it the object continued to grow to about 5 times its origional size. After it had enlarged about 5-8 other spheres of light (looking similar to large stars) seemed to explode outwards from the origional light. After these lights spread outwards for about 10sec they &quot;imploded&quot; back into the origional light which then shrank back to the origional size of a star and then faded away. This first encounter lasted about 30 seconds and never made any sudden or quick movements. besides exploding and imploding it stayed in the same spot.

Something about them caught my attention, and then I realized it was that they were moving towards us, all at once, together, as one it seemed.  I watched them for a few mins until I was sure of what I was seeing, then I told my daughters to look up and they saw them/it too.  They slowly came almost directly over our heads, and as they got near to us they started to bank and turn towards the south.  I didn&apos;t realize it at first but as they got closer to us they were also descending. I could see any edge or shape to this craft, but it was blocking out the view of the sky and stars behind it as it moved...  As it straightened out towards the south after making the turn, it wobbled once or twice and then shot off to the south 3 to 5 miles (estimate), also elevating as it moved, and then just stopped.  It covered this distance in the blink of an eye, but it also seemed like maybe who ever or what ever was controlling this thing, wasn&apos;t having the results they wanted.  The Movement was somewhat erratic and unstable.  Changing elevation and direction and stopping and going, and that wobble before it moved quickly to the south, just didn&apos;t seem as controlled as something that could move that fast and that quite should be.

I looked straight up, because the facility is well lighted, both inside and out, making star gazing less than spectacular. I happened to focus on what I believed to be two ordinary stationary stars. One star was of medium brightness, and the other star, at the 3:00 o&apos;clock position, was very dim, just half as bright, and about the distance of a quarter held at arms lenght from the other star. Suddenly, the dim star, just a speck of light, made sharp, angular manuevers, all within close proximity to the other star.  I remember exclaiming to myself &quot;holy mackerel, that thing is moving&quot;. I nearly ran inside to get my work partner, but I was afraid to lose track of it, so I just kept watching. Then the pin prick of light made a circular move, which brought it to the opposite side of the stationary star, to the 9:00 o&apos;clock position. These moves only lasted 4 to 5 seconds, maybe a moment more or less. It hesitated for a split second, and then headed south.  I had the presense of mind to start counting: one-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand, four-one thousand, five-one thousand, six-one thousand, gone!!!  over the southern horizon, where I lost sight of it at about 15 degrees over the horizon. This speck of light had no sound and no tail.  It never flared brighter or dimmer. This speck of light, which I perceived to be very high in the atmosphere, crossed half the night sky in six seconds!!  It did not blink.  After making its manuevers and going south it did not accelerate, but simlpy arrived at its intended speed and went absolutely straight.  This once in a lifetime observation has annoyed me since it happened and I&apos;m pleased to report it. I have since retired from that line of work.

At this point it has a very strange and eerie sound... a vibration type noise like wubwubwubwub.

We turned onto a main road then off onto the next road down from the one we turned off and drove up about a half mile and stopped. It had snowed during the day and the road was covered and a very light snow was falling.  We were looking behind us and near the end of the road alittle up from the main road we could see a white light that looked like it was a car with just its dome light on. It went off then came back on closer to us and then off and then we started to drive again. Looking back it seemed as if there was something right behind us, a black shadow of something and a red beam flashed by the truck.  We then came to a stop sign and turned left onto the road we live on, about 100 ft after turning it seemed like we were in a blizzard with snow flying heavy and blowing very hard. Our satellite radio lost reception during this. The blowing snow stopped after about 10-15 seconds and then totally stopped as if a helicopter had gone right over head.  There was no noise of any kind and we returned home 2 minutes later. 2 hours after arriving home there was a bright white light in the lower sky outside our house moving in circular patterns for about 40 minutes.

At first I thought it was a heliocoptor, but as I kept glancing at it, I noticed that it was a perfect black sphere. It was maybe between 500 and 1000 feet away. I&apos;m not sure because I don&apos;t know exactly how large it was. I guessed maybe between 3 and 7 feet in diameter. It seemed to fly at a speed only slightly faster than I was driving, so I sped up a little bit to keep side-by-side with it. I couldn&apos;t hear any sound but I was in my car and there were several other cars driving around me so I can&apos;t say that it was totally silent for certain.After paralleling the thing for about eight miles down the highway, I had to turn into work. I got out of my car and watched it as it slowly flew over the edge of the horizon.

I continued to look at it, and either it periodically &apos;turned over&apos; to reveal a red area, or else it was flashing a red light.  It seems like it was pretty far up there, but since I don&apos;t know exactly what it was, I don&apos;t know for sure how high it was.  However, if it was a conventional aircraft of some kind, then how high would it have to be to be about the size of Venus?  This was definitely NOT Venus or any other star or planet, not a helicopter, satellite, bird, or balloon.  The reason I rule out balloon is because if it WAS a balloon, then it would have to be extremely big, circular, black and red (or else black with a flashing red light)  AND have the capability of hovering.  Does this fit any known balloon?  Even if it were caught in a up draft, could it remaing ABSOLUTELY still?  It was NOT bobbing, jerking, wiggling, or doing anything else except possibly gently turning periodically to reveal another side which was red.  It could also have been a flashing red light.  I just don&apos;t know.This was about 5:30 pm, but it was still quite light, and the sun was behind me, so it could not have been in its own shadow. It was definitely black. That much I know.  What I DON&apos;T know is what it was.After watching it for about 3 minutes, it suddenly disappeared.  Just gone.  Like that.

It was a cool autumn day, with clear blue skies and no clouds, and lots of sunshine.  There was a bit of wind, as I recall.  I looked up and saw a white puff of cloud appear, like a firework...but there was no sound.  Then, a white hemispherical shape came out of the smoke, with a white/metallic cone underneath it, pointing down, and seemingly separate.  I thought to myself, &quot;This looks like a model rocket nose-cone with a parachute, I remember making those.&quot;  However, I saw no indication that a model rocket had been launched (they leave smoke trails.)   I slowly realized that this object was actually much larger and further away.  My estimates are that the bowl shape was 100ft across, at a height of 750ft to 1000ft above ground.  I puzzled over why it was hovering in the air.  Then, to my surprize, the cone began to rotate around underneath the bowl shape, clockwise if you were looking up at it from the ground.  It acted as if it were connected to the rim and remained pointing down.  There was a hazy dark cloudy spot between the cone and the bowl shape, like a field of some kind.  The cone spun around at a rate of 3 to 4 times per second.Then, the whole unit turned on its side at right angles to the ground, and proceeded due south at an estimated acceleration of 1000km/s (100 Gs!!!).  The cone continued to rotate around the rim as if attached to the bottom of the bowl the whole time it did this.  It was on the horizon and out of sight in less than 4 seconds.  Then, mysteriously, there was a second puff of smoke where the first had been, as if something closed behind it.

No noise was heard, as it was not THAT close.  I watched it for about 30 seconds then called my friend to come see.  By the time he got there (about 30 seconds later), the big light had faded out slowly and risen in the sky.  It was now a lot higher and looked like an airplane high in the sky with a red light flashing.  We watched as it flew away to the West at the speed of a regular plane.

This was several years ago (1966) in the early morning hours. This object was circular and was orange in color. It was about the size of the moon when the moon is overhead. &apos;I told my twelve-year-old brother to look and he looked up and said that it was probably the moon. It wasn&apos;t the moon because the moon was elsewhere in the sky, low but not on the horizon. I didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it as it was stationary and glowing orange from dim to bright. The intensity of the light was not extremely bright closer to dim but clear. It only appeared for a short time probably 30 to 45 seconds and the disappeared. There was no sound associated with it. I have thought of this from time to time over the years and have tried to think of what it could have been. The only thing I could ever come up with was a UFO. This all took place in Columbus, Ohio on the west side of what was then called Westgate Manor We lived at ((deleted)) Briggs Road.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Missing Time: Two PeopleMy mother and I have a long history of UFO sightings/involvement.  It&apos;s highly possible that there was an abduction experience when I was not quite three, and my mother was 23, involving not only us but a busload of soldiers en route to Augusta, GA, in 1957.  But when the incident I&apos;m reporting now happened, I was around 25, and my mother was 45.  I had driven from my suburban Alexandria home to visit my mother in Front Royal, VA, and we decided it was a lovely summer afternoon for a drive.  We went on one of our old favorite rides: to a nearby mountain where an airliner had crashed a number of years before, just up the road from a semisecret military installation.  The road led through some beautiful countryside, and we&apos;d always enjoyed taking leisurely drives and talking about life in general.  My mother and I had seen many UFOs, both together and separately, and had, as mentioned earlier, a bizarre bus trip when I was very young, but on this summer day the conversation was light, and the subject matter was strictly terrestrial... except, of course, for our traditional speculation on what went on at that semisecret military complex out in the boondocks yet so close to DC.  We were travelling north in bright sunlight early in the afternoon... then the next thing we remember, we were travelling south, about 20 miles from where we last remembered being, and the sun was almost setting.  We both seemed to be coming out of a brain fog -- speech was very difficult.  My mother spoke first, saying in effect &quot;How did we get here, and how can it be this late?&quot; It took great effort for me to respond that I had no idea.  We literally did not say another word for the remaining forty minutes of the trip -- very unusual for two chatty sorts, especially given the circumstances.  I could not comprehend how I could have been driving in such an apparent fugue state, and that both of us were in the same condition was quite disturbing.  Neither of us could remember a single thing that had happened to us during the five or so hours just past... and neither of us were capable of talking about it -- or talking about anything else, at that time.  Even years later, it was exceedingly difficult for us to discuss the incident beyond the bare known facts, and both of us vividly recalled the incredible introversion of our thoughts on the way back to her house.  But we both, as we managed to admit to each other years later, were positive that we had seen &quot;something,&quot; that a craft (UFO) was involved.  Our difficulty talking about this event even years later seemed perhaps the result of a mental block of some sort placed by an outside source.  Especially given our individual and shared histories with UFO sightings (also witnessed by others numerous times), there was little doubt in either of us that we&apos;d had an intense and lengthy encounter with something, and some entities, decidedly not of this world.  The roads we were travelling  My mother was an accountant for a furniture/appliance store, and I was a chef/restaurant owner (physically a bit disabled now, thanks to years of heavy lifting, etc.) and am now a professional artist and writer.  This report is probably only the first in a somewhat long line -- it&apos;s time I deal openly with the strangeness in my life that seems to have revolved around UFOs, and this is step one.  I&apos;m very open to discussing the full range of experiences and incidents with an investigator, if you or an associate are interested.  I will also consider hypnosis in order to penetrate the mental veil concealing the two incidents of missing time, providing that the hypnotherapist is reputable and well-versed in probable abduction incidents.  Those two incidents have haunted me for so long -- once for nearly fifty years -- and I&apos;d like to know the truth, however discomfiting it may be.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My nephew and I were outside in front of my home at dusk. We were lying in the grass beside the road.  We would jump up as a car drove by and attempt to scare the drivers.  We were children and weren&apos;t being watched closely!  While waiting for the next car, a &quot;flying saucer&quot; slipped from NNE to SSW at tree top level.  I can still see that saucer clearly in my mind after all these years.  It made no sound.  It made a Z movement as it slipped through the air. That Z movement impressed me, because in 1995 when I saw my second UFO, it made that same Z movement. My nephew was no younger than two but probably not yet four when we saw the saucer.  He remembers it. He had to be old enough to talk, because when we saw it, we turned to each other and yelled, &quot;UFO&quot;!  We also had to have heard &quot;UFO&quot; on the television or radio for us to know that term!  We ran into the house, but neither of us remember what happened after that and there is no one left alive who could tell us.

I had just came home from work, fixed a meal and ate, when I decided to sit outside and enjoy the night air in my backyard. I was out there for about 30-45 minutes after sunset when the clouds started coming in, the weather called for rain, so as I was watching some of the forcasted clouds come in, I peered up and to my amazement I caught what I beleived to be a ship hiding in concealment. So, I was transfixed on it as it passed slowly by there was no sound coming from this ship at all. Then it occured to me that Nostrodamuses claim was wrong it wasn&apos;t meteors he saw but alien spacecraft.To my greatest suprise I would get to see two of the worlds greatest theories come to pass. As I watched as it passed overhead, another came by then another, then another, as I was calculating where they were going. I figured it was WPAFB. Then they stopped. The ship overhead was a triangle in shape with three large viewing windows from my observation,ther was also two figures in the windows which seemed to be looking directly towards me, so I just politely waved greeting them to Dayton. Then all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye I saw a bluish type of light, like that on Star Trek&apos;s transporter system. Well to my suprise it seemed like there were little children running around my yard playing. I couldn&apos;t see them physically because they had on something that made them seem to be invisible. Like that suit the predator wore when he was fighting Arnold S. then as i am looking around I feel a little one lean on my leg and seem to be looking right into my face, and another start playing in my hair, like they have never seen a black guy before. It was just amazing that there kids was just as curious as mine are. So I peer back up and smile &amp; laugh that the two are still there in the window are still looking down on us. It must have been at least 20 or more minutes they stayed in my yard playing. The ships started moving out, I would guess that WPAFB had difficulty greeting our new friends and unloading there belongings. I would guess this ship that stopped over my head was a passenger vehicle, because there was more vehicles to come. The next was box shaped,like a transporter. The one after that had my magneto pulse drive system underneath. I counted at least ten ships, but the last two gave me goose bumps you could tell these were not peace loving ships these were built for fighting. they were larger than the rest with deep grooves and edges, and just looked terrorfying.

As soon I looked, I knew the craft was not a Aircraft that was known to me.  I just sat there slack jawed, my girlfriend said something like &quot;go, it&apos;s clear!&quot;, I just pointed head at the craft. The craft was moving slow and I precieved low, appox 500-800 feet.  It was about 5 thumbs wide when over head. I&apos;ve worked at an airport and can judge speed fairly close, my best guess is that the craft was woving at about 50-75 mph. when the the craft came close to overhead I shut off the cars motor, the craft was silent.

What my fiancee and I saw was nothing like we&apos;ve seen before.  Around 6:00, both of us got into our cars and proceed home from of different jobs.  I was commuting North from Glendale into Valencia.  My fiancee was coming from Reseda Blvd and was battling out the freeways in heavy traffic.  At about 7:40, going west on the 210 freeway I spotted three lights traveling from the North to the South (San Fernando).  The three lights formed what I can almost positively identify as a solid triangle.  Two lights were a cool blue and did not pulse or strobe in any way, and a thrid, on the side (not directional front) was more white/yellow (also did not flash or blink).  The object was large and low, about the size of a large commercial air craft at about the altitude you see them when they&apos;re approaching an airport to land.  Sometimes you might see a strange light in the sky, but as you watch it it always explains itself by changing direction or distance and you come to realize, &quot;Oh, it&apos;s just a plane... I couldn&apos;t see the wings before.&quot;  But I observed this as it traveled across the complete 180 degrees of my field of sight, crossing over the freeway and continuing on over San Fernando Valley.  This object never changed perspective.  It appeared as a SOLID, large, geometric triangle with three lights at its points.  No curves.  No wings.  And it glided slowly perfectly smooth over the freeway.  Too slow for a plane at that distance and altitude.  This was strange, but I might have been able to dismiss it easier if I hadn&apos;t arrived home to hear my fiancee saw the exact same object from the other side of the valley.  Our observations were identical, and we both agreed that our after-work sleepy daze was broken when this strange object immediately stuck out.  We both, independently came to the same conclusions (not that it was a space ship or anything, just that this was no ordinary plane) and we were shocked to find we both witnessed it.  One case of over-active imagination... maybe.  But two?  I was going about 60 MPH but my fiancee was stuck in heavy traffic.

I went to let them in the house and when I opened the door they ran me over peeing and pooping as they crossed over me.The noise was very hi-pitched.I was 13 yrs old.My first reaction was to run where they did under my bed. I went as far as the bed room and ran back to lookfor my mom and brother. The front door was opened and I went to the porch and our neighbors and my mom and brother were all looking in the sky.

My family were on a road trip to Utah in  September of 2005. On Interstate 80 in Wyoming, driving through miles of farm or pasture lands, on the 27th or 28th in the late afternoon, I noticed jet streams from aircraft at extremely high altitudes. This is normal and did not concern me. But as I looked occasionally due to bordom of the drive, I slammed on my brakes due to a fear that &quot;something&quot; may have fallen off one of these air planes and was about to hit the roadway.  As I kept my focus on the object, I drove very slowly, realizing that it was not falling. I guestimate the object was approximatly 300-600 yds above ground. It was almost directly overhead. It was difficult to make out shape due to what I first believed was a very strong reflection of sunlight comming off the matalic surface of the object. It had a compact form, and I believe it to be a spherical shaped object. It did not have wings, strobes, lights, or propellers.  It was still day light. My wife asked why it was so brite.  I told her it might be a weather baloon and it was reflected sunlight. My wife said,&quot;No! We&apos;re driving west, the sun is over there (in the direction of our travel), it can&apos;t be reflecting the sun.&quot; I became nervous at the relization that she was correct.  Then the object turned dark. This was as strange as the brightness. It did not just turn off the light, it became a black sphere in the sky floating above our car.  Then it took off.  I have never seen anything move that fast in my life. It traveled west and was no longer visible within seconds.  As we calmed our children down we tried to rationalize what we had seen. About 5-10 minutes later, my wife yells &quot;there it is.&quot; Just as before, above us, slightly in front, extremly close.  Again, it turned black, and took off.  I took the next exit and waited.  Hoping (sort of) that it would appear again (may possibly be three seperate objects, or same one that &quot;circled back&quot; with out us seeing it). As my wife looked for the camera, it did appear again, but this time it turned to black much faster and, again, took off in the same direction.  Based on size above our heads, and when it visually was no longer visible as it travelled, I guestimate it travelled over at least 100 miles within seconds.

It was evident that these lights were round in shape. The time was approximately 9:30pm - it was dark by now. The colour emanating from them was like bright headlights, white with a slight yellow hue, yet they were above the trees.I am a mother of 6 children and of sound mind and character. I don&rsquo;t make stuff up.I live near a very large, deep and pristine lake in NE Alberta, Canada.  My home is nestled in a forested area adjacent to one of the many bays of this lake, named Cold Lake. To the west of my home, approximately 4 miles, is the largest jet fighter Air Force Base in Canada. I am very used to and familiar with seeing and hearing these jet aircraft on a regular basis. What I witnessed this night was very different.After a few minutes of gazing upon this anomaly, one of the lights sped away in a westward direction. Its take-off or acceleration was like nothing I had ever seen in a conventional aircraft, jet, helicopter, prop-plane, whatever.  One could compare its take-off to the release of an arrow from a bow.  Also, there was absolutely no sound. I would estimate their distance away from me at &frac12; mile or less. This left 2 lights still in place above the trees. Given the estimate of &frac12; mile distance away, the actual size of the lights would likely be somewhat larger than virtual headlights.No structure, definition or appendage to the lights was visibly evident; it was a dark night.Upon my arrival home, one block from my initial visual, my son, very excited, asked if I had noticed the lights above the trees over there? I responded with, &quot;&ldquo;yes&quot;, of course! We discussed the matter briefly, including the one that got away and decided to investigate further.The lights were hovering over a marshy area. The water was lit up due to the proximity of these lights emitting upon it. The light would pulsate seemingly on a timed or regular basis. It is important to note that there are no roads where these lights appeared; the only road is the one to my house. I state this so that no one will have notions that they were motor vehicles; how could they be?  At the time of this sighting we had 5 dogs. Don&rsquo;t ask why, we just did. As the light decreased from full intensity to zero light or pulsated from normal to no light, the dog&rsquo;s hair would stand straight up on their backs and they would bark, acting erratic in nature. When the light returned to normal the dog&rsquo;s behaviour did too.I said that my son and I were going to investigate further and so we did.  At approximately 10:00pm we decided to drive around to the top of a nearby knoll hoping to get a better view.  The lights were still visible but somehow appeared to have moved to a more distant location.  We watched them (the 2 remaining lights) for about 10 minutes and then decided to go home.  Upon attempting to start the car it was discovered that it was unable to turn over; it was &quot;dead,&quot; so-to-speak - very uncharacteristic of this vehicle because the battery was new and maintained regularly.  We supposed that somehow these lights had an effect on the operation of our car.  So, we had to walk home.As the evening progressed we would periodically look outside to see if the lights were still present.  It was midnight when we finally went to bed and the lights continued in place.I must say that the whole experience gave me what I would define as a spooky or unnerving sense of emotion. We returned to our car the next morning; it started without incident.Strangely enough, I spoke to a neighbour about this event.  Earlier in the evening, at about 7pm, he was travelling to his home and witnessed a light or lights travel immediately over his car at a high rate of speed.  Perhaps these lights were related or of the same group.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

After watching for &frac12; hour, I went outside with my 3.5 digital camera and took two photos. I returned to bed and watched as the object slowly rose over a period of about one hour to about 45 degrees. I then went back to sleep. On March 16th, I opened the photos in my computer and blew them up to reveal two unusual exposures which I believe to be UFO&rsquo;s?

I thought it was an airplane as I see many airplanes in that area because they are heading to Midway airport to land. As I kept going on southbound on Western Ave. I kept getting close, but it looked weird. It look like a plane with no wings and it had lights flashing. The lights look like they were dancing. So I speed up and made a right hand turn at 36th street and parked at the corner. I didn&apos;t get off the my car, but I opened the window. As it passed westward I saw this on its side. When I said this is no plane, a red light flashed in my face. It disorientated me for a few seconds. It seemed like a sign telling me they saw me. As It continue westward, it turned now heading southbound. It seemed it picked up speed and I didn&apos;t see it anymore. I was 5 mintues away from home. When I got home my mom was making something to eat. I went right to the mirror to see if there was anything on my face because I felt a burning sensation. I even asked my mom if she noticed anything on my face. She said no. I went to my parents bedroom where my dad was and told him, dad you are not going to believe what I saw. He said to me that he heard it pass by. Before telling him anything. My dad said he heard a hover/murmur noise.

Neither one of us said anything for about 2 minutes because we thought that they were perhaps some sort of airplane. Then after noticing that they were not moving at all, I asked her what they were and she told me that she had been watching them and that she was wondering that same thing.  We pulled over to see if they were in moving and we came to find out that they were sitting completely still. We decided to move slightly closer to them just so we could get some sort of a perspective of where they might be hovering over and as we were driving we passed by two trees and once we passed those trees, we looked for the lights and they were gone. We decide to turn around and go back up the hill thinking that for some odd reason maybe we just couldn&apos;t see them from the angle that we were at. So we went back up the hill and we still saw nothing. We drive past where we saw them the first time and when we almost get to our home, we saw them again. So, we drove closer to them yet again just on a different road this time. We parked the car and watched them for about 3~5 minutes then, as my mom was looking for the binoculars, I saw the first one fade out. I told my mother and she looked up and with the binoculars, she watched the second one fade away. They did not reapear so we decided to go on home. We got home and were inside for about 5 minutes and then went back outside to look for them once more.

Upon our stay we witnessed several unidentified crafts hoovering. They were too low to be stars, and too high to be boats. Similar to what I&apos;ve read by others, they were symetric, metallic looking objects with a deep red eminating from the bottom, sometimes a bright green. They were observed for several nights, since our evacuation from Hurricane Katrina till we arrived home after about 5 months in a hotel. It was a nice hotel with an excellent view of the Gulf from the 6th floor, with a balcony. We have video footage of these objects which seemed to stay just out far enough not to be detected by the naked eye very well. Sometimes they would be in a &quot;formation&quot; of some sort, a &quot;W&quot;. At one point as we were all looking  at them from the balcony, one &quot;craft&quot; lit up, lights seemingly going around the vessel. That was the point that we knew it was something extraordinary. It was also where we could make out the metallic, grey look to the surface. Like two upside down plates, the lights emitted from the upper middle section of the phenomenea. A deep red or green light emitted from the mid-bottom. They hoovered mostly, sometimes moving, sometimes slowly from our vantage wiew, but had to be incredibly fast compared to seeing an aircraft passing by.

This craft had one softlight Big white light on each &quot;wingtip&quot; and the nose light consisted of multi-color lights neatly packed in an oblong shaped area. The big white lights were easy on the eyes,The nose lights did not blink or pulse. I felt no downward air or heat as it glided over me.Only I think a slight very low blowing noise.I witnessed this object in 1988 while at my job outside a cottage at Beaumont Juvenile Correctional Center as I was about to re-enter &quot;Bell&quot; Cottage after a task given Me.  I learned a little over a year later another Officer had watched it from another Cottage Window.  He told me &quot;It was a &quot;wedge&quot; shape with lights that was hovering by the Infirmary then started to move slowly down Cottage row then suddenly speed away very fast.  I&apos;ve always since have belived this craft was trying to sneak over me as I approuched Bell Cottage  But my eye caught it as it moved toward me overhead.

The object appeared somewhat translucent with an undulating light which changed colors (yellowish, whitish, orangeish) as the light moved in what appeared to be a counter-clockwise direction inside around the margins of the object.  The object looked smooth and rounded with no sharp edges or projections. We heard no sound and it moved rapidly and quietly through the sky.  We observed it for probably less than 30 seconds. My husband and I both hold college degrees, traveled extensively around the world, lived in Asia for five years, and never experienced an event like this.

I was on a date with my girlfriend, Victoria (Tristan) Poetzel. It was about 9 or 10 pm and we were returning to my house. I pulled into the driveway in front of my parents home. I got out of the driver&apos;s side, and looked up toward the night sky. I noticed a small dim white light that was no larger or brighter than the light from the dim stars that were visible that night. The light tracked very slowly, in a straight line, due south. My first thought was how it reminded me of the satellites we used to watch move slowly across the sky as we layed in our sleeping bags on the camping trips of my youth. They were dim, and moved slowly in a straight lines across the night sky. But this was in the city, on the street, surrounded by streetlights, at sea level. I&apos;d never noticed a satellite in those conditions before. I said to Tristan, &quot;Hey, do see that light? What is it a satellite or something?&quot; I pointed in the right direction, and told there it was in the sky next to the tv antenna on the neighbor&apos;s house. I saw her look in the right direction, but she said nothing. I wondered if she could even see it. She didn&apos;t like wearing her glasses all the time, and she was not wearing them now. Her eyesight was not that great. We wathched for a moment longer in silence and suddenly, to my surprise, the light appeared to oscillate wildly back and forth perpendicular to the direction of its travel, kind of like the needle of a sismograph, and then it was just gone. I was stunned. Nothing I was aware of could move like that. I quickly looked toward Tristan, and in perfect unison we both said, &quot;Did you see...&quot;  She had been able to see it after all, and we had both witnessed its odd departure. We went inside and explained what we&apos;d seen to my parents. As UFO stories go it&apos;s pretty boring. No huge craft. No big headed aliens. But, we saw what we saw, and I can&apos;t explain what it was. I&apos;m a skeptic myself, but this story is the God&apos;s Honest Truth and I&apos;d take a lie detector test in a minute to prove it. Unfortunately, Tristan and I broke up in 1988. I haven&apos;t seen her in years, and I don&apos;t know if she recalls what we saw.

I was returning from a museum visit with my girlfriend when I noticed a couple of strange white lights close to the horizon. I glanced at that a few times and noticed that they didn&rsquo;t look normal at all. My girlfriend noticed them as well and we were trying our best to figure out what they were. They looked like two almost straight lines, close to a crescent moon maybe and they were extremely bright. They were moving a little back and forth in the sky and they looked like they were very far away, but looked very large. There were a few dark clouds above them, very thin in an otherwise crystal clear sky. We went through a drive-thru to get a coffee and I phoned my brother to go outside and take some pictures. While I got my coffee the objects were out of sight and we could not see them for about five minutes max. When we were back on the road one of them had disappeared, completely. The sky was a dark blue all around and we could see no trace. One was still there however, still bright as it was previously. As we drove westward towards my home we saw the object slowly move up towards the thin piece of patchy dark cloud above. It moved slowly towards it until it vanished behind. (The cloud was very sparse and very thin, yet the brightness completely vanished.) I continued to watch it and suddenly my girlfriend pointed out an object which was rising from the top of the cloud. This object was not bright however like the previous one, it was black and looked like it was extremely high and moving extremely fast. It looked like a giant &apos;V&apos; shaped object and was moving higher and higher above the clouds. It was still slightly light outside at the point, enough to see the object fairly well. It did not look like a plane, maybe it was, but I still wrestled with its shape and the apparent speed in my mind. I got to my home and ran inside to get a camera as my girlfriend kept watch. My brother had not seen it, he looked in the completely wrong direction! Either way, I ran outside with the camera and it had just vanished. My girlfriend said it looked like it just went so high it was out of view.

This is the second time it&apos;s happened to a friend of mine, his story:  He said he was walking home from the store during the Monday night snowstorm and as he approached his building, he noticed three women in high-school cheerleader mini-skirts walking silently behind him (he mentioned that they were silent because he said that he only heard his own footfall as it crunched into the snow). When he turned back around he noticed what he first thought to be alot of police cars. Then he said because of the size of it, maybe a large construction crew working on Lyndale Ave N. As he climbed the steps of his building, he noticed that the women had lined up side-by-side, standing at the foot of the steps but were facing and staring at the &quot;construction sight&quot;.  Everything was silent and this is when he said he got the sudden urge to run into the building.  He said he went straight to the Recreation Room because the window there gives you a direct sight to the street where the &quot;construction sight&quot; and the women were.  This is when he got a clear view of what he said was this huge object hovering over the street about tree level.  It was silent, black, or either a very dark color, and had a row of flashing, dancing, lights running along the bottom perimeter of it.  He said what was also astonding is that the object was about as large as a football field.  &apos;He also noticed that the street--which is usually busy--did not have ANY traffic at all.  (I was born and raised there too so I know this particular street and it is ALWAYS busy--just like a freeway.)  He said he then started running around inside the building to all his neighbor&apos;s, knocking on their doors trying to get someone to come and see the object--finally finding someone after approximately 15 minutes.  He said he told this person, &quot;Man, come and see this shit!&quot;  But when they got to the window, the craft was gone.  He said the guy then asked him, &quot;What shit?&quot;, and my friend said he told him, &quot;Man...NEVER MIND&quot;  He saw this very same object back in 1979 while with a group of friends. That sighting lasted for about 10 minutes as a triangular-shaped object moved slowly in their field of vision from right to left. I must say that these encounters are similar in that there is an eerie calm and that sometimes no-one seems to be around or is arousable when these experiences happen--obviously &quot;they&quot; set it up this way.", "I was at a Waffle House in Brentwood T.N. on the corner of Old Hickory B.L.V.D. and Franklin Pike Circle. Across the street of Franklin Pike Circle is a Target convience store. At this location, I saw a black ball floating in the air. The object was bigger than a softball but smaller than a basketball. I wathed the object for 7 to 8 seconds. The object then began to move slowly in a westernly direction upwards for at least 3 to 4 minutes until it was completely out of sight. I don&apos;t know why, but I have seen objects like this 3 times over the period of 32 years. Two were at night and they glowed; this one was during the day and it was black. After I saw this object, there was a small Cessna-like airplane in the area.

As I was driving I looked up in the sky and could see a greenish light moving in a circular pattern. It would make one revolution about every 2 seconds. So I continued to travel northbound and the light seemed to move with me as I moved. I pulled into the Georgetown Ice arena so that I could get a better look at it. It was not too high in altitude, probably about 50 feet in the air. While I was stopped it was making a perfect circle around the house across the street. After about 5 minutes of pondering what it could be I continued down the road, and it seemed to move with me. It never got any closer or farther away. I turned eastbound onto M-45 and it started to move eastbound with me also. Once I started to get into the city it got farther into the sky and higher into the air. After I arrived at the grocery store to pick up my girlfriend I looked up and could not see it, but I didn&apos;t think that it was gone, so I traveled northbound on Collindale rd in Standale, mi and once I got to a location where there were no city lights and it was still there. Looking on a map it appeared as if it was circling over the Sand creek golf course. The time now was about 6:50 am. I traveled back to the store and picked up my girlfriend, and went back to the location where I saw it on Collindale rd, and it was still in the sky, but very faint as the sun had started rising. We could see it faintly on the drive back home on M-45 in the North sky. We lost sight of it at about 7:17 am. the light could not be coming from a stationary object on the ground because it when I first sighted it, it appeared to be about 150 yards north of me, later in the morning it appeared to be miles away, but still north of me.

This was my 2nd sighting this summer.  It didn&apos;t appear that anyone saw what I saw. The reason I&apos;m reporting these two sightings is because I feel no one else saw these craft. I also feel that I saw these sightings because I was so in tune with nature at that time (my garden &amp; all} and it appeared that no one else saw the &quot;acorn&quot; on the busy street.

Amazing object to behold!Sighting occured in Sep. of 1967 [two years before the Moon landing of Apollo-11 - I was very interested in the space-race at that time]. UFO (flying disc/saucer) seen first at a distance of about 1 mile to the north of the city. Approached/descending and came up the middle of the street in housing estate [four miles from city centre]. Hovered overhead for about 2 minutes at a height of about 20ft. Trapezium shaped window on side of the circular craft. Flying machine rotated on its axis 180 degrees and window moved to other side. It was so low that I could actually look into the craft through the window of this machine - whitish interior - nothing else observed through this window [obviously, if there was a window something could look out of it]! Sighting occured at around 10pm - twilight - craft kind-of blended into the dark sky background. Noiseless/silent. Looked like something out of a film. I was 12 years of age at the time of sighting. Amazing sight and left me with a sense of wonder at the time - flabbergasted/goggle-eyed/knew I had seen something really unusual - not from here. Also seen by my 13 year old brother who can confirm the sighting. At the time of the encounter we were out for a walk in local area. First thought the object was a plane/helicopter - bright white spotlight underneath the craft turned off as it approached. Knew immediately that it was a &apos;classical&apos; typical UFO [from watching TV programmes and newspapers/magazines of the time]. Object moved/floated up the street over the tops of the houses in a southerly direction for a distance of about 150ft. After about 5 minutes the disc/object shot up into the sky at high speed. Dark metallic blue colour - very close sighting, typical UFO - very distinct as such. Looked like a flying machine from 200 to 500 years into the future. Impressive, very visual, solid-flying-machine, unmistakable as UFO and typical of the photographs that I have seen of these things. No markings on craft to identify it. Seen at very close proximity - less than 20 ft from the ground - saw the underside of the machine. Circular shape. Hovered above houses in local area - just above the roofs. At one point directly overhead. Have read extensively about the subject over the years. My personal conclusion: UFO&apos;s are real - seeing is believing. Origin: probably other dimensions. UFO&apos;s/NDE&apos;s possibly related. We are not just biological creatures but also spiritual beings. There is a bit more to the universe than science/religion tells us or would care to admit [outside their box]. Even after all these years since the sighting [39 years] I am still amazed that I saw such an object and have not personally seen anything like it since. Find it very odd that after 60 years no answer/explanation to the subject of UFO&apos;s has been forthcoming from science/religious communities.  Presently interested in astronomy [have 16-inch Newtonian telescope] &amp; chess. Christian. The UFO enigma seems to be a conundrum/puzzle/mad-hatter&apos;s riddle - a world-wide phenomena - a question with no answer, as yet. Yes - people are seeing and photographing these objects. Many hoaxes have been reported but I think a high-percentage are geneuine reports. Billy Meier&apos;s pictures are very good [possibly real] but I think his story is off-the-wall, a diatribe which ruins his case. This testimony is geneuine, honest and true. I have no ulterior motive in reporting it [similar report also sent to Mufon website in Feb-06]and would like to remain anonymous although you may contact me privately by email if you like. Do you believe in fairies/UFO&apos;s/angels/God?  What is the sound of one hand clapping? What is the riddle of the Sphynx? Who are we/what are we? What is the nature of reality? Is there life after death? What do you think of NDE reports? Is the Ark of the Covenant under the Temple Mount? Is this the end of the age? Is the Christian story true? Are there codes embedded in the Bible text? Are crop-circles telling us something - symbolic? There are more questions than answers and the more you understand the less you know! Well, that&apos;s about it from me - I hope you find this report interesting and believable?  Just file it away with the other 1,000,000 sightings that have been reported over the years. I&apos;m hoping that someday somebody will come up with the real answer to this phenomena and enlighten us all - a logical, lucid, rational, believalbe, provable, truthful explanation will suffice - at the moment we are living in a fog of possible solutions, bubble-geum answers with no end in sight.", "Boomerang style crafted spotted with no sound only lights on the craft.I was standing at the bus stop by the mail box out on Whittaker when I looked over my shoulder to see if the bus was coming.

It was totally silent.

This object was very large, approxiamtely the length of a 747 airliner or larger and had intermitten flashing colored lights coming from every angle, reminded me of colored lights reflecting of a high quality diamond. It had the appearance of an immense amount of diamonds clustered together to form the above mentioned shape, like nothing I have ever seen before.

My neighbor whom I had gone next door to see and have her look at this so I would be believed, saw pretty much what I saw through the binoculars. She described it as a translucent oval object, extremely large in size and appeared to have what looked simlar to an immense amount of diamond like objects inside, with itermitten lights flashing.

Half way through my journey, I came to a T junction, no cars where on the road at the time, when I all of a sudden felt rather strange, like when you think someone is watching you. I looked up to see a large disk shaped object hovering over me, around 60 to 70 foot in the air, it was around 50 foot in diameter, it was silent except for a very low sounding hum, a little like a power station hum. The craft was circular with a ball in the centre, that seemed to be glowing orange like the cherry of a cigarette, the circular space outside of the glowing ball was like a black metal, kind of a dark purple silver. There was also a smell that reminded me of electronics class at school, it was of a sulphur type of smell, like when you are using a soldering iron. I am not sure exactly the amount of time I stood there for until I turned to see a man had come out of his home, maybe about 20 seconds since first seeing it, he was standing on his doorstep looking much the same as I was, staring up at the craft in amazement, although the craft was directly over my head, I did not feel scared at the time, I was to confused as to what I was looking at to feel anything. After what must have been about 30 more seconds to a minute, it slowly and silently ascended upwards around another 100 or so foot, then moved forwards towards the north of me for about 50 yards, hovered for a few seconds, and then shot of to my right, which was the direction of RAF Odiham around 8 miles away, the craft moved so fast that it looked like it just vanished in thin air, but you could just make out that it moved off in a certain direction, the only sound it made was a slight whooshing sound, as if it had disturbed the air as it sped through the atmosphere. I looked back at the man on his doorstep, and he was looking at me in a confused manner, I then started to feel a little worried in case it came back, and continued on my journey home, I got home in a very excited state at what I had seen, my parents I think thought I had gone loopy, I calmed down somewhat and went to bed as I had school the following day, that night I started to feel very unnerved, as I was starting to think could it ever come back?. The following day I got up tired, because of lack of sleep, and went to catch my school bus, which was only a few yards from where I saw the craft, while waiting I went and knocked on the mans door who had also seen it, because I was desperate to find out what he had thought it was, his wife (I think) answered the door, I asked if her husband was in and she asked why, and I said because I wanted to know what he thought about that strange thing last night, and she became agitated and told me not to speak such silly nonsense, then as she was closing the door I saw the man with shaving foam all over his face, but the women closed the door, so I never got to find out what he thought about the experience. I often wonder if anyone else had seen it from there window, maybe not though, as it was very silent (If anyone did please Email me, I would love to hear from you, it happened by the Hook bypass greenhaze@hamptonroads.com). I am not sure what it was, maybe a secret military craft, or maybe an alien craft, but I really don&rsquo;t believe that with our modern technology, that we could build something so perfect as what I saw that night. I did not imagine it either, as the man definitely saw it too, and the day after the women at the house acted as if her husband (or boy friend) had told her about it based on her reaction.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was an airplane enthusiast and modeler at the time, but UFO&apos;s were not in my vocabulary.  I had never heard the term before.One spring evening, probably late May or early June (appx. 1962-63), I went to bed at 9:00 pm which was my normal routine.  My bed was placed next to my window (which faces west) and, as usual, I would stare out into the night sky prior to falling asleep.  This time, just as I was drifting off to sleep, I saw an unusual object floating in the sky, seemingly just outside my window.  Coming fully awake, I was startled to see a large, circular red light, appx. the size and color of a traffic light as seen from about 100 ft. away, hovering at a height appx. 50-60 ft. above the ground.  On either side of the large light were two smaller red lights, about one-fourth the size of the central light, and angling upwards at about 45 degrees so that the entire object appeared V-shaped.I continued to watch the object for appx. 15 secs. at which point the following occurred; the large, central light dimmed to about half its former luminosity and the four smaller lights winked out completely leaving only the large light visible.  Appx. 2-3 secs. later, the four smaller lights reappeared only this time in a straight line, two above and two below the central light.  The smaller lights were also dimmed this time to match the brightness of the central light.  I continued to watch this arrangement for appx. 15 more secs. before the lights winked out completely.I remember that my window was open that night and at no time did I ever hear any noise from the craft nor did it change position while in view.  I also remember there being a stiff breeze that evening as evidenced by the rustling of the tall grass in the field directly behind my back yard which would seem to rule out a balloon of some kind.  I also believe that all of the lights correlated to just one object and not that all of the lights were individual objects.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I could see an outline of a black triangle shape. There was alot of moon light out. It started to turn and as it turned there where 4 bright lights on the back. It was still moving slowly. I slowed to about 5 mph and watched it moving and then turned around to go the same direction it was moving.

Looking to the left of the moon were two blue spots of light.  Off and on about once a minute they would strobe white light.  They stayed in place and never moved and never made a sound.  While watching these two things my neighbor (Still on the phone) said look in the direction of Denton.  I saw what looked to be a bright yellow dot of light. (maybe ten miles out)  As we watched (Wife and myself in person, neighbor on phone) the light seemed to get closed and it looked almost flat.  As we watched the light started to sway back and forth.  It would then move maybe about half a mile out away from where it was sitting and then shoot back to where it first started.  It did this over and over again for about 20 minutes.  From there it then seemed to circle in one spot over and over again, it did this about ten times then sat still.  From there is would shoot out like before and curve out back to where it started.  (The other times it shot out before it would go in one line and shoot back in one line in what seemed like no stop)  It then quit this after two runs and stayed in the same spot it first started.  We then saw what appeared to be a 747 or other large aircraft some close to it headed to either DFW or Alliance and the thing went up and away from the object.  When the aircraft left the area the thing went back to the same spot.  The thing just stayed still with the odd movement off and on until about half an hour later when a small jet went into the area and the light just vanished.  I have two other people that saw this other than me and we are willing to talk about it.  I never have seen anything quite like this before.  These things never made any sound.  Where I live sound will travel for miles upon miles.  The area is also blessed to not be under the glow of city lights.  I have worked around aircraft as well and I know the way this thing was moving, was not like any natural manned craft.  The moves would be too much for a pilot.", "Missing 3 hours of time after seeing lights behind car.My boyfriend and I had been driving around the back dirt roads in Kitsap and Mason Counties. The area can be found on a map in what would be north west of Belfair on the north shore penninsula and about an equal distance south west of the Bangor/Silverdale area of Kitsap County in an area known as Tahuya. My boyfriend pulled over and parked the car next to the road.  I don&apos;t remember what day or month it was as it happened so long ago but I do know that it was summer because it was in the middle of the night and it was warm enough to have the windows down without wearing a jacket.  In Washington I would say it was late July or August.  I don&apos;t know how long we sat there but I do remember asking my boyfriend what time it was. He told me and then I began to light a cigarette. The next thing I remember was what appeared to be car headlights coming from an odd angle behind us, but I didn&apos;t hear any engine noise.  I remember we both noticed the lights as my boyfriend was looking at his driver&apos;s side mirror at them. I wondered who else would be out here in the middle of nowhere at this hour. The lights came up behind us so smoothly almost as if they were floating. Then the next thing I remember (which seemed to be only seconds passing)is no lights and I was looking at my boyfriend and I asked him again what time it was as if I were reliving the minute before. He told me and it was 3 hours later.  We just looked at each other wondering how that could be.  I think I said something to the effect of &quot;I have been trying to light this cigarette for 3 hours?  Didn&apos;t I just ask you what time it was?&quot;  All I can tell you is that this moment in my life has never gone away.  The bottom line is that lights came up behind our car on a dirt road making no noise at all and with their dissapearence I lost 3 hours of time.  We were in our early twenties at the time and I never told anyone because I didn&apos;t think anyone would believe me.  Now even after all these years I believe something happened to us that night that was not normal or of this earth. When I did sleep next I had a vivid dream of being examined by aliens.  I don&apos;t know if this dream was my minds way of trying to account for the missing time or if this is what happened to me during the three missing hours.  I guess I&apos;ll never know. I still remember the dream though as if it I had it yesterday.  In case it could be related to my missing time I will explain it as best as I can, but like I said I don&apos;t know if it is related to the 3 missing hours and the strange lights behind the car.  I was laying on a metal table but I wasn&apos;t cold or hard. There were several, 3 for sure, (beings? not human) around the table. One to the left of my head one behind me and one to my right side. I had the feeling they were males although I couldn&apos;t tell what sex they were. They had greyish colored skin and bigger heads then we have with no hair. I remember the heads as being larger especially in the back area more so then ours.  They were talking to me without a mouth I heard them in my head.  They were telling me that I was fine and they seemed happy or I was getting a happy feeling from more then one of them.  It was like being in a room with a group a happy chatty people. I felt that my boyfriend was close but not in the same room as me.  I also received the feeling that he was fine just as I was. The one to the left of my head asked me if I would have a baby for them. I said I would but that I couldn&apos;t have babies and I asked them if they could fix me so that I could and could have one for me too.  I felt a sense of confusion from them and that&apos;s all I remember of my dream. The one I really looked at was the one to my left.  I don&apos;t remember them wearing clothes and they were what I would call scrawny except for their heads.  I also don&apos;t remember them having ears. The mouth area was like a slash and they didn&apos;t have lips like we do and I don&apos;t remember seeing inside the slash of the mouth so I don&apos;t know how deep it was. The mouth was smaller then our opening for a mouth, about half as small. I couldn&apos;t tell where the light in the room was coming from but the room had a bluish cast to it.  My comment about not being able to have babies was most likely due to my earlier misscarriage that left scaring and I was told that I would probably not be able to get pregnant again.  However 5 years later I did.  So, was this dream related to my missing 3 hours?  I don&apos;t know but unlike most dreams I still remember this one as if it happened yesterday and I still relate it to my missing time. I am not a crazy person. I would be very embarrassed if anyone I know found out that I thought I may have been abducted by aliens.  I have always thought of myself as a sceptic, but I can&apos;t or never have been able to explain the lights behind our car and the missing 3 hours, nor why this dream doesn&apos;t fade from my memory.  I would like to know if anyone else in my area saw anything similiar or unusual during the summer of 1987 in the late evening or early morning (before sunrise) during a very warm night in the Tahuya/Dawatto area of the Kitsap penninsula.

Two other people were in the parking lot, but didn&apos;t acknowledge that anything unusual was in the sky.

I was just taking a walk during my lunch hour, it was past 12:30 and I just happened to look up, and there it was. I t was so high up in the sky, and I could barely discern the shape. With the naked eye, it seemed like the head of a pin was floating in space,it seemd to be either circular or comma shaped, I knew it was really high because two planes just happened to fly almost right next to it, but right away I realized that it was even higher than the planes. from where I was standing,I could see that it was hovering near the northern area of Santa Ana, Ca. near the Mainplace mall. And It was about 5 to 7 degrees north of where the sun was.   This object moved very slowly, probably about 5 mph, in a shoutherly direction. The object was very Bright, but it seemed to shimmer between white and a coppery hue. I finally got back to my Bldg. In downtown Santa Ana. And I stood at our parking lot for another 15 min. until 1 o&apos;clock. So my sighting lasted about half an hour, and during that time it did not move anymore than maybe a couple of miles or so.

I came back out around 3 pm but it was gone at that time.The Crazy thing is that the next day (Friday January 6th) I was off and my wife and I happened to drive to North Santa Ana, to the Mainplace Mall.  And as we parked in the rear parking lot on the top of the structure, I was curious and decided to look up, and THERE IT WAS AGAIN!! This happened at Noon too.

I could see NOTHING AT ALL. The dispatcher wanted to see and he was calling me so I relived him and he went and saw the object. While I was on the desk I called the tower (Aircraft Controller) he told me that he could not see the object with his eyes but that it was on the GCA radar. I also called the radio station and the ask all the people to go out and look and see fi they could see it. There was one other fireman who was unable to see the object. That night after the sighting the firehouse was a buzz with talk and speculation but when the next day came none of these witnesses could remember it, only me and the other man who did not see the Object could remember the incident.

Unfortunately I did not write the event down on my calendar, but in early September of 2005, my husband and I were sitting on our deck, about 7 pm in the evening, watching birds in our backyard. I looked up and saw a small airplane flying quickly, but fairly low across the sky, from right to left (south-east to south-west), with it&apos;s lights flickering. The sun was behind us and shone directly on the plane. Immediately above the plane (a few miles higher up in the sky) was a very large, capsule-shaped object moving very, very slowly...if at all. The sun was reflecting directly off of it making it shine a very bright gold metallic color. I pointed the capsule out to my husband... who does not believe there are UFO&apos;s...and will only admit to seeing a &apos;light&apos; in the sky.  He did not pay much attention to it, but I did. The sky was clear which made the next part strange to me.  The capsule appeared to move slowly  behind a cloud or a cloud slowly covered the capsule and eventually the capsule disappeared.  The cloud&apos;s shape was not defined in any way, except the edge that slowly enveloped the capsule. Because the &apos;cloud&apos; had no definition or color the capsule could have been going into a slit in the sky.

Also, I saw no flashing marker lights. I stopped and stared at the light waiting for it to go over my head. After about 1 minute of watching, an incoming 737 flew by from the west. Jokingly in my head I thought, &quot;they&apos;re going to hit each other&quot;. Then, right as the jet passed just in front of the light, the light quickly backed up!

These small lights were about a 10th the size of the light and look like it would if someone dropped road flares from a hot air balloon. The light then disappeared above the clouds. The duration was just over 4 minutes. At that altitude it would be about &frac12; mile the light backup up, and in only  1 or 2 seconds!

The last time we saw it light up there were the set of three lights, but there were additional lights this time, about two more and they were a bit  ahead of the three we were use to seeing. To us it seemed as if there was more then one. If asked I can not exactly say, they were in to many different positions they all stayed about 100 feet off the ground. We came to a dead end and could not follow them anymore so we turned around and went back home. The whole chase lasted about an hour and we ended up about 10 miles from our apartment complex. Tonight we decided we would check to see if we could see these lights again. I had seen on websites that others had also seen these lights in/around the same area. So we went near the area we first saw the lights and parked by a field. This was around again 9:15pm, we waited for about 25 minutes and saw nothing but just when we were getting ready to leave, My Husband, Step-Son, and I, saw these lights come on just south of our location. There were 12 to 13 lights on and the same orange color as before. Behind these lights we saw what looked like sparks shooting from behind it. We watched as it looked to be coming in from an angle and it started to turn more lights on. I&rsquo;m not sure how far it was from the ground but it seemed pretty close. I tried getting a photo of it but it disappeared completely from there and never reappeared.", "I was driving home from downtown San Antonio and witnessed a series of  crafts with strange lights on Highway 281 for an hour or so.On March 10, 2006 I was driving on Highway 281 at 12:30 A.M. past the Alamo Dome in downtown San Antonio when a large bright white light caught my eye ahead in the sky about 1-2 football fields high(the craft stayed about that far away the whole sighting). At first I thought it was a tower light or something like that but when I got closer to this object it eventually got right above my car in the middle of the highway. I then saw the bottom of the object. It was triangular in shape with red and blue lights on the three corners blinking. I watched it until I had passed it. Astonished and terrified, I decided to take the next turnaround and go back and see if what I saw was real or not. When I got back to the place of the first sighting, I  no longer saw the craft in the middle of the road but instead I saw the object near the lookout tower on the opposite side of the highway to the right of the tower. I then decided to take the next turnaround and find a spot to park on the side of the road to get a better look. But when I got near the tower again on the highway there was a 2nd craft that was smaller and had red and orange lights as opposed to the red and blue lights of the larger craft. I should also note that every time I saw these things during the hour of my sighting the crafts top bright light kept turning on and off randomly. When I saw this second craft I got scared because it proceeded to come straight towards me. This smaller    red and orange craft eventually went right over me like the larger one did before. This craft looked like the first one did, triangular in shape only with red and orange lights on the bottom at the three corners. It also had a top bright light as well. It passed me and went to the right of me on the highway and then immediately changed directions and joined the larger craft on the left side of me on the highway quite fast. At this point I was not about to pull over and stop as these things were just too close for comfort. I was shaking, I honestly don&rsquo;t know hwy I was so scared. Instead I just kept taking turnarounds and went in circles about 3 times until they disappeared. I saw them going back and forth across Highway 281 every time I turned around. It is almost as if they were following me, playing some kind of game. It&rsquo;s kind of  egocentric of me to think that these things were there only for me but at the time is how I felt which is probably why I did not want to stop on the side of the road for a constant look at these things. When they were no longer to be seen I headed back to my original destination point, home. About 5-10 minutes later I was near the University of Incarnate Word still on Highway 281 when I saw the small red and orange craft yet again on my left side no less than a football field high. I could not believe that it was near me again. It proceeded to cross my path giving me another view of its bottom and headed to my right until I passed it up. So I took the next turnaround yet again and when I got back it was gone. I then went ahead and drove a few more minutes before taking the next turnaround to finally go home. But when I got back the larger blue and red craft had returned and was approaching my left side until it got right overhead of me again. This time however I saw a bright beam of light that looked like those airplane beams you see near an airport or major highway shoot out of the bottom of the craft and proceeded to point it EVRYWHERE. When I say everywhere I mean it pointed it at cars, buildings and houses nearby. The odd thing was it never once pointed it at me. At least I think, though now that I think about it when I saw the craft overhead the light was so bright I had to shield my eyes for a second so it might have shined it on me at once. It very much looked to me like it was searching for something. After it got done with the beam it went on its way to the right of me and I lost site of it when I got too far from it. I should note that when it did this i got a pretty good look at the side of the craft. It looked disk shaped. I was scared enough that i went home. Before I got home however I saw the small red and orange craft flying over 281 and towards my neighborhood near Brook Hollow Blvd until I lost sight of it beyond the trees on the horizon. It was around 1:40 A.M. when I got home.", "I witnessed triangle craft being chased by military planes near NAS Pt.Mugu Dec.2004Was driving on PCH west of Malibu. Ca. south of the Point Mugu Naval Air Station.There is an strech of rode where campers can park by the ocean just south of Mugu Rock. It was a nice day so I had the window down. Suddenly to my left just off the beach bout 100 yards a dark triangle shape craft flew by quickly! Looking Past the craft I could see two military fighters about a mile out keepig pace with craft.It was nothing I had seen in 20 years in the military! Ahead of me the coast took a jag to the west toward Mugu Rock this craft followed the coast line and as it did it turned it side exposing it top side. I could see no tail fin and no cock pit.This craft made no sound and I was very close! It scared the heck out of me because I thought it would crash but it did not. It came to Mugu Rock and very easily negotiated around it keeping the same distance away.Scared and curious at the same time I accerlated and got past the rock as fast as I could.Once past the road was straight for a distance of a mile and so and I could see the air station clearly. no planes were seen in the air. I hurried down the road to where the road turned east and I could see down the road and too the city of Camarillo. no planes in sight.I kept searching the skies but saw no planes.It was a very unusal event. The only reason I am reporting it now is because some one else reported a similar incident in the same area 2 years prior(June 2002).I know what I witnessed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I don&apos;t know the exact date, but it was an evening when we were all studying for midterms.  A student in a room that faced the Arboretum (actually looked over it - the tops of the trees were level with our windows) called us to her window to see a huge disc hovering over the tops of the trees.  It was metallic looking, gold, and it had a red/orange light in the center and two blue/white lights on the sides.  I assumed there was a fourth light on the side we couldn&apos;t see.  It was perhaps 75 feet across and within a hundred yards of us.  As we watched, it moved forward, then backward and eventually sideways and away from us maybe a mile or so.  It then landed in a grassy clearing.As I remember it, we called the Civil Defense, the police, and the boys&apos; dorm.  A man from the Civil Defense came up with us to watch it.  We saw the boys run out of the dorm and down toward the object.  We also saw a police car drive toward the object.  As the boys and the car approached, the lights on the object went out.  It was not seen again.The next day, Dr. Hynek from Project Bluebook came out as did the TV and radio stations.  Oddly, I don&apos;t recall that the officials spoke to the actual observers.The sighting was labelled as marsh gas - an absurd conclusion as it there was no marsh and what we saw looked metallic and solid.Many years later I read a Reader&apos;s Digest while waiting for a plane, and saw this story reported, so there may be more information there.  I think the R.D. story was in the 80s, but it could have been the 90s.((NUFORC Note:  The sightings by many students at Hillsdale College constitute a celebrated case.  This sighting is well described on pages 354-357 in &quot;The Encyclopedia of UFO&apos;s,&quot; written by Ronald D. Story, and published by Dolphin Books in 1980.  The section devoted to the Michigan sightings in March 1966 describe four sightings, on March 14, 17, 20, and 21, the last of which occurred near Hillsdale College, and which was witnessed, reportedly, by 87 students, as well as by Dean William Van Horn, who was the Director of Civil Defense for that college.  The object observed hovered over a nearby swamp for an estimated two hours.  We have changed the date above to March 21, in order to reflect what we know about this case.

I could tell they were above the clouds because their outlines were blurred slightly from the cloudy sky but the circles were still very bright and visible.  The circular white lights were about the size of dinner plates and were flying around independently and then all joined into one light and then split off into four again.  They did this twice in my presence.  I didn&apos;t stay outside any longer once my dog was finished because frankly I was a little spooked by the occurance and just wanted to get inside. My dog was not phased in the least. There were no visible beams as if the lights were spotlights, absolutely no noise, and the lights seemed to me to be more solid than any spotlight would be as well as very free and unbound by any movement limitations that a spotlight would have as a spotlight originates from a source on the ground.  These balls of light were very free moving.  I am a college educated, professional person who is not claiming to know what these lights are but I do know what I saw, and I know they were very strange and seemingly intelligent.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I had moved there in the fall of 1996 to open a new Retail Electronics Store.  My grandmother at the time was in poor health and she wanted to see my new store. Not being up to travel 3 1/2 hours to see it, I decided to take some photos of it before I left that morning.  I had a polaroid instant camera.  About 20-30 min into my travel on Interstate 80(west)  I looked to my left and hovering in a deep field was this object.  It was shaped like an upsidedown teardrop or Balloon. It was a very dark gray to almost black in color.  I slowed down very quickly as it just hung there.  It was probably 150-200 feet above the ground and seemed to be about 1&amp;1/2 the normal size of a hot air balloon.  That&apos;s what I thought I was looking at, except there was no basket at the base tip of this thing.  It didnt appear to have any demension.  It appeared almost flat?? I tried to take a few pictures(still driving) but as I had to wait for them to develop, there was nothing in them.  I really never heard of this kind of UFO before, I wrote it off as a weather balloon or something.  Now I read others have seen this same black shape.

Saw a very bright light moving overhead at a good clip; about as fast as a low-flying aircraft appears to move. Thought initially that the light was the landing spotlight of an aircraft but there was (a) no noise whatsoever and (b) the light was unaccompanied by the blinking red and green id lights common to aircraft. Also the light remained steady for the duration of the sighting.The light was approximately magnitude -5 or possibly -6; it was distinctly brighter than venus, and a yellowish-white in color.The light displayed a peculiar sort of sliding motion in additon to its forward vector as it crossed the sky from west to east in about 2 minutes. (we have a big sky in New Mexico). By sliding I mean that it appeared to move slightly north as it travelled eastward, but to do so in a way that made it seem it was an ancilliary to its primary motion eastward. It&apos;s hard to describe, but it was like when the wind is perpendicular to the road and it makes your car veer slightly as you&apos;re driving. But I the skidding motion of this light was constant and did not seem to vary with the gusting wind that evening.I have seen the ISS and this did not resemble it at all, being far brighter and apparently closer, and moving faster, as my wife who also saw the tail end of the sighting confirmed. Nor did it look like a balloon reflecting the setting sun, as the light was constant throughout the minutes it took to cross the sky, fading out only after it had gone far to the east almost to the horizon, and this was 10 or 15 minutes after sunset. It was also moving far faster than I&apos;ve ever seen a balloon move, even in high wind. (And the International Balloon Fiesta is about 60 miles north in Albuquerque every year, so I&apos;ve seen my share of balloons.)", "Amazing sighting in Whittier.

They had said that they didn&apos;t know of any military planes flying over Middleboro last night. Details: I was on my computer until I heard some loud noises outside. When I looked out of my window, I seen the triangular shape aircraft fly over my house. When I couldn&apos;t see the lights from that, another aircraft of the same kind went by my house. It kept on going until a few more came by at the same time, there was two or three this time and lined up, then kept on driving and broke the line then disappeared from my eye sight.

The hovercrafts looked like a triangle, with steadt lights at the bottom. I will draw it out on the e-mail I send you. I have seen air-planes at night before, but I know this wasn&apos;t an air plane because this looked a lot different then an airplane.

I was driving south on Hwy-69 from Ankeny to Des Moines [Iowa].  I&apos;d arrived at [approximately] the crossroad of NE 66th Ave. Myself and my passenger were listening to an &apos;oldies&apos; radio station on the AM dial, when suddenly in front of us the entire sky lit up white/pink/orange.  The radio went dead - static only.  Upon searching, nothing could be found on either the AM nor the FM dial.  The weird lights on the horizon dissipated.  Considering the times back then, I think it&apos;s understandable we immediately thought Des Moines had been nuclear bombed.  My passenger and me began sobbing, she hugging me across the console.  Still I continued to drive, but at a marked slower mph.  We approached the area of NE 51st Ave, where on the west side of the road was situated a K-Mart and an Earl May garden center.  Directly behind Earl May was I-80. This is hard to describe, because it was so amazing ... it&apos;s difficult to get my brain around it, let alone find words to do the visual any justice. I drove slowly as we saw *something* behind Earl May.  It was approximately fourty feet high [a guess, judged by the height of the one-story garden center].  It had ... what I can only describe as &apos;sparks&apos; emitting from it&apos;s &apos;roof.&apos; It was, as I remember, rectangular, and silver in color.  But the silver was ... shifty.  Pearlescent kinda.  The &apos;sparks&apos; were of varying colors ... white, pink, orange, yellow ... but said colors were *vivid* and, no joke, hurt my eyes.  At the time my mind thought the &apos;sparks&apos; were emissions from this ... thing. In that immediate area, just north of the I-80 interchange, and just south, there are stoplights.  Also entrances and exits to and from I-80 [in a clover leaf shape]. At both stoplights cars were stopped.  On the entrance to I-80 westbound too was a car, sitting there, the driver&apos;s door was open. Surreal. Again, what we saw behind the Earl May was enough of a mind-jumbler.  Then realizing cars were stopped ... at green lights and on major entrances to Interstate roads ... I was driving *very* slow at this point, as I passed cars ... seemingly empty of drivers and passengers.  But I did make note of semi-trucks passing over the I-80 bridge, as they were apparently the only other vehicles in motion, beyond my own. I drove to my passenger/friend&apos;s house, and we woke her father, as we were quite alarmed.  We phoned the radio station to which we&apos;d been listening.  They reported no &apos;outage&apos; that they knew.  Nor did they have any breaking news concerning any sort of ... well, anything that could or would relate to what myself and my friend witnessed. Jump to 1992.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sic.  How can the story &quot;jump&quot; backwards in time?  PD))  I&apos;d bought a new Macintosh.  Once I got it set up and connected to the internet, I posted my story to a message group.  Two persons responded, asking what type auto was I driving.  Perplexed (and thinking maybe they were messing with me) I responded I was driving a Chevrolet Celebrity.  One responded immediately asking &quot;... was it diesel?!&quot;  Yes was my response.  Same person responded, again within moments, that the reason semi-trucks were traveling over I-80 was because they were, too, diesel engines ... and went on to say that might have been the reason my vehicle was still operating.  I don&apos;t understand *why* that might be ... but I know it created quite a stir within the group to which I posted.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

AT 8:40 pm.Approximately 24 hours before the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; sighting(s)in Arizona, my next door neighbor and I were standing on the sidewalk in front of my home located in Northwest Las Vegas, Nevada on March 12,1997 at about 8:40 pm (20:40),when I glanced up(looking WNW) at the Spring Mountain area and saw a huge formation of off white or yellowish lights in a relaxed V or chevron shape gliding (ENE)directly towards and ultimately over our position!  I asked my neighbor if she was seeing what I was seeing and she confirmed same.  This formation of &quot;lights&quot; was very low (estimate slightly higher than local air traffic), and VERY wide (estimate 1.5 miles wide as I scanned the object) Our major intersections are approximately 1 mile apart, and I am located between Cheyenne and Craig Road off of Alexander, so the apparent width was fairly easy to guesstimate. This formation of a dozen or more lights didn&apos;t appear to have substance in between the lights, because as it slowly and silently moved directly over us we could see the night sky (stars) in between the lights of the formation. The sighting lasted probably 4 minutes.  I wanted to run in the house to grab my camera, but we were both kind of frozen on the spot watching this event. The formation of lights glided silently overhead towards the location of Nellis Air Force Base approximatey 16 miles ENE of our position.  As soon as the object? was out of sight my neighbor, (65 year old female) and I parted. I ran in the house and told my husband. I called Nellis Air Force Base to report what I&apos;d seen, and the Airman on the other end didn&apos;t seem very interested and said he was &quot;in the basement, and probably couldn&apos;t see much anyway&quot;!  He suggested I contact your UFO Reporting Center.I also called KLAS TV Channel 8, and they were pretty vague, with no other calls at that time.  24 hours later the Phoenix lights stole the show in my neighboring state of Arizona!  I heard the hoopla on the Art Bell show March 13th as well.  I have tuned into his show since 1984 when he first started on the AM station in Las Vegas.  I did call Mr.Davenport about this sighting, and he asked me to write a letter documenting what my neighbor and I had seen.  I did so, but did not see it in the archives, when I was recently reading through them.  Please know I am not confusing the dates.

It was behind the cloud briefly but was always visible through the cloud except for a second or two when a dense spot in the cloud obscured it completely. Another identical point of light appeared from behind the cloud trailing the first point of light at about a 2&quot; distance at arms length.  There was no relative motion of the two points.  I noticed a third point of light trailing the second by 2&quot; at arms length, but this point of light was definitely below the cloud and a light greenish blue in color, similar to an airport beacon.  The three points of light slowed and drew closer together, forming an equalateral triangle.  They stopped completely, but at that point the cloud blew between myself and the objects and I could no longer see them.  The motion of the objects was opposite the motion of the cloud, and the clouds were at the 5000 foot level.  Assuming the objects were at cloud level, the triangle formation would have occurred approximately between Thurston Middle School and the large S curve in highway 133.

Initially,  I thought it was a remote control device but quickly realized it was way too large, then considered whether it was a military test vehicle of some sort and finally, that it may be a UFO.

I do not believe in anything in which I do not have conclusive proof, which is almost exclusivly for me, my own eye witness memories. I am now 31 years old (as of 2006). It was the year of 1989 and I was 15. I saw somthing in broad daylight which was so obvious and easy to see, that many cars on the Mountain Parkway Toll road on the northern edge of the smoky mountains, had parked on the side of the highway to sit apon the hoods of their cars and watch! My mother was driving, and my little sister was the first to spot the spectacle. It was near 6:00pm and the sun was low and orange in the sky. It was that kind of sun that you can look right at even though it is still fully in the sky.When I looked I was only curious at first to figure out what this thing was. It appeared as the shape of an almond with the soft &quot;points&quot; being vertical and the color was almost the same as the sun which was in a completely different place in the sky. I put forth a guess that the sun did give this object it&apos;s color. Like a reflection of sorts. What I witnessed next along with dozens of parked bystanders and my sister and mother was incredible. Almost instantly there where three small shiny objects appearing identical to normal stars moving around very near the large oval shaped object. Next, one at a time, the small objects moved to the top &quot;tip&quot; of the oval and disappeared, as if they had landed on it  and turned off or went inside it!! At this exact time we were going around the circular exit ramp to Interstate Highway 64. Once we were on the new highway going straight I regained a good viewing position only to see that the object had turned on it&apos;s side so that it looked more like a giant human eye. It then started to slowly move, I think. For as we went straight, it seemed to move from right to left across our path. The way it was moving and the way it appeared as we changed roads  led me instinctively to presume that it was not a far distant object like the moon. It only move slowly for 10 seconds or so before it disappeared or moved away so fast that I did not see it happen.

The more I think of it the more it seems it was not a dream.  It was the most frighting thing in my life. I was about 4/5 years old when the first occurrance happened.  Two/three  creatures appeared in my bedroom at night.  They just came thru the wall and where there.  I was scared to the point of hysteria.

Yhis really happened.", "1965 Dark Grey Cylinder UFO Updated StatementI just wanted to offer an updated version, the original being:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25728.html  &quot;Every now and then, my mother and I would take our dog on his night walk to the Parade Ground, a flat park of baseball and football fields.We went there because at the time it was being renovated, and the fields were being partitioned and fenced. This gave us some confidence to allow the dog off the leash to run free for a change. The Parade Ground is just across Parkside Avenue from Prospect Park.It is August, 1965. I am ten years old. The dog was having a good run, and once we saw that he wasn&apos;t about to run off completely, we relaxed and gazed upwards to view the night sky, trying to find various constellations. In those days, the street lights in Brooklyn emitted a white light, and not the beige-looking type now in use. If you went to a park, you could get a decent view of the stars, but of course not anywhere near the view if you were upstate in deep woods. Suddenly, as I looked to the left of me, I saw what I first mentally equated as a submarine perhaps two storeys off the ground higher than the six storey buildings beneath it. &quot;Hey Mom, do you see what I see?&quot; She did. Here comes this thing, slow and steady and silent. It is huge.It is dark grey - not &quot;battleship grey,&quot; but as grey as can be before you rule it black. There is no shine to it. The front of it was round; I&apos;d seen pictures of submarines, and that is what came to mind. It is actually shaped more like a very long medicine capsule. As it  proceeded to float past us, we observed its right side.It is solid. It is a perfect and very long dark grey cylinder, and it just keeps coming very slowly and steadily. Obviously, we can&apos;t see the top of it, but so far, we see that even though it is almost black, we sense a light behind the darkness. This does not make sense, as my mother and I later reckoned. The best I can come up with is that my eyes saw dark grey, but my mind knew the cylinder was emitting light.Dark light!  This was no blimp. No lights. No sound. No windows.No gondola beneath. No visible markings. No nothing! It is just a cylinder 300 feet longer than the Intrepid aircraft carrier now docked in the Hudson River going by!  This thing was so huge, that even from the height above me, (200 Feet?) it was clearly visible; visible enough to see even the slightest imperfection clearly, if it had any. At the same time, we are not in any panic. We are unusually serene. As if it&apos;s no big deal somehow. Maybe we were in a stupor beyond awe. Finally, the end of the ship passes. I ran to see the back of it. I see it is as round as the front with an opening in the center. To this day, I&apos;m not sure if it was square or arch-like.I am convinced that at least the bottom of the opening in the back of it was flat, so it was square or arched. I remember thinking that 3 buses could easily drive inside at the same time.On the other hand, I&apos;ve seen jets low to the ground on approach to JFK Airport, and thought that &quot;my&quot; cylinder was at least 3 times wider at the same height. This is the only time I experience apprehension. I worry for a moment that whoever is flying this cylinder might see me. I ran to a to where I could see the other side of the cylinder.It is exactly as perfect and unremarkable as the other side and the bottom. I have been struggling with my memories for years as to whether there was a single tiny light, blue or red atop the opening in the back. I add this item, but I am not sure. Inside the opening it is absolutely pitch black. The cylinder was in the order of 1200 feet long. I did not know this at the time. When I saw the cylinder completely, it was &quot;crossing&quot; Stratford Road, and the back of it was at Buckinham Road. The distance between these streets on Caton Avenue according to street maps is about 1200 feet. I rejoined my mother in the original field, and we watched this thing float over the Prospect Park POLICE STATION, heading west until it faded from sight about half a mile west of the Parade Ground. No newspaper, radio, or TV station mentioned it. For that matter, we didn&apos;t even tell my father!  As I first accessed the Internet, I ran a search for &quot;cylinder ufo,&quot; and plenty of links came up. Even pictures! I wasn&apos;t too surprised, because I know damn well what I saw was real, and other people MUST have seen something as well. I told some close friends. They gave me the jaundiced eye.I could hardly blame them. I guess its just one of those things one must see to believe.&quot;  Notes:  The Cylinder crossed over Parade Place, and was equidistant between Woodruff and Crooke Avenues. The Cylinder was about 1/4 the width of the Parade Ground, and travelling in a straight line over the road that runs nearly the length of the park. Why these single lane streets are designated Avenues is a mystery to me, especially Crooke Avenue, which runs only two blocks. Modern street maps have re-named Buckingham Road as East 16th street. The equivalent for Stratford Road would be East 11th Street, so by my point of view the cylinder was at least five blocks in length. I need to remark that some internet-based street maps would put the length of the cylinder at 1500-1700 feet. I really should go back there and take measurements myself.", "I saw a white dome shaped object with a haze around it and a stripe on it that blended in with the backroundAround noon at a hillside campsite in Allagheny state park. We were about to leave when me and my friend looked up to see a white dome shaped craft come from behind a mountain peak. We all had a very good view at the object because there wernt any trees in our campsite. As it was flying I noticed as it flew in front of a small grey cloud, a stripe in the middle of  the object matched the color of the cloud. The object seemed to have a haze around it so it could have been the same thing as the stripe on the object. After about 40 second it flew behind another peak.

At first only three lights shined on each point of the triangle. The lights were similar to those new, almost blue, lights you see on some cars (neons?). The craft was moving too slow to be a regular plane. It couldn&apos;t have been a helicopter. A few moments later, more lights came on. I didn&apos;t count exactly but I&apos;d estimate a total of 7 lights at this point. The object speeded up a little and eventually moved out of sight. It sounded like...? Wind? Like a very quite plane, but no engine sound. Wish I had known to count and notice direction. I was in shock at the time. Wasn&apos;t really thinking about anything else except to watch it... I have to note that there IS a military base nearby, so perhaps the object I saw was some new test plane? I have no idea.

During the time I was delivering newspapers at Kirker Creek apartments when in my car I looked up at the sky facing north I saw a bright red orange fireball type object in the darken sky.  You couldn&apos;t miss it. It was travelling at a slow rate at a low elevation around and above 500 ft in the air.  I observed the object carefully to see if this was a plane or helicopter but all I could see was a bright red orange glow all around the object.  There were no beacons of light flashing on it like a plane nothing I could spot similar to a plane was on this object.  This object though had this slow strobe blinking on it.  I watched this object fly in the sky for five minutes or more. It was heading south toward a patch of clouds as it entered the clouds I could not see it any more the object did not exit the patch of clouds as I presumed it disappeared in the clouds. This was not my first sighting, as I witnessed this object 4 times in the past 2 months during the same time at around 5:30 am while delivering newspapers in the same area in Pittsburg on Railroad Ave and Buchanan in the neighborhood where Hillview Jr High is at. My first sighthing was in the middle of Janurary of this year on a Wednesday same time. I was on the street of Redondo Dr. and Railroad when I looked  up and saw a red orange light and had the same slow glowing strobe blinking, it was travelling at a slow rate heading east it was at a low elevation and the object didn&apos;t make a sound at all because this object was above and near me I could have heard plane noise from it but I didn&apos;t, so I started following it in my car untill I lost it the incoming clouds. I have never seen anything in the sky like what I was. I&apos;ve seen so many planes in the night sky that this object differed from any other plane. My second sighting happened two weeks after the first sighting, end of Janurary. This sighting happened on Saturday around 5:30 am again I was in the same area. I was on  El Dorado Dr just a few blocks away from Redondo. I was facing south west when I suddenly saw this time two bright red orange lights come from the south as the two objects where flying parallel to each other at the same rate of speed. The two objects were coming towards my direction at a fast rate of speed like above 100 mph a sec then then the two objects slowed down at the same time and they were on the same low elevation I saw before. I just watched the two objects fly north into a patch of clouds as I lost them. The third sighting happened in Feburary this time I was on Buchanan and it was wednes day around 5:30 am again. I saw the object fly south at the same rate of speed and elevation and same physical characteristics I&apos;ve been witnessing. I watched it for two minutes and then looked away from it for a couple of seconds as I kept on driving.  Then I looked back at the direction I saw the object was at and I could not find it anymore I looked all around in the sky and it was a clear morning. At the slow rate it was going I could have seen it pass by me even though I looked away from it I know this for fact because when I see a plane fly by I could still see pass. The fourth sighting happened on the last week of Feburary on Saturday the 25th two weeks after todays sighting same time around 5:30 am. I was at Kirker Creek apartments when I looked up at the sky facing north I saw the same exact object. I observed it very carefully as it was flying and hovering in the sky at a low elevation. I can see it always flew in an quick stuttering up and down motion as it was doing this the oddest thing happened nothing like I saw in my previous sightings there was this tiny but visable object coming out underneath the main object it had the same color and form and it was coming down very slowly toward the ground like in a hovering and floating movement. As it was coming down the tiny object started to fade away until you could see its color any more. It vanished away. The main object just continued fly ing south into the clouds when I lost it. Again what I&apos;ve been seeing is a bright red orange fireball type object in a circular shape flying at a low elevation in the area above Railroad ave and Buchanan Pittsburg CA at a time around 5:30 am. I mainly see this object whenever the clouds start to come in and after rainy weather when there&apos;s a mix of patchy clouds and a clear sky.", "cylinder object with five bright lights vertical and horizontalI saw a bright light which I thought was a star.

It had a rod sticking out of the top and also of the bottom of the cylinder. After watching it for awhile, it seemed to moved  from west to east and then at 6:35am it went up higho er and then went out of my sight. I am curious to know if it was a sattelite or a UFO.

If you will observe real close on the 9 o&apos;clock position of the orange cube you will notice a white object shaped like an inverted space shuttle or a cross like appearance just above the blue waters.

We are thousands of miles away from the nearest land and theres no way a target shooting will commence if theres any ship near us or worse be visible to the naked eye.

I saw 2 planes close to each other with a trail behind them....beside the 2 planes was an object with no trail.  A minite later Another airplane with yet another object flew by.  Both unknown objects were bright (sun hitting them) and oval.", "Observation of spherical white colored craft in geostationary position for 1 hour plus. The altitude at a guess at 2,000 feet high. This was seen on September 4, 1962 at 3:30 pm Central Standard Time. Location of sighting was 2.6 miles south of St. Louis Lambert airport. The sky was clear and wind was calm. My mother was hanging clothes out to dry, and called out to me to come out and see the object. I rejected her offer for some time, but she insisted that it was  something I should see. When I finally went out and saw the object we talked and she asked if it could be Venus? I told her that it could not be because of the time of day and direction was eastward.I was a member of the St. Louis Astronomical Society at this time. My mom said I should get my telescope and take a look. At the age of 15 I wasn&apos;t totally coordinated yet, and I broke the front glass out of the front screen door. Trying to get the telescope out the door. I&apos;m adding for the time frame. It took a bit of work to gather the broken glass up before a got the telescope to the back yard.Setting up the telescope. It was a Tasco refractor 60 mm objective lens, with a alt-azimuth mount. I first used the wide angle eyepiece to spot the object. I found it magnified well, but still rather small. I let my mom look through the scope and by this time we had the next door neighbors over also. So now we have our own star party. Three adults and one kid.I let everyone take there time and look. Of course they all asked if I could get it bigger. I set the 3 X barlow and the strongest eyepiece. This set the magnification of 525 power. When I looked at the object it nearly filled the entire field of view.  I can only explain that I had it focused perfect!  It looked like a cue ball.  No markings.  Perfectly smooth and rather off white, not shiny.  It did not give any glow off.  No sense of spinning motion, and no noise at all.This is important. This object has not moved one nanometer in an hour of time. Nothing in the heavens or earth can do that!  When you view the moon at full power with that telescope it&apos;s like a big train moving by. This didn&apos;t move. I expected it to move and was in total disbelief at what I was seeing. I let my mom and the neighbors husband and wife both take long looks at the object and we all agreed that it was not moving. I kept saying this can&apos;t be happening! No one is going to believe me at the next Astronomical meeting. But I got witnesses!  Better yet I&apos;ve done lunar eclipse photos, and said I will be getting my camera and special eye mount for it and I&apos;ll be back. Never had a chance to move.When we look back at the time in history, it was as one of the worst in nuclear confutations. The &quot;Cuban missile crisis&quot; was happening. I no sooner said that I was going to get the camera when I hear a very load jet aircraft take off. Living for many year near the airport we grew accustomed to the different sounds of the commercial, and air force aircraft flying and even crashing near by as a F-86 did a mile down the road. This was the sound of afterburners and full throttle. As soon as the plane came above the tree line I spotted it as a B-47. She was doing a tight circle as we literality turned our bodies around as it circled and climbed for altitude. On the second sweep around I was beginning to wonder if it had something to do with our visitor in the sky above. I was a lucky hunch, because at that very moment I scream! Look it moved! What had been stationary for an hour did a sudden straight vertical movement to twice the altitude in a split second and stopped. The B-47 was still in hot pursuit with all engines at full throttle. It kept a circular pattern as she climbed up toward the object. After about the fourth revolution around the B-47 chase was over. I saw the object go from that second position to ascend straight up out of sight.My mom insisted that I report this to the Air Force base at Lambert Field. I looked up a few numbers that sounded official and dialed them. When I mentioned I wanted to report a UFO, they responded I could get in a lot of trouble doing this. Did my parents know I was doing crank calls to the US Government? The last call I made I did get through to an Air Force official and said I wanted to report a UFO and it was being chased by a B-47. He said that&apos;s ridicules there&apos;s no B-47 aircraft in the air. I said if you don&apos;t believe me look out your window. He hung up quickly.  No report was ever made to the papers that I could ever recall.Iwould like to know if anyone in the St. Louis area saw this object also.", "green flashA GREEN LIGHT SHOOTING BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE SKY, DIRECTLY UNDER THE NORTH STAR, IT SHOT BACK AND FORTH ABOUT 3 TIMES FOR APPROXAMATLY 6 AND A HALF SECONDS.", "orange fireballs with a streak moving very fast.My family and I saw something that is hard to explain, At first we thought that an airplane had exploded in midair because it was a huge orange ball like an explosion,but then just like a second later like sraight across from it, it like did it again like a plain had exploded twice very quickly like a boom then boom but there was no noise, same orange ball it moved very very fast, then a few seconds later like straight below where we first saw it happen like really close to the ground it did it again but this time it was like huge orange fireball then a orange streak then the fireball again but we could see it all at the same time that time man I dont know but it moved very very fast then right before it disappeared it moved slower like a circle on its side rotating around going up diagnoly.", "There was a sudden appearance in the sky of a bright green light travelling extremely fast from north to southest with a bright green tail out behind it.

At first, we thought it was a large aircraft with it&apos;s landing lights on, heading westbound toward Tulsa International Airport. As we continued to observe the light, we noticed that it did not move. We were able to get out of our car and watch the light for an hour, and it never changed position in relation to us, the horizon, or any other observable object, while the stars progressed across the sky as normal. The object is obviously geosynchronus as it has been in the same position in the sky visible at the same basic time every morning for three months. The only time it is otherwise visible is on Monday nights, when it is visible all night long. It is not visible any other night of the week until approx. 04:30am. I have written NASA asking what this might be, but have received no response from them. At leasat ten other people have observed this same phenomenon, almost all are law enforcement officers as I. i believe it may simply be a satellite, but it&apos;s position does not match anything I have been able to find on sites such as NASA&apos;s downloadable satellite tracking software.

The sky was overcast since it had been raining all afternoon. I saw what appeared to be an object hovering several hundred feet up in the air in a northwesterly direction, it had what appeared to be flashing red and green lights all around it.  They were flashing in a running motion sort of like neon lights do or like a series of bulbs going on and off in a very quick pattern.  It was equipped with a powerful floodlight that is turned on occasionally when hovering and pointed the light up into the clouds.  When I first sighted it it was motionless in the sky with just the lights flashing, I ran to grab my binoculars to get a better view and when I got back it had turned on the floodlight on by the time I got the binoculars focused the light had switched off and the craft was moving at a rather fast rate going over my house.  When hovering there was no noise but as soon as it started moving I heard a noise rather like a lowflying airplane.  I ran to the window on the other side of the house and watched it&apos;s flight it paused again just before the treetops would have hidden it from my view and once again turned on the floodlight. I watched it for several minutes more until it just winked out of my sight. There were low hanging clouds in the sky so it may have just risen above them but from my perspective it just seemed to vanish into thin air. I don&apos;t know if what I saw was a UFO or just a survey helicopter, since I have never seen a helicopter at night I can&apos;t say for sure but what caught my attention were the lights flashing in a pattern in what appeared to be a circle around it, I have seen airplanes at night and to my knowledge they carry signal lights that just blink.  The other thing was the complete absence of noise until it started moving, won&apos;t a helicopter make a noise even when hovering and lastly the powerful floodlight that it only turned on when it had stopped in the air and pointed up into the clouds.

I looked straight up above me and did not see anything at first and I finally made out an object that looked like a huge boomerang.  It was black and pretty much blended into the night sky.  The only way I could make out the shape was because on two ends it had these tiny red faded lights and the tip of it had a tiny white light.  I have great eyesight and they were hard to see.  The object was higher than the incoming planes so there was no chance of it crashing into them, but not much higher.

The blue of the fireball stuck out against a solid blue sky, i was quite impressed and quite puzzeled by it.. The reason I think it was from space is for the fact that it did not make a sound and an explosion that big I was expecting the bang as I continued to walk but heard nothing..What would it take to make an explosion of blue flame, atleast the size of 4 football fields(looking up from the ground) appear from outerspace?? my first thought was a space craft blew up but when i got to my buddies i couldn&apos;t find anything on the news.This event happend before the columbia incident which i saw on TV and the BLue flame explosion was atleast 30x greater than the explosion I witnessed when columbia went down..((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We boated upriver about 10 miles till it grew dark and we found a spot to build a fire and sleep in our sleeping bags. We made a nice fire, ate a little, and sat back to relax. We were situated in a canyon about 100 feet deep, but I could see miles upriver. It was a moonless night with many stars. I noticed a movement and looked there to see a spherical object which was incredibly bright, yet cast no light (which bothered me constantly even years later) that was slowly rising vertically over the edge of the canyon maybe 1/2 mile away.  Once above the canyon edge, I saw that it was bright white, round with rows of lights that rotated around it that were white also.I said to my buddy, hey do you see that and he looked and saw it too.  Just then it started coming what we both thought as straight at us real fast.  Even now my hair stands up.  I said I&apos;m grabbing the machete and he said I got the rifle.  We were both scared and went into survival mode. Right as I said Im gonna take them out with me. It stopped.  Stood still.  It reversed the course and floated below the hill just where it rose up. We then heard what we thought were dozens of coyotes howling very close by. We were nervous and went out with torches to gather wood for almost an hour.  We made the HUGEST bonfire you could imagine and talked like nuts about how scared we were. My next memory was waking up completely zipped up in the sleeping bag and covered with about 8 to 12 inches of ash.  Neither my friend or I remember laying down or even wanting to as were so scared.

On March 11, it was in the south east, on the 14th, it was almost due south (my house faces directly solar south, and it was slightly to the west). The row of lights was about the length of a quarter of the circumference of the moon, but they were placed vertically with blue at the top and bottom and red in the middle and were about the size of very large, very bright stars. It was impossible to tell if it was a line of stars or lights or a continuous bar of color, but it looked more like 3 stars - blue, red, blue. The night was mostly clear on the 13th, but the lower part of the horizon was slightly overcast. The moon was apparently already down in the west, because my first impression was that it was probably a reflection on the moon. Then I realized that it was definitely not the moon, and the moon wasn&apos;t visible. On the 13th (at 1:30 AM), the sky was very overcast with no stars. The moon was visible behind the clouds, and the night was bright in spite of the clouds. The object was very bright and appeared to be among rather than behind the clouds. I watched it for about 10 minutes each time; the first time, I went inside because it didn&apos;t seem to be doing anything and I assumed it was simply some brightly colored stars. But on the 13th, I watched until it seemed to be covered by the clouds and disappeared. It did not move at all except for appearing at different places in the sky on the two different nights (or early mornings). It almost looked like airplane lights, but the line of lights was straight up and down and it didn&apos;t move closer or further away or change position. In addition, there was a slight sound that seemed to be almost like an airplane engine. However, I can hear the interstate from my house, and I couldn&apos;t discern whether or not it was cars on the interstate or if it was coming from the lights. I don&apos;t know what it was, but I am absolutely sure it was not a plane, a radio tower, the moon, or any star or planet configuration I&apos;ve ever seen before. One of the weird things was that I saw it more to the east at 5:30 and more to the west at 1:30. Another strange thing was that it appeared to be closer than some of the clouds, appearing below them, but was covered by lower lying clouds, although it may just be that there was simply a break in the clouds on both nights that permitted viewing.", "Craft flies very low over our heads!!This sighting occurred in December of 2005.

The rear of the object was &quot;glowing&quot; an yellow orange color and making a low humming sound. In the center of the object was looked like a large dome that hung below the object and pulsated the same yellow orange color.

Here is one more for you. I think my sighting was somewhat unusual, because I saw the craft flying southward above Interstate 17 about 60 miles north of Phoenix.  I&apos;ve heard reports from the Prescott area, and of course in Phoenix, but not many from in between. Please refer to the following map:  http://maps.google.com/?ll=34.174885,-112.136593&amp;spn=0.099698,0.100079  This shows I-17 north of Phoenix.  The map is centered on the Sunset Point rest area, which is about 1/2 mile up the road (north) after my sighting ended.I was driving home from Phoenix, and the time was approximately 8:15 pm.Don&apos;t take that time too seriously -- I didn&apos;t check the time while watching the UFO, and came up with an approximation later based on the time I got home. (I was used to making the trip and new how long it took to drive between Phoenix to the Sunset Point halfway point, and then home in Sedona.)  See where I-17 is split lower in the map area?  That is the stretch of the interstate that connects the Sonoran Desert with a mesa area at higher altitude.The road there is curvy and is on about a 7% grade, with little or no shoulder.It was getting dark, and while driving about halfway up that part of the road, I noticed an inverted V of bright lights far off in the distance.  They seemed low near the horizon, and at first I thought they were lights on a distant mountain.But that didn&apos;t make sense, because the mountain is off to the left (west), and the lights were just about 5 degrees left of straight ahead.  Also, they were white color and steady, not flashing red as with a radio tower or something like that. While I was thinking those thoughts, I realized there was no way the lights were on the ground, since they were getting higher in the sky and nearer (bigger)!  Obviously, it was something or some things flying through the air.It was getting difficult to watch the lights, because I was in traffic, navigating curves uphill on a road with almost no shoulder and a cliff to my left in case I messed up!  (BTW, I was in the left lane of traffic.) As the lights got nearer, I had to push my head forward toward the windshield and look upwards.  It was a little tricky... The lights stayed on the left of my car, apparently flying over the southbound part of the interstate.  I could clearly see there were five lights, one at the tip and two each on either side, in the V shape.  The lights were white, but not pure -- slightly yellowish, like an incandescent light bulb. As the lights were just a short distance away, I thought, &quot;That is either 5 military jets flying in formation, or a UFO.&quot; I watched to see if I could see a solid shape of a big ship, but it was too dark.  As the lights got the closest, I thought, &quot;That is either an alien UFO or some secret government project.&quot;  It didn&apos;t seem to be jets in formation.  There were only the 5 whitish lights, and no green or red lights, or flashing lights of any kind.Another thing I remember thinking at the time was that I wondered how big the craft was.  If it was flying low, it might have been the size of a commercial airliner, but if it was higher up (tens of thousands of feet), it would have been huge and moving very fast. When I first spotted the lights off in the distance, they were about the apparent size of my thumb held at arm&apos;s length.  When the lights flew by, they were about the size of my fist at arm&apos;s length. By the time the lights had passed by my car, I had driven all the way up the hill to the mesa where the Sunset Point rest stop is located.  I thought of pulling over since there was some shoulder there, but realized that by the time I got out of the car, the lights would already have flown far away, and I wouldn&apos;t see much.So I didn&apos;t stop. Two days later (Saturday) I was out socializing around town, and mentioned to some friends that I&apos;d seen something while driving home from Phoenix.  One guy looked at me and said something like, &quot;Oh, you saw it!  You saw the UFO that was reported on the Phoenix TV news!&quot; If it weren&apos;t for that, I probably would have never connected my experience with the big UFO sighting, which I otherwise would have heard about months or years later, after I&apos;d forgotten what day it was I saw them.I don&apos;t watch TV or read newspapers, and if other witnesses are anything like me, that would explain why you don&apos;t get many more reports.  It wasn&apos;t until months later I decided to do a search on the Internet and learned that people were calling the UFO the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot;. When I learned that the UFO was a mile wide, I realized that when I saw it, it must have been at a high altitude and really moving! I haven&apos;t tried to do any of the math -- the calculation would be rough at best -- but I guess it must have been going about 2000 miles per hour. (?)  If I can figure out how many apparent angular degrees my thumb is, and use a stopwatch the next time I drive home from Phoenix, maybe I can come up with a better number. I&apos;ll be happy to do my best to answer any questions you have regarding my sighting.", "A circle moved quickly in a strait line.A flash of light moved across a small section of the SW sky.

He recommended that I forward this to you and spoke highly of your efforts.  Here, then, is my e-mail to him in part.  I removed an introductory paragraph as well as my name from the body of the text. Best regards and good luck  &quot;The year was either 1972 or &apos;73 to the best of my recollection.I was in the back yard of our house on Robbins AFB one evening with my Father, an active duty major at the time, and would have been around 9 years old.  I saw some strangely colored stray clouds (which in hindsight were probably very slightly colored by the sun that was no longer above the horizon) and had asked Dad to explain what I was seeing when a bright blue circular image suddenly formed in the sky as if someone had removed the cover from a spotlight and had projected an image onto a screen in the sky.  The disk was slightly larger in appearance than the actual moon, which was on the opposite horizon.  I called for my younger brother, sister and mom and we watched this disk as it remained stationary for several minutes then slowly dissipated over a period of time as if air movement was breaking up the &quot;screen.&quot;   We were all very familiar with the local aircraft, beacon lights, etc. as Dad was a pilot and he couldn&rsquo;t explain the phenomenon.The object was stationary while it held together and did not appear to have an active source such as beam of light.  There was no sound coming from the object.  Its relative brightness was somewhat more intense that a full moon on a clear night.  It was a balmy night with widely scattered clouds. To the best of my memory it was halfway up in the south western sky from my vantage point.  My impression was that someone projected an image in the sky that left a glowing blue stain on fog or cloud particles.Our next door neighbor, another USAF officer, saw us looking skyward and came out.  He was also fascinated and at a loss to explain the phenomenon.&quot;((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When I noticed the light in the sky I brushed it off as being a plane landing. then I realized where I was and that There was no airport close by. My curiosity peaking, I began to pay more attention to this light. The object that I observed looked kind of looked like a triangle with three lights. As I observed, the lights grew really bright and then started to fade. The light faded untill it was as bright, and as large as a star in the sky. At this point it began to move in SE direction and it was picking up speed.

My wife is a nurse and I have a BA from Centre College so I believe that we are both credible.  It was a clear night sky with little or no moon which made the object stand-out even more.  The best way to describe it was triangular in shape with lights at each corner.  The reason we noticed it is that it was offset from the night sky.  It appeared to be hovering and rotating in a counter-clockwise direction.  The lights were not flashing but were steady.

The dots were north of me, and they appeared to be several miles away from me, about 70 degrees up from the horizon and falling very rapidly in a formation pattern, much faster than a plane or any object would normally descend, but I thought I was seeing a plane flying straight down and I said so to the person I was talking to on the phone, then the dots seemed to swirl around each other for an instant at about 30-40 degrees above the horizon and then immediately turned out of the descent and began moving parallel to the horizon, moving directly east for a few seconds, then they seemed to swirl around each other again and went straight down again, descending below my field of view which was blocked by a bunch of tall trees across the street. And that was it. I didn&apos;t see an object attached to the dots - just the white dots themselves.

I say this, these are not airplanes because they Hover. I could get pictures if i had some way to zoom way up. Strange huh it", "ufo sighting in louisville ky, it just vanished!my fiance and i were out on our balcony this morning after a lare dinner, and we looked up into the skies to see what had at first appeared to be an airplane on fire going down, but it was so close to our apartment. it was glowing yellow, white, blue, and red....    it floated towards the right a bit, and stopped in its tracks... it hovered for a few moments... 2 helicopters came in to check it out, but as they were circling in on it... it was glowing orange... and vanished.... but reappeared like magic in the airs to the right.... now i ask you , what aircraft just hovers in the air, and begins to glow???? and what aircraft for that matter reappears out of no where undetected?", "Bright yellow and dim blue points that maneuvered and finally climbed straight up and out of sightOn Saturday, May 26, 2001, at around 11:20 pm, at the RTMC Astronomy Expo, my friend and I were walking down the road to get to our car when I noticed a bright object come over the hills (from the south west?), moving very much like a satellite, only it was brighter than a satellite.  I ran to the car to get my binoculars naively thinking that if this was too bright to be a regular satellite, maybe it was the International Space Station.  When the object was about at zenith, it slowed to a stop.  My friend and others camping in the area exclaimed in surprise when this happened.  I trained my binoculars on the object and discovered that it was actually two objects, one glowing bright yellow that we had been following with our naked eyes, and the other much dimmer and glowing a deep, deep blue.  While the yellow object was now moving very slowly and steadily, the blue object seemed to orbit tightly, rapidly, and haphazardly around the yellow object, constantly changing directions and speed. After meandering around the sky above us for maybe 1 or 2 minutes, it began to climb.  I could not judge its altitude.  People around us thought it was anywhere from 20,000 to 100,000 feet up.  Through the binoculars, I guessed that it was about 1,000 to 10,000 feet up and climbing, but who knows?  Eventually, the blue object slipped behind the yellow object and I never saw it again.  At that moment the yellow object began to gyrate rapidly and wildly in a small area and seemed to leave a short trail.  I thought maybe my binoculars were shaking, but this was not the case since the background stars were not themselves gyrating. The object continued to climb quite rapidly until it was difficult to see even with the binoculars and then we lost it. I&apos;m guessing this whole thing lasted about 6 minutes, and the whole time we did not hear a sound from the objects. It is certainly possible that this was some kind of hoax since the RTMC might be a tempting target for hoaxers.  I also considered aircraft from a nearby airport, but its behavior and appearance were unlike any aircraft I have ever seen, and it did not make a sound.  The RTMC is held up in the mountains at a YMCA camp.  The air that night was cool and very still. I tried to see if at any point the space between these lights would block out the stars behind it, but I could not come to any conclusions mostly because it was always moving and was small even in the binoculars.  Funny that I had a nice digital video camera in the back seat of the car and didn&apos;t even think to use it!  About a year after this happened, I contacted an organizer via e-mail.  He saw it, too, but felt that the object was &quot;in the hundreds of feet up&quot;, and given the venue was probably a hoax of some kind. I&apos;m a computer programmer and my friend is a mechanical and electrical engineer. The location of the RTMC can be found here:  http://www.rtmcastronomyexpo.org/index.html", "Bright flash of light and streak of light over Alhambra, CAStanding outside my apartment about to go in when I saw a bright flash of light that seemed to come from almost directly above me, in a sort of northerly direction.  As I turned to look I saw a streak of light falling from the direction of the flash (or seemed to be falling), downwards angle, towards the east.  The streak of light was shaped almost like a teardrop, and I&apos;m pretty sure I saw it change color from a pure white to a bright orange before either disappearing or falling out of my point of view.  There was no sound, and the entire event lasted less than 5 seconds.  To be honest, I don&apos;t think it was a UFO, but I&apos;m kinda hoping it IS one, because to my uneducated eyes, it looked like a missile or a plane exploding, either one of which would be bad....", "Cylinder shaped object was over my house then started moving off.While I was coming out of my house there was this cylinder shaped object in the sky. It hovered over the front and back yards of my house. And it was a greenish color and it had white lights on it.

Family and friends shared experience.I was 12 yrs. old. We lived in some apartments in Oakcliff Texas. My brother, myself along with some other friends were out playing. I looked up at the sky, just above the tree line hovering above our apartments was a cirle like object with windows all around it. It made no noise as it spun slowly. It never lit up. I went and got my parents. My dad didnt believe me but my mom came out and saw it along with many other people. I ran and knocked on doors to ask for a camera only to have the doors shut in my face. By the time I got back it had left. Nobody remembers it taking off.But my brother and my mother still remember this event. I had the feeling they wanted water. We had a huge creek that rad behind my apartments, they were spinning just feet from the creek.", "2 large cylinder shaped objects seen in clear daylightAt 4:00 pm Feb 7th, my husband and i were putting up a television antenna. I was holding the ladder as he was on the roof. The skies were perfectly clear and you could easily see the moon to the east. I looked up and saw a large silver cylinder shaped object coming from the North-east. It looked like it was larger in the back with front being more narrow. It made no noise and glided rightover our heads. I am not sure of the altitude. I yelled to my husband to look up but he was in a precarious position and failed to see the object. I watched it as it headed south and it just vanished out of sight. Then another object just like it came from the same direction and I told my husband to hurry, hurry and look up. He saw this object as it passed over but this one headed in a easterly direction and it too just disappeared from view.

We were in the dept&apos;s six passenger pick-up truck, I was riding in the front passenger seat, another member was driving, and the third member was in the right rear passenger seat. The fire station fronts onto Third St.(Norhtwest), and as we left, we turned right onto Third St.(Northeast), and proceeded approximately 100 feet to the corner of Third St. and Railroad Av. At the corner, we turned right onto Railroad Av. (Southeast). As we got on Railroad Av., I noticed two aircraft with lights, travelling East at high altitude. It is common to see aircraft overhead here, most at high altitude. Military training flights are also common, at all altitudes. As I watched the planes get farther away, I noticed a third light, approaching from the Southeast, and much lower in altitude. I at first thought that this was a military plane, with a light on or under the nose, there were no running lights or other lights visible. As we continued on Railroad Av.(Southeast) I could see lights from the Parker-Hannifin plant buildings on Tannery Road, as well as the lights on the plant&apos;s elevated water tank. I could also see the outlines of the mountins nearby. I continued to watch the approaching light, it did not cast a beam like a spot light or head lights on a vehicle.  It appeared to be round, and did not change in color or intensity.  The light continued in a straight line toward the Parker-Hannifin plant, and because the elevated water tank was plainly visible, I estimate it to have been at an altitude of 1000 feet or less. We were travelling on Railroad Av. at about 5 MPH, we had passed the corner of Fourth St. and were about halfway to the corner at Fifth St. where we would make a right turn.  At this point, I said out loud, &quot;What the Hell is that?&quot;  The driver asked what I was talking about, and put his foot on the brake, I pointed into the windshield and said &quot;That light&quot;.  As we got to the corner of Railroad Av. and Fourth St. the driver stopped, and I jumped out to see if I could hear plane engines.  Just as I got out of the truck, the light appeared to grow in diameter and intensity.  Before the driver and rear passenger could get out of the truck, the light just vanished, just like you flip off a light switch, it just was not there anymore. We continued to stand in the street by the truck for acouple of minutes, looking for the light, a car came up Railroad Av. stopped and asked what we were looking at, when I told him that I did not know, both him and his passenger got out to look, but whatever it was, was gone.  There were aircraft seen at this time, headed West, and East, all at high altitudes   I am convinced that this was not a plane or helicopter.  As I said earlier, you can see aircraft over the town, day and night when the skies are clear, and hear them when it is overcast.  That evening, the sky was clear, with very few high, thin clouds, the stars were bright.  The temperature was in the mid thirties and there was no noticible wind.", "Six or seven white lights in a row that turned red, then back to white and quickly flew awayI was walking my dog shortly after 9 PM (he always asked to go out about 9 PM) It was January in the early/mid seventies. While walking in a northwesterly direction on Lloyd Road (see map) I saw what appeared to be an airplane with its landing lights on approaching me just above a house on Cheyney Road. I was startled because there seemed to be at least six or seven very bright white lights in a row. I had never before seen so many landing lights on a plane, there are usually only two, maybe three or four at the most. We live along one of the approaches to Philadelphia International Airport (about five miles SW of us) so I have seen many planes approaching with their lights on.I looked at the lights for a few seconds, there was no sound of a plane, only the wind blowing. Suddenly the area around all the lights turned a bright red/orange, sort of a flattened oval shape. Where the white lights had been, the red/orange color was brighter than the rest of the object. The color was very intense and reminded me of the intense type of color that you get from a welders torch, only it was an intense red/orange and not blue.The object then began to move sideways (easterly) and at that instant it turned into a white color again, turned and moved extremely fast away from me in a north easterly direction and quickly vanished in the distance. The whole event lasted about 15 or 20 seconds. I never told anyone of this event but after seeing a television story about the January 2000 object near East Saint Louis, it reminded me of this event because the lights in a row seemed to similar to what I had seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

On the afternoon of Feb. 12 at approximately 1500 hrs, my cousin and I were standing on the driveway at his farm when we heard a loud swishing sound from across the valley from his farm.  The farm is at a rather high elevation and we had a clear line of sight for several miles to the Southwest across US Highway 60. The sound became louder and we saw literally thousands of birds flying across the highway from my uncle&apos;s farm.  They appeared to have been startled by something.  A minute later we then heard a helicopter coming from the opposite direction.  When the copter came into sight we noticed that it was a flat black in color and had dark tinted windows.  I got my binoculars from my truck and got a closer look. The aircraft had absolutely no marking anywhere on it.  It flew to the Southwest to almost exactly where the birds had come from and began hovering not more than 75 to 100 feet above the field on my Uncle&apos;s farm.  The craft continued to hover for several minutes and I watched it the entire time.  There were no marking at all and all of the front bubble glass appeared to be tinted very dark.  I was unable to see anyone inside and it was close enough that I should have been able to see the pilot clearly.  If anyone else has had any type of contact with a black chopper like this, I would like to know who these people are and if the birds and the chopper are related incidents or just coincidence.

We are both of sound mind and body, and the nature of this letter is to do nothing more than report an event that occurred, based on this persons account on Wednesday March 29th .After asking this individual if he was going to report it, he said hell no. Perplexed and astounded by testimony he gave, I am going behind his back to report this event. Simply because he stated &ldquo;this was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life&rdquo;. He was very serious, specific and said this was not any sort of aircraft, based on how it behaved. At approximately 8:55 PM on Wednesday March 29th in rural Starkville Mississippi, the individual was leaning against the bed of his truck, facing North East having a cigarette looking towards the sky casually. It was pitch black, stars illuminated the clear sky, the crescent moon behind him. In the sky at about 1000 feet he noticed a peculiar white light in the sky just sitting there about a mile and a &frac12; from him, just over to the right. In a matter of one second the object moved about 2 miles South West, which was closer, and to the left of where he first saw it. It stopped and did one flash (white light), then immediately went North about a &frac12; mile in a split second , stopped and flashed again just once. Then the object darted East South East about another mile and &frac12; where it was just above the tree line as he was looking at it, then it flashed 3 times, same white light. The final spot it stopped but further right from where he first spotted it, but closer to him. Then in an instant it simply just disappeared.

Something caught my eye and I glanced at the upper left hand side of my windshield.I saw an extremely bright stationary object at about a 10:00 position in the daylight sky. It was intensely bright,like sunlight reflecting off a mirror. Although reflected light tends to spray outwards - this appeared to be a perfect circle or orb approx 3/4 inch in diameter from my position in the driver&apos;s seat. I thought it might be the sun reflecting off a plane, but it was too large, much too bright and a little too low to be an aircraft. To my relief, the brightness gave way or folded to a flat and dull grey slender shape. I had thought it was plane after all. I looked away for a 1/2 a second and when I returned to look at the object and it was completely gone from view - vanished. I searched the sky - nothing. In the farthest distance high up in the sky I could see the trails of an airplane and  other commercial aircraft far to my left. It was really weird. I work for an airline and live in in Fairfield County CT where there are always commercial aircraft in route. I searched UFO related sites to see if anyone else saw it because there were so many cars on the highway. It freaked me out butI&apos;m still holding out for a logical explaination.

I was sitting at my kitchen table around 3:00pm on a summer afternoon (we live in a rural farming area)and I happened to look out the window only to see a very large dark pointed object flying towards my house, from south-westerly direction. The craft flew very slowly just above the trees. As the craft moved across the treeline, it but did not create any air turbulence - neither the trees nor leaves moved. It made no sound and moved very very slowly over my house. My daughter and I ran out onto the side gallery and looked up at the object which proceeded over our heads in an easterly direction. Again, it made no sound and I felt no air turbulence. As the nose of the craft moved over the front of the house, we had time to run to the rear side gallery and watch the last 1/3 of the craft pass overhead  (our house is approximately 45 feet wide). The width of the craft, I would roughly estimate to be about 200 to 250 feet wide, maybe more. The wing span ran from our road to our barn, which is approximately 2 telephone poles wide(100&apos; between poles). I would estimate it took approximately 7-8 seconds for the last 1/3 of the plane to fly completely by. The craft was a huge triangle. The color was a dark greenish black.It look liked it was made of plastic. I don&apos;t remember any lights or windows, but I distinctly recall that the underside of the craft was comprised of  very large tubing (same color as the craft but the pipes looked like large plastic sewer pipes (running back and forth..(south/north) across it&apos;s underside.

No I didn&apos;t contact the authorities here, I was quite a ways from the nearest town, and it was late at night.  I will contact my son to have him make a report.  We haven&apos;t talked about it for years, so it will be interesting to hear what he remembers. I also tried to make a report about an incident years ago when I witnessed a bright light above the town of Culdesac, Idaho.  It was approximately around April or May of 1996, I would have to double check, because I am sure that I wrote it down.  The amazing thing was that a few days later I read in the Lewiston Morning Tribune (LMT)as ad asking for anyone who witnessed  something over the town of Culdesac to phone a certain phone number.  I again didn&apos;t call or report this.  Chicken I guess. At that time, I was working as a ((title deleted--public employee)). When I witnessed the bright light, I at first thought that it was an airplane just reflecting the sunshine, but I realized that it was just way too bright to be an airplane.  I then noted that it wasn&apos;t moving, it seemed to be positioned in one place high above the town. I was driving home from work, and was actually looking at a double rainbow in the sky when I seen the bright light.  Another thought....I remember seeing a picture of that same rainbow in the LMT the next day.  The bright white light seemed to be totally still, then after 5 or 6 minutes, it appeared to be falling straight down for a distance, then zipped off at a 45% angle in a western direction. It was immediately out of sight.  There was a car in front of me, and I did see that they were also watching the rainbows. I wonder if they also seen the bright light, or could have reported it.

It dimmed completely before being blocked by the building. I had this sort of weird feeling that what ever it was knew it was being watched, so it kept hiding.

I could not see any military jets, commercial planes, or helicopters (they would have the flashing or strobe lights in the night sky). Conditions were light hazy skies to the horizons with views of constellations above. I saw four red lights moving north to south at a slow speed. The lights traveled in pairs of two. In each pair, one red light angled higher than the other spaced by a degree or two, followed by a larger space (up to 5 degrees), and then followed by the other pair of two. These two pairs of lights did not break their formation and continued south until they vanished from sight. They were as bright as Venus and seem to be around 10 thousand feet.

These two did seem to slow down couple times or at least move to the west. I viewed this pair for a couple minutes before vanishing in the southern horizon.

I was at work and I stepped out for a cigarette and it was a beautiful blue cloudless sky.  I looked up to the sky and off in the northwest direction I could see a glimmering (looked like a sun reflection, rather than lights) and slow moving object in the sky.  It was very small from the distance away, so this object was very hard for me to determine any shape or relative size. It moved so slowly and occasionally would ascend and descend rapidly at what seemed a thousand feet or so, but would then fall back into it&apos;s snail pace travel across the sky. Two other guys came out or the building and noticed me looking up, so they inquired what I was looking at and I pointed it out.  One fellow grabbed onto the object immediately, while the other could not seem to fixate on it. Again..It was pretty high up and small. Anyway...as we were looking up, we saw two orange and black chevron shaped objects fly across the sky into our felid of viewing from the west and turn into an eastern direction at a super rate of speed and a much lower elevation than the other object. The two objects then made a sharp turn toward the west and did not separate or lose any ground to each other during this maneuver.  It was incredible to watch at the speed they were moving.  Total precision is the best way to describe it. Then they ascended to a little higher altitude and made another minor turn (again, perfect precision) and climbed and headed toward the first object that I originally spotted at the higher altitude. These two black and orange chevron objects made zero noise that I or the other two could detect and we looked at each other stunned after and the looks on our faces related pretty much the same question...&quot;What Was That&quot;?  All three objects then vanished from our naked eyes, once the chevron objects appeared to re-unite with the first object.

When I came out about 10 minutes later they pointed out a star, but said, it could not be a star because it was blinking different colored lights. I saw it very far off, and it was indeed changing color, blinking, but I could not discern whether it might have been a satellite or a plane. When we got home, we took a closer look at it-- it was NOT MOVING AT ALL, it was BLINKING red, white and green. BLINKING. Location was due north, towards Boise. We inspected the sky and I spotted a second object in the north east. Same... stationery, blinking colors, level in height with the other. 22:10 I (the adult mother, 49 yrs old) can verify 4 objects. Another daughter, 14 years old spotted five. THE MOST DISTINCTIVE IS IN THE NORTHEAST AND IS VERY CLEAR. I have called a friend who has a telescope. He has called back and has verified sighting one object. He is a medical doctor and an excellent source. He cannot see any of the others as his property is obstructed by trees.

It was so faint that I thought it might be a glare on my granny sunglasses. I moved my head up and down and side to side. The object did not move. I raised the sunglasses and the object was not visible. I put the glasses back on and it was visible. It was very faint and line pattern was white in color. so the object was a white line on a blue sky background with white clouds all around. Very hard to see. I had some binoculars just out of arms reach and I was worried about losing the object. I took a chance and reached for the binoculars. I never saw it again.

The apparent strobe lights were not noticed until the bright light disappeared and at that time the apparent strobe lights departed the visible sky in all directions until no longer visible.  We are unsure if the strobe lights were visible during the observance of the larger light as we were concentrating on the brighter flashing light until it disappeared.  Once the brighter flashing light disappeared, we noted that the movement of the strobe lights was consistent with the general direction of the movement of the brighter flashing light until they departed the area.  No noise from the skies was heard during this observance; however, the frogs in the lake were making an unusual amount of noise prior to the siting.  The noise from the frogs was disputed among the persons hearing the noise to be an abnormal noise made by the indigenous frogs of this lake.

It was 50 feet in diameter and a pale grayish color. From what I could tell the object had no windows of markings of any kind. The object flew directly over our house and by the time we got outside it had disappeared.

Still the object held motionless, but continued to pulsate, at about 4-6 seconds per cycle, I would guess. We both thought this very odd and were sure it could be no plane, when we got an added shock as the final pulse seemed to enlarge and disspate, as if a puff of smoke had been spread from a central point and then vanished.

I went outside a few minutes later to look in the sky &amp; see if any of my neighbors might be shooting fireworks or flares... there were no other &quot;fireballs&quot; that followed.

It came in from behind the &quot;handle&quot; &amp; traveled between the 4 stars that make up the &quot;cup&quot;..... (Megrez, Phecda, Merak, &amp; Dubhe.)  It was a perfectly centered path through the cup, &amp; was 1/2 the width, or thickness of it.(If you were to scale the cup of the Big Dipper at let&apos;s say, 4 inches deep, the &quot;flash/streak&quot; would be 2 inches thick, by 4-6 inches long, &amp; split the center perfectly, leaving an inch on both sides.)

The area in my view, was a local sod farm and as such, it is slightly wooded around the edges of the property, but mostly a large clear field along both sides of Fairfield Rd, near the junction of Rt. 33 and Brickyard road. The night was bright due to a full moon, and clear. The flashing lights caught my eye a second time, because unlike the many airplanes that pass overhead in the area, they hovered in one spot as they moved from left to right in sequence. I got up off the couch for a closer look, and began to realize that this craft was flying very low and hovering just above the tree line. It hadn&apos;t moved like a plane would have out of my view; in fact, it didn&apos;t follow any of the many flight patterns I have come accustomed to seeing with aircraft. The lights were very bright and flashing in sequence, beginning with white or yellowish lights, a bright red light in the center and again towards the other end the same white or yellowish lights. As the lights appeared and disappeared in sequence,they seemed to be rectangular in shape(almost like a row of teeth). Realizing this was not a typical aircraft, I frantically ran to get my husband out of the basement, and he came upstairs quickly! At this time we both stared at the object in amazement, not really sure what we were seeing. He ran outside to get a better view fom our deck. Noticing that it was definately a different type of object, he grabbed the car keys and took off in the direction of Rt.9. I stayed home with the children (alseep in their beds), continuing to look out the window at the object. The object hovered a bit longer, and then began to disappear under the tree line out of my view within a few minutes. I checked the time starting to panic a bit- it was 12:18 am. Before my husband returned,another interesting phenomenon occured. I had been watching a pre-recorded DVR event at the time of the sighting and it seems that for some reason- when I tried to switch to live tv mode, thinking the news may be picking up on the sighting ,it stopped working temporarily (the DVR function was on and it stopped responding). In fact, I had to shut it off and re-start the system to acquire a new satellite signal. My husband returned a little after 12:30. He said, he traveled east towards Rt. 9 in the vicinity of T.G. I. Friday&apos;s, but lost sight of it. Having been curious to see if anyone else reported this sighting, I googled  Howell NJ and UFO sightings this morning and was shocked that there were two sightings described on NUFORC.com that detalied to the letter, the same exact vicinity we had seen the aircraft!!! I then was convinced I needed to report our sighting. My husband and I both having seen it, and being educated rational adults, we concluded that we can&apos;t say for certain what it is we saw, but whatever it was, we agreed that it was : a low flying craft, the lights were many more and quite larger than on a regular airplane or helicopter, and amazingly it hovered (seeming to float) in one spot much like a helicopter would but silently!! Intestingly enough, speaking to my aunt this morning  (on an unrelated topic), who lives a few towns over in Monroe NJ, she commented that last evening the whole area lost cable t.v. power and it had not yet been restored today.  After she told me about the outage, I looked online for a connection between sightings and power outages, and found quite a few interesting instances. There was also an interesting connection between sightings and military installations and or nulear weapons satations. I didn&apos;t mention what we saw to her or to anyone else, because it is difficult to describe such an event to people since most are skeptics (including myself, until last night and more so after reading those other two entries describing the same spot!!!). It was definately an interesting experience, one I will never forget! I know now, that I will no longer hold the skeptics viewpoint, but can with confidence believe that something other than what is known to us publically, can hover over an area silently and more or less fly without a known flight path. Perhaps our technology is evolving. We live near a few military installations and this could be an aircraft that is under the classified testing phase and has yet to be revealed! Who knows- however, as I mentioned earlier, my husband and I both witnessed the event and we can state with confidence that the object followed no known flight pattern, and was hovering, or moving slowly and much lower than any other known aircraft, and what we saw- we had never seen before!", "hey all you ufo peeps i am only writing this to verify another guys sighting here in swf there here alot ufo&apos;s and there disturbing the pease1 the man saw a silver disc and yup thats what i saw only the sheriff had a helicopter out for a look see i only hope that all they want is a little look see or to check us out,if not there is going to be hell to pay.am i right((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the alleged sighting occurred sometime during June 2005.

What caught my eye was that just off the tip of the cresent moon, there was an object which reminded me of a drop of water haning off the tip of the moon.  I starred for a while and determined that it was definitely not a star.  I could see that it had a circular shape and reflected the sun light as did the moon. I continued to see the object (which never moved from its &quot;hanging off the tip of the moon position&quot;.  And eventually the road turned and I stopped paying attention.  But when I got home, I was so baffled by what I had seen, that I called the local weather station and asked about possible satelites in the area, but was told there werent any that i could see or anything that would be there like I described.  I have recently seen videos and pictures of what I can now saw if very much like what I thought i saw that night.  And due to the fact that these spheres have been documented as moving and being still, i do believe that is what i saw that night.  All I know for sure is that it was NOT A STAR!   And it was not there later on in the night.  Since it was a routine journey, it did not have a camera on hand unfortunately.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

About 11:00 the night before our wedding she and I were standing on a small dead end road far outside of the center of Edgartown, MA looking up and enjoying the beautiful night sky.  It was a very clear night so the sweeping streak of the Milky Way and billions of other stars were visible that night.  The ground was very dark because there was no moon in the sky at the time. A single very large black triangular shaped object creeped very slowly in over us blocking out the stars.  The object was completely silent and had no lights on it at all.  It appeared to be at a low altitude, maybe 100 ft or less, possibly at treetop level.  It was such a deep black that we could only discern its shape by the stars which were blocked out by it.  Its size was large enough to block out most of the sky over us. We were both stunned as the point of its nose slowly wedged itself into our view but then a calm fell over both of us and we didn&apos;t utter a word.  We weren&apos;t quite sure of the duration of the event because neither of us could remember it leaving.  It was strange because at the time we both acknowledged that this had happened but we never told anyone in the wedding party nor discussed it much with each other after that.", "pure silver, pure spherical, moving over the algoma steel plant parallel with Wallace Terrace, um...east to west , not big, not very high up, in a very straight path, probably 10- 12 feet in diameter, faster than i could drive my car on the in-town road (about 60 kls/hr), my daughter and i saw it and chased it and ... lost it at Allan Side Road, the sky was clear blue and it was a warm afternoon.

Right at sunset, while driving home I noticed a bright &quot;star&quot; wink on in my windshield at about 45 degrees.  As I looked at it, in sequence about 5 more of these &quot;stars&quot; winked on extending in a line towards my direction, with the final one almost 90 degrees up over my head.  After about 10 seconds they ALL went off at the same instant.  Not faded, but disappeared instantly.  I have seen military flares in the area in the past, but they are generally an orange airburst type that is not a point of light and fades slowly.  These were simply like a bright gold colored star.

The sky was at twilight, a very dark blue but not dark.", "star like object high up in the sky making strange movements and somethings changing lights/colorObject was noticed when I lay down in my bed getting ready to fall asleep. I saw this light, I would estimate at least 2-3 km above the city that kept my attention as I eliminated what it could be. It moved back and forth (very small changes) but in a fashion that is unknown to be done by human aviation (e.g. left and suddenly up) so I knew it was not a star either but it otherwise looked mostly like a star.

I was driving and she was in the passanger seat. We were on OLD US 35, leaving W.C.H. and about a mile from the Fayette/Ross Co line. My friend says to me &quot;Look, What is that?&quot; I glance out my window and about a mile or so away is this incredibly bright object just hovering in the sky above the farming fields. (We where out there in the country.)  I&apos;ve seen plenty of things like airplanes and helicopters in this area and I know one when I see one. This WAS NOT one. I&apos;d like to add here that it was not yet dark at all outside, the sun was still hanging in there and the sky was still blue. I could see vaugely a bowl shaped bottom on it that appeared to be a silver color, but emmiting from it was the most blinding white light I&apos;ve ever seen. Imagine if you will what a normal airplane looks like AT NIGHT, imagine the lights. It was like the lights times 100. The lights where so bright that it seemed beamy almost, the sun but a crisp, white color. (The sun was on the other side of my car, BTW. LOL)  So I&apos;m attempting to drive and watch this object that&apos;s not moving by my estimations and all the sudden, it&apos;s like the lights on the craft dimmed by 50% and I said to my friend &quot;Did it just dim it&apos;s lights?&quot; and she said &quot;Yes.&quot; No more then five seconds later she says &quot;OMG It&apos;s just gone!&quot;  So I looked agian and sure enoungh, it had totally vanished. I saw nothing. The car behind me started driving really, really fast and they took off around me like a bat out of hell. So we drive down 35, cross the Fayette/Ross Co. border and turn around and come back. I look up and I see a bunch of jet stream or contrails in the sky, all going in the same direction where we had seen the craft. My friend counted ten of them in all.

While we were still looking we noticed another bright white light moving from South to the North.  As we watched the light started to dim, and we thought it would disappear too, but then it pulsed a very bright white light, started going dim again, then about 5 seconds later pulsed again.  It did this for about a minute, pulsing on and off while moving very fast across the sky until it disappeared completely. I&apos;m using the word pulse instead of flash because the light, when it happened, would pulse on very slowly, not like a harsh flash, and then slowly dim. This was a very clear night.

After we stopped on our field nearby home, we were seeing that more acurately. It was exactly the circle made of white light&acute;s squares or rectangles. Together they made cca. 15 - 20 meters diameter round. It   rotated around its central line, but it was only the light, but very regular. ...

It was on the NW horizon above a 3400 foot range of mountains and very high in the sky and far away. I looked again with binoculars and was amazed to see the object was actually egg-shaped its surface was covered with flashing lights.  I saw the colors amber, blue-green, and red all flashing independently of each other. As the object very slowly moved east its shape seemed to change to cigar--almost as though it had tipped on its side or turned. It continued to flash, the colors so bright it looked like a carnival ride in the sky.  It then flashed only one color in different places on its surface--all amber, all bluish-green, all red. At one point it began to climb higher in a zig-zag pattern--slowly, almost meandering, then continued east again.

When I tried making sure they seemed to freeze in place and I was overcome with a horrible fear and felt forced to lay back down and close my eyes. The next day I asked my little brother if he had seen anything and he told me that he thought our parents had been in the room. I then asked both my mother and father if they had been in our room at any time of the night and they both had said that they haven&apos;t been in our room the entire night.I believe what I have witnessed was 2 alien lifeforms and I do not know if they had done anything to me as I slept.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I could have dismissed this as some kind of balloon - except that something struck me odd.This was some kind of oval shaped object - perhaps the closest thing I can think of is football (american). No visible things protruding outside the eliptical, oval shell shape. I can&apos;t remember the color, but I think it was sort of greyish. This thing was so benign and innocent that you would see it but would not even notice it.So naturally fitting in the sky. I realized that there were three things odd - (1) it was high in the sky must be roughly somewhere between 1000 ft to 10000 ft - a plane flew from San Jose airport and its size and height was of the comparable order. So, I thought it perhaps is not a balloon as I have not seen balloons of  plane sizes.  (2) It was moving at an incredible thing. It did not look like any object having an engine - no audible noise, no smoke trail, and it was sort of gliding - something like an orphan kite. But it was going from west to east, and speed seemed 10 times faster than a jet. It cleared the whole sky in my view in less than 15 seconds, while I think a plane would have taken at least 2 minues or so. (3) towards the end it was so far that I would have lost it anyway but then it sort of started gaining altitude. Significant gain in about a couple of seconds. If it was not for logically thinking about these things, I would have completely ignored and not even remembered about this. I was with my Dad. As I felt something odd about this object, I pointed it to my dad. He saw this as well. I pointed to him my logical inconsistency of speed - he seemed to agree. We were in Great America Parkway waiting for the fireworks when this happened. Time must be between 8:00 to 8:30pm. There must be a few thousand people right there looking into the sky. I did not talk to any one, but I was hoping that someone else saw it. I surfed web to see any information, tried to dismiss it as some sort of balloon. But could not find any conclussive evidence either way. Nor did find any one else mentioning this.So I decided to report it. If there are more people who saw this and can conclussively identify this as man made object, I would be thankful.This would solve the puzzle and satisfy my curiosity. Please note that I am not an expert on aircrafts, balloons, natural phenomenon, or any other such things that could explain many of the so called UFO sightings.I know this, it was no optical illusion as it was a solid object. It was not any of the usual kind aircraft with wings etc.. as this object had nothing protruding out of its shell.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We all had mixed emotions. My Mom was frightened, I wished to leave the car, and she kept screaming for me not too! She recently died. Until now I was not allowed by my family to discuss the event. We held it in our family. My brother has zero problems talking about this, nor my sister but my Mom was frightened to a point where she tried to speed away in our car, however time stopped, we could not move! It was really fascinating I thought?  I knew all about UFO encounters as my father was in the Korean war and the US Air Force. This occurred while we were heading home from my grandmothers home in Short Hills, NJ on Old Short Hills Road prior to reaching Walnut Street in Livingston. I remember the UFO was hovering near the property that had a hidden resevoir behind it, and alot of power lines. I lived on the East Orange Resevoir in Livingston NJ and knew that some people thought UFO&apos;s where seen near water, so I was use to going and playing and ice skating on the resevoir and had zero fear, however my Mother would not allow the door to open and the car only had two front doors, and she remained fixed behind the wheel of the Pontiac convertible. I asked her years later why this scared her and she refused to speak ever about it.  However when I arrived home to Baker Road, I phoned my Dad whom worked in the Menlo Park Mall in Edison he owned a furniture store there.  He was working late that night.  I do recall we left during semi-daylight and arrove home in the dark!  He told me to call the Morristown Airport and report it! I did, at a small age, I never forgot this experience and have had an insatiable yet calm interest and patience abpout this topic. I was married in 1977 at the young age of 17 years old, and when I told my future husbands Mother about how I had witnessed a UFO, she declared,&quot; Wow, I saw it along with most of my eight children and my husband, who at that time worked for Bell Labs in NJ,  My Dad was working close to the Thomas Edison Labs in Edison NJ at that time. We always wondered, if this UFO had something to do with the fact we did marry and have a son? Many years later yet young as teens. I do truly believe that the UFO&apos;s come out of the Bermuda Triangle and are seen by many.  I saw on the news in the 1990&apos;s UFO&apos;s hovering over Phoenix, that was not like our experience.  Time stopping, I remember the exact clearing in the woods where this occurred, the exact home it happened in front of too. It is amazing to me that I am now 47 and this still perplexes me although I realize my Mom was aware of military interogation, blue book files etc, from my Father collecting Time Magazines, and the fact he always was into the paranormal!  Alot of people in my immediate family saw this occur, aprox 13 of us are alive to talk about it. I have drawn it, however do not share it. I feel that we all have individual incounters and that they may be helping or hurting us? I do not want to open a pandora&apos;s box. I feel this is how my Mom was protecting me and my siblings, or I could have been reporting a encounter of the third kind or missing! I am glad I am not doing that. I wish all of you success. Do you realize that the UFO&apos;s are hanging out near the USA submarine bases? Look on the World Map? I do not know but would like to if they are hanging around other countrys submarine bases? They are built by General Dynamic&apos;s and Electric Boat, the fact that our Star Wars program has begune makes me feel like I just may see one soon, since I live near the Bangor Wa submarine base now? Who knows? It can not be a cooincidence, your tracking is excellent in my mind. Keep up the fantastic work and I will report any others I happen to see, to the US Navy or Marines since my son is a US Marine he told me I may have had response had I called them in NJ, way back when I was a little girl. True story, no additions. The craft was circular and looked invisible however you could see windows and lights. Within the circle. when I was interogated by my Dad in a most professional way, and this is more then likely why I have such a memory! I told him exactly what I am telling you, This craft flew over us, and then all of the cars behind us could move, and my Mother could have had a speeding ticket~! However we got home safe, and I wrang Dad He was excited and wanted to know more, at such a young age I was allowed to stay up late and explain and try and draw what I saw! It was round, perfectly, looked to have some sort of craft in the center, like if it were spinning or creating a temporary worm hole? It had beings in it, as they gazed at me out of tiny slits, within the outer ring, sort of how Jupiter has rings this one had one bright light ring belt around it.the center looked like an inverted bubble, unlike all of the drawings my Father had seen elsewhere mine was upside down? He did not question me. I still stick to seeing what I did indeed see, my brother remember it too. I have not asked my little baby sister because I do remember she was in a car seat at this time, so she was a baby of around two, it would definitely be in her memory from Dad bragging that his wife and family saw a UFO for real!", "Mother Ship/ Appeared as a StarI never reported this as it was one of those miraculous moments that only the three of us shared.A star like object,(literally) was more like a light of a planet. in the sky with the hundreds of others the three of us were looking at. We were actually looking for the Pleidiaes (sp) constalation. Anyway we noticed a darting object and my friend said/asked if we saw that? We agreed. We layed down on the ground and watched literally 100&apos;s (trying not to exaggerate), objects flying in and out of this star? Whatever, it was a Mother Craaft we don&apos;t know but we watched for a long time. It was wild. These objects had no spitting out like and explosion. They DARTED  in out up down. There was no rythme . Just as if they were going in and out of a gas station. I cannot remember the year but my friend can exactly cuz her b-day was coming up. I want to say 94/95/96 Can be more specific if this interests you for info.That was NOT the only Tucson sighting either Thanks for you work ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star sighting, we believe, given the duration of the event.  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Loud persistent humming accompanied by shape of light with no source creating the light.I will email because it is too long for this box.((COPIED REPORT))I began watching a movie on Dish Network and all of a sudden the picture cut-off. An error message was displayed saying my smart card was not allowed to access the channel. This was true for all channels. I am a service tech by trade and did my best to correct the problem with no results. Fustrated, I walked out on the patio to smoke a cigarette. As I sat there, cows began mooing and whaling. I passed this off as a nuisance as well. As I pet the dogs, the female dog stuck her ear up as if to hear something. Using the local colloquialism I said, &quot;Geeet-em!&quot; Both dogs ran out in the yard after a grey figure that I saw moving very swiftly, standing upright. As they barked, coyotes began to howl; They were all over the place! There were three different packs from the North, South, and West Directions. The pack from the north was extremely close, and it sounded as if they were in the front yard. I was surprised that I could not see the coyotes but had seen the other figure. The coyotes returned howls back and forth along with all of the sparsely placed neighbors&apos; dogs. The cows began to moo again accompaning all the other sounds of animals. As this was going on I heard a humming sound in the sky start to get louder and louder. This is when I became really nervous, because too many strange things were happening for me to write them off as coincidence. I looked and looked at the sky but could not see a plane or helicopter that was making this noise. The more I looked for something in the sky, the louder the noise became. Finally the noise was so loud that it somehow was making me lethargic and had a sort of hypnotic effect. I almost lost conscienceness, but began to fight the effect it was having on me. Please keep in mind that the coyotes were still yipping and yelping while all this was going on, but the the dogs had retreated to the patio and were just as frightened as I was. Everytime I would glance at the female dog, she would growl under her breath as if she knew that the occurence was threatening in some way. As the noise prolonged, I then noticed what I would describe as a &quot;light shadow&quot;. It was a oval shape of light in the front yard that appeared on the lawn, but yet there was no ray or beam projecting that light onto the ground. It was light without a source, and it moved in a quirky manner in a circular pattern. I felt an energy trying to communicate with me, but I kept thinking: &quot;No, No, No, I don&apos;t belive it!&quot; It was almost as if I was trying to deny its existence in order for it to go away. And quicker than a flash everything was gone, the world was still and peaceful, and I was left doubting everything I had seen. Doubting what I saw did not help, however, because nothing could be justified in my mind as to explain, logicallly, what had happened. I know that every sighting must first be considered as a hoax, however I must iterate that this was the first time I have ever experienced anything so unexplainable. Until now, I did not belive in such things. What I saw, heard, and felt has changed my mind forever on the subject. If you have any questions feel free to cal my celL  ((number deleted))((name deleted))", "Group of flashing rapidly moving lightsI have been seeing this for roughly a year. What happens is at certain times of the month several lights will appear, moving around the sky in unison and flash on and off while doing so. I have had several other people see it with me at times and they all agree with me that it seems like it is being flown in such a manor, definatly not stars or weather balloons or aircraft ( there are several airports in this area including one that has some military craft at it). I finally decided to file this in the hopes some else around here is seeing it.", "We went outside for smoke, when my brother looked up at the sky and point to south east from us, I saw blue light shaped circle streaking across the sky with high speed, than disappeared into the light as we get 12 hours of light up here.We thought that the light was a star first, than it moved North than North East.And we realized that it was disappearing before our eyes.", "Sighting in the froest of bowlandI was out on  my rounds feeding the livestock on my farm near dunsop bridge in the trough of bowland, lancashire when i spotted an object in the sky, then another and another and another the objects where moving at an incredible speed and were dipping and diving around the hillside. The objects disapered and left the sky full of smoke. An object fell from the sky, which appeared to be just a piece of scrap metal, but it didnt look right i went to start my quad engine to go back home but it wouldnt start, so i ran all the way home.

I was driving East on Arkansas Lane in Arlington Texas in early afternoon.  As I topped the hill and approached the intersection of Park Springs and Arkansas Lane I saw an enormous oval shaped disk that appeared to be made of highly polished silver, hovering over the City of Grand Prairie, Texas, which is the City to East of Arlington and about 10 miles from the intersection I was approaching.  It seemed to me to be about the width of a football field or two and was much larger on the horizon than the Dalworthington Gardens Water tower that came into view as I approached the next traffic light at the corner of Spanish Trail and Arkansas Lane.  The strange thing about this sighting is that the UFO appeared to be appearing and disappearing as it sort of wobbled while sitting there in the sky.  Although I did not see any airliners at that time, The UFO seemed to be sitting well above the trees that were visible to me and just under a landing flight path to DFW Airport that I generally always see a plane or two making a final approach when I travel East on Arkansas Lane.  Sometime before this sighting, I remember hearing about some one or some group trying to project a picture of Christ in the skyline above New York City and at first I thought that because the UFO was appearing and disappearing that perhaps that was happening here also.  However, this was in broad daylight.  I looked to my left, intending to honk at the white pick up truck to my left and call the driver&apos;s attention to what ever this was.  However when I looked at the driver, I could see that the gentleman driving the truck had his mouth open and was looking at the same sight I was seeing. I continued down Arkinsas Lane and the UFO continued to hover and appear and disappear until I reached the intersection of Bowen Rd. and Arkansas Lane.  Then the UFO disappeared and never appeared again. The next day, I was again in my car listening to either the local Classical or Oldies but Goodies Radio station, when the announcer made the following addition to a short news break, &quot;All you people in Arlington, who called in to report what you thought was a UFO yesterday were actually seeing a weather baloon.&quot;  I was not one of those people who called in, but I do know that what I saw was no weather baloon.  At the time of my sighting, I did not have a computer.  Two years later when I did purchase one, I began a search that continues today for someone, anyone who saw this same UFO  I am unsure of the date and even the exact year, but I know that others must have seen it and either called the authorities or a radio a station to report it.", "Bright light at low altitude vanishes leaving a round cloudI am 50 years old and left Reno, NV 5:30am to Sacramento, CA to take a test. Some where in the Sierra&apos;s on interstate 80 there was a bright light, about 2000ft AGL. Looked to large, bright and still to be an Aircraft(Aircraft lights this close usaully show some transmited vibration). The light projected a flat and fanned-out beam into a cloud. Unlike a head light beam. I thought the cloud was causing this affect. After studying it for about a minute trying to justify it in my mind it then moved to the right and stopped. It dimmed and brightened then disappeared. As it disappeared there was a faint round fog or cloud like that which is generated by a high altitude jet engine but very faint. It formed a ball around where the light  pushing out then rushed slightly into where the light was. The light going out and the cloud forming took about a second. I continued to watch the round cloud and noticed the other could was gone. As I watched the round cloud still trying to rationalize what I saw the round cloud disipated in about 5-7 seconds. It was a clear sky and only some of the brightest stars were still visible. Being a novice pilot and watching stars as a pass-time I can only say this is something I can&apos;t explain.", "Silent trapezoid (triangle with its head cut off). Oklahoma, 1971.One fairly clear evening (~8:45) at dusk, in the summer of 1971, my brother (11) and I (male, 13) visited our 3 friends [Female(14), female (12) and male (8)], who had relocated from the Houston area the previous summer. We were outside Broken Bow, OK. We were west (~5 miles) and somewhat south of the city and in a very rural area. We were walking north to see their church at night -- an exciting/scary thing to do! The birds had stopped singing and the crickets had not yet started, so it was very quite. I noticed that there were three lights toward Broken bow that were not blinking. I asked if they had any towers out there and they said they didn&apos;t know. And something was mentioned about their living in that particular location (on rural acreage in a mobile home) only since December (~7 months). So we just kept walking toward the church. About a minute or so later, we looked up to see a very large opaque trapezoid (triangle with its head cut off) with three lights. It was moving very slowly toward the sun that had already set. The narrow end of the trapezoid led and the wide end followed. It blocked out the atmospheric haze that was still aglow because the sun was not quite completely gone. It continued westward until it was obscured by the wooded area to the west of us. The lights were as such, two in the front on each corner and one in the north corner only. I do not remember their colors. The amazing thing is that it made no noise. There is no way to be certain of its size/height, although if I had to guess, since I thought the lights were towers, then it must not have been too high, assuming it maintained its height. If it was that height, I&apos;d guess it to be about 1/3 the size of a football field. I was elated to hear about the one in Phoenix in the 1990&apos;s. Although it was chevron-shaped, and had more lights, like ours, it was hovering, expansive and silent. I assume the aliens have changed their designs over the years; either out of boredom or out of necessity, scientific or economic - gotta keep up with the Joneses-Snergabloids.

We were just talking and I looked up at the stars because I love the stars. When out of my periphial view to my left I saw somthing. Its weird but at first glance I thought it was an owl gliding across the sky. Then my mind thought it was a flock of ducks flying in a V formation. But when it was right over my head the light from the stars vanished behind it. It was a black triangle craft making no sound at all. I looked at my wife and pointed to the sky and I kept asking what is that. She didn&apos;t know of course. It had no lights no sound and glided across the sky to the north west. I watched until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. We jumped in our car and tried to follow it but I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. I;m telling you if I hadn&apos;t looked straight up I never would have saw it. I went home and looked on line at all the stelth planes that are known to exsist. none of them looked like it. the edges were rounded. It was the creepest thing I&apos;d ever seen. I have listened to you and Art for years and never thought I would see somthing like this. At the time I didn&apos;t report it because it wasn&apos;t as fantastic as all the reports you seem to get. The only reason I amm sending this is to add to your evidence that we are not alone. Thank you for all you do. One more thing, it might sound weird but I got a strong impression that what ever was in that craft knew that I was watching it. I wish I would have reported it sooner but like I said I didn&apos;t think it was a big deal. If you do get in touch with me I did have questions of a dream I had in 1996.I know I might sound dumb but it was a dream of little greys taking me from my bed and putting a clone of me in my place for about a year. I know it was just a dream but I&apos;ve always wondered if I should talk to someone. Couple of my friends I told just laugh until I tell them I had a second dream a couple days before my surgery that the little guys brought me back. Then they just say how weird.

The front of it was green and then it tapered into orange, there was much more orange than green.  It wasn&apos;t a green object with an orange tail because the whole thing moved together as one object.  There was no noise.  The way it appeared it reminded me of shooting a bottle rocket.

Right away, we saw one object, and then another, pop out of the first object and fly off to the east until it was obscured by the dorm called Cheshire (the event took place in the rear parkinglot at Franklin Pierce college.

The objects that popped out and flew away happened very rappidly, and seamed to have yellow contrails they left behind them breifly.  They seamed to be white and yellow in color.  We ruled out it being a star, a plane, a planet, or a satelite.  We went and got a camera but by the time we got back the object was so far away that we couldnt focus and get a good picture becuase the object looked like a star or a plane in the distance.  The object we assumed was some type off unidentified military object or possibly a extraterrestrial object.  Eventualy we watched this object get too far away and it was not discernable from any other stars in the sky.  I happen to think this event was military related.  After a while I noticed many (5 or six) other craft that looked just like the first object, but were staying stationary and very far apart ( 5 miles) and seemed to be flashing red , white and blue lights in successing order.

It was obvious that it was in our atmosphere.  And it was absolutely not a plane. Not only was it moving faster than any plane I&apos;ve ever seen, it had no type of blinking light on it at all.

The heavy rain had just stopped and it was getting dark during the shooting. I found out when I reviewed the movies at home.   As is my usual habit, I deleted all the movies in the camera after downloading into my PC.  The other movie shot close to that spot and few minutes later did not show any of this object.

From 1984 through 1987, while living in the Monterey Bay Area, I observed several times what appeared to be flights of balloon clusters at very high altitudes passing eastward over the Central California Coast. Most were too far away and too high to see much, even with 7x binoculars.Only one time did they pass directly overhead and seemed close enough to see them better. The clusters appeared to be several silver-gray, featureless balloons in tight formations and appeared to be straight eastward moving very rapidly, like a jet. They also seemed to be moving around, rotating around each other in rather unballoon-like ways but I am uncertain of this because of they were so far away. I did not think much of these sightings, assuming that they were some sort of new fancy style of balloon, travelling in the jet stream, until I found out that others had seen very similar objects from relatively close by.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I also remember that the paper printed a squib about it after that, basically saying that stationary lights were observed over the city and that the Air Force was notified, and that the Air Force indicated that it would look into it.

There I saw what I thought was a large plane flying rather high over that airspace.  It was extremely bright in the pre-twilight evening.This is a flight area for planes landing at the internation airport in El Paso so I really did not think much about it.  I saw another jet fly below it.  The second jet was definitely coming towards the airport and even though it was approaching twilight, I could not see the landing lights. It was still too light outside.   I could see the form of the plane as a shadow. The second jet left a vapor trail.  This caused me to ponder and wonder how the plane flying higher did not leave any trail.I watched the  first craft and its glistening shape changed slightly to crescent as if it had turned to reveal its profile.  It seemed to have pivoted at the spot it was at.  It made no motion in relation to objects on the ground.  From my observation point - several miles from McGregor range - and having seen a commerial aircraft look like fly specks below this craft, I suddenly was aware I was looking at something extraordinary.  This thing seemed to be about 1/4 inch wide now from my front yard - but if it were higher than commerical airliners and further away, it had to simply be huge.A speck of light sudden flew up from the ground east of the crescent and appeared slammed into the crescent at an extremely high rate of speed. I&apos;ve been involve in missles and I&apos;ve never seen one as fast as this one.  The crescent seemed to absorb the speck.  I thought at first that it might have been a missle from McGreor, but having just seen a commerical plane in that airspace, that did not make any sense.McGreor would have closed off its airspace before any test firings.  Commerical traffic was still using this airspace.  There did not appear to be any materials falling away from the crescent shaped object as one might expect if it were hit with a missle.From my point of view, it appeared another speck of light came from just below the crescent and also slammed into the crescent. It was not as fast as the first, but still far beyond convential craft speeds.  I realized there was no vapor trail from the smaller speck.About that time, on the horizon appeared three vapor trails in formation that were rapidly approaching the area. I suspect they were from the near by airforce base, but that is nearly 100 miles from here.  They might have been from White Sands - a little closer.The cresent turned from sunlight white to a brighter blue white light and in just a few milli-seconds was too small to see.

One day I received a call from my close friend in Hong Kong. He informed me that the night before he and several members  of our community were having night cruise. They saw balls of light in formation but he stammered over his description and it seemed to not make sense. It was a Hong Kong harbour cruise.My friend asked me to come the following night at around 8.00pm to talk  whilst they were unloading a chartered ship full of oranges. I arrived and spoke to my friend when he was interupted by the Polish captain of the ship and they were talking. His back was towards me when I saw up in the sky and saw balls, glowing in delta positions. Pls note my choice of words. I called to my friend and he said that was exactly what they saw and he became very flustered. 10 chinese were on the quay side and  when we asked them to look they became very cynical and made jokes and we could not assess whether they could see these things or not, in the sense that they could see but could not really make descriptions. One of them took pictures, however the night before, the pictures that were taken did not show anything. Now, I must explain to you something. Firstly the objects were balls estimated at 8ft diameter, glowing between white and gold. My friends descriptions was &quot;glowing red&quot;. The chinese could not say what they were seeing and as I said their answers were not cohesive. There would be circa 9 balls in delta formation that did not change. As wide as 500-1000ft wide. Secondly there were about 5 delta formations and they were circling the IFC 1 building in Central Hong Kong, slowly.. It is I guess a 50  or more story building and the building has a light beaming skywards.The objects circled the beam within the height of the beam.Thirdly my friend is the Governor of the School, religeous and honest. I am a Director of a Corporation in HK. My friend does not want to talk about this incident due to it effecting his credibility as a school governor.I can honestly tell you under oath that these objects were intelligently controlled. I can vouch that no reports were made in Hong Kong at all and that is understandable as far as local culture is concerned. It happened a month after we were shown the UFO flap on TV which happened in Beijing and Shanghai. the objects were not the same.Not wanting to go too deep into it but for weeks afterward strange related issues took place as far as I was concerned, however they have not been happening since.Please also note this was not lights on a wing. Each ball was its own object in fixed formation with the others.They appear to resemble the film clips on the internet &quot;phoenix lights, which might be balls on a wing. these were not.", "Sighting of a formation of cigar shaped U.F.O.sWell, it happened at dusk when the stars were just coming out, myself and a friend were driving along the street on our way to eat with some friends at a nice pizzeria when my friend, who was driving the vehicle, brought the objects to my attention.  There were three of them, motionless in the sky, just visible over the buildings. They appeared to be very far away and gave the impression of being VERY large though I can&apos;t be certain of this.

The weather conditions were a clear sky, no wind, the sun was already beneath the horizon, and it was almost nightime.", "A triad of star-like lights, arranged in the shape of a miniature Aries, slowly passed from NW to SE in a possible formation.I was doing some naked-eye astronomy, including successfully finding M-13 and seeing epsilon Lyrae as a double, plus occasionally looking for satellites, when I saw at approximately SSE (160&deg;) azimuth 70&deg; what appeared to be extra stars to the north of Serpens Caput, near the southern end of Hercules.  They were arranged in a very flat triangle quite closely resembling Aries&apos; three brightest stars in overall shape moving from northwest to southeast.  The lead &apos;star&apos; corresponded to the one furthest from the other two and was easternmost of the triad.  It was the faintest at a maximum magnitude of about 4.0-4.5.  The central object was brighter by about half a magnitude and always was to the WNW of the leading object.  The final object was brightest at magnitude 3.0-3.5 and was always positioned almost straight west of the central object.  Compared to the other satellites I saw tonight, the triad moved more slowly, covering about 10&deg; in a minute.  The spread of the objects was about 1/4 the actual size of Aries, covering maybe 2&deg; in total width.  The objects passed below naked eye visability a few degrees above Sagittarius, possibly blocked by a thin cloud that was covering that part of the sky.  There was no deviation from straight-line flight, nor was there any changes of relative positioning of the three component lights.  Aside from some scattered clouds, the skies were steady with only minimal light polution near the horizon.  The Milky-Way was very clearly visible, and stars were visible to below 6th magnitude.  Seeing was excellent with virtually no turbulence (stars weren&apos;t twinkling).I also have a very old record of another sighting I made in 1979, coincidentally in the area of Ophiuchus by Serpens Caput, but that time the objects were definitely not satellites, as they stopped and reversed direction.  If I find the note, I&apos;ll make a separate report, as I recorded the date and time of observation when it had happened.", "A Round Bright Light the Size of a Beachball flied right over my brother and I heads before dissappearingMy brother and I was walking on Pelham Road around 8:00pm on a clear night along side the A&amp;P Shopping Center in New Rochelle when we both saw this bright light flying over the A&amp;P Shopping Center and right over our heads.  We must of had at least 4-5 seconds of analyzing this round light the size of a beachball flying right over our heads and then disappearing as we continue to look at the direction it was flying which was across the street from the A&amp;P.  It vanished right before our eyes as if they knew we had visioned their identity.  The object made no noise.  But my brother and I was just stunned about what we had saw and realizing that it just disappeared in front of our eyes.

As we waited for the light, both our eyes were caught by the gleam of an object that was about the size of a pea held at arms length, and at about 60 degrees above the horizon.  The object was at least several miles up in the atmosphere, as it was blocked out momentarily by clouds.  We were stopped, and we had the chimney of a house across the street as a point of reference.

The windows were half open and pushed out like shutters, perpendicular to the building, so I could see reflections in the window panes.  I was facing the mirror,  East, when I noticed a light out of the corner of my right eye.  My mind computed that I was seeing the moon reflected in the window, so I turned to check out the moon.  Instead I saw two lights in the distance, one heading West, the other heading East.  It took my mind a couple of seconds to understand what I was seeing.  I remember clearly thinking that I was seeing an airplane heading West on its descent to LAX, and also seeing it&apos;s reflection in the window, because they were heading right for each other.  But a second later I realized I wasn&apos;t, that I was watching two real, separate lights heading towards each other, one from the West, the other from the East.

I saw 4 bright lights ascend, and then hover in the air for approx. 5 seconds and fly away. The area is rather remote so I ruled out being commercial aircraft. I work at a military installion, NAS Oceana where we have many F-18 fighter aircraft flying. It was not F-18&apos;s because the only time they fly with their lights on is when they are on the ground taxiing, or when they are approaching the runway. I know there is a coast guard facility about 30 miles from the track, but I don&apos;t think what I saw could have been done by a helicopter. I have lived near an airport (CID, Cedar Rapids Iowa Municipal Airport) all my life, and never seen anything like I saw this evening. I can&apos;t say I&apos;m 100% sure it was something abnormal, but being around aviation my whole life, nothing I have ever seen was like I saw tonight. I was with two other friends, and one dismissed it as he figured it was just a small aircraft, but my other friend thought it looked quite out of the ordinary as well. I saw 4 lights, which where white in color, and I saw them moving across the sky at a fairly quick rate, and then they stopped for about 5 seconds and continued on their way. It looked to me as if all four lights were independent, but my friend who agreed that something weird had happened wasn&apos;t sure. I heard someone else say that they were Speed TV&apos;s helicopters covering the race, but I was at the track before the sprint cars were racing and they never passed over the track, and I never heard them or anything. The only possible explanation I can come up with was that they were F-18s flying in formation, but why they did they have their lights on? Why were they 80 miles away from their normal fly zone? Why didn&apos;t I hear the engines? How did they hover in the air for nearly five seconds without changing direction? The objects were going to fast for how close the lights were, but I didn&apos;t hear anything, and that was one of the main reasons I found what I saw very strange. Please get back to me to let me know what was going on. I&apos;ve always been a skeptic of UFO&apos;s but what I saw tonight was nothing like I have ever seen. Please let me know if there were any others that that thought it was strange, there had to be at least 1,000 people at the race tonight, I know other people saw it.", "2 flying objects with revolving red lights blinking from right to left slowly flying south in night sky.I went out into my backyard at 11:30pm to have a cigarette and noticed 2 objects with revolving red lights blinking from right to left -with my arm outstretched, these objects were 2 and 1/2 inches apart. They flew very slowly in a southernly direction towards the Mid-Cape Highway. I could not distinguish what their shape was, but they looked very close together and flew very slowly and made no sound whatsoever.I watched them until they were out of sight..8 minutes total.", "Spinning, brightly-lit flying saucer approached me from across the lakeI was outside at about 3 a.m. by myself at the Lake of the Ozarks in Laurie, MO. I started noticing a star randomly blinking light that was very obvious and bright. The sky then began to flash at random, like a camera, but much softer than lightning. I started noticing more activity within the stars, such as random blinking red and green lights as well as the flashing. My attention turned back to the original blinking star. It would flash, disappear, then flicker around frantically while alternating red and green lights. After about 20 minutes of watching this the star shot abrubtly into the sky at tremendous speed, and proceeded to come across the lake at the same incredible speed. Within about 15 seconds, I could see a flying saucer above the lake which looked to be about 350-400 feet above the ground. The main body of the ship was like an intertube ((sic)), wrapping around a circular dome on top of the ship. The intertube part had magnificent white lights, in vertical rectangular forms, surrounding it in an even pattern as it was rotating clockwise with the lights flashing in no particular pattern. The dome top was rotating the opposite direction as the intertube (counterclockwise) and had smaller, circular red and green lights surrounding it, which were also being lit up as it spun. The outline of the ship was very clearly defined by the extremely bright lights it was emitting. It&apos;s strange though, because the lights were something I had never seen before, as if it were an energy source we couldn&apos;t even comprehend, but the lights weren&apos;t too bright to look at, even though they were by far the brightest lights i&apos;ve ever witnessed. It&apos;s trajectory was perfect, flawless, as it came from the stars towards me across the lake. It was absolutely silent and moved at a rate I couldn&apos;t even describe, but was still very visible and clear as it moved. As it neared me I debated for a split second whether to stay out and see what happens or to run inside, because half of me was incredibly curious and in awe while the other half of me was more terrified than I had ever been in my life. I ran inside and woke my friend who accounts me being &quot;white as a ghost&quot; and &quot;frantically explaining what I saw&quot;. To me, the best way I can describe what I saw, is that the stars were camoflauging some sort of ship, which then proceeded across the lake towards me uncamoflauged and in perfect sight. I got the feeling that I had seen something which I shouldn&apos;t, and that the flying saucer was actually coming towards ME, and me specifically, from across the lake.", "Black rotating donut or ring shaped object drifting slowly across the skyMy wife, brother, mother and I were shooting birds in my mother&apos;s backyard with a pellet gun when I noticed something floating or drifting through the air.  My brother went inside to get two pair of binoculars to better see the object.  The object was black and donut or ring shaped and appeared to slowly rotate or spin on a horizontal axis.  You could clearly see the sky through the hollow center as it rotated.  The object moved in a roughly south to north direction and was visible to the naked eye for 5 to 10 minutes.  Using binoculars enhanced what we could see with the naked eye.  The craft had no lights, and did not seemingly emit or reflect any light.I tried calling the local law enforcement, the local airport (in which direction the object was heading) and the FBI in Quantico, VA.  My calls were either not answered or I was given the brush off and not taken seriously.The object was approximately 500 to 1000 feet off the ground and moved very slowly as if drifting through the sky.  To give an approximation of the speed in which it traveled, we watched the object cross the sky for between 5 and 10 minutes.  About 10 minutes after the object disappeared from view, a passenger jet was flying in a south to north direction (same as the craft), at a low altitude (a couple thousand feet, probably) and crossed the same area of sky that the craft did in about half a minute to a minute.", "White objects in the sky seen after the pictures were developed (Digital camera)I did not see the crafts at the time I took the photos.  I was taking a pic of the moon over my house on the first viewing. The second pic was taken over my roof on the 8th of May 2006.  I was taking a shot of a hawk to blow up and identify later.  I was surprized when I saw the white dot in the first pic, and after talking with my wife about what it could be, I decided to see if it would happen again. Although I know after many sighting etc. that things don&apos;t happen the way you might expect it. They usually are always different and quite the mind trip.  It is hard to explain what is totally alien to ones nowmal life.  Anyway I took the second shot and there in the pic is a white thing!  What it is I don&apos;t have a clue. But I do know something is happening as I see things like that pretty regularily, but I have never caught one on film.

I wish I could have seen these things with my eye at the time but I didn&apos;t.  It goes with my belief that they (who ever they are or whatever) are able to tell when I see them and hide or move when I try to focus on them.  I had thought that if I used mirrors and took a pic I might be able to fool them!  I think I found a way of confusing them.  My camera takes the shot milliseconds after I push the button.

After about three minutes, it suddenly disappeared. I pulled back onto Watson road and drove down to Broadway, where I stopped and made a right hand turn.  I then proceeded west on Broadway and kept looking at the general area where I had seen the copper colored light a couple of minutes prior.  The light suddenly reappeared, with another copper colored companion light, the second light being about ten degrees to the right of, and about ten degrees above the first light.  Both maintained a consistent intensity, but were brighter than the first appearance a few minutes prior.  I would estimate that they were hovering in the area of the Buckeye Hills Recreation Area, which is about eight or nine miles from where I pulled off of Broadway (at the intersection of Broadway and Apache roads) to observe them further.  Neither light made any movement. I saw at least one other vehicle on Broadway stop and pull over to observe these lights.  After a minute or so, the other vehicle continued on.  I called my wife at our nearby home and asked her to get our camera ready as I was going to come home and try to photograph these lights. I pulled back onto westbound Broadway and proceed to Miller road.  The entire time the lights were still visible. I maintained visual contact with the lights until I pulled into our subdivision.  I quickly retrieved our digital camera and drove back out onto Miller road, but the lights were both now gone.  I stayed in the area for about twenty minutes, but they did not reappear.", "Bright OrbApproximately 22:00 on or about June 15th 1992, Myself and my girlfriend had just returned to her home from a dinner date. We were sitting in a 1990 Geo Storm with a hatchback. As we were talking we noticed a light inside of the vehicle, it was so bright it seemed as though the sun was out. My first thought was that a street light had come on. There were no lights near the vicinity of the vehicle. The light shinned on us for a few seconds(maybe 20-30 seconds). After the light left the car we looked out the front windshield and saw a very bright shinning orb approximately 100 feet in front of us. The orb was about 30-40 ft in the sky, just above the trees. We watched for a few seconds as the orb moved around in the sky in front of us, then it took off at an amazing speed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The object was very high in the sky above the pacific ocean. The object hovered, from a long distance away, flashing light. It was certainly unidentified to our point of view, for it didn&apos;t conform to the any known technology such as a helicopter, airplane, or any other form of aircraft. It was a lighting object, in one place for a very long time flashing powerful, light flashes in a perhaps purposeful or random sequence from a long distance away. There were no sounds. It was like someone had a flashlight hovering over the pacific ocean 1000s of feet above the air and was turning it on and off quickly in a strange order. It had some kind of purpose.... it didn&apos;t appear to be any kind of aircraft or satelite of any sort. It was definitely well below the earth&apos;s atmosphere and it carried on, hovering a flashing, for at least 20 minutes. After the lights disappeared, jet airplanes, perhaps airforce jets flew by ahead in the sky very high up, no sound, assuming a Mach speed rate at least.

I layed down on the picknic table to watch the stars, the night was very clear and the stars were beautiful. Then as i was looking strait up I saw an interesting object that was moving slowly in the sky i thought it was a satelite. During my trips across the counrty i have seen many satelites and have even tracked them through websites. This object that i thought was a satelite was that high up, just a dot,it had a red tint and was definatly not in our atmoshere. After The object had caught my eye for about 5 seconds it did an amazingly fast j turn. Moved in the different direction for another few seconds and then dissapeared.

Out of habit I always stand up and watch them.  As I heard them coming I looked up into the sky facing southwest (they are approaching from the S. West heading N. East) when I saw a cloud that seemed in the shape of a horseshoe. It disappated, the US Military planes flew over - watched them - then looked back from where they came and found a triangle in the sky not moving.  I didn&apos;t take my eyes off of it.  Then, fast as ever it headed directly towards the North, stopped on a dime, stayed still for about 30 seconds.  Then moved back to it&apos;s first position just as fast.  Then in a blink of an eye it went South West super fast and a small white round sphere came from it and darted with it out of sight.  A plane was coming from the east then (commercial airliner) and as I watched it another triangle was in the Western sky not moving.

I believe my comments, along with some of the others, were: &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; &quot;..that triangular shaped thing? &quot;Do you see that?&quot; We were all mystified. This V-shaped object was extremely high up in altitude, higher than any plane I&apos;ve ever seen flying, and moved just under the moon, towards it, then disappeared. It had about 8 round Shapes (probably lights, though it was too high up for me to see the illumination of these lights).  There were about four round shapes on each limb of the &apos;V&apos; shape, and the whole shape seemed somewhat translucent. Many planes had passed through the crisp crystal-clear sky as I was viewing the moon for a duration of about 15 minutes. All of the other planes had very bright lights, took routine pathways and were easily identified as planes. This V-shaped, triangular object was quite different from the planes. It had more lights on it than a plane and the lights appeared transparent or translucent. And, it was so high up that it appeared as if it was the same distance as the moon!  Then, it disappeared  as it seemed to fly towards the moon. This triangular, V-shaped object was something else!  I remember thinking that possibly a V-formation of ducks could be traveling (but in the dark at night). Perhaps, we (Earthlings) weren&apos;t the only beings sending good vibrations to the Universe during the Harmonic Concordance that night??

I turned 180 degrees around and saw an object moving at a uniform distance above the roof of the house in front of me, about 2 ft. above the roof, coming towards me from the backside of the structure, and it occurred to me that it was maintaining a uniform distance above the roof as opposed to an arc over the house from the other side or a path that would lead it way past the house---it was &apos;hugging&apos; the roof as if on purpose. The object was a sphere, maybe 1 1/2X the size of a basketball, emitting a VERY bright blue light but a light that didn&apos;t hurt my eyes as I watched it come over the roof to stop about 5 feet above the ground maybe 15 feet in front of me, between the house and where I was standing. It emitted NO NOISE, NO ODOR, and no noticable spinning or other movement---it just hovered there---I then began to think---I believe that all of my mental processes had ceased as I watched it, from complete amazement and captivation, with no fear or any emotion. However, as soon as I began to &quot;think&quot; about it, this object went from right in front of me to over the horizon, perhaps 1/2 mile away up the hill I was on, and disappeared. Again, NO NOISE ans NO anything---it just &quot;left&quot;. As I ponder what I have seen, the most powerful part of my memory concerns the following: I believe that it would have stayed there in front of me until I began to &quot;think&quot; about it, and as soon as my brain kicked into gear, it took off at light-speed+ to get away from me, protect itself or whatever. It could differentiate between observation and analysis---these are just my feelings---no proof of anything, nor any harm done. I have decided to call it a &quot;probe&quot;, something sent to gather inormation as I saw how it was hugging the roof-line as though it had a useful &quot;range&quot;, and I would go farther to guess that what it &quot;records&quot; is brain wave activity or something like that---based on it&apos;s reaction to my &quot;discerning&quot; that it was there.

He asked excitedly if I remembered the video of the Mexico City sightings on tv?  (A UFO surrounded by numerous white lights in a formation in the sky)Yes was my answer, then he stated he was looking at that type of sighting from his home.  He described a craft with about 40 white lights in formation and gave me a local landmark for a reference point so i could confirm what he was seeing. I ran outside only to find a large tree was blocking the location of the sky this formation was observed. However, I continued to talk by phone, getting updates about the sighting. Within 5 minutes, I too noticed a bright white object about 30 degrees above the horizon just seemingly hanging in the sky to the east of my location, I confirmed with the original witness where I saw the object and concluded that we were viewing the same craft, (Except I could not see the dozens of starlike objects) very slowly drifting ESE.  Please note, that the sky condition at the beginning of this sighting was a high thin overcast with numerous breaks and as the observation continued to its conclusion, from west to east, a more solid condition developed.  I was so excited I forgot for about 10 minutes that I had a pair of binoculars in my car, so I ran for them hoping for a better look.  With them, I now could see dozens of white starlike objects moving independently but in formation around the craft. At this point I just wanted to concentrate on watching this and terminated the phone conversation.  As I focused on the 1 main craft, the largest object, I could see it was a saucer shaped white object, rotating, that seemed to change shape streching vertically with odd shaped structures on it.  It seemed to dart around at times, forcing me to search for it, eventually turning to the west and started to track towards me.  Most of the time it just appeared to hang in mid air rotating, but as it eventually moved closer I had better resolution on it, noting that the bottom seemed to have a yellowish glow. Also, several times I saw air carrier jet aircraft tracking N-S or NW-SE in the area above 10,000 ft. wondering can they see what I see?   I was so awed by this craft, appearing to change shape as it rotated, banking and wobbling at times.  At one point only, I saw what appeared to be brilliant crystal like lights on the parimeter of the craft. The craft eventually moved to a point about 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon when I lost sight of it in the overcast.

During the first part of the observation the group of lights passed through a portion of the sky that was brightly illuminated vertically by the exterior lights of a nearby large hotel and resulted in causing the lights to appear to shimmer (similar to atmospheric distortion) as they crossed the cone of light. Objects observed for a duration of approximately 45 seconds (from 90 degrees to approximately 45 degrees above the horizon)  Group intensity faded uniformly as objects moved in a Northerly direction until no longer visible  Approximately 3-4 minutes later a solo object (similar point of light but intensity 2-3 orders of magnitude lower) followed same track as first group but at a somewhat higher speed.

I went to bed without investigating... which seeems kind of odd, but maybe I was just frightened. I awoke in the morning to find one of the dogs had gone to toilet in the porch (rather than go out the night before). The next night (0100 on 06/06/06) at around the same time again, I went to the porch to let the dogs out and again, neither would go out. I stood on the porch and looked at the sky and broke wind. Immediately I thought &apos;oh... i don&apos;t want to frighten them&apos; and immediately, before I could even process this strange thought, saw a craft fly from above me to the North. It was in view for about a second... it wasn&apos;t going super-fast..... i saw enough of it to be able to recall it. It had several lights on it and was about the size of the moon in the sky.... maybe not so high up?  What&apos;s odd about this comical tale is that I appeared to know something was there before I saw it... I have absolutely no idea why I would have that thought enter my head after breaking wind!  Maybe nothing to do with this but Sonora has a lot of static electricity.... I am always getting shocked when I go shopping off of metal or material.

They ride thermal pockets, and this day was far too windy and to cloudy to see any Para gliders.  The object just cruised, it seemed as if it was slowly gliding back and fourth, because the V shape was clear, then it flattened out as was just a black line floating through the sky.  It had no noise at all.  It was more curved than a B-2, which has sharp angles along the back.  The floating V was smooth, and it had no glimmer at all, no glint from the sun.  I watched it ascend and get further away, until it was a black dot far away in the sky.  As it got further I saw a slightly orange/brownish glow around it, it looked almost like a sunspot in the eye, that&rsquo;s the only thing I can think of to compare it to.  That was about it, it wasn&rsquo;t fast like a jet, it was too big to be a para glider, and it was definitely not a bird.   A black boomerang shape just floating through the sky casually.((NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be quite credible.  We are familiar with the hang-gliders that frequently can be seen on the windward side of Tiger Mtn., and they probably would not venture as far away from that mountain as the east side of Lake Sammamish, and as far as Mt. Si.

It appeared to be very large,low in the sky and hovering.  The sky was mostly clear with a few clouds. There was no sound or other aircraft in the sky at the time. There was no metalic reflection from the object. The object did not appear to be moving (left or right) from my angle although it rapidly got smaller and smaller before it dissapeared.As the object was getting smaller a couple walked up from behind me and and asked what is was. So I know it had a very unusual appearance. I am just curious if anyone else reported any sightings in that area on the same day.", "Was blue did not move at all nere jupiter.The object that I saw stayed in one place.  It was near Jupiter.  It first looked like a star, but then I saw that it blue and it was blinking.  It was circular and did not move at all.  IT disapered after 20 min.  There where some trees around but it did not move at all so I could see it all the time.", "Blue, green, red and white flashing lights sitting in the sky in northwest Indiana sky for past two weeks.I don&apos;t know but I have been watching these things in the sky for the past two weeks.  First I thought they were helicopters flying around at night, but I couldn&apos;t hear any helicopters or see any spotlights.  Then I kept noticing them out every night.  There are sometimes 3 or 4 at a time in the sky and they just hang there.  They are blue, red, green and white flashing and pretty high in the sky, but if you even take a minute to look around you can see they are there.  I usually stay up most nights and like to look out at the sky and last night we came home late from a weather seminar and when I looked out the window I showed one to my husband.  He kept saying that what I am watching is airplanes in a holding pattern waiting to go to airports.  I kept telling him no way.  Saturday night I got the telecope out and tried to focus on this one &quot;thing&quot; in the sky and it took me a good 40 minutes to figure out how to use this telecope.  I finally got it in view and I&apos;m telling you I couldn&apos;t keep a focus on this thing to get a clear definite description.  I could see the lights of blue, green, red and white. It seemed like they were rotating in a circle or something.  Finally after 45 minutes this thing just moved behind a house roof in my view and then never appeared again.  My husband, after the 45 minutes, said yeah, that was strange, for it to be just sitting there for 45 minutes.  He is a big skeptic and a big logical chemical engineer.  He has an explanation for everything and he really was short for words.  Last night (Sunday night), we came home from a quick errand and when we got out of the car I started to point out to him at least five different spots in the sky where the same types of blinking lights were just sitting.  I am not insane.  He started to look around and I could tell he was a little uneasy about how many were just up there.  I said, well, I don&apos;t care if the aliens are going to present themselves to us, I just hope they aren&apos;t violent.  One other thing is one day last week when I was just watching the sky in my sunroom I noticed one that was sitting there.  When a plane (which I did know was a plane) came flying through the sky, this thing flew over rather quickly to where the plane was, stopped for a few seconds while the plane passed, and then just flew off. It was like it was checking out the plane or something. It is true though that if you take the time to look at the sky, you will start to notice things.  I have been taking pictures of chemtrails lately because they are really happening a lot lately over my town.  When I was coming back I heard a rebroadcast on coast-to-coast mentioning this site, so I decided to track it down and let you know that something is up there every night and it&apos;s not stars, and it&apos;s not planes.

We were standing outside in an area devoid of light so that the evening sky was clear.  We were in Winona, Minnesota.  It was a beautiful night without a cloud in the sky.A loose formation of 4 points of white light traveling from East to West were observed.  The 4 points of light were of equal intensity, remaining constant at about the brightness level of a bright star.  The 4 objects were separate, moving independantly from one another, seaminly to dart about in a loose formation, all traveling together.  As we stood near a tall industrial building, the objects were seen as they came over the roof of the building and then disapeared about 5 seconds later.The most unusual thing about the objects was the area around and in-between them.  The space around and between the objects of the formation seamed to ripple as though the light from starts in the background was being distorted.  It was like a large bubble of water traveling across the sky, distorting the light, we could clearly see through it but distorted and rippling.There was absolutly no sound, silent.  Our first impression was that the objects were close.  It then appeared that the objects were at very high altitude (or maybe not even flying near the earth) traveling at a very high rate of speed.  Then, as the objects flew to a point about 90 degrees from the initial sighting, they just vanished.I&apos;m 60 years old and have seen many strange things in life, but Ive never seen anything like this before.", "A orange,red triangle was flying fast forwards.aIt appeared in the sky,started flying forwards fast.It was orange and  a little red,it had the shape of a triangle.", "group of red and white flashing lights moving slowly through the sky for a period of at least 5 minutes.White and Red flashing lights.

The van was travelling at approximately 45 mph. I was sitting in the front seat and my view was through a clear windshield. The other passengers did not see the object.  I did not alert them to my sighting because there were family members who would have been skeptical or fearful.  I have extensive knowledge of aviation (general, commercial and military).

The object was to the West/Southwest of my moving position.  No sound or apparent movement was noticed during my observation. There was a row of pine trees along the roadside but the object was unobstructed for nearly ten seconds.  The object was approximately at an azimuth of 35 degrees. It would have been relatively smaller than the size of my thumb with full arm extension.As the van proceeded my view became obstructed by the pine trees.  When the van emerged from the tree line, the object was not visible.  The amount of time that elapsed between the tree line obstruction and our emergence was less than 10 seconds.  We would have travelled less than a quarter of a mile but still would have seen the object if it were relatively stationary to my viewpoint (i.e. a celestial body or high altitude aircraft.  I tried to look back through the side window on the driver&apos;s side but did not see the object.  I looked directly overhead and then looked out the passenger&apos;s side window.

 i tried to get someone from my roomate and my girlfriend to come out but they just got pissed and complained about getting up early for finals.  i called my best friend who said, &quot; whatever, i believe you, now stop calling and let me go back to sleep.&quot;  i called the neighbor who looked out the window and said the couldn&apos;t see anything.  well i explained that it was almost directly over the house.  about that time her baby woke up and she was fed up with that idea.  at this time i was going nuts.  i thought i was loosing it.  i was brought up in the lds religion and i have never believed in ufo&apos;s of any kind... untill i saw what i did.  i went to a friends house a few doors down and nucked and rung the door bell.  her roomate came down and i could barely get the words out.  it was baffling... i couldn&apos;t even begin to tell her what i was seeing.  so she came out and i pointed it out to her.  she saw the light, said she saw it move a little, then claimed it was a satalite.  i had to tell her what i saw.  the thing moved at incredible speeds and didn&apos;t slow to a stop, bot instantly came to a stop.  then she asked if i had smoked anything.  i realized this was going nowhere.  i let her go and tried to figure out what to do.  i tried calling my best friend again to see if i could barrow his camera because all i had was my cell phone and the video quality isn&apos;t the best.  he got mad again so i flipped.  i need someone to believe me and see what i am seeing.  i recorded almost 3 minutes of this light on my cell phone which was barely visible, but it is still there.  at this time i saw two more lights moving with every motion that the first light was.  it was definately a triangle.  i thought to call 911 and maybee get an officer out to my house to file a report or something.  as you could guess... bad idea.  the wierd thing was, i tried to dial 911, it failed?  kinda wierd.  so i tried to dial my neighbor again and then my best friend, and on top of it tried to send a text message to the person i was on the phone with to begin with.  i couldn&apos;t dial out.  i just got this phone this week.  so i run in and grab my old cell phone which still worked.  i dialed 911 and requested an officer to my house.  i had to call back again 10 minutes later to see if he was coming.  another five minutes passed and he showed up.  once again i could barely explain myself.  i paointed at it as it was moving and he wouldn&apos;t stop staring at me.  then he turned on the flashlight to my face and asked if i had consumed any lsd or if i was under the influence of anything.  at the time i wasn&apos;t (lucky me).  so he starred at it and couldn&apos;t tell if it was him moving from standing there looking almost straight up or if it was the light.  the next words out of his mouth was, &quot;wow. i saw a shooting star... hey, another one.  that&apos;s kinda odd.&quot;  i looked at him like; you&apos;ve got to be kidding me.  where the few shooting stars came from was exactly where i pointed to the ship.  i tried to say, they came from the ship in three different directions.  officer, you have to believe me.  i swear i am not crazy.  odly i said that line a whole lot throughout the night.  he got a call and said he had to go.  he tried to saw it was probably some airforce testing.  i could tell that he was in denial of what he had just seen.  said he had some where to be and left.  at this time it was around 2:30 am.  where does a sheriff have to be at that time, and why was he so jumpy.  none the less i was still going crazy.  no one honestly believed me.  i laid back on the hood watching the bright light almost twinkle to a red, then a green, then a blue, and then back.  all of a sudden i got this terrifying feeling throughout my body.  for some reason i was frightened.  it takes a lot to scare me, but when i was thinking why am i scared, because physically i wasn&apos;t but i had one bad feeling, i snapped to realizing that i was shaking and already starting to run towards my door.  i had to go somewhere.  i drive into city limits around 4:45 am.  there was a hince of light coming up over the palouse so i hurried into town.  the first place that i saw was conoco.  thankfully it was twenty four hours and i saw two employees inside.  the lady at the door mopping looked at me funny... probably the expression on my face.  i was hoping for someone that recognized me from shopping in there all of the time so they wouldn&apos;t be freaked out and would actually give me the time of day.  behind the counter in the back room was a newer employee that i had only seen once or twice before, but the person who had trained him the first night i saw him was a good aquantance and told him that i was a cool person and was in there all the time.  of all people, the only person that would recognize me and was around my age was him.  i tried to explain but nothing came out.  just come outside quick, and if you can think of anyone with a camcorder, call them.  he comes out of the store throwing on his jacket and i point to the sky.  he was like, what?  so i pulled him out of the front of the store to the side where there was less light and i stood close to him and pointed.  i didn&apos;t even have to say it, he said, &quot; wow, that bright light right there isn&apos;t it.&quot; he knew what i was talking about.  he didn&apos;t know what i meant but looked right where i was.  i told him now watch.  give it around thirty seconds.  i saw it randomly jolt to different sides and suddenly stop.  every time i was all, you saw that right?  he really couldnt tell if it was him moving from standing up or if it was his eyes grabbing focal points or what.  so i laid on one of the tables and told him, &quot;please, give me two minutes of your time and just lay on that other bench at stare at it.&quot;  he was supprisingly willing.  once again i had to state, i swear i am not crazy.  after about fifteen seconds of this thing moving around and me asking if he saw it... he took a wierd gasp of air.  the next thing i hear is, &quot; o my god... you arn&apos;t kidding are you.&quot;  finally.  i pointed out that there was dimmer lights on the other two points.  he struggled but adjusted and saw them.  as we bothe watched it move and come to frantic instant stops i notince you couldn&apos;t see stars behind it.  i followed the direction from the bright light on the front to the dimmer lights that formed the triangle and there was still blackness with no stars continuing down the ray that the lead light and the dim light formed.  together we both counted between 4 and 5 lights down each side.  we watched it move and saw by the way the lights moved together that the tip (wich i designated to the bright lead light) was wobbling not only side to side, but corresponding with the other lights, up and down also.  it looked like the lead star would randomly point down, then left, then right... by now i realized that this wasn&apos;t just the bright light that i saw before.  this was an outline of some sort of craft that seemed like it was struggling to hover in one place.  by focusing on the outline of the craft and not on the lights themselves, i understood that it wasn&apos;t just darting and stopping, it was turing from side to side, from front to back trying to counter the way it would randomly move.  i had to pull out my phone.  the second phone that i grabbed would dial out, but i hit the capture video button and the screen showed a brief flashing triangle and went to static.  as i am typing this, the video or the camera will no longer work on my old phone.  so one could dial out, and one could capture video.  i grabbed my new phone out of the car wich couldn&apos;t dial, but we stood there and captured 43 seconds of the triangle moving around randomly flashing lights.  once again, bad quality, but we could make it out when we watched in the dark.  i tried watching the few videos again a little while ago, but with sunlight up now, and no dark rooms in my house i figured i&apos;d look at it later tonight to show anybody and everybody who will give me the time of day.  with this mind boggling site over head we both laid back and watched the evasive movements.  out of the corner of my eye, the was quick movement.  there where random &apos;shooting stars&apos; in the sky every couple minutes.  and then none.  as the sun started to come up to the point that you couldn&apos;t see stars, we saw that there was only a handful of lights in the sky.  the one we were watching, and now, other movements just like the one before.  we tried to count how many actual clusters of lights there where instead of trying to make out all of the individual lights.  it was amazing.  he ran into the store to grab a coat and i waited at the door, then looked at the lady who was mopping when i walked in and told her she had to see this.  we all walked outside and looked up to a hazy dark gray sky with random stars in the middle of nowhere with comparison to the other stars.  i looked to the east and saw the light blue peaking out from the rolling hills of the palouse.  &quot;does anyone have a good video camere?!&quot;  no body will ever believe us.  we all laid watching the sky, with evasive manuvers from many different areas.  i saw a wierd formation with all of these.  for a couple seconds it seemed like all of those lights were one huge ship.  with the way they moved so scattered across the sky covering almost half the distance from horizon to horizon, i couldn&apos;t focus on them all at once because there was no longer an outline formed by the stars behind it.  i quickly dropped that idea when i saw the light furthest to the east move sharply towards the sunrise and stop where i could barely see it against the lighter sky.  it was wierd, there was no shape, there was no outline, just the lights that formed the triangle with the blue sky showing through as if it was only a few lights hovering there.  it sat still, darted a couple times, sat still again, and we looked away to see the other ones.  when we looked back we couldn&apos;t find it again.  now we all laid there and saw now less than 3 different triangular star cluster moving independantly.  there were random lights moving around behind these three wich were obviosly the closer ones, but we could&apos;t make out triangles.  just that main light that seemed to lead it.  we looked to the west to see if there were more, and against the western sky, wich was still dark as night, was a twinkling red light.  it went back and forth from red and yellow and white but mainly stayed a reddish twinkling color.  at first we just though it was a star, or maybe one of the nearby planets that reflects a red twinkle.  and it moved!  we watched that one now because the color on it was easy to spot and the contrast of the red on the black made it easy to depict motion.  it was very far away though and it was barely above the horizon, so we decided to lay back down on the benches.  as it got lighter, customers would come for gas or for the convienance store and on thier way out, i couldn&apos;t help it, but i got their attention and pointed to the sky which seems to come out a lot better than my words.  some people would walk over tawards me and ask what about the stars.  as it got lighter, these were the only stars in the sky.  i told many people who were curious to just watch for at least 30 seconds, that&apos;s all i ask.  a couple would say they really had to get going, but a couple of them stood there with me, watching.  costumers would leave and come and a couple would be interested but not believe or whatever they were thinking, but me and the conoco employee stayed out on those benches slowly watching the clusters dissapear into the daylight untill the only one left in the sky was the first one that we had seen.  it was geeting light comming up on 5:30-6:00 in the morning and with clear skies, there was an odd haze, or fog, or maybee a random cloud cluster.  slowly the stars forming it&apos;s shape vanished in the light, and the last light wich was the first that we saw blended in the the daylight.  it was one long night.  there are a handfull of us who can&apos;t deny what we saw, and a couple breif video clips on my phone to prove it.  i hope that in the next couple days i find of other people who saw this.  i&apos;ll tell you what, i know exactly where i will be tonight between 1 and 6.  out on the hood of the car, hoping i see them again.", "bright u.f.o. seen floating across the sun and disappeared behind a cloudMy friend and I just got out of school and went too go pick up my friends sister.

Then there was a bright red light in a consecutive pattern. Then they dis appeared. Then came the rest of the group (9 crafts) which came over at about the speed of 30 to 35 km per hourthey were about 500 meters long but these did not blend into the sky as well as the first group. Then 8 of the group disappeared but the 9th stayed and after a minute or two it landed. Then I and the other 7 people in my hiking group went to go see what was going on.

They look to us more like lanterns, of some variety.  Just a guess, on our part.  PD))I took a 9 min video of more than 25 lights traveling E over Phuket Island, ThailandThe following is my testimonial to the events that took place during a 3 week vacation trip to Patung Beach located on Phuket Island in southern Thailand, on March 22, 2006 at approximate 11:30pm. The day started with less than favorable weather conditions, raining heavily throughout the day and into the early evening.  Later in the evening the clouds broke up and the night appear clear with a salting of small cumulus clouds and what appear to be a high layer of haze above the clouds making it difficult to see any stars and the moon was not in sight. At approximately 11:30pm, I had walk out on to the balcony of my second story room at the Tropica Hotel and while looking in the direction of Na-Kha-le bay (N by NW) I saw a dark red (almost ox blood colored) light rise up above the tree line heading in the direction of Rang Yai Island (E by NE).  My first impression was that that light was a helicopter of sorts but my curiosity rose a little after realizing that the light was not blinking.  Within the next 5 seconds a second and a third light appear with the same dark red coloring, rising above the tree line, nearly in line with the first light. This seamed odd to me so I quickly walked back into my room and grabbed my Canon ES50 video recorder in an effort to get a closer look.  Within the approximately 30 seconds it took me to grab my video recorder and turn it on, 5 of these lights had appear, all heading the same direction mentioned above, but now the color of the lights had changed to white. After about 5 minutes, over 20 of these lights had appeared still traveling in the same direction, on an incline of about 30%. It was clear that once they reach about the center of the island, just over the Kathu Cascades range, they began to ascend upwards at a near vertical angle.  While I was recording, some lights would pass behind the branches of the trees in the hotels court yard, obstructing their view only briefly.    I found it difficult to zoom in on a cluster of them without loosing focus.  Finally, after trying several times to get a close up, I decided to pan down into the court yard of the hotel with hopes to get the camera to focus and it appeared to work. I put the camera on pause for a brief moment to move to the other side of the balcony to get a better angle.  I saw, what appeared to be the last light quite some distance from the others and in a clear patch of sky without any obstructions from branches.  I quickly zoomed in on the single light, which at this point was a dark orange color.  The light took on a triangular shape and moved as though it were traveling in an &lsquo;s&rsquo; pattern but still holding the same general direction as the other lights.  I tried to zoom in more but lost the image.  As I zoomed out, the craft reappeared and then spun in a clockwise direction, disappeared for much less than a second then 2 small white lights appeared just slightly ahead of where the craft disappeared.  The two lights joined and created a burst of white light that began to gyrated until it formed a circle.  The next minutes of video taping was of this singular light pulsating from the center core at a very rapid rate. I found I was getting rather fatigued as my hand began to shake from trying to hold camera still for the entire course of this 9 minute video.  I zoomed out from the singular light and paused the camera.  In the next minute, I quickly exited my room and headed to the pool area in an effort get a better view.  Once I reach the pool the lights were gone.  I rushed back upstairs to the balcony in my room to see if they were still viewable from that angle but found they were not in sight. I went to the bar at the hotel and to other bars on Bang-La Road asking others if they had seen these lights.  Evidently, no one had.  I scanned the local papers the next day for any", "Yellow-orange sphere with a long green tail.One glowing yellow-orange sphere with a long green tail, moving northeast-to-east in a slight descending arc.  The tail got shorter in three distinct movements, and then the whole thing disappeared.  The sky was clear and the object was too high up in the sky to have been hidden by any trees.  At first I thought it was a meteor, but the angle of the arc was too slight for it to have crashed down at the time it vanished.  I have been unable to find any report of meteors in the area that night, and it was too big not to have been noted.  (Due to the distance/altitude, I&apos;m not sure what the size of it was, but I&apos;d compare it to holding a penny up at arm&apos;s length.)", "4 white objects west of SeattleI was at the intersection of Broadway and Olive St. on Capitol Hill in Seattle, looking west at the Olympic mountains at about 9:45am.  I spotted (4) objects moving south at a steady speed.  They were traveling in a line, one after another, closely spaced and evenly spaced.  They were bright white in color, although due to their distance from me I could not discern their shape.  In spite of their distance from me, however, they appeared to be quite large.  The (4) objects did not appear as points of white, but rather were larger and each had a horizontal dimension slightly greatly than their vertical dimension.  They were traveling close enough to the ground that they were passing in front of the Olympic mountains.  The appeared to me to be traveling along the tops of the foothills just in front of the Olympic mountains.  They were traveling level or nearly level;  they did not appear to be gaining or losing elevation. I am reporting the above because I have not been able figure what they may have been -- they are unidentified to me.  I am not assuming them to be alien craft, but I am not ruling it out either.

We took a break and observed many birds flying above the trees and river. At that time I noticed a circle of four disc (possibly metallic or possibly reflecting back light). These discs were above the few clouds that were present that day. I called to her to look at what I was seeing and she saw it immediately. At that time another disc entered the formation from the West. We just watched in awe. They continued to circle in perfect formation and then one by one they shot off to the West and seeming to go upward until out of site. This lasted approximately 3 minutes. The circle appeared to be about the size of a basketball and the discs were about the size of a quarter. This was above the level of clouds as there was a thin cloud that the discs flew above as they left the formation.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

On July 13th or the 14th 2003 around between 8-8:30 pm in Licking county, Ohio, I walked outside my home and the very first thing I did was look up into the sky like I always do to see anything out of the ordinary.This time I got my wish! As I walked down my porch steps,I looked up. Then I turned to my left towards my dog,I pet him everytime I go outside.That&apos;s when I looked up again as ususal,This time I saw an airplane up in the sky.It wasn&apos;t one of them small 4 passenger but one of them huge airliners that carry abut 100 I suppose?...Anyway,I have never in my life seen an airplane fly so low to the ground before and that alone caught my attention right away.If I wanted to I could have counted all the windows on one side if I felt like it but seeing it so low below the clouds and closer to the ground was more interesting than that. As the plane was flying on by,I noticed this tiny white dot come out of nowhere up from behind it.As the plane was moving south bound this white dot came into better view for me.To make a better description what I saw, This white turned into a 3-layer grey oval shapped ball of light.It literally followed along side this huge plane for about I&apos;m guessing 10-15 miles?I estimated how long a mile is on the ground then took that measurement in the sky and calculated there.I watched them both fly off till I could no longer see either of them.This grey oval shaped ball of light,I&apos;m guessing very hard here,was about 1/4 % size of that plane itself.Uusually I can hear airplanes,helicoptors in the sky,even many miles before they are even close to my area.This plane that was side-tailed by an unknown flying object was about 2-3 miles from the ground up.And I heard NO sound what so ever period.The only reason I even happen to witness this event was bacause I am always looking up in the sky dan and night for anything out of the ordinary,if it wasn&apos;t for my interest in ufos and aliens,I would have probably not seen none of this. This grey ball of light never moved out of track while near the plane.It stayed in a very straight line all the way along till out of sight.the distance between the ball of light and the plane was probably between 70-100 feet.neither the plane or the object made any sound.My strong opinion that the grey ball of light wasn&apos;t a missle cause the object would have smacked right into the plane therefore causing an explosion,There was no impact and the object was like I said a few good feet away.It wasn&apos;t no cloud cause I have never seen in my life a cloud so round,grey or actually move so perfectly in a line like that,plus at speed? I don&apos;t think so.Not to mention that day there were hardly no clouds in the sky to begin with.Myabe a couple here n there but that&apos;s it.It wasn&apos;t no shadow cause there was no ground to bounce off from and the plane was no where near the shape of this object. Basically that day I saw for the first time an actual ufo.And there was even an airplane right along side with it to know for sure that object wasn&apos;t an airplane!((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

From 1973 to 1976 as an M.P. (Military Policeman) working undercover for the D.S.T. (Drug Suppression Team)  C.I.D. (Criminal Investigation Division) in Germany.  Basically, I traveled throughout Germany, wearing civilian clothes and pretending I was a former soldier that now resided in Germany dealing narcotics.  My codenames were Porkchops or Frisco, depending on what part of Germany I was at.  I went after what was known as the &quot;Khaki Mafia&quot; that originated in Vietnam.  The perpetrators recognized me, because I was known to wear a black trenchcoat, sunglasses, dark clothes and at the time I was sporting a beard and mustache.   But, before this excitement took place, I was in Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, in 1974 on a training exercise.  One night, two other soldiers and I were in Columbia, South Carolina, checking out the sights and we looked in the sky and saw 6 glowing blue discs in formation.   As we watched the UFOs dispersed in erratically zig zagging movements and disappeared quickly.

It was much longer along the back side than it was to the tip.  It&apos;s size to me was the most impressive,  I can only guess but it was very close to me and seemed to be at least a mile wide at the base of the triangle, which was the back of it and the longest part.  It had a dim,circular light at the tip and also on the right and left sides of the base of it.  No other lights and not a sound could I hear from the thing.  It was moving at first, it seemed, about 10-15 miles an hour at about 100ft in hight.  Then as it passed me it began to increase in speed, at first gradually, then seemed to accelorate beyond possiblity and was gone. Never a sound and the amazing thing was I was never scared at all which seems to me very odd.  Oh yea the thing was aparently black but I&apos;m not sure I could of seen a color it was so dark.

My girlfriend told me when we got back to the apartment that she never saw my tail lights go out and her phone never rang.  I put the phone down and saw another light cross over my car from S to N.The lights were white, steady and round.  I was in moderate traffic so I wasn&apos;t able to give the lights more than a glance so I couldn&apos;t estimate speed or altitude.

It apparently was not received, as it is not in the website database. Since that submission, my recollection of the event has improved and therefore changed somewhat. This is a recollection of a sighting of unknown lights in an unusual pattern sometime in the early 1970&apos;s, perhaps 1973 or 1974. I have tried to remember details and circumstances as accurately as possible. I am no aviation expert but I have grown up around aircraft, living near Reid-Hillview Airport, well before it was purchased by Santa Clara County and became a FSS, and I was acquanted with the former owner, his daughter and her family, as well as others who worked there or had tiedowns or hangars, so I know more than a little bit about aviation. There are some explanations for those who are unfamiliar with aviation as well as to explain why I do not believe that the lights belonged to any ordinary aircraft. In the early 1970&apos;s I was at home during a late spring or summer evening and looked up to see nine orange/amber lights arrayed in three equilateral triangles which were themselves arrayed as one large equilateral triangle. Each orange light was at the point, or vertex, of each small triangle which themselves were at the points of the larger triangle, nine lights in all. The night was warm and the smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen. There was no moon. Typically, above the smog, I am told there is a strong Westerly wind in the evening and into the night. The array maintained perfect equilateral triangles as it headed roughly north-northwest in a straight line, It appeared to move slowly, like a light airplane but seemed to be silent. I watched the lights closely for some time, from when it was almost overhead, as it passed overhead and then was lost in the smog and reflected city lights somewhere over the north part of the city, trying to see the outline of some object and watching the lights to see if any moved independently, as well as for any lateral drift. I never could see any object, just the lights, none of the lights moved relative to the others and no lateral drift was observed. I estimated it could be seen for at least fifteen minutes. The array was unusual as no navigation lights were seen: No red, no green, no white, no strobe or flashing lights of any kind, just steady orange/amber lights, which I realised later had the same color as low-pressure sodium street lights. I know what aircraft look like in the sky at night, as I lived next to a small civil airport at that time and lived directly under the southbound departure route for the city&apos;s major airport and I often watched aircraft go over, trying to guess what kind it was. Sometimes, because of the smog, all that can be seen are the navigation lights. I have never seen such lights on any aircraft before or since. It occurred to me that the aircraft might have been some of the new SR-12&apos;s recently made public but the lights never moved relative to each other, they never drifted from course and there were no navigation lights, as would be required near the airports under VFR rules. There was no engine noise. At the time, jet engines were still quite loud and some DC9&apos;s, 727&apos;s and 737&apos;s, as well as DC8&apos;s from Mexico were still using turbojets instead of the quieter fans. Neither turbine nor piston engines were heard. The array was viewed through smog which reflected the streetlights so there was only a view of the orange/amber lights. No solid object was seen, no reflections. The smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen, neither could any aircraft from either airport. But somehow those lights could be seen. Because of the smog,  the exceptionally slow speed and the lack of any visible shape I could not determine the altitude or the size of the object or objects attached to the lights. I asked around to see if anyone else had seen the aray of lights; no one had. The FAA and the local newspaper both pointedly expressed their lack of interest in the event. It remained forgotten until I saw another very unusual sky object while in Monterey.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

But what got to me was the way it moved off balance and at a remerkable speed.

Every nite we went on the balcony,3rd floor of the 3 storey building, to look at the moonrise and nite sky. My husband was on the balcony and as soon as I joined him, I looked out and saw a flashing lite off to my left coming off the point at Cape Canaveral which was about 10:00 with due East being 12:00 and about 30-40 degrees above the horizon. I of course assumed it was a plane but immediately noticed that the light was flashing more like a strobe lite. I was amazed at its speed, faster than any aircraft but slower than if it had been a meteorite; it also had a red flashing strobe light appearance simultaneously with the bright white strobe flashing.I ran downstairs to watch it at ground level. From the time I spotted the light, ran downstairs, and saw it again, it had moved across the horizon to where the moonrise had been the previous nite, approx at 2:30 with 12:00 being due East, and then was out of site. My husband had stayed on the 3rd floor and saw what I had seen and I rejoined him. I then spotted another lite, identical to the first and starting in the same location. There were 2 more following behind it for a total of 4 including the first one. The subsequent three followed the exact path across the horizon with the same incredible speed and flashing bright white, red and occasional green strobe-like lights.  Then there appeared in the south east of the horizon an orange glowing orb  and the 3 rapidly moving flashing objects disappeared into the glowing orb. The orb then faded and an object of numerous colors came from this area and sped off at a high speed in a westerly projectory over the coastline and disappeared. My hushband pointed out that the lights seen resembled a frequency of brightness and color as seen from gaseous ionization. Satellite Beach is maybe 15 miles South of Cape Canaveral; I first saw the flashing objects off of the Cape. Three days later, on April 20th at 4:27pm, NASA launched an Atlas rocket, which we also saw from our condo location.", "2 bright streaks of light with dark object above them observed in clear, cloudless sky.We were driving Highway 101 northbound, from Redwood City towards San Mateo, nearing the time of sunset, approx 8:25pm.  It was a very clear, cloudless sky.  I noticed what initially appeared to be two, parallel &quot;streaks&quot; of bright light, slightly angled to the left of what would have been a vertical position. When I first noticed the streaks, they appeared to be moving downward.  This only lasted a second or two, and then the streaks appeared stationary. I said to my husband (who was driving) &quot;Look at that...what do you think that is?&quot;  Neither he nor I could come up with an explanation of what it could be.  It was an interesting phenomena, because we both were expecting as we drove closer that whatever the object was (airplane, cloud, etc) would soon become apparent. As we drove closer, the bright streaks of light dimmed considerably, eventually becoming just a greyish color, and we wondered if it could have been the setting sun which was illuminating these two streaks.  As we approached our exit, I could just make out a solid dark object above these streaks, and it was obviously much farther away than I had originally thought.  Due to the distance, I cannot describe the shape of the object, other than that it was wider side to side than it was top to bottom. It did not appear to be completely smooth, but to have some shape to it. The object and streaks did not move, rotate, etc. following the few seconds after which we originally saw them. The dark object above the streaks was not lit in any way.

As I looked out I saw a yellowish white light with a silver blue light above it and a red one below.  They moved as if all one object but the two smaller lights (blue and red) were some distance above and below. I think I saw connecting arms from each small light to the middle light but cannot be sure.  It traveled from W to E and took about an hour or more to disappear in the E.

It was a stunning sight and I hurredly called it to the attention of my companion. The formation proceeded in the direction of VEGA, passed to the west of it, veered off to the East and disappeared from our view. The formation was about the size of my hand held at arms length. It was impossible to determine its height. There was no sound at any point. It consisted of about 6-8 indivdual lights. The lights were not spots, but vertical with a slight bulge in the middle. The formation was somewhat triangular, vertical on its left side and sloping slightly outward on the right side. It was traveling wide end or bottom forward. There was no variance in spacing or intensity of the lights nor variation in speed. The night was clear with no haze or cloud cover. The phenomena appeared as if it could have been produced by a searchlight but there was no cover upon which it could have been reflected and no variation in the light as would be seen if on cloud or haze cover. The light was soft and about a 1 in intensity. It did not reappear. There was no airplane traffic in the area prior to, during, or until some time after the sighting.

I observed it very carefully and listened to see if it was some sort of aircraft.  It was moving much too slowly to be an aircraft, no noise, and there were no blinking lights.

At first I thought it was a plain but it was far to close not to see any wings or lights.  as we rounded a bend in the road it disappeared behind some trees, but when we got to where we should have seen it it was gone. On the way home I saw it and the trucker next to us seen it to. we passed the same bend in the road and it was gone.  The trucker almost hit a small truck turning in frount of him and his trailor swong to our side of the road and we almost hit him. About 10 secounds later it appeared right in frount of us and as we were watching it changed to grey then black and sort of faded away. there were no clouds around it and very few in the sky.  It was about the size of a mini van. It made no noise and was just floating there.  If it was a bloon won&apos;t it have still been there.  I know it sounds crazy and I wouldn&apos;t have belived it unless I seen it myself, but it was there as real as me siting at this computer.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

One night, she came running back inside the apartment screaming.  I asked her what was wrong.  She said that a UFO was hovering 200 feet above her head.  I didn&rsquo;t see anything.  I noticed she was hysterically crying.  I drove her to the Sacramento Sheriff&rsquo;s Department and they had her use their phone to call an 800 number to call Dr. Allen Hynek of the Chicago, Illinois Bureau of UFO Investigations.  Dr. Hynek sent us some forms to fill out, so she could describe what she saw.  Dr. Hynek later called me and asked what I was doing.  I told him I was watching &quot;Dick Van Dyke&rsquo;s The Comic&quot; on TV.  He asked what happened when Helen was screaming outside, I said the TV went on the blink, it displayed static and I was trying to fix the TV, when I heard her screaming.  He told me that when UFOs hover nearby, that they cause disturbances on car engines, TVs and radios.  This was a normal occurrence.  Later I learned that 2 other people in Sacramento saw the same UFO in two different locations and it was reported in the Sacramento Bee.From 1979 to 1986 I was back in the U.S. Army.  This time I joined Military Intelligence and I was stationed at PIC-K (Photo Interpretation Center, Korea).  This time my code name was &quot;Hollywood or Joe Hollywood,&quot;  I wore a black suit now and I was clean-cut.  I kept the sunglasses though.   My job as a 97 Bravo (Intelligence Analyst) was to work with Image Interpreters in identifying targets in North Korea and Red China, such as T-72 tanks, etc.  I would create what is called a &quot;sitmap&quot; pinpointing targets discovered by Image Interpreters, that studied reconnaissance aerial photographs.  I would categorize certain photos. We would go on what is called a &lsquo;hot run&rsquo; from Seoul, Korea, (Yongsan Barracks) to Osan Air Force Base.  The vehicle would display a placard that indicated that the vehicle could not be stopped for any reason.  There was a combination lock on the trunk of the vehicle and a combination lock in the suitcase inside the trunk,  the driver and myself would have &frac12; of the combination to open the trunk and the suitcase.  We would place the hotrolls (film) into the suitcase and head back to Seoul.  During my time as an Intelligence Analyst I categorized 6 photos taken by reconnaissance satellites of what appeared to be UFOs.  The UFOs moved on their own accord, as if they were guided by some kind of intelligence.  Therefore the 6 photos were significant by Military Intelligence.  The photos moved up the intelligence chain from Military Intelligence to DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) to CIA (Central Intelligence Agency).  From there, I don&rsquo;t know where the photos went.  While at PIC-K, I worked with Air Force Intelligence, Navy Intelligence, DIA, CIA, Marine Recon, US Army (Green Beret) Special Forces, 101st Airborne, US Army Rangers, 82nd Airborne, Delta Force, Navy Seals.  It was necessary for us to work closely with certain elite military groups.   Another strange photo I once saw was given to me to categorize.  It was a photo of an American POW in Vietnam, taken in 1981.  The photo went into a metallic box with a combination lock and disappeared up the intelligence channel.  The spooks (intelligence personnel) I worked with, would never discuss UFOs.  Most spooks belonged to some sort of secret society, most were Freemasons and I was a Rosicrucian.  When I departed Korea, I signed up for the 82nd  &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot; Airborne and Special Forces training and they were ready to send me to Ft. Gordon, Georgia and Ft. Bragg, North Carolina and I was called to do a special assignment.  I received an H identifier and became an Army instructor and taught the Soviet Threat for OPFOR (Opposing Forces).  I wore a Russian uniform, ski mask, black gloves and talked with a fake Russian accent and called myself &quot;Corporal Dowbowski.&quot;  I would instruct the Soviet Threat, teaching the W.E.F.T. (Wings, Engine, Fuselage and Tail) on Soviet Aircraft, kill zones on Soviet aircraft and land roaming vehicles, the use of many Soviet weapons from the AK-47 to the SVD Sniper Rifle in which I was proficient.  During my time with OPFOR, I learned from Intelligence circles, that the Russian KGB also knew and were aware of what exactly UFOs were and where they came from.To this day, I don&rsquo;t know the answers to the UFO mystery, but hopefully one day our Government will disclose what they know to the public.", "ufo I seen in washington pa.I was sitting on my patio at 8 pm getting some cold air when i looked back by my garage.

At the time of the sighting I was facing east. Through the windshield, I saw four or five greenish lights that appeared to be fairly low to the ground, maybe two-hundred to three-hundred feet high. The encounter lasted only maybe 2 seconds, if that. However, from what I saw it appeared that the lights were in a stright line as if attached to some larger object. As I saw them, it appeared that the object on which the lights were mounted was spinning as it moved. I only derive this conclusion from the way the lights moved across the sky. Soon the lights were on the north side of the seemingly triangular shaped object, and they all merged (on a two dimensional plane). After this the lights disappeared and after watching for another few seconds or so, the lights never reappeared. I drove quickly one more block to my house and quickly got out and looked in the direction that the craft was moving, but I didn&apos;t see anything. My sister, who was in the car with me, also saw the object. I think she may have seen it a little longer than I did. All I said to her was, &quot;Woah.&quot; I didn&apos;t describe what I had seen to her, to make sure she had seen the same thing that I did. She also described seeing the lights in the same way that I did. Although my sister did see the object, she did not have her glasses on and her sighting might not be trusted. I, on the other hand, have had a vision screening within the last month or so and got a result of perfect vision.", "Object trailing a commercial airplane.At about 14:00 my daughter, wife and I were looking at at high flying aircraft (commercial) and following the fuel trail on the clear sky. We then realized there was another object, smaller in size but same altitude (20K feet)flying a little behind and above the airplane. The type of movement and flying pattern was different than that of the airplane.  It looked more steady, perhaps slower speed.  As the airplane continued towards a north-easterly direction, the object drifted more towards the southeastern direction.  We tohught it could have been a helium balloon that had gotten loose.  However, at the same time a smaller airplane (private plane) flew around the same direction as that of the object and then we realized this strange object was definitely a lot higher and could not possibly be a small balloon as we could see it on its steady course and round shape (it looked white from our point of view). As my wife and I (and small daugther ) kept our eye on the object, it suddenly stopped and it &quot;sat&quot; there for a few seconds.  It then vanished.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The craft was only visible as a orangeish reddish light about the size of two large stars. I watched it for about ten seconds or so and looked down for about 5 seconds. When I glanced back up the craft had covered a pretty good amount of distance, became twice as bright, three times as large, and appeared to be shining a broad flood light just south of my location, which I found very odd. As I continued to watch I noticed low hanging, wispy clouds which accounted for the distinct appearance of the &quot;beam&quot; of light, but now the light spread was facing the rear of the craft. The object now looked like a comet without the long tail. At this point it now had my complete undivided attention, which is good because the next event made me cast all doubts as to weather or not this was a publicly known craft. In a odd way the craft had now either exploded or accelerated in  a completley different direction, the best I can describe is NNW (45* difference in original path) and about 10* higher. When it did this, a very distinct shockwave caused the surrounding clouds to curl on themselves, similar to a plane breaking the sound barrier but in a much larger fashion (no noise at all for the entire duration of sighting). When this happened, the appearance of the craft slowly faded out. From the time I looked back up at the craft to the time it was no longer visible was about 50 seconds or so. I have seen many many meteors, 1 meteorite and a couple of balzacks (the term I believe is given to a meteor exploding in the atmosphere, occasionaly audible) and as far as my experience has taught me, this was niether a rock nor known plane. Perhaps it was a satillite re-entering but I was under the impression that those are brighter and not nearly as slow moving. This craft did not at any time leave a debris trail as such other objects tend to do.

Unusual White LightsIncident Report:  Unexplained Lights Location of Incident:  Southwest of Sherman County Roads 55 and 16 Date of Incident:  January 18, 2006 Witness:  Patrol Deputy; Sherman County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office  At 1943 hours on the above date, I was on routine patrol in the area of (southwestern) Sherman County Road 55, westbound, and approaching the intersection of County Road 16.  There are no street lights or other light sources in that area, as it is quite remote, with only a very few residents living in the area.As I proceeded west on Road 55, my attention was drawn to my left, to approximately a ten to eleven o&rsquo;clock position, by unusual lights, which appeared almost instantaneously, which I caught out of the corner of my eye.  The lights appeared to be five orange fire-like balls, which appeared to be on the same horizontal plane.  As I perceived movement out of the corner of my eye, but the lights were not moving when I looked at them directly, my impression was that the lights had traveled in a left to right, or east to west fashion.  The lights hung in the sky, approximately 10 degrees off of the horizon, clearly stationary, for approximately five seconds, before each of them blacked out simultaneously.  I immediately pulled my patrol car over to the side of the road.Within approximately twenty seconds, I observed one light, starting just above the level of the first row of lights, illuminate, followed by a series of four additional lights that illuminated over the course of perhaps two seconds, and in equal intervals.  I estimate these lights to have been approximately 15 to 20 degrees off of the horizon.  I could observe no smoke trail, as one would expect with high intensity military type flares, and noted the lights were equally spaced, which would be quite difficult to do with precision, with ground launched military flares.  These lights remained illuminated for perhaps five seconds, and again, as with the previous lights, shut off in unison.  This synchronicity in the illumination patterns seemed, to my thinking, to eliminate flares as the source, as flares would burn out at different times.I waited in that location for several minutes, but observed no additional lights in the area.  Additionally, I was monitoring the Renner Field CTAF/Unicom Frequency, as well as the Aircraft Emergency frequency, and overheard no unusual traffic on those channels.  My impression was that the lights were quite far away, possibly in the area of Cheyenne Wells, Colorado, but could not make any determination as to distance whatsoever.After seeing this anomaly twice, I telephoned Goodland Police Officer [WITHHELD], whom I knew to have an interest in such oddities.  Officer [WITHHELD], who was off duty, listened incredulously to the observations I had just made, and stated that he would be en route to my location from his residence in Goodland.  That call was placed to Officer [WITHHELD] at 1946 hours, and lasted between one and two minutes.While I awaited the arrival of Officer [WITHHELD], at 1955 hours I telephoned the National Weather Service Field Office in Goodland, and spoke to the meteorologist on duty.  I did not catch his name, but I explained to the meteorologist who I was, and that I had just observed some very unusual lights, which I estimated to be south of the Town of Kanorado, but that I could not estimate a range at which I observed the anomalies.  I asked if the weather radar had picked up any unusual activity in the area from Kanorado south in the vicinity of the state line, and probably into Colorado.  The NWS employee checked the previous twenty minutes of radar data, and stated only that &quot;There is one anomalous return south of Kanorado on one pass, but that&rsquo;s not unusual.&quot;  I asked if the NWS radar was calibrated to pick up aircraft, or if it eliminated aircraft from the data collected, and he said that routine air traffic was not detected by the radar.At 1958 hours, I received a call from Officer [WITHHELD], asking to confirm my location, and I then moved to the intersection of County Roads 17 and 55 to make his finding me somewhat easier.  From that location, I could still observe the area of the sky in which I had observed the unusual lights.  Officer [WITHHELD], arrived at my location at 2003 hours.At the time of the arrival of Officer [WITHHELD], we observed what we regarded as unusual lights, although they were quite small.  The lights appeared to be consistent with those of small aircraft as far as size, but the FAA required colors and flashing lights were not present.  These unusual lights consisted of steady-on white lights, and we noted an unusual lack of known air traffic in the area.  These lights seemed to begin directly south of our location, and continued to the area directly above us, and west for some distance.  As it was a clear night, numerous light and commercial aircraft could be observed in the area, but none were in the vicinity of the white lights we were observing.  I began checking all aircraft frequencies at that time, and found nothing unusual in any aircraft radio traffic.  However, it was clear that none of the &quot;known&quot; aircraft were in the area of the unusual white lights.These white lights appeared to be moving, largely in a southwesterly direction, but I did observe a small group of three, just above the horizon, which appeared to be spinning in a counterclockwise circle, as if it were three separate aircraft circling at an air show.  However, these three lights did not contain any of the FAA mandated lighting, and the pattern flown was quite tight, leading me to believe that not even the best of pilots would attempt such maneuvers, particularly at night.At approximately 2025 hours, the sequential orange lights again appeared in the same vicinity as I had initially observed them, following the same pattern of lighting up sequentially, creating the illusion of movement, remaining illuminated for a few seconds, and blacking out in unison.  This occurred twice, and Officer [WITHELD] was able to see for himself, the lights which I had described.After this sighting, we remained in the area perhaps another twenty minutes, but nothing occurred, so we left the area altogether.Deputy [WITHHELD] Sherman County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this excellent report.

This was right over the river as we stood by the River Palm hotel, a very public type area. The Lights from the Hotel went straight up into the sky and the object went straight over head. We even thought at first perhaps it had been a flock of geese but could not have been as we heard no noise of any kind. Every time we go back to Laughlin we go the River Palm Hotel same spot and same time Dusk and look up. This has helped as we realized it was much much bigger than anything like geese because it was about the same height in the sky as the helicopters that were flying earlier. Also we noted that each round or balloon shape was nearly the size of one copter or a small VW volkswagon beetle bug or nearly as big. They looked like they were stringed together, I say that because they weren&apos;t exact as they were in a V shape and as I said about 8 on each side. It seemed to me that one side seemed to move or some on one side seemed to move. My husband the other witness didn&apos;t notice that. As we stared nearly straight up the colors seem to be almost opal or of many reflecting colors as if it were reflecting the colors which would make sense since the lights were so bright from the hotel. We could see it disappear into the clouds, gradually disappearing, also it seem to be going some what slow. Naturally no one else was around towards the other end towards other end of river nearer the Flamingo Hotel there are more people. Naturally at that time I didn&apos;t have a cell phone with camera nor a digital camera. It was just to 2 of us. I keep better records but had the info lost in my old email enfo so I am not exact on the month as a matter of fact it was somewhere between  months and 26 months ago. We could ck our records perhaps our credit card to find when we stayed at the River Palm. I have asked and even notified the airport tower of course I waited a year to do so but they said they saw nothing. I can&apos;t believe no one else saw this because it was so hudge.

After I picked her up I proceeded to drive on Rt. 110 towards Harvard, MA to bring her to my Father&apos;s house.As I proceeded down the road, I saw a large bright yellow/pale orange light in the sky about 20 degrees on the Horizon, that was far brighter than any planet that should have been in the area of the Northwest Sky. I proceded to drive and look at the moon as a reference point and thought the light was moving very slowly.This really blew my mind, because I had no idea what this light could be. I broke off of Rt 110, and drove up a large hill towards the &quot;Fruitlands Museum&quot; in Harvard. Since there&apos;s a great view of the Northwest sky from this Orchard hill with many lookout points, we had to get a better look. As we pulled in, my sister and I jumped out of the car to watch this large glowing object varying in lighting intensity in the Northwest sky hovering about 20 degrees over the horizon over the prison hospital near the former Fort Devens.We watched this object slowly move up and down over the lights of the prison hospital for must have been 6 minutes. During this I called my girlfriend to describe what I was seeing and have her call her mother who lives close in the area to look at the sky. My sister also called her friend from her cell phone to look in the sky. As we were watching this object, we noticed lights circling in the cloud cover to the right of the object in the sky. We never saw any definitive objects or lights, but there were lights circling in the clouds making very erratic, then circular patterns.  There were no spotlights shining up from the ground.  There were many cars passing on Rt. 2 which is visible from this point, so someone else driving on the road has to have had to seen this object. All of a sudden the light disappeared, just like it clicked off. Just moments after it shut off,  2 fast flying planes came into the area, I could hear them before I could see them. But saw lights on wings fly fast into the general area towards us, then bank around 180 degrees back towards the area we saw the craft. The planes flew around until we noticed there were no more lights shining in the clouds. We watched the sky for about 10 more minutes and saw nothing so we headed back home. We got home shortly after 11:00pm.  Now ontop of this story, I went to check the call time on my phone to see how long I was on the phone with my girlfriend. There was no record of this call on my cell phone when there should have been. There was no record of this call on my girlfriends phone. Then on a separate line with my sister&apos;s phone, she has no record of making this call. I don&apos;t know what this means or even if it is a critical piece of the story, but I found it odd.", "UFO over Culbertson Montana.I did not witness this myself, however, I have visisted with several people that DID witness this along with others that heard and felt the great sound of a supposed sonic boom or crash.

I noticed a very bright yellowish/orange light in the sky about 1-2 miles away over a cornfield. There was alot of farm land and some trees in the area. I thought it was odd because it was so low, bright and huge. I have never seen an airplane that size and especially not that bright and still in the daytime hours. You would need about 75-100 airplanes to make up the size of this. I continued to watch it for a few minutes and it wasn&apos;t moving, but just hovering over the cornfield. I told my friend, who was driving, to look out her window and she saw it also. We both were in pure amazement because I have never seen anything at all like this except for in the movies. Then the light became a bright whiteish color and we could see a silver lining underneath, like the bottom of a disk or bowl. I didn&apos;t take my eyes off of it. It continued to just hover over this area. A few minutes later, the bright light started to dim. Within a split second, the lights totally disappeared and I saw a flash zip across the sky really fast and totally disappear into the sky. We continued looking all over the place and it was just gone, totally gone. We then noticed approximately 10 jet streams in the sky going towards the direction of the object that we saw. We didn&apos;t see any airplanes or helicopters in the area at all while we were witnessing this except for after it disappeared, we saw those jet streams going towards that direction. The only thing in this particular area was the cornfield/farm land and some trees. There were no street lights, tower lights, buildings or anything at all. We were in such amazement and didn&apos;t even think to take a picture of this until afterwards. This lasted approximately 5-8 minutes I would say. I wonder if anyone else saw this or anything odd in the sky tonight?", "4 &apos;Star&apos; shaped and coloured craft descend and hover above 2 jets - Wolverhampton UK: 2 witnessesI was sitting in the car waiting for my friend to come out of the supermarket store.I had a feeling that I was going to see a ufo. (I have predicted the appearance of sightings I have had, due to a feeling I get, to which I have had all my life).The sky was blue - not hazy or cloudy - just blue.I noticed outof the drivers side window two jets flying in formation. The jets were very far away and were tiny - you could just make them out in front of their chem trails. I lit myself a cigarrette and watched the jets for a while, by now the jets were visible from the windscreen. I said to myself, that feeling must be just a coincidence (for the last  several sightings I have had) when out of the blue canopy a star shaped and star coloured object descended and hovered above the jets, (it was quite a long flight down for it)I was just thinking YES! when not 1 but three other crafts descended 1 by 1, identical to the first and just sat there hovering with the 1st. I was blown away by this but then the second and forth &apos;Stars&apos; ascended back up through the blue canopy. Just as the first &apos;Star&apos; started to ascend, the other 2 &apos;Stars&apos; came back down. Now there were three hovering. The first &apos;Star&apos; re-descended and now all four were hovewring there.My Friend came out of the store and by now I had got out of the car and was leaning/sitting on the bonnet. I asked her to tell me what she could see in the distance, she replied, I quote: &quot; I can see two planes - why?&quot; I asked &quot;what do you see above the planes?&quot; She replied: &quot; I can see some stars - so what? You can see stars in the daytime sometimes!&quot; I asked: &quot;ok - what are the stars doing?&quot; She then became anxious and shouted: &quot; so what! I wanna get out of here, lets go, I don&apos;t want to be here!&quot; As it was my friends car, (I was driving for her)we had to go. Since this happened I have told people and although they think me insane I kinda knew that they would believe me once they heard my friend tell what happened. (she is a teacher and held in good regard and standing)So a couple of times we bumped into each other whilst I was with a person whom I had &apos;relieved&apos;the story with and I asked her to tell.Her reply has been, on both occaisions: I don&apos;t want to talk about it!&quot; This is not a story but a true account of 1 of my many sightings, it isn&apos;t just the fact that I see a fair few ufo phenomenon it&apos;s the fact that I predict their appearance.

The light appeared with a flash and took less than a second to cross the sky.  The light was radiating heavily and looked to have extuinguished before coming in contact with the ground.

We do this a lot as we love to look at the stars. On this evening the sky was very cloudy and the cloud cover was low. I was somewhat windy as well. I noticed in the eastern sky three lights that look as though they were in a triangular pattern. The colors of the lights were, red, green and yellow. What caught my eye was that as this shape moved through the cloud you could see the cloud being displaced and the cloud sort of shimmering over the haul of the object. The angle from my position to the objects was approximately 60 degree&apos;s. The object looked to approximately 250 to 300&quot; feet above the surface. I observed that the object was moving slow and banked up and right. There was no sound. It seemed to me that as this object entered the cloud it became somehow visible, I must say that I know this all sounds fantastic, but this is how it seemed. The object was very large for any air craft I have seen. I would say possibly 100 yards across and 45&quot; thick. That is a guess. It moved very gracefully, almost like a fish would move in the water. After it passed through the cloud it was no longer visible. My girlfriend unfortunately did not see it, but supports my sighting. When it was visible in the cloud you could see the cloud shimmering over the haul. I know this sounds crazy, but I swear I seen this. I would like to discuss this with someone who might know what this object was. I am not after publicity or notoriety. I have always been skeptical of these sort of sightings until now.

They looked like they were not moving, except for the fact that they were &quot;blinking&quot; in and out of view.

Then they reappeared in the exact same formation, looking exactly the same and would flicker for about 10 seconds-until they disapeared again.

We all saw what I am about to describe-  three lights in a triangular form, though we never saw the form of the vehicle.  They floated, hovered and moved slowly.  The lights were equidistant from one another, and they were white--and very very bright. They remained the same distance from each other, the entire time, and it appeared to be 3 lights on the same craft. I never saw an acutal craft, just the lights of it. The lights moved FAR to slowly to be a normal object (like a plane), and at times didn&apos;t appear to be moving at all. I realize that objects appear to move slower than they actually are, the farther away they are.  I know that objects can look smaller than they are the farther away they are. Over the years, as I have tenatively, and cautiously shared this story with a few select people, I have been given the following explanations. &quot;Sue, you probably saw an airplane.&quot; Well, do airplanes hover?  Are there lights completely equidistant, like the lights on the point of an equilateral triangle?  Do they hover? I know that they can appear to hover, if they are far enough away.But the size of these lights made it impossible for them to have been that far away.Suggestion number 2  &quot;Maybe you saw a spot light.&quot;   Maybe...if there were three spotlights and they moved in a straight line, and all moved together;  and, if they hovered.Suggestion number 3  &quot;Maybe your eyes were playing tricks on you.&quot;  Okay... for over half an hour, that&apos;s a long time for my eyes to adjust to the night light, whatever.  But what about my witnesses? After being ridiculed, I decided it best just to let this event in my life stay private.  I am now 42, and I was 18 when this happened.Well, You are the third person I have shared this with, Mr. Moderator.What is your opinion?  Is there a logical explanation?

Can&apos;t remember the exact year, but it had to be between 1987 and 1989.  Three of us were driving around the Woodland area of Mansfield, OH on a very clear night, just happy to be out of the house and hanging out.  For well over an hour, we could all clearly see a brilliant blue/white light in the sky.  It appeared to be a bright star, or perhaps a planet. It was fairly high in the sky, not near the horizon at all. Again, after seeing it for more than an hour in the same exact spot we thought it could only be a celestial object.  However, after a while we were driving down a road and saw it through the windshield...and suddenly it shot off to the north/northeast at incredible speed.  It went so fast that it left a blue/white streak halfway across the sky before it disappeared. At first we thought it was a meteor, but upon reflection realized it could not be--what meteors are blue/white and stay in the same spot for nearly 2 hours before they move?

While stopped at a traffic light, she pointed to something she saw in the sky which was almost directly over us. I had to lean forward to be able to see up through the windshield to observe 3 identical black triangular objects. I observed them for less than 30 seconds. The objects were motionless and we could not hear any noise from the objects. There were no markings, lights or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.), just a solid black object. the objects were in a loose triangle formation separated from each other by a distance of approximately 5 times their individual width. What struck me most was their stillness and almost silhouette-like appearance.My impression is that the objects were the size of private jets or fighter planes. They were significantly higher in altitude that the normal Santa Monica airport traffic that occurs regularly in that area, enough so that a closed fist at arms length could have covered two of the objects (were they spaced tip to tip).While observing them, I moved my head to change my viewing angle so as to verify that this was not caused by debris on the widshield or reflections. These were definitely airborne objects.Once the traffic light changed to green, I resumed driving, but was unable to see the objects again since they were nearly directly overhead. Once we had driven a few blocks so that the objects should have been easier to view from a shallower angle, the sky was empty where thay had been.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

There was no object/craft visible.", "Flying object  over Wales emitting other objectsA flying object passed over our house this evening which caught my attention. It was  very high up and I could not see any shape but it had an orange glow/colour to it. I would normally think it was an aircraft,(it was moving at about the speed an aircraft would) but the reason this one caught my attention was because it was silent and dropping objects, about one per minute or two. the objects it was dropping started off as orange glowing lights , (the same colour as the flying object) but they then dissintegrated into nothing. Similar to how a firework dissapears before it hits the ground.  I called my wife just in time for her to see it emitting a final object before it faded from view.The only thing I can think of is perhaps it was a military exercise, as there are military bases in Wales.

Back in 2005 my sister was driving home from some late night dinner with my mother and as we drove down our street I saw a light at the end of the street over a house just above the trees about two feet above. I automatically assumed that it was a airplane flying low at night and the perspective was throwing off the actual height. So my sister stopped to get the mail at the bottom of our 150 ft driveway. I stared and then noticed the light was not moving. Just as a mentioned this to my mother and sister the light began to zip smoothly towards us. My sister did not pull up the driveway, but my mother began to panic and said to get up the driveway. My heart began to race since this light as now apparently only 2 feet above the treeline! As we pulled in the garage I looked overhead and saw the light skirt over the tops of the trees and then we were in the garage. As I ran inside to look out the windows, the object had left and that was the end of the excitement.

That area is pretty much all farm country, and at the time there was at least 8&quot; of snow on the ground from a previous snowfall. The night was clear and very cold...around 20 degrees Fahrenheit. I came to a stop at a remote four-way intersection, and sat at the intersection, and carefully looked both ways for traffic. While looking to the left, a circular light suddenly appeared on the snow, as if someone was shining a spotlight straight down. The light was approx. 30 feet in diameter, and was about 150 feet from my position. There were no houses in the immediate area, and there was no sound being made. I was driving my winter car, an old Camaro, and the curvature of the window restricted me from looking up to see the source of the light, and the window handle was broken, so I couldn&apos;t roll the window down in order to put my head outside to get a better view.  At this point I sensed that something very strange was happening, and pretty much floored the accelerator to exit the area as fast as possible.  When I got to work, I was relating the incident to a few of my co-workers, when another worker (an off-duty policeman) arrived and announced that his police radio was bristling with reports of strange lights and ufo&apos;s all over the region.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As we watched it for several minutes it slowly began to fade to a barely visible point of light, not moving from that location. At that time my friend said she saw an arc of light in that same area and afterwards a fast up and down shaft of light lasting a second.

It was about a mile and a half away within a few seconds. We were both pointing when it started flashing red, white, and blue lights extremely fast. It looked like fireworks. It reminded us of cameras going off all at once, over and over. It then disappeared in the distance. No one, as far as I know, saw it but us.

During the winter months, it is usually dark at those times, so the night sky can be visible if it isn&apos;t cloudy. On several occasions, I have witnessed a bright yellow-orange light off to both the east and west of our house, which remains stationary for a period of about ten minutes. One particular evening, the object appeared in the southwestern sky, clearly visible in the twilight. I observed it slowly (very, very slowly) moving from south to north for a period of about ten minutes (to hazard a guess, I would say it moved about an inch from my perspective in the sky). I walked into our barn to feed our animals, and about three minutes later when I walked out, the object was due west, having moved significantly in that short amount of time. It can also be observed off to the southeast sometimes in the morning, and it usually does the same thing. Look away for a few minutes, and it will have moved significantly across the sky. I know for sure that it isn&apos;t a form of aircraft (such as the MedFlight that flies around every now and again) because there was no sound emitted.

His sighting appear to be the same as mines being that they saw 3 object heading east with two crafts flying together while the 3rd was a bit apart (in my case 2 ships apart and trailing 10 seconds behind. What I would like to know is if the crafts that Vancouver saw was traveling horizontal to earth or at an angle as most pitures and drawings that we see of triangle crafts. Because I originaly reported it as a cigar shape but what if what I saw was a side profile of the triangle, like seeing the rim of a book. ****  note **** The skies were still blue at 19:30 about 1/2 hour away from sunset. Vancouver, WA to Brooklyn, NY is 3000 miles apart. WA reported it at 13:55 (PDT) that&apos;s 15:55 (EST). I made my report at 19:30 (EST).  If it is possible that we seen the same 3 craft then it must have travled at the speed of 1000 MPH to reach my area in 3 hours +. When the object came in from the horizon at 260 deg SW flew at the closest point over my house I ran from the back yard to the front ( 60&apos; ) just to see it come out from over my house and head NE at 80 deg toward Long Island. As I stated in a previous post, after the sightings, I veiwed a commericial jet plane ( close enough where you know it&apos;s a plane but can&apos;t tell what airline and about the same size as the crafts) flew over the same path at about the same speed it took the crafts to reach and pass over my house. So if a plane cruises about the speed of 500 MPH and the craft travels at 1000 MPh and they both took about the same time to cross over my house then is it possible that that crafts were twice the size of a jumbo and were flying twice as high giving the illusion that it was the sze of a jumbo and needed to travel more distace then a plane to cross over my home.", "A beam of rotating light in eastern KansasI don&apos;t remember the actual dates. I was working as a conductor on a north/south frieght train in eastern Kansas. One of our locomotives had suddenly died and I went back to try to restart it.

It reminded me of a police helicopter&apos;s search light that I&apos;d seen in the city except that it was rotating (spinning). I couldn&apos;t see where the light was coming from because of the window awning on the locomotive so I stepped out on the trailing end of the locomotive to get a better look. The beam had disappeared and something shot across the night sky like a shooting star. The whole thing only lasted seconds. I restarted the engine and it ran perfect the rest of the trip.

I originally submitted it two or three years ago and it was apparently not received as it did not appear in the database. I was riding my motorcycle on my way home from work one night on SR1 in August 1987 and as I left Castroville I kept seeing flashes of orange and green lights out of the corner of my eye. I assumed that they were just reflections from street and other lights nearby in my face shield. The flashes kept occurring and were random. Then it occurred to me that they were all coming from the same point in the sky. I looked up and saw what appeared to be occasional small flames of orange and brilliant green coming from a small, dark spot in the sky. I exited the freeway and stopped to get a better look. I saw a small, dark object in the sky, darker than the sky, to the south and at approximately a 40degree azimuth. The object did not seem to move but I could see what appeared to be sheets of orange and green flame occasionally going from the near end back toward the farthest end. I took out my binoculars and looked for the object, finding it once another sheet of flame crossed it and saw what appeared to be a dark, rounded rock  with a large depression on the side and small pockmarks or craters on it. The rock was oriented with it&apos;s small part toward me and pointing a bit more West and downward, and the much larger part pointing away from me. It reminded me of some of kind of potato. The rock was much darker than the night sky, even though there were few stars in that area of the sky at the time. Even so, there seemed to be some light illuminating the side I could see as well as the near end, that I assumed was light reflecting off the Earth or from some lights on the ground. As I watched through the binoculars, sheets of orange and green flame would be emitted or produced from the near end and would spread along the length of the object briefly. I stood and watched the object until I was falling asleep. It was perhaps just an half hour. I did not see the object move from where it was. I thought the object had moved but it was the stars that had moved. I mentioned the sighting in sci.astro about two years later. Someone posted a followup (which I never saw until 2006) saying that I saw a rocket from Vandenberg but there is no rocket that looks like a rock. I also mentioned in the post that it appeared to move a few degrees but I was wrong: it did not appear to move relative to horizon or any landmark that I could see but it did move relative to the stars, or rather, the stars moved behind the object. I followed up the sighting with inquiries to local news and to the FAA and got no response at all. I believe what I saw was an asteroid near-miss. The object was probably at the edge of the atmosphere, which would account for the occasional sheet of flame, and was moving at the same speed and roughly in the same direction as the Earth, which made it appear to be relatively motionless and which kept it from hitting the ground or water.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Finally checking the NUFORC log today, I found 3 reports around 5am of May 9 that share elements of my sighting, but I believe that I witnessed a more complete, longer duration event.  Returning home after a very late night at work (normal for me), I had just pulled off I-280 at the Foothill College (Moody Rd.) exit when a bright light in the southern sky caught my attention.  I am thoroughly familiar with the constellations and celestial bodies, so anything &quot;out of place&quot; is immediately evident.  This object was at least Sirius- or Jupiter-bright, in the constellation Ophiuchus and somehwat east of Arcturus.  Jupiter had already set or was obscured by the coastal ridge.  The object was moving very slowly north- or northwestward and at first I took it to be an incoming aircraft.  Expecting its brilliant, steady white light to begin strobing any second, I was astonished when instead it sprouted a &quot;vapor trail&quot; on its left side that mimicked a classic comet tail (I noted the time [5:06] on my car&apos;s digital clock about now).  This trail was highly structured and almost perfectly triangular.  It then began to grow steadily but maintained its geometrical shape.  As I continued to watch (I had parked my car on the periphery of Foothill College by this point) it was as though the mass of the original object were being converted into this growing exhaust trail.  Eventually, the object was completely &quot;consumed&quot; and no longer visible, leaving behind a glowing elliptical cloud with a very long major axis.  This cloud easily covered the area of a small to mid-size constellation, perhaps larger than Ursa Minor or about half of Hydra.  It faded gradually but I could still make out traces of it 10 to 15 minutes later when I arrived at home.  As far as altitude and location, I would estimate it to be somewhat higher (2000-3000 ft.) and closer to the coast than the San Jose observer.  I fully expected some mention of it to be made immediately on local radio (there was nothing subtle about this!), but KGO, KCBS, and KQED-FM were all silent.

The objects flew from east to west in the same path each time, after that I just thought &quot;Wow&quot; another sighting of some of those strange lights that I have saw many times before. What happened next is still unbelievable to me as I sit here and write it. I sttod there in the same area of my backyard, for a few minutes, I had my spotlight with me because it is so dark out there and I try to watch for snakes, we have alot of copperhead snakes around here! Well&apos; here comes another object, now the first two objects were approximately 30 40 thousand feet in altitude, it is really according to how big they were, they looked small of course. This next object was much lower and it was coming from the east. it was traveling at a relitively low speed, just to be silly and playing around I shined my spolight toward the object. What happened next is wild, The object slowed down to almost a complete stop as I flashed and blinked the spotlight at it. It then continued to gain a little more speed and it continued on. As I was still watching that object, here comes another out of the west. This one was about 15 to 20 thousand feet in altitude, and again no sound or no flashing beacon, just lit up. All objects were low enough that I could have heard an engine. Again, I shined my spotlight at it and held it on it for several seconds, now remember you can see a spotlight from an airplane if you are looking for it. Already amzed and almost chilled from the last craft, this one began to slow down as well, almost to a complete stop, I wasn&apos;t believing my own eyes.And then it bagn to speed up after I continued shining the light toward it, as it was speeding up it was climbing, at a rate that was just unreal, it looked as though it shot into space, within seconds I just simply couldn&apos;t see it anymore. People say &quot;oh those things are those UAV&apos;s that the air force uses, I am sorry I don&apos;t think so,at the altitude that these objects were, I could have heard them and they are not capable of climbing as fast as that object did.

Looking at it further, we could see that they weren&apos;t separate aircrafts either, because the area between the 3 lights was a different shade of black than the rest of the sky.  Then a regular airplane came over, it looked to be on an intercept course.  We could then see how big the UFO actually was.

Formation took up 1/3 of front windshield of Rav4 -approx 500 to 1000 feet off ground. Very large! Very distinct unchanging pattern of white lights moving silently in front of us. We stopped and got out of the car but could not hear any noise whatsoever. The far left light was blinking on and off (slowly) - all others were bright and unchanging. The formation that we witnessed matches almost exactly with a previously reported incident in Phoenix, Arizona in 1997 (reference Dr. Lynne D. Kitei)which, when I saw the exact pattern (as re-created on the television documentary) prompted me to write this report as there are no pictures. Object(s) remained in view for approx 3 minutes as it continued to move in front of our location in a Norherly direction- we ran out of roadway in which to follow it further. The location of this sighting corresponds to the intersection of Web Ginn Road and Moon Place and was first viewed between Moon Place and Ronald Reagan Parkway (about 1/2 way between these two roads and moving parallel to Web Ginn road before it turns to the right at the intersection of Moon Place. My daughter drew what she saw in the lower half of a piece of paper. I then drew a picture of what I saw on the upper half of the paper (without looking at her drawing first) and then we compared the two drawings.

She also wrote at the bottom of the painting &quot;Some things are just not to be said... or explained...&quot;", "Craft near AFB followed aircraft then proceeded south at a constant rate through changes in direction and elevationhe shape was not clear since the color of the craft matched the sky haze.  The only reason the craft was so visible was the reflection it gave off but the reflection did not show the exact outline.  However the reflection(s) allowed use to visually follow the craft while my friend and I kept asking each other, &quot;Have you ever seen an aircraft do that?&quot;, over and over. Al was over Saturday evening and I saw my first UFO.  Craziest thing I&apos;ve ever seen.  I still don&apos;t believe it was an Alien thing but it wasn&apos;t any typical aircraft.  The speed and its maneuvering looked impossible.  It chased two planes over the airport going two different directions, dodged another and then dove close to the ground and proceeded south all in 10-12 seconds.  It was at dusk so the sun was going down but shinning on the vehicle.  It was white and no lights of any kind.  It had to be a pearl white or like that reflective 3M white tape or sign material.  It was not shiny metallic but definitely white but a halogen white.  It did not have a vertical stab, rudder and it was a little hazy so there was no way to make out any detail.  There has been a lot of activity at the Ft. Carson and Peterson since this weekend.  My guess is that it is some sort of new flight vehicle and they were testing it.  It was likely also very stealthy so I assume it was likely not picked up on radar, especially considering what it did and the speed involved.  It was directly east when I saw it and farther out than an approach for the airport.  It came around and come up behind the first plane and veered off coming around to approaching the second plane coming in at a right angle to the first plane.  That was an &apos;S&apos; shape that covered more than 12 miles.  Then it went south and dodged a plane on approach while in a steep dive.  After it came close to the ground it leveled off and proceeded south.  It did this all within 8 seconds, no longer.  It did not seem to lean into turns as an aircraft would and looked like it stayed level.  Neither Al or I could make out its shape except it did not have a rudder.  The only plane that I know that could do this would be an F-22 but there was no sound.  Something maneuvering that fast should have made some pretty noticeable throttling jet engine sounds.  If the F-22 has noise suppression maybe, flying an experimental pattern and painted pearl or reflective white.  My guess and feel after just watching the Thunderbirds at graduation is it was traveling just under mach one.  Also it did not change speed either in the hard maneuvers or when it dove.  It just looked really odd.  Neither Al or I took our eyes off of it until we could not see it any longer and just started laughing.  He&apos;s retired Army advanced radar and communications technician.  The F-22 has vector thrust but it makes a lot of noise and it still looses speed in hard maneuvers. One thing this was not was winged aircraft, even an F-22 with vectored thrust.  It made maneuvers that only a helicopter could make but at a speed that had to be just below mach one at 7000 to 10000 ft. elevations.  The two sincere giveaways that this was a special craft was first it flew over an municipal airport and Air Force Base with no lights and in two flight paths of other aircraft and came very close to the rear of those two plane with no clearance lights or landing lights&hellip; all very illegal for either military or civilian aircraft.  The second giveaway was either drastic changes in direction or elevation did not change the velocity of the craft in the slightest. I am not a believer in extraterrestrials, an engineer and would have to see either an extraterrestrial or their craft closely before I could possibly believe.  Someone owns and operates on incredible aircraft for sure.", "Day light aerial object resembles flying domed skylightMy wife and I had been working in the yard and she sat down in a patio chair while I went into the garage to put up some tools.  She called to me to come back outside with some urgency in her voice and I did so and she pointed up and said &quot;is that a plane?&quot; I looked up and saw a distant object almost directly overhead about the size of a pea reflecting sunlight causing a glare that made it difficult to observe.  My wife remarked that she had been watching it for a couple minutes and it had been stationary with slight movements from her vantage point of leaning back it leaning back in a swivel rocker type of patio chair.  Additionaly she had been observing it where the eaves of the garage and main house came together at a 90 degree angle and and so the object was framed in that view.  She didn&apos;t call me until it began moving and she wanted me to see it.  When I couldn&apos;t see it clearly I went inside and grabbed my 8 x 42 fieldglasses for a look.  The obect could be seen very clearly then.  It was all white, with a flat square bottom with radiused corners, and a domed topside.    For all practical purposes of comparison it reminded me of the porportions and shape of a dome shaped 2&apos; X 2&apos; replacement skylight cover if it had radius corners instead of 90 degree corners at a builders center.  It&apos;s course was basically north to south but in a bobbing weaving fashion rather than straight line.  The size in my field of view of the field glasses was about the size of the skylight on my neighbors&apos; house which is about 80 feet away.  It was easy to keep it in view and focused there were no control surfaces or propellars or engine nacelles.  We traded the glasses back and forth several times and I had to move to end of house when a pine tree blocked viewing.   I thought I would lose view when it went over the moutain but instead it descended in front of the mountain and it was obscured by the foothills in an apparent landing.  Being that we are a few miles from Ft. Huachaca it could be new technology.   It wasn&apos;t &apos;old&apos; technology as I have seen examples them in flight.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Went out to check how clear the sky was.  Looked up saw an object brighter than Jupiter in a position that was not where Jupiter was.  I thought to myself,  &quot;whats jupiter doing over there?&quot; Then I looked and saw Jupiter was still over where it was supposed to be,  looked back at the object.  It was bright white,  and it started to move slowly,  picked up speed.  It moved across the horizon from south to northwest. Went and got my binoculars. Typically we get a lot of air traffic being near the Riverside Descent Area to Detroit Metro Airport.  But I was able to see other planes at extremely high altitudes.  Planes typically have flashing lights, and red/green lights on the wingtips.  I looked at the object with my binoculars.  No flashing lights at all.  Just a bright pure white light.   My wife saw another object moving in the opposite direction and had been looking at that.  Then after the 2nd object had moved across the sky in the exact same trafjectory but opposite direction, we picked up another 3rd object moving the exact same direction as the first. The object was not a plane with its landing lights (another typical phenomenon I&apos;ve seen in this area for 30 years) because it was almost at the zenith and it was moving. It was not a satellite, as it was moving much too slow.  Plus it had started off stationary, like just a star in the sky,  then it started to move off.  Eventually the object did lose its brightness and fade away. I have seen satellites get bright and then fade away but the speed never changed.  this was stationary for a bit before it moved off.((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station was not visible from Windsor, Ontario, on May 22nd, 2006.

The sky was pretty clear considering we had thunderstorms earlier that day. I spotted what I took at first to be a star because It was a bright yellowish white colour, solid throughout and very high in the sky. However, I then noticed it was moving. I stopped walking and watched it. It was flying in a strait pattern but going rather too fast and smooth for an airplane. I took off my headphones to listen for sound, to make sure it wasn&apos;t a plane or for some bizaree reason a helicopper (though it seemed too high up for this) I couldn&apos;t hear anything but the normal car noises ect. It didnt have any light changes and I didn&apos;t see any red lights or pulsating lights like on a plane. I walked forwards to watch it until it disapeared behind a tress near by. I continued on my walk, shortly afterward, maybe three minutes later, a plan flew over head. It looked nothing like what I saw minutes before and was at the normal height in the sky.This is strange to me because its the second sighting I&apos;ve had in the last week. I can&apos;t remember the exact day, I think It was Tuesday or Wednesday. It was about 1:30-2:00pm I was driving to see a friend at work when I noticed a a silvery object really high in the sky, higher then I had ever seen a plane go. It&apos;s shape was somewhat circular and I couldn&apos;t make out any wings. I observed it until I turned a corner and it was gone from my view.

It glided left then right, then left then right, then hovered, then glided a few houses down, then glided left , then right, then hovered, then glided a few more houses down and kept doing that till I lost sight of it behind some trees, then I didn&apos;t see it again.  All the while, the lights kept going from all red, to all blue to all green over and over and the light would stay the one color for like 5 seconds then turn all blue then all green over and over as it glided and hovered.", "star in the sky during the day?I was at my in-laws for mothers day , it was fairly clear out, there were a few high cirrus clouds.  I noticed a white spot of light up high in the sky at first I thought it might be a balloon, but it never changed shape at least to the naked eye, and it stayed fairly stationary in the sky.  Also, for reference a balloon actually did float by it and it was not even close in distance to it, this was much higher up in the sky. It looked like a star but during the day, which I thought was strange. I was able to point it out to a couple of my relatives and they were also able to see it, though I was the one tracking it for about an hour and took pictures of it. It slowly moved toward the sun from southeast to northwest.  I went online to see if there were to be any astronomical occurances that day.  The only thing that could be a match was Mercury was to be in that exact portion of the sky.  But reading more into it, it seemed it would be to dim to see during the day. The pictures I took, do seem to be of a crescent planet. That would shift back and forth most likely due to atmospheric distortion.  I am really curious to as if this was a UFO or a planet.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.

Time 13:55-14:05.Overview:  Shortly after finishing an outdoor lunch with my wife and son, my son noticed something in the sky and asked me what they were.  I looked up to the sky in the direction he was pointing.  What I saw were three triangle shaped black objects moving very slowly across the sky in a easterly direction. I called out to my wife, who had taken a few dishes into the house, to hurry outside and take a look at these things.  My wife came outside, looked up to where my son and I were looking and also observed the three flying objects.  My son ran into the house and brought out our digital camera but said that he could not find the objects in the view-finder of the camera. I then ran into the house to get our binoculars but could not find them so I returned outside, and together we observed the black triangles drift across the the sky untill they entered the clouds. Facts:   We observed the objects for about ten minutes from 13:55 to 14:05 local time (PDT).  The objects were triangle in shape, and black in color with no lights observed.  They were moving in a kind of formation (two close together and the other one by itself).  We did not hear any sound coming from the at all.  Sky cover was completly overcast with a cumulo-stratus cloud layer at about 3000 to 3500 feet above ground level.  The objects were clearly visible against the clouded background.

The lights were of an odd color, a pale yellow would be the best way to describe them.

At first I thought it was a plastic banner that had come loose off one of the boats and reflecting the lights of the harbour.  I alarmed my friends who thought the same.  Next we thought it was fireworks from one of the many nearby beach bars when my friend pointed out that the lights were moving far too quick to be fireworks. As time went on the lights changed into fireballs with the one at the front flashing/burning brightly which made me think that maybe it&apos;s an aeroplane on fire and about to crash, leaving trail of burning fireballs behind it, some smaller, some bigger, in different colours.  By this time the entire port was looking at the sky (1000&apos;s of people).  There was no sound coming off these objects.  The phenomenon carried on going right across the nightsky and the fireballs only started fading and disappearing when they were almost out of sight to the far East (they had appeard in the west).   I have seen meteor showers before but never have they been anything like this in terms of quantity, intensity and how close they seemed above the Earth&apos;s surface.  Very strange indeed.

After blinking about 20 times, it began to move VERY SLOWLY and it wasnt until then I realized it wasnt just a bright star. I said something to friend at that point and we both then watched it for over 40 minutes. Its movement was in east to west direction but it stopped and started many times over and with seemingly different velocities over 45 minute period and often made directional changes back/forth and up/down--with a gradual westerly progression as net effect.  At 12:01 seemed to stop and not move again, still a bright light (brightest in this night sky).  Would a satellite act like this??  NO trails, auras, sounds, beams or other objects.

From my memory there were no lights or sounds, I recall 2 long diamond shaped indentions on the bottom, and then 3 or 4 lines across and at the points of the triangle were circles. What I remember about the triangle is very clear, it was very low and I saw the bottom very clearly.I know I&apos;m not crazy and the evidence around my house proves to me something happened last night, but I can only recall seeing the triangle leaving.", "Stationary long objet with dome in middle.

At first it looked flat and long with a dome shape in the middle, and then as if it turned slighty on it&apos;s side it looked diamond shaped and these same colored lights outling it.  After about 15 minutes it started to fade, but don&apos;t know if it was because of clouds moving in around it.  After it seemed to disappear, just to the left of it I saw a flash of white light and didn&apos;t see it again.

This light rose up sharply and split into three seperate lights which can be described as a square/rectangular light,solid on the upper half of this rectangular with the bottom half open with a few horizontal bars goin across. These lights then slowly went out and a similar light would appear just above and angled over, then again fade out and re-appear at another angle. We had binnoculars but could not make out any kind of craft within this outline of lights as of yet. Within a few seconds there began a flurry of small white lights circling this larger pattern of lights and then moving rapidly out of this circular pattern. These smaller lights appras to have 2 rectangular lights that would blink every second or so.We watched this happen again a few minutes later in another part of the sky, Same bright orange light with it splitting into some kind of square light.

Last night, just before I was about to retire, about midnight, I went outside. When I do so afterdark I usually carry a flashlight and shine it just long enough to make sure that there are no snakes in my path, as we do have a few types of vipers here, including the quiet and lazy copperheads that would just let you step on them before they would move. A rattlesnake would make it&apos;s presence known....... anyway, I am digressing.When I turned the flashlight out I quickly noticed that there was another light source coming from over my head. It was quite bright, bright enough to leave very distinct shadows on the ground from the leaves on the trees. I noticed that the light source was moving, and looked up in the direction from which it seemed to be coming. Flying quite slowly, and very quietly, directly coming from behind my cabin there was an orb about the size of a beachball. It was a vivid golden color, and it flew nearly as low as a crop-duster airplane.It shone a light that was most definitely aimed directly at me. After it had passed over me for a very short distance it turned off the light, and it simply disappeared. There was never any sound whatsoever from it as it passed and then vanished into the dark of the night.I have a friend that is currently staying here with me, so I came back inside the cabin and told him about what had just occurred. He quickly came back outdoors with me. We both heard a sonic boom far off into the distance as I was giving him the details about the object&apos;s trajectory. I do not know if that was related to the orbs flight. Needless to say, my retirement plants were dashed. I was just a wee bit too excited to go to bed.I would like to add here that I am in no way an U.F.O. fanatic. I&apos;m not even an x-files fan, for that matter but, I have pretty much always believed that there must be other intelligent life forms in the universe, and that they may very likely have visited our little planet in the past, and still do so in this day and age. Nevertheless, I had not expected to have such an up-close and personal experience, as personal as I would ever like that to be. It was directly spotlighting me from an overhead distance of perhaps two to three-hundred feet. That, good enough for me, thank you! Anyway......

During the day they appear on film and we have them recorded, yet to the plain ordinary eye they are not visible. When my wife and I first seen them we were filming our 6 year old son flying his kite when we first noticed them. The same evening when this first occurred we had an experience that is still ongoing. At first we assumed that a child had a laser pointer, we seen a red laser enter into our master bedroom and literally bounced off our walls, our 6 year old son yelled at the same time and had the same red beam of light in his bedroom and that evening needless to say he slept with us. We cannot explain this without coming across as insane, yet we are getting no help in regards to whom we have currently contacted. We now see these red beams during the day in our home and after trying to record them on film they disappear. Our son is petrified due to he stated that these red beams were talking to him and after we asked him what he meant he stated they were spelling out words as well as language to him. I will not go into any detail as to what these beams have spelled out, we are in fear that it will get worse if even possible at this point in time. They claim to not be from Earth, furthermore they claim to do us harm.

Went online to check local weather and current lighting strikes.  Nearest strike was in Abliene, TX.  Not a cloud in the sky. This got me curious, so I was looking in the sky for clouds or a storm.  Looking to the northwest low to the horizon (now about 5- 10 mins later), I saw 4-5 faint star looking objects floating around doing unbelievable manuvers. These objects would be moving slow at first, then at lighting speed change direction.  Sometimes you see only 1 at a time.  Sometimes two or three at a time.  The best I can describe it was it looked like a &quot;dog-fight&quot; between stars. They would move up and down, left to right,  figure eights, you name it, zig-zag, at all different speeds. Their speed was unbelievable.  This was not man-made!  Notified my wife and woke up my 8 yr. old son to witness.  My son got very scared and started crying, my wife couldn&apos;t comment.

Everyday I look out the window and try to figure out where exactly this thing was.  So, here&apos;s what you have asked me for:1)  my home address is ((address deleted)).  The rear of my apartment faces southwest.  I have a clear view of downtown Portland from this direction.  I am also to see the West Hills from my windows.  I only saw two lights and I have narrowed the vicinity of downtown to above the Brewery blocks (between N.W. 11th and N.W.  13th and N.W.  Burnside and N.W.  Davis streets).  It traveled very slowly, gliding almost, east past the USBancorp tower (between 5th and 6th avenue and Burnside) just passing it (but higher than the building, which is 470 feet approximately).  About three blocks after the tower it slowly turned south.  It continued for I would say a mile to a mile and a half.  The lights were still very clear, just a little faded. 2)  The angle of the lights was about 60 degrees.  These lights lasted about ten minutes or so in duration, without breaking or flashing.  These lights were amber in hue, but as I really studied them, I noticed that one of the lights might have been more red (I believe that there were three lights in a very small cluster).  My husband was with me at the time, and he will be filing an individual report this week.  We both stood there and watched these and discussed what it might be.  I guess we were trying to rationalize what we were seeing above a major metropolitan area.  Nothing made sense, nor does now.  They could have very easily been attached in some way though, for moving that slow, with absolutely no sound.  It is very quiet where I live, so we can hear anything flying in the sky.  There is a helipad five blocks away and we can hear them for a good ten to twelve blocks.  Especially that night, it was late in the evening and our building was silent.  There was hardly any traffic going by.I have already given my consent to an interview with the Oregonian.  You might also think about calling the Portland Tribune, it is an independent local newspaper.Let me know if you want that picture, I&apos;ll take it tonight and then one in the morning for a daylight shot.I have enclosed a map of where I live and other points of reference.Regards,((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM))", "The objects merged as one.Standing at Cranes Roost right by the New Watch Tower around 8:05PM.

I was saying good bye to a friend of mine and we walked outside and talked for a few minutes and I was just observing the passing planes and happened to look Northward.  A plane caught my eye (I could make out the blinking navigational lights) and then near it I saw a smaller light resembling a star.  I could not make out if it was moving or not until the strangest thing happened. The light appeared to increase in brightness almost instantly and accelerate northward quickly.  I pointed for my friend to see and he watched it with me as it grew increasing brighter, acclerated in speed and then definately moved north and then made a curve off to the left(westard) at steady turn(then moving NorthnorthWest) until we both could only see it with our peripheral vision before it finally dissappeared. The light was definately in a higher atmosphere, because I couldn&apos;t hear and noises and I could not make out navigational lights. It moved rather smoothly to the north on and performed it&apos;s turn with ease. I&apos;ve seen shooting stars and this was moving way too slow, even when it acclerated and the shooting stars I&apos;ve seen don&apos;t just steady turn, they have a basic straight course.  It&apos;s possible it could have been the afterburner of a jet engine, but my friend as well as myself could see the light dim before it increased into the vanishing white ball.  Another thing I would like to add was that there was no pulsation to the light, at least from my stand point, in Florida on a perfect evening with the right line of vision you can see miles. There were several planes in the air that night to make comparison to and none were acting in the manner this light was acting. After seeing it we both questioned ourselves because we&apos;ve been out several nights fishing in the darkest of areas and ever seen anything like what we observed that night.((NUFORC Note:  The ISS did not pass over Port Charlotte, FL, on this date, so is not a possible explanation for the event.

Pics werew taken from the western end of the city looking east. Of particular interest was the last frame shot at about 8 pm. I did not see this image at the time. I discovered it only when downloading the photos. It is about 3/4 up from the horizon, This frame (heavily cropped here) almost separately depicts the foreground and buildings, the moon, an elliptical image of apparently regular dimensions, containing a delta, or cone shaped object (image) concentrically disposed to the elliptical shape.Lens flare and lens dirt are eliminated by comparing this frame with others showing the ellipse, but not the inscribed delta image. The sky was clear and the evening cool and dry. The 8 megapixel camera was tripod mounted and triggered by IR remote. Exposure time of about 7 seconds was automatic, tungsten white balance, natural colour, 100 ASA, focal length about 50mm. Extra fine JPEG recording format.  2560 x 1920 pixels. (Web pics are low resolution 72 dpi)  In this photo the moon has a blurred image due to earth rotation during the camera exposure time. This may be explained as follows.[To observers rotating with the Earth, the moon appears to move along the Ecliptic at ~15 arc seconds per second. That amounts to 1/120th a moon diameter per second, or a full moon width (0.5&deg;) every 2 minutes. The apparent direction of the moon&apos;s motion depends on which hemisphere you&apos;re in. The moon&apos;s apparent motion is real enough to smear its shape and blur its surface features when telescopes or long exposures enter the picture. Courtesy http://dpfwiw.com/moon.htm#motion] Therefore, during 7 seconds camera exposure, the moon has moved 7/120ths its diameter  nearly 6%. Small wonder the moon is blurred.The buildings did not move. Neither did the cone/delta shape.This raises a question. An object at 30,000 feet or less is within earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and will fall due to gravity unless it is held aloft by some means that overcomes the force of gravity, such as wings on an aircraft.The photo shows that the delta/cone did not move in 6-8 seconds while the moon did.It follows that if the delta/cone image is about distant from earth as a jumbo jet and did not move relative to earth, it must have had some means to hold it stationary. Anti gravity technology is evident.Conversely, if the (image) object is so far distant that it may be in geo-stationary orbit (like some satellites that from earth appear as stars), then it is HUGE!", "A light that looked like a star but moved erractically left to right and in a circular pattern.We saw a light above the ocean. Initially, we thought it was a star, however it  was moving erraticallly.  It would be still for awhile then it would move to the left or right and make circle patterns.  Eratic movements best describes it but it never got closer.  Planes came and went and they looked totally different.

I did and at an altitude of about 10,000 feet (estimated, it was just above the normal flight plan of landing LAX planes) headed east bound right over downtown was what appeared to be a weather balloon, silver in color.  This ballon was shaped like a 3 dimensional polygon, the sides were triangular so I gues it would be described as a dodecahedron.  I looked closer and saw several dark collered what looked like jet airplanes with curved back wingtips in hot pusuit of this weather balloon.  Just then a friend of mine walked up and wondered what I was looking at.  I showed him and he saw the same thing (a big releif!).  Just then the Balloon stopped in mid flight just east of downtown Los Angeles.  The &quot;jets&quot; that were in hot pursuit split off in formation and began circling the baloon (i.e. the first plane went let, second went right, third left and so on).  The Balloon stated to spin at about 10 rpm.  More and more &quot;jets&quot; began to appear and I counted maybe 20 of them at this point.  After holding in this position for about 2 minutes the baloon took off stright up at a rapid and controlled rate and the jets broke the circular formation and followed right behind the balloon in a straight line, straight up until I could no longer see them with the naked eye.  The speed was comprable to a space shuttle launch but there was no noise, no smoke or trails.  I heard no unusual sound and the only thing I noticed is this was taking place in the normal flight plan that planes land at LAX and during the entire time of the sighting no other air traffic was seen or heard.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was sort of oval-shaped and moving in slow motion.The movement of the thing was weird.  It was sort of flipping over in the sky - like a coin would move if you tossed it.  As it was flipping over and over the edges of the object seemed to glow a sort of bright golden colour.  The sun was behind us.  This object was moving toward the sun very very methodically and slowly.I timed this thing with my watch.  It moved just over our heads and eventually disappered as I lost it in the glare of the sun.  The whole event lasted about 10 minutes.  To this day, I still have not got a clue as to what this thing was.  It was definately being controlled - but by what.Since that sighting, my son has seen the same object 2 times more recently.  It always seems to appear in the Toxteth area of Liverpool.  My son said that, again, it was tossing in the sky, moving very slowly and the edges of the object were gleaming a golden colour.  The last two sightings of this object were 2005.  In all cases, the object was silent.", "Fuzzy lights over Naples, FLTake this for what you will...While walking my dog, around 5:30am, behind the hotel I am staying at, I noticed 4 very fuzzy/hazy pale yellow lights traveling South to North at a very high rate of speed.  They were in what appeared to be the &quot;Missing Man Formation&quot;..which would seem to be an obvious explanation to the sighting, however, this occured about an hour before sunrise on a moonless, for the most part cloudless, morning.  The &quot;lights&quot; were also oval in shape, and absolutely no sound could be heard of any type of jet engine.  I observed them moving across the sky for about 10 seconds, before they disappeared into a cloud bank to the far north of where I was standing.  A few seconds later, the cloudbank lit up from what I would normally assume was lightning...but...after after seeing those lights, I&apos;m not so sure.  I have a novice interest in astronomy, and observe the nighttime sky regularily...so to see this really caught my eye.", "At 2:20am a very powerful explosion sound occurred. It shook my entire house, woke the neighbors and set off car alarms throughout the neighborhood. A co-worker living over 2 miles away felt and heard the exact same sound and vibration.

I come from a family of five and my father is a well known surgeon in the area.  I am currently finishing a BS degree at a well known university studying Geog and Gis etc.  Unfortunatly I recently fell victom to Leukemia and had to take some time off school.  I ve been watching alot of History channel etc on ufos and when I can I sometimes listen to coast to coast, (unless I just can&apos;t bear to listen to some of the bs from some people). Well one night, I was lying outside on my deck on a recliner looking up at the clear dark sky.  When all of a sudden a cigar shaped craft with green glowing like airplain windows flew over my house moving at the speed of a falling star except it stoped and I think looked at me and then resumed from 0  to the speed of a falling star and went twards the SFO airport and curved as it left.  Never the less this was no falling star.  I&apos;ve done some reasearch on the ufo subject and what bothers me most about it are all the people who have everything to loose and nothing to gain by coming forward with knoweldge of this subject.  I hope this is helpfull to someone.  Also I do beleive if you concentrate on seeing a ufo enough it could appear (maby they are able to focus on thought) however I dont suggest it.  I will never forget what I saw (almost like a cartoon?) but I know that man dos not have this technology even today.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My son called me on the Balcony at that point, and together we saw them going trough the clouds in a very smooth random pattern, (following the smaller light that I could not see probably because of the clouds),the movement was smooth and swaying like the course that fishes swimming in a pond would take.

The aircraft were travelling west.  The size was about the size of the stars in the constellations which indicated high altitude.  The distance covered during the period of time they were in my view indicated a very high speed.  The 3 red aircraft were traveling parallel ahead of the 2 white aircraft.  The 2 white aircraft would move ahead of each other and diagonally across the width of the 3 red aircraft.  1 of the 3 red aircraft stopped for approx 5 seconds and the white aircraft increased their speed and caught up to the 2 red aircraft.  The 1 red aircraft then quickly travelled towards the 4 aircraft in a zig zag sort of pattern and passed the 4 aircraft.

I watched this little dot of light, indistinguishable from other stars in the clear night sky, dart around and make 90degree turns, then move only slowly for a while (like blowing on the upper winds) then return to it&apos;s post DIRECTLY above Furnace Creek.  I heard no sounds. The way it was moving, i don&apos;t think it could be anything our human technology is capable of.

I heard my fellow employees calling for another employee to come outside to see something.  A few minutes later, another employee came in and asked if me and a few others if we wanted to see a &quot;blimp.&quot;  We walked outside, and approximately 500 feet in front of me, and approximately 500-1000 feet in the air (about the height of an average radio tower), we saw three lights in a triangular formation (one green light on top, two white lights below).  On of the lights might have been flashing slowly.  There was no silouette or object that we could make out for them to be connected to, it was as black as the night sky.  Below, but from our view unconnected to the lights, was a flat, bottomside of a rectangle, which was not necessarily illuminated, but had a grayish tint to it (like it was reflecting the moon, kind of thing), and it didn&apos;t appear to be connected to anything.  The object was motionless. We watched it for approximately 10 minutes without it moving, and the night was silent.  It seemed that the employees who had called it a &quot;blimp&quot; were assuming that&apos;s what it was because there was no solid shape, outline, or reflection (other than the previously mentioned rectangle) to be seen.  It did NOT look like a blimp. I went back inside to call my husband who was working at another worksite about 1.5-2 miles north and east of me, and asked him if he could see anything.  He informed me that others were already going outside to look at something, and that he would go check as soon as he could.  He was unable to go out for apprx. 30 minutes, but when he did, was able to see a &quot;side&quot; view of lights.  I assumed what I was seeing was a &quot;rear&quot; view because when I went back outside to check on it around midnight, it was about 1000 feet away instead of 500 feet. I was able to find a website that had blimp schedules for 2006, and there were no scheduled blimp flights in our area for May at all, as they were all in the South for golf tournaments and the Kentucky Derby.  There was no sound or motion to indicate a jet or helicopter.  Having grown up on a Navy base in S. California, I am quite familiar with all kinds of aircraft, and the sounds that they make...even the Stealth fighters and bombers make some noise.  This object made no noise, had little to no movement, and had no form.  Those of us who observed this object at my workplace had mixed opinions as to what this object was, ranging from a military experiment to UFO&apos;s, but we were all clear that the object was NOT a blimp.  I did not see it leave, although an employee that works with my husband reported seeing it, looking away for a moment, then looking back at it, and it was missing from the sky.", "The UFO was the shape of a triangle, and each corner of the triangle was a dotted circle.

The sky was completely clear except for a couple very smeall, very thin, barely visible clouds and there was not even a hint of a breeze out. At first I thought it was a bird - the kind that can flap their wings fast enough to just remain relatively motionless, which I have observed on several other occasions - but then I saw a crow fly directly in front of it and it just remained totally motionless although it did seem to be quite a distance off behind the crow but still I didn&apos;t notice any kind of movement whatsoever from the object for quite some time, probably a good 2 to 3 minutes or so. Then I thought it was a kite but then rejected that thought immediately since there was absolutely no wind or even so much as a hint of a breeze. Then I thought that it was a baloon of some sort but couldn&apos;t justify why it would just sit there completely motionless for such a long time - at least 2 to 3 minutes. I went in to get my digital camera and it was still there when I got back but unfortunately the batteries in the camera needed recharging so I wasn&apos;t able to get any footage of it.

At first, I thought it was a blimp, but I found it peculiar that it did not move.  Even more surprising, the object moved away at incredibly high speed and accelerated faster than anything I have seen before.  The object was &quot;cigar&quot; shaped and looked very similar to a silver blimp.  The most unusual thing about this object is that as it flew away in the opposite direction, I noticed that the object became &quot;transparent&quot; and eventually it dissapeared completely.  I could see clouds through the object like it was a semi-transparent mirror.  The effect was similar to the stuff you see in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

While doing so, I noticed a very bright light in the sky, larger than a star, which was changing colors, hovering and moving slightly up and down, which was located in the ESE sky.I called for my live in boyfriend to observe as well, in which he did.  We watched the object for a good ten to fifteen minutes, as it appeared to hover, and make only slight movement in the sky, mostly in an up and down motion, but sometimes slightly back and forth.  The object appeared to grow brighter and dimmer at times, but did not seem to be &apos;traveling,&apos; like a plane.In the center of this object, stretching horizontally across the object, the lights emanating from the object changed colors frequently, and one could clearly distinguish that this was not a star or planet.My boyfriend and myself both noted that this was not a star or planet from it&apos;s slight movements, and the line of lights which changed colors, and noted that it was not like any aircraft which we normally see from where we live, because of it&apos;s movements, and sometimes the lack thereof.  We heard no noise from this object.I began cooking supper, but occasionally checked back on the object, which was there several times when I checked on it, but eventually disappeared.One interesting note, in another account of the January sighting, the person witnessed the UFO on the 15th, we witnessed it on the 19th, however, the witness was on HWY 301, which is not far from our house.  We live on Cahoon Rd, off Normandy Blvd, which runs into, and ends at HWY 301.   Normandy Blvd., Jacksonville, FL 32205  This incident can be verified by my current boyfriend of 4 years.  I did notice several conventional style aircraft flying in the same area that night which may be able to substantiate this story further. ..................................................................................... 2) The electrical assault incidence:  This may sound very strange, but on my word of honor, this is the truth, and did in fact happen.In 2003 or 2004, my memory escapes me as to which year exactly in which this occurred but, one afternoon I was washing dishes at the same address as the above incidence, and I was alone in my house, as my live in boyfriend was at work.  I became aware of a strange frequency which I could hear which seemed especially &apos;targeted&apos; at my right ear.  This frequency was a lower pitch than the frequencies I normally pick up on from time to time, and seemed strange that it seemed &apos;targeted&apos; at the right ear, instead of being heard by both of them.  What was also strange was this frequency was also felt as well as heard.  As I experienced this frequency, I also experienced a strange sensation in my head, almost like a slight stun to my brain.  Though I found this to be quite odd, it did not become unpleasant until a few seconds later when from this frequency I suddenly experienced what felt like an electric shock to the upper right side of my head, which felt like I was being zapped by a stun gun!  This immediately brought me to my knees!  After about a minute, I returned to my feet, (quite startled, scared and somewhat pissed off), only for this to happen once again! Immediately after somewhat regaining my composure, I grabbed a pistol and searched the house for an intruder and a possible explanation, but I discovered that I was indeed alone in the house, with the doors locked.  I had never before experienced anything like this, nor have I since, however I am now quite frightened when I hear frequencies.I debated with myself the idea of calling up the military to see if they were doing some kind of military weapons testing using frequencies, but declined to do so, as it dawned on me that they probably would not tell me the truth, and them knowing I would sue them for testing on me, I figured that it probably might not be a good idea, as they could (and would), probably kill me by zapping me, if they chose to, rather than being sued, if this occurrence was a result of military testing.  I also pondered that this may be UFO related, as I have had &apos;other&apos; strange occurrences happen in my lifetime, which I suspect could be UFO related.I have no answers or explanation as to who is responsible, or why this incidence happened, but would truly would like the answer to this.  Have you ever come across any instances like this in your research?  If so, would you please share them with me?  Any input on this is greatly appreciated! ..................................................................................... 3) Time loss incidence #2:  In early spring of 1997, I was traveling from Louisville KY, on my way home to Jacksonville, (I lived on the Northside of Jacksonville at this time, but was spending time with my boyfriend at the time, who was a mechanical engineer working in Louisville, while my best friend stayed at my house, held down the fort and cared for my dogs.  One of my dogs was in the pound, and I went home to rescue my dog.) I had stopped at the Pio-Ono (GA) exit on 1-75 late at night, to get gas and coffee, before leaving the parking lot, I put in a fresh 90 minute cassette tape, of some recorded music, (45 minutes per side), which had CCR on one side and Aretha Franklin on the other.  The tape was rewound before I left the parking lot, as I used 90 minute cassette tapes to help &apos;time&apos; the trip.I got back on I-75 headed south, (I was quite sure of this), and was on my way down the road.  In what seemed like just a few minutes back on the road, I went to take a sip of my coffee, and it was cold, at this point I knew something was weird, as I had just bought the coffee moments before, and it was quite hot at the time, and I take creamer in my coffee, and powdered creamer does NOT dissolve in less than hot liquid, yet the creamer in my coffee was perfectly dissolved.  I then became suddenly aware that the tape I was listening to was well into the other (Aretha) side, and I had not changed it! I kept going on my journey to spite the strange occurrence, pondering an explanation.  A few moments later, I discovered that I was not traveling South as I was sure that I was, but was headed North instead.  (I was starting to weird out at this point).I got off the next exit, and turned around, and started heading South again.  It took me about 20 minutes to reach the Pio-Ono exit once again, and it was at this point, that I understood that I had experienced another time loss episode.  I later told my best friend, and boyfriend (at the time), about the incident, which you can contact both of them concerning this...................................................................................... 1996 UFO sighting, Jacksonville FL:  One evening while sitting home enjoying an evening alone, (no boyfriend in this incidence LOL, and this event took place at my Northside Jacksonville residence, the same one as the incidence above), I was lounging on the couch, listening to music, and I happened to look out the window at the night sky, and noticed an object fitting the exact same description of the UFO in the #1 sighting in the sky.  I observed it just hovering there, moving slightly up and down and sometimes back and forth growing sometimes dimmer, sometimes brighter, and changing colors.  I realized it had to be a UFO.I watched this object for a good half an hour, when my roomate/friend came home, and I told him about the object.  He checked it out, agreed that it was probably a UFO, and after a while, he went to his room, where I did not see him for the rest of the night.I watched the object for a while longer, and suddenly it just disappeared like a light being turned off! This can be verified by my ex-roomate. ..................................................................................... Time loss incident #1, Jacksonville, FL, 1994:  About 10:45 PM, I went to the convenience store to fetch a soda and a pack of cigarettes before the store closed at 11.  I lived on Deerfield Lane in the sticks off of Starrat Road in North Jacksonville.  This was the only store for about 5 miles, and wanted to get there before the store closed.  This store was only about one half mile away from my home, so the entire trip usually only took 15 minutes tops, even if I stopped to chat with someone, or their was a line, etc.  It was the norm for me to put off making the trip until the last minute, because at the time I was writing a book, and was very much caught up in the process of doing so.When I left, my boyfriend Brian, was sitting in the recliner watching TV.  This too was the norm, as he would retire for the evening customarily after I made my evening run to the store.I went to the store, got my RC and smokes, and headed back home as usual.  When I returned home, the lights in the house were dimmed, and the TV was off.  I thought this very strange.  I started feeling quite spooked for some strange reason, which is NOT the norm for me.  I walked in the door, and there was a very pissed off Brian waiting for me interrogating me as to where I had been!  Of course, I thought he had lost his mind, as I had just been to the store and back as usual.I asked Brian if he had lost his mind, and explained/protested that I had just been to the store and back as usual.  This infuriated him, as he said that I had not been just to the store, that the store has been closed for hours, he began ranting and raving about how he went up there looking for me, I was nowhere to be found, how he called my best friend, blah, blah, blah, and pointed at the clock and said it doesn&apos;t take 3 hours to go a half a mile to the store, blah, blah, blah, and proceeded to have a conniption!  I looked at the clock and it was after 2 AM!  I then thought that he had lost his mind, AND was picking a fight with me, that he had moved the hands on the clock.He then tells me to call my best friend Brenda, and let her know I got home safely.  I did.I found out then that Brian had not moved the hands on the clock, that in fact I had a strange and unexplainable time loss eppisode.  (I&apos;m still not convinced that Brian had not lost his mind though, from the conniption he threw.  I then nick named Brian, &quot;Flyin&apos; Brian&quot;.  LOL.)  Brenda had been very worried about me, as was Brian.I could not explain what had happened during that time, but after that, everytime I had to travel down that stretch of road between the convenience store and home, I was terrified, though I could not offer any logical explanation as to why! Shortly after that, I began having &quot;nightmares&quot; in which I could swear I was awake, and these things were happening to me.  I would pinch and even slap myself to make sure I was not dreaming but....I would &apos;dream&apos; that I would be awakened by a presence in the room.  I would get up, look around and sometimes there would be typical greys, sometimes no &apos;seen&apos; being was there, but a presence was felt none the less.I would try to wake up (Flyin&apos;) Brian, but never could wake him up when this happened.In this dream, I would wake up, and get up and look out the bedroom window into the field out back which was covered in blackberry briars, and sandy Florida soil, with dips in it, where it was not exactly driveable, and see lights like 8 or ten vehicles lined up outside, complete with dust and sand flying up, in this field.  I could swear that I was awake, but apparently this was a dream, because the next day when I would inspect the field where the lights were, no vehicle tracks were apparent, nor were the blackberry thickets matted down.  This was a fairly regular occurrence.  And like I said, the field was not exactly drivable.Brian and I broke up not long after that, and to this day, I refuse to go down that stretch of road.This incidence can be verified by my ex-boyfriend Brian, and ex-best friend Brenda as well. ..................................................................................... Fall 1986, UFO sighting, New Bern, NC:  One evening in the Fall of 1986, I went country cruising with a friend and coworker and we decided to take a break from riding, and parked in the Croatan State Park just East of New Bern, NC, and not far from Cherry Point Marine base.  Yes, we had parked to smoke a joint, as hey, we were in our mid-twenties at the time, and to just talk.  (I am now in my mid-fourties, and no longer smoke weed.) As we were sitting in my friend&apos;s truck smoking the tater and chatting, we noticed an object, that again matches the description and maneuvers of the other UFO&apos;s in the above instances.Both of us, having lived in the area for quite some time were quite aware of the aircraft, military and otherwise, which flew regularly over the area.  This was NOT the normal aircraft which we were accustomed to seeing, and no, the pot was not especially spectacular either.The next day, there were articles in the paper about a rash of UFO sightings seen across the US and the world.This can be substanciated by my friend. About 6 months, maybe less before this incidence, my mother told me in the strictest of confidence, and after much prying as to what was bothering her, that she was hearing &apos;signals&apos; one night, kind of like when one hears frequencies, only in something like Morse Code.My mother lived directly across the street from me, and I did not hear them.  My mother never drank or smoked a tater in her life, didn&apos;t take so much as an aspirin, and was a very honest, Christian woman. ..................................................................................... Fall of 1978 UFO sighting, Hendersonville, NC:  About 2 weeks before I was to be married, my mother and I were sitting up discussing &quot;if I was sure I really wanted to get married or not&quot; mother and daughter speech.  It was a pleasant night, and we were sitting on the couch with the lights off, and the windows open to her 2nd floor apartment.Mom alerted me to check out the object in the sky.  The object, again matching the same characteristics and maneuvers as the ones in the accounts stated above, only with the slight difference, that there was one large one, and three other smaller vessels which moved about in the sky around the larger one.  They would move in directions that clearly differentiated them from any aircraft we had ever encountered or knew of, and would change colors in tandem with the larger craft.Sometimes these vessels would hover in a triangular pattern around the main vessel, and at times zig-zagged about, or go straight up and down.  We watched these crafts for about 25 minutes, until all of a sudden they took off at tremendous speeds.  We knew from the speed they were traveling, that these had to be UFO&apos;s.Unfortunately, my mother is no longer with us to substantiate this story, she died in early 1987 of a rare disease, sideroblastic anemia.  My ex-husband however, can substantiate that Mom and I told him about the incident.", "On 5/6/06 at 10:20 PM we spotted a big round ball of light moving swifly across the sky in Newburgh, NY.What my husband and I observed was a large ball of light similar to a shooting star (although it was 10 to 15 times larger in size than your average shooting star)moving East to West as we were traveling home on Saturday May 6, 2006 at 10:20 PM. We were approaching Rtes 32 and Rte 300 in the Town of Newburgh, NY when we spotted the sight.  I stared at the light (once I spotted it) following it for approximately 30 seconds before it shot up now in a northerly direction, disappearing leaving a tail at the end that eventually vanished also.", "Daylight Cigar shaped UFO sighting, with Witness!What you are about to read is quite unbelieveable. But I swear on my familys life that what I say is true and even have a witness whom saw exactly what I did.. And it changed my life forevermore... The year was 86.  I was 17.My friend and I were driving on a rural country road/hwy, just outside the town of Louisville KY on a fine clear summer day.The time was about 4:30pm. I was riding shotgun and enjoying the nice country drive when something caught my attention through the corner of my eye off to the left of the highway.  I noticed something large hovering over a wooded area about a quarter mile away.  At first I thought &quot;what in the world is that?&quot;  It was a silvery metallic cigar shaped craft that was probably at least a hundred feet long.  It was in a vertical position, just hanging there motionless maybe a hundred feet above the treetops.I pointed this curiosity out to my friend who was just as puzzeled as I.I figured it must be a weather ballon or something like that.But...I have never seen anything even re similar in appearance in my 17 years of life. There were no appendages, wings, motors, rotors, windows, Nothing! It was a solid metallic shape that reflected the suns rays brilliantly.My friend and I were looking at the object trying to figure out what it was, when, in the blink of an eye it was gone!  I was quite excited and scared.Eagerly we scanned the skies around where it had been, looking for it, but it was nowhere to be found.  Maybe 30 seconds later, while looking on the OTHER side of the expressway from where it had been, I saw it hanging there motionless again.Yelling &quot;there it is!&quot;  I pointed to my friend where it was, and we both watched it for several seconds.  Then, right before our very eyes, it disappeared slowly, as if it was cloaking, or dematerializing.It just faded out to nothing.  It did not move away.  It just disappeared.We were speechless.  I told family and friends but no one believed me, even with my friend as witness.I cannot describe how I felt, but know that this event convinced me to research what I saw, and over the years I have found much. Having seen this firsthand, I have opened my eyes to accept what others cannot.Many people have seen exactly what I have, all over the world.I don&apos;t know what it was that I saw, but it was broad daylight when we saw it, so there is no questionable night time issues here.In my opinion this was no government secret project/craft.1. The technology was far too advanced.2.  The speed used would have broken a humans neck, or the G forces involved would have been impossible for a human to withstand.3.  As far as I know , no government on earth has craft cloaking/dematerializing abilities. This has bothered the hell out of me for 20 years. It could be a government project, but I seriously doubt it.Having seen what I have, I honestly believe we are being visted by beings from another world.  Before I die, my one wish in this world is to truly know what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Odd light changing color, seemed to worry dog.At first I thought it was an iridium satellite.  It went from west to east in the northern sky, it was a blue/white light.  Once it got to the almost due east part of the sky, it no longer kept the linear path.  It started going side to side, and I thought it must be a plane on a confused path.  When it was going east it was blue/white, when it was going west it was red/white.  When it was red, my dog would look up at it and whine, when it was blue again he would stop.  This went on for a while (I had no watch) then it turned east again after going back and forth, turned very red and disappeared.  It was quite odd.  I checked the iridium paths tonight and saw none for this area of the sky at this time.  While is was going east originally, when it was almost to the spot where it started back and forth, a jet was coming from the south east to the west north west.  The jet was accompanied by a jet sound as it came across, this light did not.  I had no optics to look closer at the light.  It could have been a plane and I would have thought nothing of it if it wasn&apos;t for my dog whining when it was going west in its oscillations.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I looked at my clock which said 12:05 which startled me because I thought it was noon and was supposed to have met my daughter in town at 7:45 a.m. A closer look at clock made me realize it was midnight, not noon, since the display did not say &quot;p.m.&quot;. I ran around house and looked out windows. It was so light that I could see distant neighbors houses. I live on top of a mountain near a river in a very rural area and there are no street lights. Usually, night time is pitch black unless there&apos;s a full moon.  But even full moons don&apos;t light up the night like this &quot;light&quot; was. I looked up in sky and could see the moon which didn&apos;t even appear to be a quarter of a moon. The sky appeared cloudy. I knew light wasn&apos;t coming from moon but was too scared to go outside to try to determine what was lighting up the sky so brightly.  There were no flashes or bright objects that I could see by looking out all the windows. The light had a strange cast to it, not quite like normal daylight but just as bright as day time. The trees and plants were sparkling. I was very scared and locked myself in bedroom with my dog who acted strangely also. Since it was midnight I didn&apos;t call anyone but just layed in bed as the strange light came in windows.  I felt strange and subdued and frozen to my bed. I felt like I was sedated and the time seemed to be passing by faster than normal. These sensations could have been caused by my extreme fright though, and not be an outside force. It crossed my mind that the lit-up night was due to a huge craft hoovering over the house. I heard no sounds. I never slept but finally the real sunlight came with dawn and the strange light was gone. I have a friend who works nights as a security guard. I called her up later in the morning and asked her if she had noticed anything strange the night before without telling her about my experience. She said that she was driving home some time after 11:00 p.m. on 4/6/06 and as she approached Nevada City that the night sky seemed to be like day time. She said she had the feeling of a huge space craft hoovering above her car as she drove but she never saw one. I then told her what I had experienced just an hour after she had seen it. It had scared her also but she had tried to tell herself that it must have just been a strange weather phenomenon. I live on top of the mountain. She lives on my road but a couple of miles down the mountain.", "Flash over Bucharest, mid day - very strangeI was taking my luch break alone, in the yard of the building I work.

I could tell the craft was moving in the same direction I was. I saw small lights of reddish orange in what appeared to be the back of the craft. It was about the size of a large home. I have never seen any craft that ever loked as unique or as impressive as this one. I looked at the craft for only about 10 seconds due to my driving at night. The craft quickly disappeared. When I arrived home, my brother in law discribed seeing the same green craft coming out of the sky and hovering behind trees about 5-8 minutes before I saw the craft. He mentioned that while he was driving, another car in front of him must have seen the craft also because they put on their brakes and slowed down. He thought it was going to crash on or near the road due to it&apos;s descending angle towards the ground.", "WHILE I WAS TAKING A WALK I SAW TWO TINY DOTS IN THE SKY.Well I left my house. I was walking to TACO BELL. It was on 04/29/2006 on a Saturday evening at 7:00 P.M. Something in the sky caught my eye. I saw 2 little dots in the sky. I don&apos;t know what it was. It wasn&apos;t a plane or star I saw in the sky. I don&apos;t know rather it was a weather balloon. But there was a plane in the area. But there were two tiny dots in the sky about anywhere from 5.000 to 20.000 feet. But the two little dots I saw in the sky were moving. I was looking to the northwest and saw these little dots in the sky then they went under a cloud and I lost sight of them. I kept looking and couldn&apos;t see them no more.

I was heading to take the Couch St./Burnside St. Exit. Just before I approached the exit, I noticed to my left in the sky at about a forty five degree angle two very bright, orange in color objects. One was at a complete standstill. There was another object, closely approaching very slowly as if to meet up with the object standing still. It came from the south. When it reached the first object it then was at a standstill with the first object. Then coming from the North, a little farther left from the two objects that were at a stand still, was another object which looked exactly the same as the first two. As it neared the first two objects, the first two objects started to move away very, very slowly to the south as the third object was heading closer to them from the north. I noticed an airplane, which came from the north and heading south near the now, three objects. I couldn&apos;t tell if the airplane was going to fly under the objects or just near them.  I also wasn&apos;t sure if the airplane was flying towards them to check them out or if it was just there coincidentally at the time.  The airplane was smaller than a passenger airplane and looked to be flying considerably low. I could see the lights and the shape of this craft and it definitely was an airplane. The other objects were not like this airplane at all. The objects looked like they were a little higher than the airplane. I really can&apos;t say how high the plane or objects were. The plane flew past the objects that were heading south.  Then I noticed a fourth object coming from the north just behind the third object as I took the Couch St Exit and turned left onto Couch St. heading east. I followed the four objects as they were heading in a S/SE direction. I was still heading east on Couch St. The four objects were flying very, very slowly now to my right at about a forty five degree angle.  I came to a stop sign on Couch and I looked directly up from my front windshield at about a 90 degree angle and noticed two more objects directly above my car. They were bright, orange in color objects that appeared to be fiery, or on fire. I really tried to get a focus on them, but could only notice the glow and haze which seemed to be in motion, almost like a candle&rsquo;s flickering. The two objects were at a stand still. I know this because I was at a complete stop, too.  About one minute later the two objects proceeded very, very slowly to the S/SE. They also started to change in size of glow. They got smaller and then bigger again as they headed S/SE.   When they got smaller they looked more like stars.  The other four objects had  just left my view as I noticed the two objects that were directly above me.   A few blocks down I came to another stop.  I kept waving to cars on my right to continue after their stop as I was at a four way stop.  Me and my two friends were watching the four earlier objects as they moved slowly, S/SE above a  white building that had  some  radar like items and other things on top of the building.  The objects looked like they were much higher than the building as their glow got smaller as they moved S/SE.  We were at this stop sign watching for about three minutes or so.  Then we proceeded down Couch street to NW Broadway and along the way would still notice the objects as they headed S/SE.  I turned right at NW Broadway and headed into a parking lot that used to be a Burger King and my friend called 911.  They gave her the phone number to the UFO Center.  I called the UFO Center in Washington State and gave my report.  As I gave my report I was watching the last two objects  that at one point was right above my car, fly off in the distance heading S/SE.  They looked like two stars flying away in the distance with one on top of the other.  They looked to be about an inch apart as they drifted still very, very slowly and then eventually fading away.((NUFORC Note:  One of several sighting reports from residents of Portland.

No sound or lights!I was assigned to the local high school, as a Deputy Sheriff, to provide security for the school against student vandalism. While sitting in my patrol car I was using our night-vision monocular, which was issued to me for this assignment, to observe the sky as it was a clear morning. A few minutes later something dark in the sky caught my attention through the lens. This object was not visible to the naked eye, however, the night-vison unit accentuates any available light and this in-turn illuminated the stars brightly. The object was visible to me only because it blocked out the stars in the sky&apos;s background thus it was clearly and sharply defined although black in color. The object was moving from West to East with absolutely no sound. My environment at the school parking lot was totally quiet with only an occasional passing car on Highway 129N which is located approximately 1,000 ft. from my location. The object had no lights and did not illuminate whatsoever. The object&apos;s shape was something akin to a cross with two differences: 1. Picture a cross with the horizontal portion moved forward near the top but not quite. 2. There was another horizontal portion visible towards the rear. That portion was not as wide as the forward horizontal postion. Also, all portions, especially the horizontals, were about 25% broader than what you would expect on a standard (?) cross. Obviously the size/altitude could not be determined, nor the speed. However, the night-vison I was using does not magnify and I would estimate that the apparent size from my view, if you took a coin in an outstretched hand, appeared about the size of a quarter-dollar. My viewing time was around a couple of minutes. I lost sight of the object due to the awkward angle of trying to crane my neck from right to left as it moved across the sky. I exited my vehicle to further look for it, however I could not. As a retired professional pilot of 20 years . . .I have seen many things I could not immediately explain, however, none of them remained a mystery for more than a few minutes.  This object is absolutely un-explainable to me and I have had two years to ponder it. I DO NOT believe in extraterrestrial craft at this point and I am certainly a dyed-in-the-wool skeptic on such matters. I cannot conceive of a rational explanation.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I left the security gate of her families home alone.  This is a tremendous huge beach front mansion. The short of it is this.  My girlfriend (who is an indirect witness) called me and told me to come home.  We were staying about 45 minutes away up in Lake Sherwood (a gated community in the Santa Monica Mountains. Knowing I had to go.  I said good bye to the few people I new and headed out the front gate and up the football field drive to the PCH.  I was parked (my 1990 black Bronco) across facing North on the road before me. The road was dark and there was no one or a car around.  I walked across the road and went to open the drivers side door and get in.  Simple enough.  Not thinking of anything but getting home. But rather then getting in the truck before I even opened the door the last think I remember were my feet lifting and my balance going backward like I was slipping but my feet we already off the ground.  Then everything in my mind went black. The first part is not that scary but it is the next part that I have trouble sharing.  I do not remember an abduction or aliens of a ship nothing. I woke up about a mile or so north of the PCH in the low hills of the Santa Monica Mountains.  I need to talk to you I can&apos;t write the rest of this down it is very upseting.

Then it shot up in the air, slowly descended, then it went straight across the sky, it shot down in an arc behind the hills, then re-appeared even closer to me (about a quarter km), which freaked me out a little, and it was at this point that I realised it was a disk shaped object, with really bright lights on the bottom, the center appeared to be red-orange, but at times almost dark pink? In the night sky it appeared to be gray-purple color, but that could have been reflections since the sky was a similar color..the object moved across the sky behind me, made no noise at all, and I lost sight of it due to the trees behind me but I could still see the lights through the trees. It was then I noticed how close it came to my position when I could see about 150 yards in the direction of the object the light flickering down illuminating the ground. I felt a strange &quot;charge&quot; in the air, like in a lightning storm, and my hair on my arms and neck were stood up..the next thing I knew I couldn&apos;t see it anymore, and I turned to my right to see if the object was going to emerge on the other side of the trees, and it didn&apos;t emerge where and when I thought it would, but when I glanced over my right shoulder there it was hovering in the air about 300 yards or more away and it took off like a shooting star (left a light trail or blur) upwards and I got such a fright I had to sit down and have a cigarette. I  had this feeling it was watching me for that second, but I am not sure if it was the same object or another object that I never noticed since my attention was on the first object. This was my 3rd strange sighting at Gagetown while I was a Reservist but the only time I actually saw anything up close.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Studied astronomy, physics and engineering.  Very down to earth person.  I don&apos;t look for phenomena, but have always had a major interest in the natural world.  I quest for knowledge in all my endeavors.  I not easily swayed, I seek facts and details. I could go further, but that being said, here&apos;s my event. February 2006;  I was driving home late at night, ~12:00 a.m. from my shop.  My girlfriend was with me at this time.  We were heading north on I-15.  Just passed California Oaks off ramp, we both noticed a very bright light hovering just above the horizon about NW, 10:30 from our position.  It was very strange in that there was no traffic in our direction.  No lights ahead and one set of lights very far behind us.  Very unusual for the busy I-15.  We commented on the brightness of the lights.  Like they were pointed right at us.  They were brighter than any aircraft lights I&apos;ve ever seen.  But there were 3 together but distinctly separate.  We thought it may be a helicopter.  It moved ever so slightly towards us, maintaining it&apos;s altitude.  We continued to comment on the strangeness.  As we approached Bundy Canyon, the object seemed to start to draw a bead on us.  Again there was oddly no other traffic in our direction, but a sporadic car passing on the opposite side heading south. As we passed Bundy the object was now even with us and within a 1/4 mile to the direct West of us and falling slightly behind us, say to the 8:00 position.  It&apos;s altitude was maybe 200&apos;.  It then turned and maintained running parallel to our direction exactly off at 9:00.  It maintained that distance for ~ 1/4 mile, then moved in to us.  It continued to fly directly over the truck.  I become very uneasy and speed up to around 100 mph, because I felt like it may hit us.  It flew directly above us for maybe a 1/2 mile and then started to veer off to the East and disengaged slowly.  I could not see it off the passenger side except for just a couple of glimpses.  My girlfriend continued to eye it.  She said it then shot off to the East at an extremely high rate of speed.  Faster than a jet she said. Strange facts:  NO noise.  This object made NO noise, even flying about 100&apos; above us. Three aircraft type landing lights up front and two of the same type lights in the assumed &quot;Rear&quot; of the object. NO traditional navigation lights or strobes. And the most amazing aspect of all is that there was no visible body.  We could not make out any physical type of structure to the object.  NO wings, NO fuselage, NO body.  Just lights and void between the lights.  Even as the object came over head, we could not see any type of body.  The object did appear to be circular only becuase of the way the lights were positioned. I figured you may like to add this sighting to what ever compilation you may have. You may contact me anytime if you would like to ask any further questions. Thank you((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was a clear day ,I mean no rain,a little cloudy, but average portland spirng day.I looked up and a triange shaped craft came straight down from clouds.Im guessing it was 150-200 ft from ground.  It leveled off in one swift movement, and stopped.I mean stopped on a dime! I saw no exhaust,nor did I see any lights.  It made no sound,but i was in a car.   Its color was black-ish.It hovered for about15 seconds.  Then with one swift movement it went straight up.  Fast-like a bullet,it was gone.

Ego talking? maybe not!", "Large red ball of light that multiplied into four separate lights at tree level, white lights flying at high altitudes.I was sitting inside the house watching TV when a flash of light in the southern sky caught my attention. It was a very clear night, and I saw multiple white lights moving across the sky at high altitudes independently of each other. I don&apos;t think they were satellites because they did not move in a steady line across the sky, instead they zig-zagged from east to west. As I was standing outside watching the lights, a large red ball of light appeared above the tree line in the southern sky. I was so frightened that I got in my car and drove 4 miles down the road to get my neighbor so he could see what i was seeing. He wasn&apos;t there so I went back home, hoping they would be gone. It was there again (or still) and then seemed to split or multiply. The second ball of light emerged in front of the first one, the third emerged from the second one, and by the time there was four lights I had gotten in my car and was speeding to another neighbor&apos;s house. By the time we got back it was gone, but the white lights were still in the southern and western sky. My neighbor thought that they might be military aircraft watching the American/Canadian border. I had no idea who to contact, so it wasn&apos;t documented at all. I&apos;ve never witnessed any type of activity like this before, so it really makes me curious as to what I may have seen.", "Dark shiny cylinderI was at work on the afternoon of May 28th 2004 when I noticed out the window that a worker across the street was outside looking north into the sky.  I looked and observed (I know this sounds crazy) a blurry object the shape of a yoyo.  The outer parts were dark with the inner part being lighter.  This object was motionless.  It then came into focus as it rotated and became a long shiny dark cylindrical shape.  I ran outside to get a better look.  It took me less than 5 seconds to get outside, but by that time it had vanished.  The worker across the street said it had come rapidly from the east to the point were it became motionless.  It was not a balloon, a helicopter or a plane.  To this day I still cannot quit thinking about what it might have been.", "Unknown bright lights, and triangular shapes over Four Corners, New MexicoA friend and I were driving back, cross-country, from California, and pulled into the Four Corners monument around midnight.  As the monument was closed, and gated at that hour of the night, we drove about a mile down the highway, and pulled off, and down through a series of small hills, to a riverbank, to car-camp until the morning.  We had been at rest for perhaps half-an-hour, or so, when we noticed bright white lights moving across the southern horizon.  We sat on the tail-gate of the truck, and watched as these lights seemed to almost bounce around the horizon, from east to west, and back at a rate of speed that was almost unbelieveable.  The lights would go from sitting still to extreem speed, and then come to a complete halt, just as quick.  After watching these lights for fifteen or twenty minutes, my friend went to sleep, and I was left sitting up watching. Shortly, thereafter, I looked directly above us, and saw what appeared to be a triangle-three points of light, rotating clockwise, and surrounding it a hexagon-eights points of light moving counter-clockwise.  To say the least I was spooked, and only watched these lights for a moment.  The lights were not extremely bright, but had the brightness similar of stars.  Had it not been for the motion and covering up of other starlight (shadow of the shapes) I might have put it off to actually be a constellation.  I don&apos;t have a clue as to what we saw (man-made, or otherwise) but am sure that what I did see was real. Several months later, back at home in Georgia, my friend and I saw a program that had footage of similar horizon lights.  Both of us got a cold chill upon seeing the footage, and we both exclaimed loudly that that was what we had seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I have a very good pair of Carzeiss Jena 8x30 binoculars we had a good day seeing many birds. At about 1-00pm I noticed initially two objects/lights very high in the sky and flying together  I looked at the two lights wondering what they could be. I did not see solid objects as such I can only say they were lights I can=t say what distance or how high up they were. They appeared to be very high in the sky. The first two lights did appear to be linked initially. One white to clear the other a pale aqua blue. The aqua blue light went brighter for a few second, then back to a pale light. I only recall that happening once. They were similar to stars. As I looked I noticed more and more lights, I lost track of the first two.  I thought there was about twelve lights. I can=t be precise of the number. My friend and I jointly concluded there were about twelve. There could have been more, it was very cloudy. I could not determine if they were solid objects or not. We were looking at the lights for five minutes. The visibility was good and the weather conditions were reasonable to good. There were white bright clouds and a blue sky and a average wind. The lights were moving in a North- east direction from South-west. The wind seemed to be in the same direction, they appeared to be travelling slow but not slowly, I couldn=t determine the speed. The lights were various pale colours clear, yellow, pink, silver and aqua blue, they were of similar size. They were definitely flying together but did not appear to be flying in any kind of  a formation, As I was looking for more after about five minutes there were four lights flying in a line but this was not a straight line. All the lights were flying in the same direction but not linked. When my friend and I discussed this he said he thought Athey were connected@.  I did not get that impression. We discussed during the sighting the possibility of them being weather balloons. I don=t know what weather balloons look like so I can=t say that they were or were not. Jumbles lakes is close to Manchester Airport. Planes were circling to land all the time we were in the area. These lights appeared to be higher up than the planes but I don=t definitely know that. I chose to look through binoculars for most of the five minutes although the lights could be seen without binoculars. I couldn=t scan the area very well due to all the clouds. Finally they disappeared behind clouds and we lost sight. During the sighting I could not identify any specific detail with the binoculars neither did I hear any noise they were too far away. My friend and I discussed the sighting. He could not think what the lights could have been. I am at a loss for an explanation. They were not children=s balloons. Weather balloons ? Twelve?.", "My son and I saw this in early evening.There were a string of lights quite brite over a low hill.  It was right in town and very visible.

At the point where the planes were turning I noticed a small object, that I initially thought was a balloon, coming towards the strip.  In less than 5 minutes from when I spotted it, the object slowed down above the Wynn golf course area. It stayed in this area for about 5 minutes.  It was not stationary at this point, but moving slowly westward. It then started picking up speed and moving in a north westerly direction and was out of my site in less than 5 minutes. It was barley visible as it left my field of view from the hotel window. From the point that it slowed down, I had a decent view of the object as it was directly in front of me.  It was fairly high up, but well under the cloud cover.  The object appeared mostly white with a patch of darker, gray on it.  It seem as though it was probably the size of a car or van. The shape was not perfectly round; it seemed as though it was more pyramid shaped but very rounded.  It also looked to be rotating. I am not sure what it was, but I could tell that it was not a balloon. It was not bobbing with the wind and the size was much too large for the height that it was at. It was not a plane as it would have dropped out of the sky as it moved slowly over the Vegas strip area.

While driving from our home 45 miles away; we were going to visit my inlaws for the Christmas holiday.  The in-laws live approximately 15 miles out of town; which is a very rural area of Hempstead county just outside the town of Hope, AR.  The local small airport and tower is also North and West of Hope, AR, but on a seperate State road #278.  The road I was traveling on was highway # 73; which is approximately 3 to 5 miles West of 278.  To get to the airport one must travel US 278 for about 5 miles from the city limits of Hope, AR.  I was approx 5 miles on US 73 heading NW when I told my wife to look at that plane with his landing lights on.  He sure is low to the ground and even though the airport was only approx 2 to 3 miles due east he was too low to land at any of the 3 runways there.  I told her to pull over and back up because we were on a straight stretch that was approx 1/2 mile long, I said it looks like he is trying to land on the road. As we pulled over the light changed directions from due west and turned toward us just above several houses and 50 to 75 ft oak trees.  I told her to put it into reverse and back up as fast as possible.  Just as she got into reverse, the light was aimed toward us but not upon our vehicle.  It appeared to hover just above the farm and chicken houses and oak trees that are adjacent to US 73.  I rolled down my window to listen and get a better look, had my wife shut off the engine.  It was a clear bright night, crisp cold air, no visible clouds in the sky and stars were plentyful.  I got out and looked at the object hoovering maybe 1/4 mile from us, only a front white light on, but the shape was unmistakenably triangle.  I could not hear any noise coming from the object, only the sound of chicken houses and the occassional dog barking.  With the crisp cold air I thought any sound from the craft would be easy to hear and travel far, but no one in the houses came out to look at the object,nor did the poultry appear scared.  After maybe 1 1/2 minutes to 2 minutes the object turned the light off, turned due West and took off very slowly and then just sped up so fast it was gone.  The object turned on its axis without forward movement, engine sound or any visible jet blast or thrust  from what I called the rear of the craft after the point turned due west.

They were in the north sky. The full moon was just to right and south of us.Now sitting at the stop light there were other cars around us at the stop light as well. We were able to see a shape that looked like a straight line . It was horizontal and moving from horizontal to slanted left to right. It was very large ...the size of the full moon or bigger. It suddenly pulled away further north faster than we could track it. Our light turned green but all the cars were hesitant to go including myself. I finally resumed driving north keeping my eye on the object which was still strobing. The object came to a sudden stop while we were still travelling north. The object was actually very close to a light tower off in the distance and it just sat there hovering. The lights went off and the object was a dark triangle now . Then very quickly white  lights appeared on top of the craft in a cone shape.Then it seemed to shift but we couldn&apos;t tell if it was clockwise or counter clockwise.Now the cone shaped light appeared on the bottom of the craft and the lights were now a deep red.

PD))More luminous objects sighted in night skyFollowing up my two previous reports (for 5/25/06 and 5/26/06), here is my report for the morning of Monday, May 29th. I was not able to make observations for Saturday or Sunday mornings as I was out of town. In terms of numbers, this was the least eventful night so far, but it was the subject of perhaps the most dramatic sightings. I started observing at 0058. The sky was almost totally clear at first, but clouds became thicker as the night went on. The following are the particulars of the objects sighted. 1) 0102 - object seen moving from southeast to northwest. It was moving slightly faster than a passenger aircraft as seen at 36,000 feet. It was visible for just under 2 minutes, from first appearance to flying towards my direction and out of sight. 2) 0122 - object suddenly appeared in the southern sky (as if a light had been turned on), then moved extremely fast to the east before disappearing (as if the light had then been turned off). There was no cloud obstruction, it was low in altitude, and had an angle of elevation of 30 degrees. It was approximately 1 magnitude dimmer than Sirius, and travelled a horizontal distance of the tip of my thumb to my wrist held at arm&apos;s length in just under a second. Its light was a quick movement of light, similar to taking a flashlight and moving in front of you from one side to the other as fast as you can. It was not a lasting streak (a line) like a meteor or flare. Like all previous objects, it had no other lights other than its white light body. 3) 0138 - object seen moving from south to north. It was very faint, and moved with a slow, stop-start motion, like a person trying to walk in sludge. It disappeared overhead to my left after about 1 minute. 4) 0216 - object seen moving from southeast to northwest. It was very similar to the previous object, very faint and with a jerky type of motion. 5) 0225 - object streaked across the sky from east to west at incredible speed. It had an angle of elevation of about 45 degrees, and, like object #2 from tonight, was at a lower altitude than the others. It was 1 magnitude brighter than Sirius, with its light characteristics similar to object #2 as well, i.e. it was a quick movement of light and not a lasting streak line. I got the sense that it was closer in distance to me than any of the other objects seen over my 3 nights of observations. 6) 0234 - object seen moving from south to north. Its movement was slower than the other objects seen tonight; I would almost call it graceful. It was about the same speed as a passenger aircraft as seen at 36,000 feet. 7) 0238 - object seen moving from northwest to southeast. Like objects #3 and #4, it had a slow, stop-start type of motion. 8) 0240 &ndash; a conventional aircraft was seen and heard moving from west to east. It had an angle of elevation of about 45 degrees, and an altitude of, I would estimate, 10,000 feet. It had a setup of lights consisting of a white anti-collision light on the underside of its fuselage and 2 red position lights on each wing. The blinking of the lights was very unusual to me - it is best described as imagining an object bouncing through the lights from one end to the other; it was an alternating fashion of blinking which I am not familiar with. As mentioned in my previous reports, aircraft (apart from fighter jets and other two-seater military training aircraft) are very uncommon here. 9) 0258 - object seen moving from south to north. It was very dim, but did not have the peculiar movement of the three previous dim objects. It passed straight over my head and out of sight after about 1 minute. I stopped observing at 0320. This was another eventful evening that, once again, at times left me speechless. I am planning to contact the local air force base later today to see if I can glean anything from them.", "I was sitting in seat 47K (a window seat on the right side of the jet airliner) of Japan Airlines flight JL 060 on Feb 16, 2006, on my return trip from the Osaka/Kansai airport to Los Angeles.  We were well into the flight (2-4 hours) when I happened to look out of my window, even though I knew there was nothing to look at except clouds and the ocean.  It was broad daylight and we were flying above the clouds.  The jet I was on also had a large video display which showed our location on a map, and it showed nothing but water all around us (no land appearing on the display). But what I saw when I looked out of the window took me by surprise.  There was something hovering at a medium distance away (not far, but near enough to get a decent look at), and at just a slightly lower altitude than the plane I was sitting on.  I could see it when I looked straight out of my window and down slightly. What I saw looked like jet-black smoke, except that the smoke was in the shape of a &quot;V&quot; with curved sides and a rounded point... like a 2-D parabolic curve.  And the orientation of it was that the vertex of the parabola was pointing in the same direction as my jet was travelling (parallel with the jet), but it was also pointing slightly towards the jet.  Also, the dimensional plane containing this 2-D parabolic curve of smoke was parallel with the surface of the earth. I am not sure how large the object actually was, but I can say from my reference point that it was roughly 2 inches long at arm&apos;s length. The oddest thing about what I saw was that the black smoke looked to be flowing within this parabolic curve shape, but the smoke never left this shape!  And the motion of the hovering was the same approximate motion and speed of the wobble of a toy top when it just starts losing stabilty (as it slows down), except that the wobble motion and speed of what I was looking at stayed constant.  The parabolic curve shape itself wasn&apos;t spinning (it kept pointing in the same direction as described above), it just had a slow and steady wobbling motion to it. I stared at it as long as I could, trying to figure out what it was.  How could smoke hold a constant shape and wobble like it was a solid object???  I did look around briefly to see if any other passengers near me were also looking at it, but I only saw people reading, watching TV on the small displays on the backs of the seats in front of them, or sleeping.  I was travelling alone and didn&apos;t know anybody to talk to about it anyways.  I also wanted to get up to access my stowed bag where I had a disposable camera, but I knew that by the time I got the camera and returned to my seat that the object would be either out of view or too small to take a good picture.  So I quickly looked back out the window to watch it and study it as much as I could.  As we travelled, it slowly drifted towards the rear of my jet and became smaller as we moved away from it, until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore from my window. Looking back at this experience, it was most unfortunate that I didn&apos;t think to take note of our position -- the jet airliner also showed (along with the map) the latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, etc. of where we currently were. Is there a way to find out who the pilots of this flight were, and contact them to ask them if they also saw it?  And can the same be done with the passengers of this flight???  I am 35 years old and I have a 4 year Bachelor&apos;s of Science degree in Electrical Engineering.  But I can&apos;t think of anything that I know of which could describe what I saw.  All that I know for sure is that I saw a black, smokey, parabola shape wobbling as a solid object, but I couldn&apos;t see anything else -- no vehicle!  Yet I was near enough to see the flowingness of the smoke.  And even though I was looking at it mostly from the side and slightly from above, watching it wobble gave me a good feel of its overall shape. The only explanation that seems to make sense about what I saw is to imagine some kind of invisible triangular craft hovering there, with the black smoke eminating from the outer edge of the bottom of the craft as a result of its hovering mechanism.  Also, maybe the black smoke completely dissipates shortly after being produced.  This could explain why the smoke seemed to conform to a certain shape -- the shape of the craft producing it -- and why the entire parabola of smoke looked to move together as a single entity while the craft was wobbling...", "three aligned lights: white, red, whiteDriving home, on a very clear night, around 9:30 p.m., I noticed 3 very bright lights up in the sky. They were aligned, with little or no space in between. The two peripheral lights were extremely bright and white, and the center light was red. They were not flickering. The white lights were much larger than the center. This object was stationary the entire time, was very big, and extremely vivid. After three or four minutes, I  briefly (for a couple seconds)  looked down at the road and when I looked up again, it was gone. The sky was open and I tried to look for it again, but I couldn&apos;t find it. I have no idea where it went.  After arriving home five minutes later, I received a phone call and the service was interrrupted. No dial tone. Using my cell phone, I called the telephone company. They normally can tell you if your service needs repair from inside the house or out. They could not with mine. I then tried calling our security gate (we live in a secured development) and their phones were also out of order.  I called our phone company again and they said that our security gate uses a different telephone provider and that it was a &quot;coincidence&quot; that their phones were out, too. I then drove up to our gate. Their phones were indeed out, as well as other residents&apos; in our neighborhood who had reported. The security also told me that their communication radios in their vehicles were not functioning.", "End of the Century UFOFirst of all I&apos;d like to say that Iam rather glad to see this website as I was just browsing through, and I thought that It would be a good idea to share a piece of my experience that occurred quite some time ago around the years 1997 or 1998 to somewhere in 2003 where I last saw certain starlike objects. These objects that I saw were not that strange as it appeared at the sky. Most however won&apos;t notice these things because they seem to resemble like ordinary stars. When we heard about this comet in the news somewhere around those years 1997, 1998 that it would appear clearly in the nightsky. Me, my brother, my dad and two of my cousins would go out to watch how beautiful it is. Not until we keep looking around that we notice other objects in the sky moving irregularly the same way how houseflies behave in the morning. The objects looked like stars but it moves then it slows down, some even cross paths. We thought that they were airplanes at first then fighter planes then it got too weird and it flew too fast at that distance we decided they were sattelites and their reflections. We never stopped seeing these things in the sky for the past years but we didn&apos;t mind them that much since we always knew there were other beings out there that needn&apos;t challenge our beliefs. But just seeing these things stimulates ones mind. My father however who works at a government based envirorment protection agency kept seeing several flying objects in the sky as he and his team perform their duties in the remote regions of the province. It was no surprise that many of his friends wondered and were in doubt to what these were and concluded there on that these were alien crafts. My father back then sometimes comes home and tells us that he and his friends saw several UFO&apos;s in greater numbers that what we see here in the city. Mainly because it was darker in province where their lights cannot be obscured by our the city&apos;s. So one day my dad couldn&apos;t take it anymore called our local meteorological station called PAGASA and begin to report and if by any chance they could somehow pick-up flying objects in their radar besides our aircraft. They answered &quot;No.&quot;  I haven&apos;t seen the same flying objects in sky recently which is quite disappointing but I always try to look and stare up just in case. Yet I was glad that we weren&apos;t the only ones out here seeing strange flying objects in the sky. People tend to try and talk about these things once you start and it&apos;s surprising but its true.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The route we took was Highway 14, to Highway 21, to Highway 13 to Camrose.  The totasl trip would be only 1 hr at 60 mph.  It was night, and the evening was cold.  We left Edmonton at approx 10:oo PM, and at about 10:20 pm we exited #14 to travel S on #21.  We were driving our 1975 red chec 1/2 ton, no camper, open box.  We had our 1 year old daughter in a baby seat betwen the wife and I, I was driver.  We traveled at 60 mph (100 kmh). As we approached the RR crossing at Looma, AB, I noted a aircraft, I assumed to be a plane mid sky at my 11 o-clock.  I usually look at the night sky while driving.  about 5 minutes later, I noticed that the plane did not make any progress and pointed it out to my wife.  Her I watched as we travelled along #21, and we noticed that the aircraft was still at out 11 o-clock (left of our vehicle)  As we approached a small twon of Hay Lakes, I noticed that we were getting closer to the aircraft. Now, there is a two story farmhouse, that is situated just n/w of Hay Lakes.  It sits only 40 g=feet N of the highway.  We always drive by this house.  The highway curves to the right about 300 ft past the house.  As we we getting close to the house, we saw that the aircradt was very large, and hovering only 50 feet directly above this house.  Brights lights were on the side, but the lights were not round.  The whole side of the craft was lit up.  As we got closer, we actually drove under the craft, so I estimate the size to be about 100 feet in diametrer.  As we passed near and uder, the craft blocked out the stars, and I noticed that the bottom was not lit up, but I could see the shape to be a circle because it was black and blotted out a circle in the sky.  The sky was claer so the stars could be seen around the object. I slowed down and rolled down my driver side window, and all I heard was the sound of my vehicle tires on the pavement.  No sound came from the craft.  I should also advise that at this point we were only 90 feet below the craft.  I kept driving because all I could think about was my baby.  My wife yelled, &quot;stop the truck&quot;  but I didn&apos;t.  I kept my eyes on it by shifting my view to the side view mirror.  My wife looked back through the rear window of the truck cab.  I then noted an RCMP  (Royal Canadain Mounted Police) approach me from the S/B lane, I watched as his car passed under the craft,, and as funny as it sounds.  He did not stop.  He kept driving and were silent all the way home.  Hay lakes is nly 30 minutes from out home in Camrose. I did not report this because of two reasons:  1.  At the time I was a City Police Officer and reporting this would kill my credibility as a crown witness. 2.  The RCMP officer driving the car I would have known, and no-one in the local detachment said anything, so I kept quit as well. I did tell a few close friends and my father.

The object was luminous, a mauve or orange-red color. We each had a different opinion of the exact color. It seemed to be oval, but had 3 lights evenly spaced, like a triange, on the bottom. It made no noise. It flew from north to south as I saw it (I didn&apos;t look at it until it disappeared). It followed the main north/south road in town (Broadway).

She also saw this thing suddenly go east when it hit the horizon (I had looked away by that point). I hate to call this thing a UFO because I still don&apos;t know if I believe in that.  It&apos;s just that I have no explaination. I have seen in the past where geese would fly over during the night and you can see the reflection of the city lights on their bellies. It wasn&apos;t that. Too high and they definately aren&apos;t quiet. It wasn&apos;t an airplane from the International airport. It was too high and it wasn&apos;t a plane.

The day was sunny with white cumulus clouds in the sky.  As I was walking along the base alone I noticed a shadow pass over me.  I looked up expecting to see a cloud.  Instead there was this large black triangular craft silently moving overhead very slowly.  It wasn&apos;t very high above the trees and I looked for identifiable markings but saw none.  I was familiar with most military aircraft but couldn&apos;t identify it so I thought maybe it was the SR 71 Blackbird which was still relatively secret.  My thought then was it couldn&apos;t be the Blackbird because it was as big as a B-52 and completely silent.  As I watched, it ascended straight up without pointing the nose of the aircraft up and disappeared in the clouds in an instant without any noise.

They were actually so slow that at first, I thought they were stars and I was just experiencing a perspective illusion. However, the gap between these two objects and the closest constellation was constantly increasing. I thought of satellites maybe. They were not travelling as fast as satellites. Then, what are the odds of two satellites travelling on the same elipse, at apparently the same speed? There was neither any jet sound, even high altitude ones, nor any port, starboard or tail lights. I rusehd inside to get binoculars, which literally took me 20 seconds, but by the time I returned, I could not locate the objects anymore. Had they been static, I could never have told them from regular stars.", "GROUPING OF AMBER COLORED ROUND LIGHTS ALL IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION, SAME LEVELON SATURDAY NIGHT 05/06/06, AT APPROXMATELY 10:10 PM I WAS HEADED TO WORK.  I LIVE IN A RURAL PART OF INDIAN RIVER COUNTY IN FLORDIA.  OUR COUNTY IS FAMOUS FOR GRAPEFRUIT AND OTHER CITRUS.  I LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GROVE AREA.  THE NEAREST HOME TO MINE IS APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES AWAY.  THIS AREA IS SECLUDED EXCEPT FOR THE OCCASIONAL GROVE BARN.  SOME OF THE BARNS DO HAVE AMBER COLORED STREET LIGHTS SUPPLIED BY FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT.  AS I WAS DRIVING ON 122ND AVE NORTH TO S R 60 IN VERO BEACH, FL.  I LOOKED TO THE WEST.  I OBSERVED THE CELL TOWER WHICH IS LOCATED 3 MILES TO MY WEST ON 154TH AVE.  WHAT I SAW IN THE VICINITY OF THE CELL TOWER WAS A GROUP OF 4 ROUND AMBER COLORED LIGHTS VERY BRIGHT AND AT ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE CELL TOWER. I HAVE LIVED IN THIS AREA ABOUT 3 YEARS NOW AND I KNOW THE LOCATION OF EVERY STREET LIGHT AT THE OCCASIONAL GROVE BARN THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER. I STOPPED FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AND WHERE THESE LIGHTS WOULD BE COMING FROM.  AFTER THAT TIME, I NOTICED A FIFTH LIGHT JOIN THE GROUP OF FOUR LIGHTS.  AGAIN I DID NOT SEE A CRAFT ONLY FIVE BRIGHT LIGHTS RESEMBLING THE SIZE AND SHAPE AND COLOR OF AN  AMBER STREET LIGHT.  BUT NOW THERE WHERE FIVE LIGHTS WHERE SECONDS AGO THERE HAD ONLY BEEN FOUR.  I CALLED MY CO WORKER WHO WAS WAITING TO BE RELIEVED BY ME AT 11 PM.  I TOLD HIM WHAT I SAW AND SAID THAT I WOULD BE IN TO WORK ON TIME BUT WANTED TO TAKE 15 MINUTES TO DRIVE TO THE AREA OF 154TH AVE WHERE I SAW THESE STRANGE LIGHTS.  I WANTED TO SEE IF POSSIBLY THERE WHERE NEW STREET LIGHTS INSTALLED OR SOME EXPLANATION TO WHAT I WAS SEEING.  AS I TURNED MY PICK UP AROUND ON THE DIRT ROAD AND STARTED TO HEAD WEST THE GROUP OF LIGHTS DISAPPEARED. I WAS DISAPPOINTED BUT STILL DECIDED TO HEAD WEST TOWARD 154TH AVE JUST TO SEE IF I COULD SEE WHAT THESE LIGHTS COULD HAVE BEEN.  HEADING WEST SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS APPEARED AGAIN.  BUT THIS TIME THERE WHERE 6 AMBER COLORED LIGHTS ALL IN A ROW AT THE SAME HEIGHT FURTHER WEST AND SOUTH OF WHERE I HAD FIRST SEEN THE GROUPING OF LIGHTS.  I STOPPED MY VEHICLE AND OBSERVED THE LIGHTS FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT.  THERE WAS A GROUP OF SIX AMBER COLORED LIGHTS ALL IN A ROW AT THE SAME HEIGHT.   SUDDENLY ONE BY ONE THE LIGHTS STARTED TO DISAPPEAR AGAIN. I LOOKED TO THE NORTH AND SAW A SMALL PLANE FLYING TOWARD THE SOUTH PASSING IN FRONT OF WHERE THE GROUPING HAD BEEN.  THE PLANE WAS READILY RECOGNIZED FROM THE STRONG HEAD LIGHT AND BLINKING RED TAIL LIGHTS.  THE PLANE SORT OF ZIGGED IN THE SKY AND I WONDERED IF THE PILOT HAD SEEN THE SAME LIGHTS THAT I HAD.  THE PLANE CONTINUED SOUTH.  WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF THE PLANE PASSING, THE GROUP OF SIX AMBER COLORED ROUND LIGHTS SUDDENLY APPEARED. I CONTINUED TO WATCH THEM AND ANOTHER PICK UP TRUCK WENT BY MY AREA.  I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE DRIVER INTRODUCE MYSELF AND HAVE HIM SEE THE LIGHTS.  BUT NOW THERE WHERE ONLY THREE LIGHTS AND THE OTHER WITNESS CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THOSE LIGHTS BEFORE.  WE BOTH WATCHED THE LIGHTS FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN SUDDENLY ONE BY ONE THEY ALL VANISHED JUST AS QUICKLY AS IF SOMEONE HAD TURNED OFF A SWITCH.  I OBSERVED THE LIGHTS FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.  I HAD KEPT MY COWORKER ON THE PHONE THE ENTIRE TIME AND OUR CONVERSATION WAS RECORDED SINCE THE JOB I HAVE USES RECORDED PHONE LINES.  I STAYED IN THE AREA ANOTHER 10 MINUTES BUT THE LIGHTS DID NOT APPEAR AGAIN.  THE AREA WHERE THE LIGHTS APPEARED WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER A GROVE OR RANGELAND OR THE LARGE ST JOHN&apos;S MARSH RESEVOIR.  THIS AREA WOULD NOT HAVE ANY LIGHTING FROM THE GROUND THAT I COULD EXPLAIN.  THE ROUND LIGHTS WHERE IN THE WESTERN HORIZON AT ABOUT 8 O&apos;CLOCK IN THE SKY.  THE SIGHTING WAS TO ME SOMEWHERE BETWEEN WESTERN INDIAN RIVER COUNTY AND YEEHAW JUNCTION WHICH IS ABOUT 20 MILES WEST OF MY LOCATION.  THE GROUP OF LIGHTS ALL WHERE ROUND AND AMBER COLORED.  THERE WHERE SIX IN A ROW AT ONE TIME BUT I HAD SEEN A GROUP OF FOUR AND FIVE.  THESE I WOULD SAY WHERE ALL THE SAME GROUP BUT THE NUMBER OF LIGHTS DID CHANGE IN THE GROUPING.  THE LIGHTS WHERE ALWAYS AT THE SAME LEVEL. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LIGHTS STAYED FIXED IN ONE SPOT UNTIL DISAPPEARING.  THE LIGHTS DID NOT TRAVEL OR DO MANUVEURS IN THE SKY.", "We saw a bright red fireball like object that appeared to be too high to possibly be any earthling made air craft. The object appeared in the direction of north west. The object hovered in one spot for the first seventeen minutes and then dissappeared for two minutes and then reappeared in the nothern direction and then completely dissappeared and did not reappear.", "LIndenhurst, Long Island New York -- Triangular CraftMy mother was giving me a ride home from work and we were on Hoffman Avenue headed home and our attention was grabbed by slowing cars ahead of us. We pulled over and looked up and there was a black, triangular carft above us, hovering...not moving, just hanging there in the sky. No one else stopped, so we left and went to our home. Once we got to the front steps, my mother pointed up to the sky and we saw about 4-5 more of the triangular black craft flying over what we believe was our locanl beach area (Venetian SHores Beach). They were flying like nothing we&apos;ve ever seen, smooth and all over the place, looking like they were just taking everything in. Our neighbor who witnessed this with us was so disturbed she called our local police dept., where she was told that it was the Long Island Railroad conducting tests. I&apos;m sorry it&apos;s so late reporting...but I haven&apos;t been able to talk about it really and even my mother and I never discuss it!!", "Red/White Ball seen from Passenger Plane, 4PM, over Miami Int. Airport, Memorial Day 06, approach.Object was witnessed by airline passenger, port side, facing Easterly.  On final approach to MIA, at about 3:55 PM, while plane was making final 180 degree turn, at approximately 4 to 3000 feet altitude, a glowing red-white ball crossed our path.  This crossing was below us, at approximatly 2000 feet, and at the general center point of the radius for which our airplane was turning around.  This fire-ball appeared to be traveling northbound, paralleling the SR-997 to the East.  If we were traveling at 222 mph, I estimate the ball was traveling 120 mph.  No change in vector was observed of the ball.  If I were able to have streched out my arm, and pinched my fingers together and opened them a bit, the gap would have been 1/4 to 3/8 inch.  If that ball was 1500 feet away from my eye, it might have been 10 to 15 foot in diameter.  The lumens given off pulsated strongly from red to white to read, with no observed briliance disipation. Wether conditions were overcast, no direct sun.  Thunder clouds were starting to form at that time, and sky darkened by the 5 oclock hour.  No rain fell at airport, and no thunder or lightening was abserved by me durring the 2 hours I remained at the airport, awaiting a connection.  85F, cloudy, still air. I made special effort to disprove what I was seeing.  I do have 20/20 vision, and I am not color blind.  I was not drinking or druging at the time.  I witnessed this ball for more than half the duration of the 180 degree turn the aircraft made, aproximately for 45 seconds.  The angle of the object, with respect to the floor of the aircraft, was just below the parallel of the floor, and drifting rearward.  The object left my view when we continued across its path and onward to the airport. Below where the ball was seen are active surface mines, with associated lakes of varying shades of green to grey.  These may be cement or sand or shell bed mines, I am not sure.  It was labor day, and 4 of the 10 mines there showed activity with dump trucks and conveyors.  The mine imediately below the object did not appear to be active. The plane was full, and I was in seat 32A.  I was interested in speaking with the pilot, but the cabin was still shut when I exited the plane.  At the time, I did not feel the need to wait for the pilot, for I needed to catch the next plane, in a different terminal.  I also thought he&apos;d think I was insane. I did not feel alarm while observing this ball, but I did feel like this may be a ufo probe mapping the planet running concentric passes, around and around. No powerlines were visable to me in the area.  I have e-mailed a MapPoint sketch of the area where it was. As I write this I have thought of possible glide path markers that would indicate were pilots need to turn for approach at night.  This is a good piece of doubt to ponder.  It was daylight out, and I did not see any tower structures at all.", "The UFO that I saw at 1 PM thursday the 27th of april 2006, hovering over downtown portland, was a white, rather opaque, imperfect circular blob light ball with what was either a black circular ball directly below it, or maybe a black helicopter . It was aprox. 30-50 feet diameter, from side to side, by my estimate to the downtown Burnside bridge area it was hovering over. It was a single object, and it did not move while I observed it except for a slight unjulation which gave it the &quot;imperfect&quot; circular shape that I just mentioned. My astute girlfriend also observed this strange object, at the same instance as myself, as well as earlier that morning, by herself, around 10:30 A.M . This is certainly not the first &quot;UFO&quot; that I have seen here in my 1 year in Portland, Oregon. I have seen 1 black triangle near the Mall 205 exit off of the 205 freeway, as well as several other pasty light ball objects hovering over downtown Portland in clear blue mid day last fall, October 2005, 1 orange/metalic orb august 2005, and 1 diamond shaped black, brown, and grey object weaving eratically in and out of the clouds and then zipping off, early april 2006!

Although I&apos;m not sure of the exact date (1964 or 1965), my brother and one of his friends were wrestling in our front yard - I was about six or seven years old and my brother and his friend would have been 9 or 10. I walked around the corner of our house to where they were wrestling on the lawn.  All of the sudden they stopped wrestling and stood straight up.  At the same time all three of us looked directly above us. There, hovering, was a large, round, silver object directly above us.  It was low enough that I could make out what looked like dimples in the skin of the object - almost like hammered metal.  Since it was right above us, I don&apos;t know whether it was a sphere, or whether we were just looking at the bottom side of a saucer shaped object.  As we watched the object it slowly moved behind a cloud. We watched the cloud for a long time and as it dispersed we realized the object was gone.My entire family loves airplanes and anything to do with space. My parents used to wake us in the middle of the night when important things were happening with Mercury/Gemini/Apollo, and were being televised.I knew that what we saw that day was very strange. At the time I don&apos;t know whether we had ever heard the term UFO, but have realized in my adult life what we saw.In the following years my father also saw very strange objects on two different occasions.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I looked into the the sky, south over the ocean, and saw what appeared to be a really bright star, brighter than anything else in the sky.As I watched, it was moving slowly, in a south eastern direction. It moved for about 3 minutes, then stopped. It has been hovering there for about 40 minutes now.At about 0:45 The object faded out to a pin-prick, and the brightened again.It remained unchanged till 01:10, when it again faded to a pin-prick, after about a minute it returned to it&apos;s normal brightness.At 01:15 it again faded, but this time it went out completely. It returned to it&apos;s normal brightness again, but almost immedialtely.After this happened, it seemed to slide out of position ever so slightly. At first I thought I was seeing things because it never seemed to move, just slide over then back in an odd way that I can&apos;t really describe.It did this for about ten minutes, then remained stationary.It is now 01:45. I have noticed no changes, it is still the brightest thing in the sky, (aside from the Moon), and I must go to sleep.I&apos;m sure if this is a U.F.O, or some space program thing, but I&apos;m awfully curious.", "Barbell Shaped ObjectMe and a Few friends saw what looked like a Barbell flying in the Sky in the daylight, there was a few clouds around but you could see this well. it wasnt fast like a Jet or had no trail behind it. It was a Metal looking color and My friend said that aint no UFO its a blimp but it looked nothing like a blimp. I think they were a little freaked out and in denial over seeing it. Hopefully someone else saw this too. It kind of looked like 2 tin cans and a little tube in the middle. no sound too.", "Saw a large number of UFOs flying rapidly above us, chasing each other, and suddenly disappearing unlike planes.We, myself and 5 other friends, were having a bonfire at a friend&apos;s house. We noticed one light moving up and down behind the trees and above them. It would disappear and reappear rapidly. Suddenly, other lights and crafts appeared, one with a beam of light coming from it forming a path across the sky. Two lights or crafts chased another across the sky. One craft flew above us and there were red lights and white lights and a strange, foreign humming and whizzing sound. It did not have wings and could not have been a plane. There was lots of activity and strange lights everywhere. They moved fast and disappeared unlike planes or other aircraft. They moved irregularly.", "stars moving in the night skywe were all sitting outside with a few neighbors when one of them noticed a strange star in the sky we all looked up and saw the star move thinking that it was an airplane. that&apos;s when the light or star stopped moving and then seperated and became two stars it paused for a moment and then went back together. after it went back together it vanished right before our eyes.I was young and didn&apos;t really know what to think. my parents have always believed in ufo&apos;s and the such and I never have known what to believe I&apos;m 40years old now and I still don&apos;t know what to think but my father asked that I report this and tell the story of what happened that night.later that night, after I went to bed, I woke up and saw a bright light coming from outside. I just thought that it was early morning and went to use the restroom. but then we heard something that woke dad up and when we went outside our dog had pasted away. what was strange was that it looked like he had a broken neck.....

When almost immediately, I noticed an object that looked, to my first thought, like Saturn and it&apos;s rings.  I quickly dismissed this as A: the object appeared to be the size of the moon in the morning&apos;s sky, and it was far too low and to the north of us (appeared to be over an area following the Fraser River, or the mountains in behind Mission, BC, well to the north of us).  As we stopped at the intersection for a left turn, I watched the object closely as it slowly moved through the sky (moving west to east).  Noticing for the first time a single flashing light on the upper ceiling of the object (similar to those found on aircraft).  Other than this one flashing light on top, it was illuminated only by the rising sun (which was still blocked by mountains for us at ground level).  Drving along the main road through the city westbound, I kept watch between buildings for it.  My Fiance, who I&apos;d pointed the object out to while stopped at the intersection, and I saw it continue slowly eastward.  The Second time that I got a good look at it, it had lost it&apos;s saturn effect, my guess is that it had been banking towards us at the time, and you could see the ring edge on.  I spotted the object a third time while driving, but we had driven far enough westward, and it moving eastward that the sunlight effect was&apos;t occuring anymore because of the object&apos;s position between the sun and ourselves.  It looked more like a dark blob in the dawn sky.  Belatedly, about a minute later, I recalled that my fiance had a camera phone and that I&apos;d been too busy watching the object to even think that we could have taken a picture.  I&apos;ve seen enough planes &amp; jets &amp; blimps in the many years I&apos;ve lived in the city here, and I&apos;ve never seen anything remotely like it. It was too slow to be an airliner, nor was it the correct shape. With the annual airshow at the city&apos;s airport, I&apos;ve seen everything from the Avro Vulcan to the Stealth Bomber.  I also rules out being some kind of blimp, as I&apos;ve seen plenty of those every time the goodyear blimp has made flybys of the airshow.  We&apos;ve also had our fair share of hot air balloons (Remax typically is the one flying around) but they&apos;re easy to spot because of the flame providing heat for lift. I don&apos;t know what it was, hence I guess, the reason why they call them unidentified flying objects. But the usual suspects can pretty much be ruled out.  Short of it being some funky blimp or hot air balloon, which I&apos;ve seen both and neither of which appears or behaves like this object did.  But I know I&apos;ll be keeping my eyes to the skies more frequently now.", "Philadelphia - Seen UFOWe were walking around Ben Franklin Parkway, on our way to the Franklin Institute, and my friend pointed to the sky and pointed to a &quot;blimp&quot;.  I don&apos;t know what it is about blimps that always make people want to look up and watch them, but i looked.  I didnt really see a blimp though.  It looked like one, but there was no tail thing, no pilot area, and especially no ad on the side. Before i actually thought it could be something other than a blimp, it spun around horozontaly, and disapeared.  It was pretty freaky, and i think we were the only two to see it.

Since me and sister have affected so much,now we cannot open the curtains as we might encounter with a weird,horrible creature or ship but now we are always looking the place we saw it to see again.Yet nobody has believed us:mum,dad,our close friends.but we are 100%sure that there are sth or sb who is capable of building a ship like this,flying,turning...so mr.davenport I hope you will believe us,then at least you can help us to release ourselves..sorry for my english ,   ((name deleted))     ankara,turkey((END ADDENDUM))", "7/4/05   seven to eleven(approx) Northwest of Ft.

The light on top obliterated the true shape of the craft wnw from the town of Davie. It appeared top be watching the fireworks and left before they ended.

It appeared to have blinking lights in an oval shape to one end.My wife saw it first, then she came and got me out of bed and said that she saw a u.f.o so I thought she was joking.  But when I went out side I saw something to the East of my house it appeared to be in space the object was a littel faint to make a clear description.It was clearly somthing so I studied it for a minute and saw a strobe like light shoot away from it many times toward the NW.IN the back ground were stars. The object was still at first, then it moved using the stars as a focal point it moved very fast to another point in space.  Freaked out I went to the neighbors&apos; house to get someone else to conform what we saw. He saw the same thing. While we were watching it, it stopped moving for about 10 minutes. Then it moved again in a different direction.  My neighbor freaked too and went to his neighbor to show him. He and his wife came out, saw it too. They said at first, that it was a sattelite. Then to their suprise it stopped moving and stayed there for about 5 minutes, then moved again in another direction. Every time it stopped we saw the light strobes coming out of it. Then we were standing by the street and a teen boy walked by and we asked him to look and he saw it with the lights coming out of it and said he never saw anything like that. We all laughed and said, &quot;us too&quot;. Then, for more confirmation, I went to another nieghbors house also, to see if they had a telescope to investigate further. They did not, but they saw it too with the lights coming out and away from it but it was stationary at the time. They made some jokes about me smoking somthing, but a few minutes later it started to move again in the opposite direction. It moved, then they weren&apos;t joking anymore. They were freaking out too. We stayed out and watched it for about another hour then it started to move again.

Object reappeared just seconds later in the same area (all this at an estimated 2-3 mile range). My wife and I observed this for about 10 minutes. I came back out on a few occasions over the next hour or so and object was still there, althought in not the same spot. Also it appeared that possibly there were 2 more of these objects further off in the distance, but were too far away to to tell for sure. On a few occasions I heard what were jets in the distance, and also seen the blinking lights of a couple different airplaines in the immediate area.

Had other colors in sporadic patterns light up.Stayed in place for about 1/2 hour then disappeared. I went to another vantage point and saw it again doing the same actions. Later it was to the north of Cincy.  Did anyone else see this?

Am I crazy?", "I was sitting on steps leading to my house.  I was facing west when I noticed a light moving from a westardly direction that was very high in the sky.  If it were not moving, I could have easily mistaken it for a planet. It followed a slightly arced pattern in the sky, heading in a south east direction.  When it was directly above me I called my wife to come outside and witness what I was seeing.  At first she thought it was an aircraft, then I pointed out how high it was and how fast it was moving. There were no flashing lights. She then realized that it was unusual.  As we were facing south east, at about the ten o&apos;clock position the object stopped and started to fade.  It appeared like it was going straight up.  It then disappeared. I&apos;ve seen meteor showers and this did not look like a meteor.  Right after the incident, we saw a high flying aircraft and realized from that reference that what we had seen was not an aircraft.  We&apos;ve never seen anything like this."]
