["Three red lights outline huge red triangle over San Diego Coutny sky.3 bright red lights forming a isosceles triangle, but almost equilateral. You could barely make out a very faint line in a off-glow red. An even fainter off-glow red inside the formed triangle. The size was too huge to explain. It seemed far off in the distance but still  large enough to be seen clearly, but to still realize that it was humungous. Maybe hundreds of feet between each light. Maybe 20 or more miles away. It was about thirty degrees above the horizon. It looked alot like flairs but there was no smoke. They were not rising or falling. This all took place over the course of 10 minutes or so. So there was plenty of time for an elevation change. Then it sort of rotated and pitched forward ever so slowly. The rotation was the lower left light seemed to move forward or maybe the right moved backward. As it levelled out it faded from view. Sort of just dimmed out. It didn&apos;t race away and take sharp turns or anything weird like that. I say weird, because what we saw seemed weird just a short while ago. It never came over our part of the county. # witnesses.Two middle thirty aged adults. M/F, some college, both work in the medical field. One helps SNF Nurses coordinate patient placement after hospital stay. The other works in the ER of a different hospital. The other witness, my neighbor, is a mid sixtyish, retired. His wife is a Hospice nurse and he did not want to wake her once it left. Both of tried to get a picture on our cell phones. I haven&apos;t talked yet to my neighbor to view his.

Anyway what we saw was valid.", "Triangular shape moved in the sky from my right to my left very quickly, and seemed to have appeared from mid-air.Standing on my balcony at approximately 21:15, I was smoking my cigarette and looked up at the stars. I thought immediately about how vulnerable the earth must be in space and had a feeling like something could hit it at any time and was a bit frightened by the thought.Just as this thought dissipated, I saw what appeared to be a slightly illuminated triangular shape very close to the same color as the sky, and three bulb like objects located at the outward ends of each of the triangular points of the shape.  The bulb like objects were either not lit at all or were very dim, but something was glowing, whether it was an illuminated track on the inner frame of the shape, or just the outline of the shape itself was luminescent.Also, it seemed to have appeared from nowhere, which startled me, and it moved so quickly from the far right all the way past me to the left that I could tell it was not moving in the way that an aircraft would move, nor did it make a single sound at all.There were no blinking or moving lights.The shape was about five or six hundred yards away.It was moving at what I could estimate at about 60 miles per hour.It continued moving away over the tree tops and apartment complexes to my left and disappeared.I am very frightened because this is not my first initial sighting. I had a much more intimate sighting close to the year 1997 at a Caldors in Waterford, Connecticut. I was with my Mother and sister at that time.", "I saw a rectangular shoe-box shape stationary object the exact color of the blue sky.I saw a rectangular shoe-box shape unidentified stationary object.  It was the same exact color of the blue sky, making it almost invisible to the naked eye.I was watching jets flying very far away with my binoculars and I saw something I was not meant to see. The sky was crystal clear, very blue, no high altitude clouds, perfect visibility. While following a jet far away, I saw this rectangular shoe-box shape object come into view as I was moving the binoculars. I watched it for a few minutes in total amazement.What is unusual is it was completely motionless, and it was camouflaged the exact shade of color as the blue sky.I was about to yell at my neighbor to come look, but when I looked thru my binoculars again I could no longer see it. It vanished very quickly. I tried for several minutes to find it, but could not.It seemed very far away, which means it must have been pretty large. I looked at it without the binoculars and all I could see was a tiny blue dot.I wish I would have had a telescope with a camera on it to take its picture.What is my opinion? I believe it has an electrochromatic polymer surface to camouflage it the same color as its background. I believe it is a creation of the military-industrial complex, (and it could be foreign-made, as in Russia.) As for the ability of this non-aerodynamic craft to hover motionless, and then fly away at high speed, I suspect scalar wave technology is in effect.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My home was located on the western edge of the city. We were in one of the rooms facing the field (a cow pasture) adjacent to my home. Two spherical objects appeared over the field, probably a quarter mile away. They were, and I am guessing here, about 100 yards across (the red one) and 80 yards across (the orange one), definitely too large to be balloons and surely not balloons as balloons do not glow in the dark like that. The light was coming from inside these objects.We were simply awe-struck with comments like &ldquo;Do you see that? What is that?&rdquo; If we had out wits about us we would have found a camera but we could only look in awe. After about six minutes they disappeared. They did not fly away, they just disappeared. Another five minutes passed and they reappeared. They were not moving on either appearance, just hovering over the field probably 100 yards in the air. The night was pitch-black and these things were really bright. After another five minutes they disappeared and did not return although we stared in that direction for a long time.Now, here is the spooky part. Nineteen years later a friend of mine I had known only a couple years casually told me that he had seen some UFOs in 1989. I took a chance and told him &ldquo;I will describe what you saw,&rdquo; and I gave him the description I have just recorded above. His jaw dropped and he told me that was exactly what he had seen, only he had seen them while camping out at the beach, a distance of about 20 miles from where the four of us had seen these objects.", "7 ufos seen in tyler txThey were really bright they looked like shooting stars but they had a tail like a comet and really colorfuly saw a cupple at first and then saw more come out of no were.

So as they start to zoom in if you look in between the flag and its pole you will see an object clear as day moving from the top of the screen to the bottom.  Keep in mind this area was marked as a no fly zone.  To me it did not look like any plane that I have seen and it moved Relatively fast.  What I am wondering is did anyone else see this?", "Multiple UFO Sightings Houston, TexasI was sitting outside with a friend when we notice a police helicopter circling around us (it continued to do so for about 10min.) Then we saw a triangular craft with a bright white light in the middle with smaller lights throughout the craft. I could pefectly see the shape of it. It was moving slowly and ackwardly and moved out of sight. Then we saw what was the shape of a twin rotor army helicopter, but it was making a low drone noise and had two very bright red lights. When one light blinked the other would go out and visa versa. On this one, it could just have been an army helicopter. But, the lights were really strong...not the normal airplane/helicopter light. Either way, why would there just be one flying relatively low to the ground? Then 10-20min. later we saw another triangular craft like the one before, but it soon disappeared. And about 5min. after that we saw the strangest thing yet. A group of blinking lights that were blinking really excitedly. Going from dim to dark as they blinked. And it would jump from one place to another and make really weird flight patterns. Sometimes it would go dim and then go really bright and go up and down really fast and then appear somewhere else. (I have a short video of it where you can see it jump, but at this point the ship had stopped blinking. Where do I send the video?) Then it started turning left then right in a smooth zig zag type of pattern. It seemed to have a shape while it was turning, but it&apos;s hard to explain the shape. I&apos;d say it&apos;s closest to the &quot;chevron&quot;sign. We also saw a bright white orbish object flying around it for a little bit. Then it started moving back and forth, then disappeared.

It was about 10-15 peaple in this group. then when we asked why they were standing their they said they saw multiple disk shaped crafts flying threw the clouds. I imideatly thought it was just the air force testing new air crafts like the insedint in Roswell. but then when I took a look for a few minutes. Just before I got sick of it I noticed some flashes. Then when the clouds cleared the flashes grew brighter and brighter. before long I noticed a disk shape and saw the silouete of the craft. there was about 4 or 5 of these crafts, I was&apos;nt sure how many because they were disapearing and reapearing threw the sky.

While I kept watching I noticed that it seemed to be getting close to a treeline in the distance.  Suddenly, it flipped totally around and that was when I noticed it was triangular in shape.  The broad end of it flared bright red and it shot almost straight up into the sky.  My wife had just missed seeing it. Last month of this year we are in the same town but a different house.  I witnessed on two seperate occasions a bright object moving almost deliberately but smoothly across the sky. I did not see any blinking or recognition lights.  The object would then arc upwards out of sight.  One I saw had been traveling east-north-east.  The other one had been going east-south-east.  My younger brother on the other side of town had also witnessed these craft and also noted the direction of travel as well.He also has a some photographs of some kind of disturbance in the sky.  In one instance, upon closer inspection you can almost make out a triangular shape in the middle of it.  It almost reminds me of the description of the aura given in the tale of the Philadelphia experiment.  My brother had a source tell him that it appears to be the new kind of camoflage being used by military aircraft.  If so, then it just may be using something similar to electro-magnetic fields to make it work.  He said the images were not visible or noticeable until he got the pictures back.

It had 4 very bright white lights and 2 blinking red lights. I rolled down the window to see if I could identify it by the sound it made, but there was NO noise, it was completely silent! That when I pulled over to give it a harder look. The craft was huge and flying slowly and very low, about 5 stories off the ground, and it was completely silent. It was shaped like either a giant diamond or triangle. I could clearly see the right angle that made up the nose and I could see that the sides also meet at a sharp angles but the back was obscured by the incredibly bright white lights so the shape of the rear was a little hard to make out. As it flew directly over me I could see that it was very dark gray with a black circle in the center. It pass over my head and then make a large arc in the sky and flew west back towards San Francisco. I watched it go over the horizon until it couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore.

This one also had bright white and red lights but unlike the first one I could clearly see that it was triangle shaped. It followed the path of the first but made a slightly tighter arc and continued straight west. As I watched it go, I saw that it was flying towards another one that was far off in the horizon.

What he described as happening was that out of the corner of his eye he caught what he thought was a meteor or a bright shooting star that just simply stopped above the house (so to speak).  He said that he looked at it for less than a minute trying to figure out what he just saw, when what appeared to be a star in the same area moved in a circle.

In about 1991, I witnessed two apparently flat, square, gray objects in the sky. The objects were identical, and moved as one. As an engineer, I would estimate the objects were approximately a half-mile away from me, and were 50 feet to 100 feet wide, each. They were closer to each other than their widths. That is, they were not very far from each other. They were both vertically oriented squares, that is, they were not &quot;diamond&quot; shaped. They appeared to be without much depth, or so it seemed as I was unable to determine if they had a depth due to my viewing them straight on. The two squares appeared to me by descending from the clouds. The clouds were not very high; maybe a few thousand feet. The squares descended from the clouds, to the point they were just below the clouds, then they moved to the west. I was facing south so they shifted across the sky to the right. They only moved 1000 feet or so when they stopped, remained still for a few seconds, and then receded into the clouds again. I estimate the entire sighting lasted only 30 seconds.2.  In 1993, I was swimming alone in the pool one summer night. The weather was nice and warm and the sky was clear. I was floating on my back in the water just looking up at the stars. My body was oriented from east to west, with my feet being to the east. I noticed a red light high in the sky that appeared from my right, from the south. I began following the light with my eyes although I remained in a laying position floating in the water. The red light appeared to be a common aircraft flying high in the sky. I watched the light move toward me and thought nothing of the fact that it was an ordinary airplane or an airliner, but at this point, I gave it no thought at all &ndash; I was just watching it fly over me. When the light reached my 11 o&rsquo;clock position in the sky, it stopped dead. This was very strange to me, as I know planes don&rsquo;t just stop in the sky. I rose up out of the water to see if I could hear the craft, as it may have been a helicopter, but it was not making a sound. The light was not flashing. I stood in the water looking up at the still, red light with amazement, trying to figure out what I was looking at. After a few seconds of being still, the red light moved again, but not how it was moving before. Previously, the red light was moving across the night sky in a slow, steady fashion, which gave me the impression it was an ordinary aircraft flying by in the night. However, after being still for a few seconds, the red light began moving to the north again. It went from my 11 o&rsquo;clock position to out of sight as if it had been fired from a gun. It zipped across the sky at what must have been thousands of miles per hour and it was out of my sight in a second, or maybe less than a second.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were in the backyard of our home taking pictures of whatever might look interesting, as sky-watching is our hobby.  We do it at least 5 days a week to relax after a long day and I&apos;ve been teaching them the constellations.  I then noticed something that didn&apos;t fit what we&apos;ve come to know as a terrestrial craft, whether a jet, prop or experimental aircraft.  There was an object that was going from the west to the east and there was no red light visible (FAA REG) as with ALL OTHER AIRCRAFT taking off from the airport. Then it started to hover and immediately changed direction and again... did not have the FAA green light on its opposite side.I have almost 60 photos of this sighting... you really must see them all to be able to appreciate what is going on here.From my vantage point of about a mile off of the Pacific coast, this craft was hovering on the southern horizon - probably above the electric company at the corner of Studebaker and 2nd Street/Westminster.  After hovering, the craft would then make 160-180 degree turns going east, then west, then repeating while slowly drifting further south - over the Pacific Ocean - towards the famed &quot;Redondo Trench&quot;.  This went on, as can be seen in the properties of my photos, for 26 full minutes.At the time of our sighting this time, it was not clear what shape the object actually was until the photos were analyzed upon download to my computer, and even then, it seemed only the lights were visible.  As far as structure and the apparent &quot;shape-shifting abilities&quot;, this was one spectacular sighting! However it didn&apos;t beat the Triangle &quot;Mothership&quot; we all saw last November 12th, and I don&apos;t think anything else could!  That was reported the same day on UFO NorthWest, if you are interested.Anyway, I took a few &quot;real-time&quot; photos of the craft, but didn&apos;t want to &quot;waste&quot; the pictures and knew the only way to be sure to &quot;get proof&quot; was to take timed shots, so - as a result - most of the almost 60 photos I shot were 8 second exposures at a F 2.5 setting with an exposure value at +2.00 (the highest my camera goes) and certainly showing the true colors of the crafts lights and its flight pattern/path.  I used a high-pixel, Sony Cybershot digital camera and did not alter the originals AT ALL! I have kept their integrity to help you to prove or disprove whatever it was that caused more than ten helicopters to be in the air after it disappeared, and caused them to refuel and return to the search for the next 2 hours or so.  The light appeared to be of whitish/yellow color with a bit of red from time to time, and what got my attention was that the lights and colors did not match the FAA regulations with regards to Red on the left and green on the right and white lights that blink 40x per minute.  This thing pulsed and then stayed lit.  Then it blinked white lights fast and then went back to pulsing again only to follow it with another blast of bright, solid light for another thirty to sixty seconds.  From where I was, it looked like a saucer, then looked like 2 doing maneuvers together.  Then it looked like two orbs that were connected somehow, then &quot;shape-shifting&quot; into something else... more square-round.I would also like to mention that based on the photos I have taken, I have reason to believe their may have been more than one craft in the sky last night, too.  Several shots seem to show what could be mistaken for stars, but upon closer inspection, can be seen to have the same color coding/ shading as the inital craft and in two of my photos, it looks as if their are 2 saucers of another shape that might even be a couple of boomerangs, but on a timed photo, it is hard to tell. You are the experts and I do hope that my final disclosure to you will help figure out what is happening on our planet! Well, this was absolutely incredible, but did not come close to others I and my family have had and would like to talk with an investigator about.Last night, there were a total of 7 of us and an 8th joined in at the last minute, that witnessed this sighting and the after-effects. Only three of us saw it for the first 20 minutes or so, because I was getting pictures while the boys watched and tried to get neighbors out to see it, too.What else is interesting is that on March 11th, 2009, there was little to no usual traffic going into or out of Long Beach Airport and around 8:18pm, seven military and police/civilian helicopters flew over our house, seeming to be looking for something on the ground. They flew rather slowly, from west to east and then took a more southerly direction when above Seal Beach, moving towards the Huntington Beach Area.Scary thing? I took photos of them, too as soon as I heard them coming and watched them go... and the first shot set off the flash which seemingly caused one of the helicopters to turn on and shine a searchlight on us! I had the kids shut off the lights in and outside of the house, got to my computer and downloaded them as soon as I could - just in case I got something I wasn&apos;t supposed to have! I would most certainly like to speak with an investigator, especially since I&apos;ve had multiple sightings (as has my eldest son) over the last many years and would like to finally share some of them with anyone willing to listen. I am beginning to fear whatever the heck is going on... and there IS something going on. Especially here in Long Beach, California.", "LARGE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT DISAPEARS AFTER SPLITING 2 RED LIGHTS  TO THE LEFT AND TO THE RIGHT IN THE SKY!HUGE LIGHTS OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN SPLIT APART! I was standing down near the ocean in Myrtle Beach,South Carolina with some friends and we saw a large light in the sky. A large white light turned red and split apart into 2 red lights in the sky. The red lights would stay there for about a minute and they would disapear. The same thing happen again down the beach, big white light went out while smaller red lights shoot out, the large white light disapeared again! We saw jets (military) Aircraft coming from the area of Shaw Air Force Base out of Sumter,S.C. go out to the location of where the lights were, as though they were searching for what I had seen in the sky. This has happen several times a week in the sky and almost the same spot. The jets would fly out circling and I&apos;m sure they was sent out for that purpose. The jets had weapons on them as if they were on a misson! I have seen these lights off and on the whole month of September. I saw the UFO&apos;s over the ocean and the jets landed at Myrtle Beach airport, every time the jets showed up the lights never appeared! The Jets stayed at the Myrtle Beach Airport 4 days and no lights! It was like the (UFO&apos;s) knew when the jets were around because they never showed back up until the jets left.  I surf fish almost every night in September and October (The fall months) because the fishing is the best, These nights were clear and I could tell what was stars and what was not. These things (UFO&apos;s)that I saw was not Stars!..not any that I&apos;ve ever saw! I have seen serveral UFO&apos;s over the past 15 years, There was a write up in the Myrtle Beach News Paper about these lights and a lot of people reported seeing them, I will try and get the news paper about the reports of sightings. There are UFO&apos;s in Myrtle Beach, S.C. Thank You, Ed((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It came from the left traveling very fast &amp; at a strange angle across the sky.  It was a very large bright colorful ball of fire &amp; became brighter as it passed before me.  It had an unusual bright long thick tail &amp; disappeared over the hill.  At the next red light I asked the man in the car next to me if he &quot;saw that&quot;.  He was just as awestruck! That was an amazing &amp; exciting experience. ps I don&apos;t think that was a star!((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??

These sorts of things I don&rsquo;t believe until tonight.  I was driving home from work and I saw an object in the air.  It had red and green lights and I thought it was just and aircraft or something but I noticed it was just floating!  It was like rectangular shape kind of and when I pulled over in the middle of the road to look at it; it looked like it flipped over like a saucer and smoothly and rapidly disappeared.  I then called my mother because this is like once and a lifetime thing and I saw something soaring through the air higher this time and then it just sat in the sky.I then saw a regular aircraft and it looked like it was going to crash into it.  I called the Mosinee airport to see if there were any of reports but they said that aircraft could be a private plane for all I know.  Nobody believes me but I know what I saw and I wish I could find out what it is.  Of course my camera is broken and I tried my cell phone but it was too high up.It was floating between two houses above the the telephone pole.", "backyard i was getting ready for bead and all of a suden i saw a flash of light when i looked outside i couldn&apos;t belive my eyes. it was an unkown shape,it had 5 bright lights,and it was almost as if i was getting weak because i saw white spots all over me.", "At 5:30 am on March 27th 2009 I was standing in my yard when all of a sudden a bright light appeared overhead and slightly to the south. It was stationery and looked to be about the size and brightness of Venus  as seen in the night sky. It&rsquo;s difficult to say exactly what to place next but the light which did not have a beam pointing to the ground that I could see began to diminish in brightness or rotate forward into the direction that it was about to travel. Once the light was gone what I could now see was what appeared to be a light that you would see on the underside of an aircraft. The craft (in was an airplane) was about 30 to 40 thousand feet in elevation and began moving south and roughly in the direction of the Philadelphia International Airport. I was not able to visually track the craft across the sky as one could normally do because the object was ascending rapidly as it moved forward. Within one minute the light diminished in size so much that I could no longer see it. Very strange behavior for a conventional aircraft.((NUFORC Note;  ISS??  PD))", "We saw one set of red lights followed closely by a set of flashing white lights moving through the clouds.On Saturday April 18, 2009, at 8:33 PM, my daughter and I saw two sets of lights  in the southwest sky.  They appeared to be heading south. The lights were partially blocked by the clouds but the first set had three red lights in the front and two red lights in the back. The first set of lights was closely followed by five or six white lights flashing in unison in a circular configuration. As they passed over the treeline an aircraft passed over our house heading east.", "Witnesses sighting of large ufo with 4 smaller crafts moving near by.On 4/3/09, I stepped onto the front porch of the cabin my husband and I live in together.  I glanced up to see if there were clouds or stars out and noticed a moving object in the center of the sky with a rainbow of colors.  I ran inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars and saw a rapidly rotating orb or sphere that flashed a rainbow of colors as it moved.  It was stationary, but it wasn&apos;t.  It stayed in the same general area, but rotated.  I called my daughter and her fiance along with my husband and we watched it for approximately 20 minutes.  Then, we noticed smaller objects that were moving around this larger orb.  It was as if the first one spotted was the docking station.  The others moved more like planes, but were round with strobe like lights on the bottom that rotated.  The crafts appeared red.  They moved about all around us and this went on for over an hour as we watched in amazement.  One by one they began to become difficult to see and then the larger docking station was moving.  It did not fly away quickly, but started fading and then disappeared.", "Bright Star like objectThere was a bright star like looking object in the sky, it was just sitting there still and I went inside to get my phone to take a picture, when I came back out it was slowly moving across the sky kind of like a plane but you could tell it wasn&apos;t a plane.", "While standing on a patio looking over the ocean, a two red/orange light immediately and obviously appeared over the ocean, one directly above the other.

The light was much larger and brighter than that of an aircraft.The location of the sighting is 33.40638, 79.13479 (via Magellan Triton series handheld GPS receiver) and the object was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon at an azimuth of 115 degrees.Seen by 2 house guest different from report filed for sighting on 4/8/09.", "pink light, came closer, looking like a white object, than reoccurred three more times in same area over the next half hourfirst saw over head while driving, bright pink ball, moved closer quite fast, turned widely in about three quarters of a circle and headed on in that direction. we continued to drive around the area looking and once we turned back on the road where we first saw it, it was again exactly where it started when we first saw it but it wasn&apos;t as bright and it looked more white with flashing lights now but it was traveling too low and fast to be a type of plane, it came back in the same area twice more flying around heading in no clear direction", "Southern California Bright Light/ UFO?  Early Morning.It was about 4 am when I was woken from my brother in law asking for the camera.  He said look outside the window there&apos;s lights in the sky.  So I glanced out of the window to see to bright lights sitting completely still in the sky.  There were no other stars seen and this was the first time I&apos;ve every seen anything like this.  My mom in law said they went out there 30 minutes to an hour early and it got real close and had blue lights flashing on the top of the white light.  I was too scared to go outside to take picture because it was still dark.  I was looking out the window and saw the top light drop and smaller light which fell slowly down and disappeared.  I have pictures of this lights in the sky that were taken around 5am.  I could only describe them as lights that grew dimmer and dimmer and moved ever so slightly as the sun came through. At 5:45 they disappeared.  I will be out there tomorrow night to see if they come back.", "Blue lights seen dancing in the clouds over downtown EdmontonI spotted 3 blue lights moving in a rotational pattern over downtown Edmonton at approximately 1 pm on April 12, 2009. I was standing on my West facing balcony located near Grant MacEwan College when I noticed the lights.  An unusual, large, circular cloud was directly over the city and lights were positioned in the center, and densest part of the cloud.   At first I thought they were air traffic beacons, but there movements were irregular and seemed to be coming from within the cloud.  There were 4 large lights which rotated in formation and then came together.  Another smaller blue sphere joined them when they came together.  Then suddenly, like someone had switched off a light, they disappeared.  It all happened so fast I hardly had time to realize what was going on before they were gone.  I&rsquo;m not positive about the number but think there was five lights in total.  My view was also partially obstructed by the above balcony.  Within an hour following the sighting the cloud cover had broken up completely.  I also spotted a helicopter circling the area within an hour following the sighting", "Stealthy rectangular object seen over Hernando, MSAfter finishing a late-night run, my girlfriend and I stopped to lie down on the track. While pointing out constellations we recognized, she motioned toward an object that momentarily obscured some of the stars from her view. I stood and watched the object after it passed overhead and noticed that it was rectangular, dark colored, emitted no illumination, very fast, and completely silent.It was difficult to determine its altitude, but seemed very low compared to surrounding commercial air traffic. No other aircraft seemed to be following it. The event lasted thirty seconds at the most, and the object moved in a linear path due North/Northwest. This event occurred in Hernando, Mississippi above a running track used by local schools.My girlfriend and I are young (in our twenties) and pretty well educated. I work as a chef in a nearby restaurant, and she is a reservist in the U.S. Air Force. She claims that the object displayed no characteristics of any aircraft she is familiar with.", "4 witnessed light in the sky come down to us and disappear on island in Great Barrier ReefI wanted to put into writing what happened to me and a group of friends on a night I can&rsquo;t forget.  It was the last night of a vacation me and some friends from my university took to an island just south of the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland.  Most of the group was tired from a full day of sight seeing and swimming, but four of us stayed up to watch the sunrise. We were on a large sand island called Fraser island just of the eastern coast of Queensland.  It was about a half hour before the sun would rise over the water on the horizon, so we decided to wait under the stars.  There was about a half moon so the lighting was dim, not pitch dark.  It was however fairly cloudy, and when the clouds opened up we could see the countless amount of stars behind them. We were laying back in the sand when my friend Adam pointed out an unusually bright star out over the horizon.  We were all running through ideas of what it could be.  We thought it may have been a star glowing through an opening in the clouds, but after looking at it it was clear this light was below the clouds.  It was unusually close to the horizon and we though it may have been a light house, but we were certain there was no land off the island.  We figured that it had to be a plane or a helicopter, but for a couple minutes the light didn&rsquo;t move at all. Shortly after, the light was gone.  We shrugged it off as strange but a couple minutes later we noticed it was back.  This time it seemed to be a little higher than it was before.  I was pointing out how weird this all was to everyone drawing our attention to it.  Then, all of sudden the light moved in a right-up-right motion, similar to Pac-Man. At this point I started yelling and screaming that this couldn&rsquo;t be a helicopter, there&rsquo;s no way this thing is a plane.  I continued to yell &ldquo;What the Hell is that!? And pointed at it when we all witnessed the light make two motions at an angle down to just above the surface of the water where the ocean met the horizon. As we watched this white circular orb, it seemed to change shape, kind of elongating in a way and changing to a greenish color and then back to white.  We were watching it in shock when it, as I can best describe, projected itself at us.  It was similar to when a light is coming at you from inside a night club or from a distant laser pen.  We could see the light now coming towards us.  This thing was clearly coming straight towards us at an incredible rate.  I had my eyes fixed on it except when it looked like something whizzed past us left to right on the beach.  It then felt like the light that was being projected toward me was going up and down over my eyes as I was staring at it. In a matter of seconds, this orb, which was now a dim gray came in quickly, floating just above the water.  It followed the contour of the terrain stay just feet over the water, then the sand, slowing as it approached. As I saw it coming in, I was petrified in fear.  I was yelling and pointing &ldquo;ITS COMING RIGHT UP HERE!&rdquo;  As it came in the four us all backpedaled, completely shocked.  This thing made absolutely no sound, but we were all very aware of its presence.  The air seemed to be electrified, as if there was some kind of electrical charge in the air. It was about ten feet high, and about 4 feet in diameter.  It looked similar to a disk only flipped up like a tire or a snail shell.  I could clearly see its outline as it approached, but very strangely, I was able to see through it.  The best way I could describe it was as if it were cloaked, similarly to the Predator in the film with Arnold Schwarzenegger. All four of us backed up terrified, stunned, too scared to run.  As we moved back, the object gradually decelerated to a stop right above the sand where we had just been sitting.  I remember asking my friends in a yelling whisper &rdquo;What the FUCK is that??&rdquo;  I reached for my camera and tried to take a photo of it.  We sat there silently for maybe not even ten seconds, when I could no longer make out its outline.  Then, suddenly a very bright pulse of light above us lit up the beach.  I say pulse because it was very quick, unlike a lighting bolt or camera flash, rather it was a quick &lsquo;bing&rsquo; of light that could&rsquo;ve been missed if you blinked.  The moment after the flash of light, the energy in the air dropped. DISCLAIMER  **At this point, everything became VERY strange.  I will tell the rest of what happened that night exactly the way it happened from my perspective.  Two of my friends remain skeptical.  To this day I can&rsquo;t forget what happened.**  As soon as the object was gone, we started asking each other what it was and where the light came from.  Before we could even start to come up with answers for each other, we noticed a group of people suddenly standing down the beach from us maybe 100 yards away.  We started asking each other how they could have got there.  They certainly didn&rsquo;t walk past us from the left, the only trail down to the beach was behind us, and to the right down the beach the next campground was 9km away.  Either they walked through thorny bushes down from where the resort was or they were there the whole time unnoticed, two very unlikely scenarios. I just had the most unexplainable event of my life just take place, so I told my buddies that we can&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that those are aliens&hellip;  One of my friends was so scared all he could say was shut up, don&rsquo;t say that shit.  As we&rsquo;re trying to figure out how the hell these people got down there, my friend Matt started walking towards them.  I was hesitant to go with but when he got about half way I decided I had to check this out for myself. As we got closer, I could see that there were 8 people facing the horizon.  They were all standing in two lines, shoulder to shoulder, in groups of two .  We stopped about a rocks throw away and yelled HEY!  As we did this, the two standing in the front and one directly behind him simultaneously did a 90 degree about face, much like a soldier or robot.  One of them was very tall, and was wearing a black suit, the person in front of him was shorter and very fat in the hips, opposite of an hour glass, and another was very short, maybe two feet tall, about the size of a small child. &ldquo;WHO ARE YOU? HOW DID YOU GET DOWN HERE&rdquo;. I yelled.  No response.  They just stared at us with dark faces.  At this point we were pretty terrified.  We had already seen lights in the sky and invisible orbs, now a strange group of silent people moving like robots was staring at us.  We could not see there faces.  They seemed to be looking down slightly and had shadows over their faces.  Keep in mind this is in April in tropical Queensland.  We were all in shorts and T&rsquo;s laying in the sand looking at stars.  These people were all fully clothed and standing, staring into a dark horizon with nothing to look at. I yelled out again &ldquo;WHERE ARE YOU FROM?&rdquo;  As I did that another did a 90 degree about face and looked at us.  Me and Matt jumped and grabbed each other, not knowing who or what we were looking at.  This figure was holding a small blue light towards the ground.  I could best compare it to a digital camera LCD if a small camera display were on. We stood there silently when one of the four that had turned towards us suddenly did an about face back to facing the horizon.  We had had enough.  We started walking back towards our other two friends.  We got back to them and started trying to explain how the people were dressed and that they moved robotically, when we noticed one of them was coming towards us. Initially we were pretty alarmed but I remember thinking well there are four of us and one of him.  As he got closer we could see he was no longer coming straight at us but running a path that would cross about 30 feet in front, perpendicular to us.  He was running in very short strides, chopping his feet behind his body very quickly, leaning forward.  As he got exactly perpendicular to us, he slowly moved an open hand left-to-right  in front of his head at about a quarter of the speed he was chopping his feet, as if to waive. We were all shocked.  He seemed to have big gloves on his hands and was wearing a scarf.  My friend Matt began chasing after him.  As soon as he got close to him, he did an abrupt 180 and began chopping his feet back to where he came from.  Nobody new what just happened. My two friends that had stayed behind said that was it, that was just too weird.  They left the beach and went back to our hostel.  Me and Matt sat down in the sand trying to figure out what happened.  We waited for the light of the sun to come over the horizon, and when it was bright enough to look around, the people were gone. To this day I can&rsquo;t explain what I saw.  Whatever came down to us from over the ocean was nothing spiritual, it was not a hallucination, all four of us saw it.  What I will say with one hundred percent confidence is that what I witnessed was some kind of advanced technology.  As far as the figures that showed up, I really don&rsquo;t know.  But if anyone who reads this testimony has had anything similar happen, or can provide any answers I am open to speaking with you&hellip;", "Floating Saucer witnessed in Clinton Twp Michigan.My mother, brother, and I were driving back to my mom&rsquo;s house when I saw a very bright light in the sky in the midst of all the tall leafless trees. It caught my attention because it was bigger than anything else shining in the sky and a lot brighter.  I had to interrupt their conversation twice so that they could take a look at what I was seeing. My mom&rsquo;s house was located in a large area where the only lights you could see outside were the front porch lights if that.As we got closer to my mom&rsquo;s, which meant more darkness, the one bright light seemed to change into about 8-10 colorful lights all blinking in a row. This caused my mom to stop the car on the road and we all proceeded to get out of the car and look up at the object. It was a round shaped, saucer like object, however only half of the circle was lit. It seemed very quiet and it was right above our heads in the sky. It almost seemed like it was planned for us to be right underneath it.After we snapped out of it, I told my mom &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go tell the guys, they will never believe us! Hurry before it goes away!&rdquo; I wanted my step-father and husband to observe this UFO so that they wouldn&rsquo;t think we were crazy when we told them about our sighting. We rushed back in the car and drove to my mom&rsquo;s about 7 seconds away from the sighting.  As we ran out of the car and made it to the porch the UFO flew off at a speed I had never before seen in my life of anything in the sky. It was in the next city in a matter of 2-3 seconds I believe.  Of course as we came inside to explain what we had just witnessed they laughed.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Six people see an object change from glowing red to blinking aircraft to flaming blue meteor.Three of us were at the house and the other four of us were in driving to Publix. I was in the back seat of the car and I saw it first (on the right side of the road).It was a glowing red star with a curved glowing red tail. It looked stationary to me. I thought it was a neon sign or a reflection of one in the window. I don&rsquo;t live there so I thought it could be something explainable. I stared at it for about 3 seconds before asking my friends if they could see the thing I was seeing. When they looked at it, the object began to move. The star in the front got smaller and the tail became straight and skinny (still glowing red).Next, the object begins to turn and the red glow went out. It was dark out so we couldn&rsquo;t see the object&rsquo;s shape but we could see its lights. It had a big light at the front that looked like a dull glow to me. It could have been the glow from being heated. It also had a light at the end. It was a very small flashing red light. That&rsquo;s when we realized that this is a UFO. The object was long and skinny judging by the placement of the lights. The object continues flying with the appearance of an elongated aircraft for about 5 seconds. (It&rsquo;s now on the left side of the road and had made a complete U-turn.)  Then, the object begins to light up again. It gets brighter and brighter and becomes engulfed in blue flames. It looks like a meteor now. It was still moving slowly. It appears as a slowly falling meteor for a little over 5 seconds before all lights go out and the object disappears completely.Three people observed it while in the car. The driver only caught a glimpse of it. We are all college students from the ages of 18-20. I can&rsquo;t speak for the three people who saw it at the house, but they had a completely clear view of the object. They were sitting outside around a fire when they saw it.", "Large bright circular object viewed over the ocean&apos;s horizon at St. Augustine PierI was surfing at the St. Augustine pier and spotted a bright yellow, perfectly circular object hovering in the Northeast area of the sky right above the waterline. In the middle of the object was a smaller dark circle, almost like a small hole. I watched the object move from the northeast towards the north very slowly, in a slight up and down pattern. The object slowly rotated as it was traveling across the sky, changing from a perfect circle to a thin line, as if I were looking at the object from it&apos;s side. The object also slowly changed color from bright yellow to orange, to a darker shade of orange, and then back to bright yellow. It continued to rotate from a full circular shape to a line then back again. The object completely disappeared and reappared twice as I watched it travel slowly across the horizon line above the water. I paddled up to two other surfers in the water, pointed out the object to them and asked if they had been watching it. One said he had been watching it and didn&apos;t know &quot;what the hell that thing is&quot;. The other surfer said it could possibly be a kiteboarder, but there is no way a kite could make a perfectly circular shape like what we were seeing, or be that far out to sea. All three of us ruled out certain slow moving objects like a blimp, or even the moon. The moon could not have traveled that far along the coast in 15 minutes, nor change color, nor disappear as it did. I called the St. Augustine Beach Police Department when I got home. They said no one else had called with such a report today, and was hung up on in mid-sentence while I was trying to honestly describe what I had seen.", "It hovered slowly over the car Sault Saint.We have been UFO hunting lately, since last week i&apos;ve seen at least six, we have video footage of two. and a picture of one during the day. We pulled over because the driver spotted it, we all got out of the car, it had two red lights one white, and three orange on the backside, it moved so slow and hovered right over top of the car within a hundred feet or so, when we turned the headlights on the car back on it accelerated at a ridiculous speed over the treeline. It was a rush...", "THE PRT AND STARBOAD RUNNING LIGHTS  SIR,  IT WAS ABOUT 19:00 WHEN I WAS WALKING MY DOG, I WAS WALKING NORTH ON BRIAN DR.  THIS OBJECT CAME OVER JUST ABOVE THE TREE TOPS AND SOUNDED LIKE A QUIET JET.  I THOUGHT AS I LOOKED UP FUNNY FOR AN A/C TO BE FLYING THIS LOW.  IT WAS HEADING NORTH AT A REAL GOOD CLIP.  IT HAD ONLY TWO RUNNUNG LIGHTS ON THE OUTWARD PART OF THE WINGS.  THE LIGHTS WERE RED AND GREEN BUT GET THIS, THE LIGHTS WERE ON THE WRONG SIDE.  RED WAS ON THE RIGHT AND GREEN WAS ON THE LEFT!

He said some lights just went by north and looked like UFO&apos;s.  He called his brother who works for the Law Enforcement.  I went outside and looked to the North.  I said lets stay here maybe they will come back, and laughed.  Their neighbors said they all saw the lights and were amazed at how fast they went.I was looking North and I saw a small white light that I thought was a star move south towards us slowly; then, it speeded up and when it came about 1/2 mile north of the housing area the light broke up into three lights.  As they moved extremely fast within 10 seconds they were above us; they seemed to pause in midair with no sound.  The lights turned gold and there was no moon out that night. Then, the objects changed shape into golden flying angels.  Some of the neighbors said they looked like flying golden eagles from where they stood.Within the next second, the three objects flew at a southwest angle and disappeared completely into the dark night.  I ran in to call the police department and asked them to record it on their dispatcher log.  We talked with the neighbors for a few more minutes and I spent the night with my son and his family. i was spooked to return to my home which was 19 miles away.We couldn&apos;t even guess how fast the objects moved; it was an eerie feeling watching the objects change shape.

I was driving on Stony Point Road from Rohnert Park to Santa Rosa. Near the intersection of Stony Point and Todd Road was when I saw an aircraft-like object quietly hovering in the sky.The object had 5 orange lights lined up horizontally: OOOOO. The lights alternated in brightness and in color (from orange to yellow).My initial thought was why an aircraft would be flying so close to houses. I would estimate the object to be flying between 500 to 1000 feet above houses, at a speed of 60mph, and was a quarter of a mile ahead of me. I continued to follow it for 3 minutes until my sight of it was blocked by trees and then the object completely disappeared (possibly landing).I followed and saw the object starting from the intersection of Stony Point Road and Todd Road until the intersection of Stony Point Road and Dutton Ave. It was after that that I lost sight of the object.", "very eariestanding outside in the back lane at work in northern ontario on a crisp cold clear evening i noticed in the night sky two oval objects glowing side by side traveling together.

I really question this site.  Let me know different.I like how my complaints to your announcements are for some reason deleted.   Obviously something is wrong here.  I don&apos;t know why but my sightings are for some reason ignored and/or never allowed any way to discuss them.   Why they aren&apos;t made public, even though independent sources have identified it?   In addition, no one even writes a response as to why.  Responses are fine, but not even a response such as  &quot; We get a lot of responses and unfortunately we don&apos;t have room for your sighting&quot;.

We where able to see these objects in the clearing we had entered. We immediately stopped and begin watching the 2 stationary lights.  The lights seemed to glow slightly red and orange and where much larger and brighter than any thing else in the sky to include the standard air traffic and stars.  They then faded out one after the other at the same rate of speed. I can assure you, being former USAF Crash Rescue, they were not aircraft, flares, or any other normal objects.  Nether of us were surprised about seeing the objects, we have witnessed a number of different unknown objects separately.  I recently found that as many as 5 other Firefighters and paramedics (1 while on duty) may have also witnessed this sighting, as well as a similar sighting 2 weeks earlier.

Assuming it was a low flying airplane or a helicopter with the bright search light on, I watched without much thought or concern.  After about 5 minutes passed I realized that the object had not moved and we were getting closer to it.  As we got near, the one light from the distance became two distinct lights with a couple red lights in between.  Again reminding me of a plane, however, this object was still stationary.  We actually passed the object at around mile marker 129 (it was to the east of the interstate) and at this point we could make out the three bright white lights in a triangle shape.  The object NEVER moved.  I also noticed some blinking coming from on top of the craft, I could make out two brighter white lights that would blink up high and one of the red lights blink below.  The craft made no sound and continued to hover as it got smaller in the distance of us driving away.  In total, I watched the object for about 15 to 20 minutes.  This length of time rules out the possibility of it being a low flying airplane because that would have come and gone in minutes.  The helicopter is the only logical explanation, but that doesn&rsquo;t explain the silence nor the triangle shape of the lights (and I could be wrong, but I thought they could not hover in one spot for too long of a time).   Furthermore, I have seen many helicopters growing up in Colorado next to all the airports and air force base and I&rsquo;ve never seen one stay perfectly still for as long as this did.", "Two large bright glowing lights flying in the clouds in Tucson.This is an addendum to the report already filed for the same date, time, and location.  I rewrote paragraph 2 only, so you can replace the second paragraph with this one.  The rest is the same.  Thanks. The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6. I remember the time exactly because I was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at Davis-Monthan AFB waiting for my shift to start. I was participating in an exercise and normally wasn&apos;t there that early. It was still fairly dark outside but daylight was just starting to break.  As I was looking forward through the windshield, I first saw the lights out of the corner of my eye out the driver side window.  Even before I turned to look at them, I could instantly tell these were odd lights in the sky.  As I watched the lights go by, I froze, didn&apos;t want to blink or even breath, and I had this real ominous feeling like I was in the presence of something otherworldly. The lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway. These lights were so bright, they lit up the clouds.  I had been in the Air Force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and I NEVER saw lights on a conventional aircraft that were big enough or bright enough to do this, especially since the lights were just as bright coming from the south as they were when they flew out of range to the northwest.  It really frustrated me that there was a straight narrow path of clouds going from the south to the northwest while most of the rest of the sky was clear.  These clouds were slightly puffy and relatively low in the sky.  I would best describe them as stratocumulus, and guess their altitude between 6,000 to 10,000 feet.  I was hoping the lights would make a turn so I could get a better look at them but they stayed behind this narrow path of clouds the entire way and I was never able to see an object.  Also, I should mention that as bright and fast as these lights were, surprisingly I saw no contrails at all.  After the lights went by, I looked around the parking lot to see if anyon! e else s aw it, but no one was around. That in itself was odd. There should have been several people in the parking lot by that time.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As I looked up hovering above and somewhat in between the trees was this UFO. My friends saw this and the object was so unreal that all 4 of us got out of the car and were staring and screaming and saying oh my god, oh my god in the middle of the road. The object was probably about 15 feet above us in the trees. The front of it was domed shaped all clear, inside were to men with masks that had long tubes hanging in front of them. Their faces were un-identifiable due to the dark masks.  The &quot;men&quot; were staring at us and spoke to us but it was very muffled so we couldn&apos;t understand them. The object made NO engine noise at all, it was completely silent. We were so freaked out and one of the girls was crying so we got back in our car and drove away.It was reported to the local newspaper and apparently there had been other calls made about it too.Now, we do live very close to Fort Lewis, among a few other military bases, so perhaps it was a military craft but the fact that it made absolutely no sound was beyond our belief.We did not receive any burns on our body, nor did the trees seem to be affected.  Our car started right up so I can&apos;t imagine that there was radiation.That&apos;s my story, and its rarely discussed because we were made fun of when we talked about it.

We decided to go to the local Sonic fast food restaurant and get something to eat. We got there at 00:00, and the employees told us that they were closed for the night. Well, one of my friends knew one of the employees.  So we decided to wait for her to clock out. She came out shortly after, at 00:03.We were all standing in the parking lot by the highway and talking.  I heard a noise of something that sounded like a distant airplane. Not too distant, but one that sounded like it might be close. I looked directly up, waited a second for my eyes to adjust to the darkness of the sky.  When they finally focused I saw what was dimmer than the brightest star (not including our sun) moving around at a great speed. It was quite small, this could have been because it was quite high in the sky, higher than most airplanes it seemed.  It seemed to be somewhat triangular in shape.  I watched it for a second, and it quickly started making sharp turns left and right, while still going at that same constant speed. It didn&rsquo;t look like it was getting any closer. The first thing I thought was it was a bug flying around, but there was no way it would be that visible at this time of night.I told everyone and two of my other friends saw it, even one with glasses on.  The other friend, and the person we were waiting for to get off work didn&rsquo;t see it.  The employee thought that we were smoking something that night, but that was defenetaly not the case.  I watched it for a good while, almost a minute, as it make incredible turns at such a high speed.  This thing could not have been man made. If it were, not many people know about it.I finally looked away for one second to ask how my friend and the employee could not see the UFO. And when I looked back it zoomed off.  I didn&rsquo;t see if it went off somewhere else or if it just went straight up and left the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.  And just as fast as it was gone, so was the quiet noise it was making while it was flying directly above us.  I kept looking around hoping to find it, and I couldn&rsquo;t.

We were in a small covered gazebo talking and laughing when we witnessed what we thought was a flash of lighting directly overhead (we heard nothing).  The weather is of concern to us because we are forecasters so we all stepped out of the covered area to see where the lightning could have come from.  There were almost clear skies and no storm clouds in any quadrants.  It could not have been lightning.

We were at a large hill called horsebarn hill at the University of Connecticut. I was the one who first spotted it when I saw two airplanes in the unobstructed sky and noticed that there was a third object (the glowing ball) which was not behaving like the other two airplanes. We surveyed the area and noted that there were nearby radio towers and traffic lights that were visible slightly above the tree line, but none of these were at the same height as the object. We observed the object hovering for a brief period (about 5 minutes) and it was pulsating with light. Soon the object disappeared. We began to scan the sky again and a few seconds later we noticed the object again over the campus, a great distance away from where it was before. We didn&rsquo;t know how it was possible for it to travel that fast. It hovered there for a while and disappeared. To me it seemed like it disappeared but I have terrible eyesight and wasn&rsquo;t wearing any visual aids. My two other friends however could still see it as a small red dot traveling at an immense speed to the other side of the hill where we saw it initially. We then saw it change a series of colors (purple, white, and yellow) and it looked like it was wobbling back and forth in the sky. We continued to watch the object and it disappeared and reappeared several times, randomly getting brighter until it was the brightest object in the sky and it disappeared again to move to a new location. After about 30 minutes of observing this object, we were not able to locate it again. I did record 4 videos of the object on my cell phone camera and caught one of the object increasing the intensity of light and disappearing, however since it is a camera phone it is not of exceptional quality. I am certain what we saw was not an airplane or a radio tower or even a street light.", "clear night sky, bright object, changing shapes and moving quickly in every direction with no pattern.From at least 4:30 AM thru 5:55 AM from the mid 5200 Block of the 60&apos;s Streets in Sacramento, near Fruitridge and 65th  - due East at what I believe was about 20 degrees above horizon was a bright light that stayed visible but moved quickly up and down, side to side and at diagonals. It stayed visible varying only slightly in any direction until approx 5:20 AM at which  time it quickly moved up and right and stayed there for at least &frac12; hour.  There were 2 witnesses.  We got some video footage but it&apos;s not great.  Used a telescope to try to get closer but all we could see was a bright light which seemed to morph in shape and move quickly in any given direction without notice.  Could not make out the shape of object except that it seemed to change shapes rather regularly.  If others saw this or know what it could have been, insight would be appreciated.  It was impossible to tell the distance but it was many miles away.", "Satellite Debris Perhaps?Over a period of approximately 15 minutes going from 90 degrees overhead starting in the northwest sky, I witnessed some sort of object that appeared to either flash or reflect sunlight based on its movement through the sky towards the north.The object appeared to be some sort of Satellite; however the inconsistency of its luminance which varied throughout the time I observed it, did not follow any normal patterns I have observed in satellites.  After about 5 minutes along a similar trajectory, I witnessed the same thing again, by I presume, another object or possibly satellite debris.  Finally I saw a third object about another 5 mintues later doing the same sort of inconsistent pattern.  No series of satellites would follow that close in my opinion along the same trajectory unless it is debris from a rocket, or satellite or something else we have not heard of yet.", "Bright, moving circular object dims, brightens slightly then disapears in a clear sky.My wife and I were standing in our yard at around 21:20 on 04/17/2009. While looking toward the north my wife noticed a bright &quot;star&quot; like object travelling at a constant rate from west to east. I found the object very quickly after she pointed it out and was able to witness the following.We had been observing the clarity of all of the stars and planets because we have just recently moved from the city to the country and were amazed by the difference in the visible sky. There hasn&apos;t been a cloud in the sky all day and there were not any in the sky at the time of the event.At first glance we thought it was an airplane, however it was a solid white color with no blinking and about the same light magnitude of a typical star in the sky. The object continued on its course for less than 10 seconds, dimmed, then brightened for just a split second before disappearing. There was still a visible star to the right of the object when it disappeared. Whatever it was it seemed to follow a &quot;controlled&quot;, straight path.My wife and I have never experienced a &quot;UFO&quot; sighting before, ever. I do believe in such objects but the scientist in me wanted to try and disprove what we witnessed. I looked up the orbital paths of the ISS as well as satellites and was unable to find anything with the trajectory that the object followed at the time of the event. We are left to believe that this was indeed our first UFO sighting. We waited for another 20 minutes with both of us watching separate portions of the sky to see if it would return but had no luck.", "Triangle shape seen in Hendersonville in 95I was returning home from doing some shopping  in Gallatin, Tennessee, with my then young son taking a nap in the back seat, and was travelling towards Hendersonville on the Vietnam Veteran&apos;s Boulevard bypass, planning on getting off at the New Shackle Island Road exit.At the exit prior to the one I was going to take, some lights to my right attracted my attention.  Higher in the sky, one could see the usual collection of airplanes that were on approach towards the Nashville Airport that is several miles on the other side of Old Hickory Lake, but these particular lights were moving slowly, were very low, a dull red in color, and were losing altitude.I didn&apos;t think much about it as I continued on towards my exit, but noticed that the lights continued to drop even lower and moved slower over the top of the suburban homes that lay to the right of the bypass.  Becoming concerned, thinking that perhaps an airplane was in trouble, and at the time being a Certified Nurse Technician, I slowed down and kept checking on these lights as I finally reached my exit, thinking that I might have to grab my phone and dial 911 if there was a plane crash.As I exited on New Shackle Island Road, the lights were now coming right towards me, as I exited to the right, and at this point, I realized that this was not an airplane. I pulled off onto the shoulder of the road and got out of my car, my son still asleep in the back seat, and I was absolutely overwhelmed by what I saw.It was triangular in shape on the bottom, with a dull red light at each corner on the bottom, and one in the center.  I had the sensation of a huge mass, that it was very large, more of a pyramid in shape, and that there was a sort of grid that lined it, rather reminiscent of a rocket gantry, some sort of support structure. It was totally black, so black, in fact, that it seemed to absorb light, giving off no reflection of any kind.There was no sound from this craft, no engine sound, no whine of turbines, nothing.  But I could feel an extremely low level vibration and hum as it approached.It seemed to be just drifting at this point, right over my head, so close that I would swear it seemed I could have thrown a rock at it and hit it. I stood there for several minutes as this thing went right over my head, then it headed slowly down the bypass, and suddenly just completely disappeared.  I got in my car, did a Uturn across the street, trying to see it, but it was gone.  And during this whole time, no traffic passed, which was a fact that didn&apos;t register with me until I was headed towards Springfield on the back roads. It felt as though somehow time itself had stood still as this craft passed overhead.If anyone else saw this craft, I would be very interested in hearing about it. I did not report it at the time, because I frankly did not know who to turn to, without being laughed at or not taken seriously, but with the increasing number of reports that sound so much like what I saw, I decided to go ahead and report it.This did not have the appearance of being terrestrial in nature, and I would gladly submit to hypnosis if needed to verify this report and perhaps dig out other details that I may have forgotten.

My friend had taken off for awhile to go inside his apartment.

I thought it was rather odd, so I keep on looking in that direction.  Before you know it, I was noticing an object that looked like a star that was very bright that just appeared from nowhere around the same area.  It was moving around the same general area and would disappear and reappear and was flying by really fast, I later found out that this was no star.  I thought this was really strange.  Then I was trying to follow it around with my eyes and I was really excited to be witnessing this.  Another light that looked like the same one appeared in another direction below that to the right and it looked like they would appear and reappear and fly away.  I was really excited to be seeing this and hoped that it would last as long as possible.  Later, I had seen a third object that had looked like the same of them appear in another direction (to the lower left), kind of like an off triangle formation.  By this time, my friend had come back and I was hoping that he saw the same thing that I was seeing just to reaffirm and because I just couldn&rsquo;t believe it.  He saw the same thing that I was seeing.

It got very bright and then disappeared, which it did a few times until it stayed bright.  (My radar detector went off saying K band like crazy each time that the light appeared and then would stop after it disappeared.)  I have grown up in this area and my radar does not usually go off in that area and it didnt go off the next day when I went back to the same spot so it must&apos;ve been picking up something that was emitted from the light.  It would also be worthy to note that this light was very close to the ground, and from my perspective I would say it was no higher than a three story building.)  Then, from the original light, came three others that branched out into a diagonal line formation, the lowest light being at the right and the highest at the left...somewhat like this -&gt; &#x5C;  (we had no idea that there was other lights behind the first until they appeared; it was as if they were &quot;turned off&quot; until they came into action).  These lights were redish orange and hovered in place.  When they moved into the diagonal formation it was precise and quick.  The entire sighting happened over a ten minute period or so, and then the lights just disappeared.  After waiting around for about an hour for the lights to reappear we gave up looking and went home. We all got a very good look at these lights and there is no way that they could have been any sort of aircraft.  Also, I would like to state that my friends and I had/have been noticing very similar lights in the sky that would become very bright and then disappear but this sighting is the only one in which the lights moved about into a formation.

My phone was upstairs, so I went up to answer it, and than out onto my 3rd floor balcony as I noticed the moon was very light.  The night sky was almost absolutely clear, the stars were really shining and I could see very well, since all the sreet lights were out.  I am in Quito Ecaudor, in a valley outside the city.  At about 7:30, while looking at the sky, I saw something far away, as it looked like a star, moving across the night sky.  This was nothing like a shooting star, as I have seen many before....this maintained its luminosity? and moved consistently at the same pace about 90 degrees across the sky.  I called my dad to tell him what he saw, and at his house  1 mile away, he went out.  He noticed something moving across the sky, in the other direction...i was still looking in the direction on mine as I thought it had stopped moving.  Than about 1 hour later, i went back out and saw another object, much lower in the sky move across the mountain range. It definietly have a few red lights....and one white.  It moved across the mountain range, than out over a valley andover a mountain.  This was not a plane.  Since the night sky was so clear, you can EASILY tell an airplane....and also hear it.  This was silent.  About 3 minutes after that had passed, another passed in the same pattern, no noise.  About 5 minutes later...an airplane came in and I could notice the MANY differences in ligthing, noise, etc. than what i had previously just seen.  I could see NO shape with my object really...just by the lighting, it seemed almost circule or diamond shaped, but the lights were clustered close together, so it&apos;s hard to really tell.", "star light object in vegas that stayed stationary then it into a cigar shaped object with both ends lit. after 10 minutes disappearedI was eating a meal outside of whole foods market when i saw a very large ball shaped object, that looked similar to a star at first; however, it seemed too bright for it to be a star.  It stayed stationary for about five minutes, while my girlfriend and I observed it.  It didn&apos;t look like a star or a plane after about five minutes.  It then too the shape of a very long cigar shaped object.  I thought it might be a test missile or a test airplane because the surrounding area of Las Vegas has a lot of Testing Facilities; however, this now cigar looking object did not look like a jet stream or a plane or anything of that sort. The tips of the cigar shape were very bright and the oject continued to remain stationary as it transformed from a large star looking object into a cigar shape; About five minutes later it vanished, which led me to posting this report.  It seemed very clear that this was, certainly, an unidentified flying object and I hope people will find this interesting", "I was standing on T-box at golf course 8 miles north of Muenster, Texas looking toward the Northwest.

However, after only being out for a couple of minutes, I had spotted a light over in the distance.  I presumed it was first of all a plane with it&apos;s lights on at night, but as it seemed to come closer, I started to think it was a plane on fire, as the sheer brightness, matched with the orange/yellow colour of a fire glowed from it. Although after watching it for a few seconds more, I do not believe this was so.  It closely resembled a diamond shape, but I could only describe as the colour that shone from it, maybe the diamond shape was an aura of light around this object.  I did pull my mobile phone out to take a picture, however I am afraid due to the age of my phone, the picture did not come out at all.As soon as I had thought the object was possibly a UFO, I quickly returned to my kitchen and rang up one of my friends to ask them to look out in the same direction, but by the time I had returned to the garden, the object seemed to be fading.  I assumed it was going the opposite direction, but the speed at which it seemd to shrink into the distance was immense.  I was too late in asking my friend to look for this object, but I shall be checking my local papers in the next day or two, seeing whether anyone else has seen this.  I certainly hope someone has managed to take a picture, as I have to admit I was very excited at what I had witnessed.(The length of time the object had been in the sky leads me to believe that it was not a flare from the coast, as it hung in the same location for such a long period of time, without falling).I have only now started scouring the Internet, and have come across http://www.nuforc.org/ I have also recorded these following details, the time is as accurate as I can guess, give or take five minutes either way.  I look foward to any reply, although I understand you must receive many letters from people with similiar stories, but I would ask if there is a chance you could let me know if anyone else may contact you regarding the following:  22:40 - 22:45 Saturday 18th April  UFO? -  Orange/yellow colour, like fire, in the direction the Belfast Lough points toward the mainland.Rough Diamond shape, though may be an aura rather than the object&apos;s actual shape.  3-5 minutes sighting.Thank you in advance for any reply,  ((name deleted)), N.Ireland", "Very bright solid gold disc sighted in Bonita Springs, FLVery bright solid gold flash in the shape of an oval or disc, streaked across the sky as I drove north on Highway 41 in Bonita Springs, FL around 10pm on 4/8/09.

Earlier in the evening on this date, a large dark rain &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; had moved in from the west, moving northeast and was positioned in the Northern sky.  Within this rain &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;, which looked to be several thousand feet in the sky, and maybe several thousand feet in area, my coworker and I saw what appeared to be three white lights which appeared to be just skimming the underside of the cloud formation turning in a clockwise direction.  What I mean by skimming is how I think a light source would be observed just inside the bottom of a cloud formation without exposing itself clearly to anyone from the ground.  This view was like seeing a light source in a fog or haze if you can imagen a view like this.  They were dim in places and brighter in other places as they were traveling closer and further away from our angle of view. The three lights were in a triangular pattern circling and synchronized with each other, meeting in the middle of the triangle formation moving in a clockwise direction.  Imagen three circles in a triangular pattern with rings touching each other and you can get an idea of these lights.  My coworker and myself watched these three lights for about twenty minutes before we decided to get back to work to finish up the night shift, which ended at eleven thirty. During this time while we were both looking at this event we were also scanning the horizon trying to find any kind of light source such as spot lights or other lights coming from the ground in this area which could have been projecting these lights from the ground. We were unable to observe any ground effect lights which could have been causing these lights. Of course this cloud could have been smaller or larger than described.  There was nothing really to reference this cloud&rsquo;s actual size that we could see in this area to give us a true indication of its size, but from past experience observing storm clouds and rain clouds like this it appeared to be very large in area as well as height.  Also, no other lights were observed in any other clouds during this event.", "They were moving to fast not to make a shock wave soundI was looking at the sky in a west to north direction and saw 2 lights going from south to north moving at a rapid speed. the most western light seemed to twist in a northern direction ubtil they dissapeared from my sight.  There was no noise and the lights seemed to be less then 2 miles high. They seemed to be going at mock 3.  There was no noise.  I thought it was a little strange but dismissed it at first as a trick of light when the lights seemed to twist. Less then 10 minutes later 2 lights came from north to south going at more then mock 6 but like before there was no noise.  Then I was sure that what I was looking at and seeing was not normal.

On the freeway to go home,  I had just gotten on I-25 from the frontage road and was somewhere around the exit for Montgomery road.As I was driving I happened to look up through the windshield at what I though was a reflection in the glass from behind. However, when I looked up the light was coming from an intensely bright object in the sky, maybe (I&apos;m estimating here) about 45 degrees up from the horizon of my car hood.The object was shaped like a tear-drop on it&apos;s side. I almost thought it was a comet at first, but then I realized it was completely solid looking. It looked like it had a tail except the &quot;tail&quot; was as solid as the rest of the object and very distinct.There was none of the hazy quality you usually see with a comet&apos;s tail, plus it was clearly all one piece, with no detached parts. Also, it was really low in the sky so I could see it very clearly. I&apos;m thinking a comet that close to the city would be pretty much impossible. The object was about the same altitude as planes are when they are coming in to land at the airport nearby.There was a red &quot;aura&quot; for lack of a better word springing to mind, out in front of it...but only around the curve where the &quot;front&quot; of the object was based on the direction it was travelling (west to east across the sky).The object was moving really fast. It crossed an area of the sky about as wide as my windshield in probably less than a second. I got a good look at it but only briefly before it flashed a kind of bright blue and was completely gone. It did not go over a horizon or behind any buildings or cars and the Sandia mountains were still a good distance away from where it disappeared. It just flashed bright blue and was gone.There was no sound, and no trace of anything left in the sky.The night was largely clear (at least I didn&apos;t notice any clouds), with very good visibility. You could see all the constellations really well and there were not an inordinate amount of vehicles on the road, about average for a Tuesday night.I can say with certainty that this was not a reflection, a balloon or lamp, a shooting star, or anything else. It was way too solid, distinct and fast (and pretty big at that) for any of those things. It moved in a fairly straight line before disappearing. I looked around to see if anyone else noticed it, but honestly couldn&apos;t tell if anyone had. I hope someone else did because I&apos;d like to compare notes and see what they saw.It was very intense,solid, bright and quick, but it was one of those moments where there is no doubt about the details of what I saw. I don&apos;t drink or party or anything and I got a really clear look at it. It was definitely odd looking and not something I could explain. I wish I could say I had snapped a pic, but it was gone too quick.", "Glowing missile shaped object sited north of Houston IAH and heading towards earth.What appeared to be a glowing fire rocket streaked across the sky and downwards towards the earth.

We were traveling north on JFK Blvd towards Terminal A.  It did not appear to be a meteorite due to its cigar shape.  One of the observers is retired Air Force and said it looks like a missile attack. No crashing boom was heard after it dissappeared towards the ground.

I was able to see it from my window on the 2nd story of my house, it was a white light, seemed like a moving star except you could see it moving.  I am in the country, and the town lights are in the northeastern sky but some stars are visible still. I thought it was a shooting star until i saw a plane seem to follow it.  The plane behind it had the sound of a jet. It was slightly off in the horizon.  This all took place in the eastern sky.  It was a perfectly clear night, about 65 degrees.  Star lit skies, and the moon was present.   I was able to pick up an very faint odd transmission that came through my guitar.  I was recording on my macbook with garageband and i heard what sounded like a data stream from an old telephone modem and a voice in the background that was jumbled and not really audible, that sound is what alerted me to look out side and i saw the object and the plane as stated above.  I was able to record a bit of this, there are parts where the recording just seemed to go to nothing and then back in.  The following url is a link to the sound file in mp3 format.

On Sunday the 19th I left Oklahoma late in the afternoon and drove to somewhere within the borders of New Mexico that evening. Found a small motel checked in went to sleep. The next morning I woke up, gassed up, cleaned my windows and continued on toward my destination at approx. 7am.

I noticed a bright object in the direction I was looking and focused my vision on it. At first I thought it might be a hot air balloon, having just watched a documentary on them on PBS just a few days before, but the object wasn&rsquo;t shaped like a balloon. The object was shaped like a dome that was slightly short of a half circle. It had a flat bottom to it that was shaped like a tear drop on its side, with the pointy end facing toward my right. I approximate that I was looking up at a 20 to 30 degree angle, through my windshield.There was a plane in the far distance coming toward me from the area of NW Arizona that was within my field of vision as well, evidenced by the con trail it left in its wake and a large mesa off to the right that was parallel to the highway. The craft was slightly above the mesa in clear blue sky.The object was bright metallic silver, as pure a color silver as I&rsquo;ve ever seen. There were no other distinguishing marks other than the bottom which appeared white and which for the briefest of moment seemed to phase out of distinct characteristic form and then back in.I had been looking at the object for a matter of probably six seconds and had to turn my attention back to the road to make sure I was still traveling in my lane. Convinced I was ok I looked back to where the object had been and it was gone&hellip; completely.Within a couple miles of the sighting was an exit off the highway. I took it and got out of my car to investigate further. I couldn&rsquo;t see anything but several airplanes with the con trails left in their wake.I later exited at another off ramp to ask if there was any historical significance to the area and I found out that right there was the entrance to Chaco Canyon, the residence of the now extinct Anastasi Indians. I thought that was interesting.", "UFO&apos;s seen over a mesaThis sighting took place in Mesa County around Grand Junction, Colorado.

A few moments later while still looking at the airplane, I noticed a disk shaped object traveling perpendicular to the airplane, but at a much lower altitude, perhaps 800 to 1500 feet.  This object passed almost directly overhead and moved in a straight line and level altitude.  My guess is this object was 10 to 20 feet in diameter and grey in color.  I observed this object for maybe 20 seconds before walking inside the dormitory.   I must admit becoming a little scared.

I then noticed two more green lights moving with it, also sporadically. They moved very fast and turned sharply and quickly. There was no real pattern to their movements at first, but then they formed a large circle in the sky and seemed to move on a fixed rotation around the circle.

They must have passed directly over the airport and were changing formations in ways no kind of fighter jets or anything could.

It was around 10:15 pm. I look in the sky all the time. One of my friends that was with us is an engineer and gets into the paranormal and UFO&rsquo;s. We talk about it a lot. This was very crazy and much unexpected. Over the Tucson Mountains to our west, we noticed 3 Hugh orange lights and changing colors to red and white. At the same time we noticed 2 more strange white smaller lights over head a lot closer to us. They made no noise what so ever, and there was no running lights or any blinking lights on it. Looking back over at the 3 lights over the Tucson Mountains as they changed color and where pulsating. Just like the Phoenix UFO on the news some years ago.They went out one by one and out of order. Then with in a couple of short minutes later they showed up over the Silverbell mountains and did the exact same thing then disappeared. My friends where looking at the 2 over our head and did not see the lights over the Silverbell mountains. When I told them too look they disappeared that fast.I looked back at the smaller lights over our heads as they where coming closer too us. These lights where white, and pulsating and moving more up then down. No other lights on the craft. One was just hovering. The second one was moving away to the west of our position. Then it disappeared. Boom! Just gone!  I know none of the objects we had been looking at where any type of plane. Or helicopter. I live right by the Air force base and the Tucson Air Port and see and hear planes every day.The last one that was hovering stayed there for a few minutes, and then it made a very wide circle and went back to where it was hovering. Then did the same thing as the other one did. Slowly moved to the west and in front of all our eyes it pulsated then disappeared.Two days later on 2-23-09 I was standing outside my home looking up into the sky at all the stars and planes still thinking about the other night. When a white light with no running lights or any other blinking lights on it came from the east, very slow. As it came closer I noticed it was not making any sound what so ever. It then got Hugh so bright that it hurt my eyes. It then stopped due south of my home just with in a mile of me. I noticed 3 Air force jets circling it. The light then went down in intensity.

Minutes later I saw what I thought was an aircraft flashing from blue to red to green it moved quickly left and then backwards it stopped and stayed in place about 30 to 40 minutes then I saw jets flying in the area and it disappeared. The brillant flash was seen in three states. Some saw a green fire ball I did not see that, what I saw was the flashing spheres, it may have been our location.

On October 17 of 1997 two friends and I were driving west on a county road (318) just outside Ignacio, Co. This road is heavily traveled and is on the Ute reservation with a mountain range parallel on the southern boundary...the road then descends into a pronounced canyon before meeting the major HWY 550 Corridor from Aztec to Durango.On this evening at about 8:17 p.m.we had just gone four miles west and looked up in the sky towards the southwest and above the mountains....and pulled to the side of the road to listen and look.Only one other car passed us going east at this time.A very ,very large triangular shaped &quot; ship&quot; with extremely long &quot; pole/legs&quot; was moving to the southwest....and within these pole/legs were a pink and very red swirling energy of light and motion...as if the poles were &quot;sucking up the matter/plants/dirt of the hills and mesas near the mountains. There was absolutely no sound and the size and scale of these legs and &quot;ship&quot; are still beyond my memory&apos;s ability to compute. My friends and I just kept asking what it was...and kept watching and not believing the size of the objects in our view.We then drove three more miles west to get another perspective and to see if the ship was moving...we then saw two smaller (relatively speaking) triangles a little higher in the sky and definitely moving southwest.The larger ship was perceptibly moving and I used a fist measurement I learned from someone to gauge height in the sky...I counted seven fists high the one pole/leg nearest us.We then drove two more miles west to look back...again no sounds, no airplanes overhead, no animal sounds....and we could look back and see all three pole/legs from that view....the legs were so long/large that it appeared that two tornado shapes on top of each other were swirling and picking up matter.We then drove into Bondad canyon and slowed to look back and could not see the objects any longer....and when we reached Hwy 550 and looked east toward the mountains and the canyon...there was nothing to see.We then drove south to our river home and looked back from the driveway....and saw nothing.I called my brother in Albuquerque (167 miles away) just to see if anything was on the news....and we tuned into local radio.I called the airport in Farmington, NM and the college observatory the next day...and nothing had been reported.My friends have really never referenced this event again...and for twelve years I have carried a sense of forever being changed by what we witnessed.I have spent years on the web looking for any other experience similar...especially the pole/legs whirling pink/and red tornado like motions....with no sound.I hope I can speak at length to someone about this event.Aztec has a UFO site northeast of the city on Hart Mountain....when I look at the trajectory of the &quot;ships&quot; of October 1997....they were definitely running parallel to Hart Mountain.", "Seemingly shooting star spilt into 4 objects, then joins back up into one object in the Black Hills.I was parked in my driveway getting out of the car when I thought I saw a shooting star in the Western part of the sky, over the Black Hills, moving North East.  I exclaimed to my husband - &quot;look! A shooting star!  Make a wish!&quot;  But what I thought was a star wasn&apos;t.  It didn&apos;t fade out, it seemed very close to Earth too close to be anything but an airplane), it made no noise at all, and the shooting star-like thing split, uniformly, into 4 parts.  The 4 parts looked like shooting stars, same size as the original and they moved slightly away from each other.  After moving away from each other for 5 seconds, still going North East very quickly, they joined back up in a uniform fashion.  They didn&apos;t lose or gain speed, they just moved very fast at a steady pace.  By this time, I was squealing at my husband to get out of the car to see this, but the &quot;shooting star&quot; moved to a spot in the sky behind some trees in the yard, and I did not see it again.  I looked all around for anything that might have reflected light, like tree branches or power lines, but I found none.

It was near 9:30pm on Monday, April 27th of &apos;09. I was alone and traveling along US 25 heading toward I-26 and had crossed the state line not long before this sighting. I noticed the craft ahead of me; it caught my attention because of the unusual lights, how low it was and how close it was to the road.As I got closer to it, I became sure that this wasn&apos;t any type of standard aircraft I&apos;d ever seen before. It was round/ball-shaped with two red lights on either side, center, and a row of at least 3 rectangular light panels on the bottom half which were strobing slowly in vertical sequence, from the top one down. It was about the size of the cab section of an 18-wheel truck. I estimate it was approximately 50 feet in the air, on the right side and just slightly over the road. It did not move at all, and as far as I could tell, it remained stationary the entire time I had visual contact with it. I had the radio playing and did not have the presence of mind to turn it off or down, so I am unaware if the craft made any type of noise. I did briefly consider stopping to try and take a picture, but the only thing I had with me was an older cell phone which previous experience taught me did not take decent pictures at night at all.I slowed my vehicle quite a bit as I approached in order to get a better look at it, being both fascinated but understandably a little shaken, too. In my rearview mirror, I previously had noted that another car was coming up behind me. I was driving quite slowly, so with that in mind, I sped up slightly to prevent annoying the other driver and finally drove past the craft, which still never moved from its position.Once past it, I looked in my mirror again and was dismayed to see that the car I&apos;d seen behind me was no longer there--I&apos;m not sure if the other driver had seen what I was seeing and pulled off or had exited the road somewhere--but I became immediately aware that I was now totally alone on the road, with no cars whatsoever in sight in either direction. This finished unnerving me and while I no longer saw the craft, I suddenly felt the need to at least be within sight of other cars/people, so I accelerated to appx 70-75 mph and stayed at that speed until I finally caught up to more cars about five minutes later.This was my first encounter of this nature. I came to this website to see if there were any other sightings in that area on that night and chose to report what I&apos;d seen since I found nothing else.

I live in a condo on Butler Beach very near Saint Augustine Beach and the ancient city of Saint Augustine.  Very often I take a 4 mile walk on the beach in the evenings.Last night, Friday April 3, 2009, I left my house at approximately 9:00 PM (I did not wear a watch) and I walked south down the beach from Dondanville Road to Mary Street (2 miles) where I turned around and was approximately one half mile north of the Matanzas Street beach ramp (I estimate it was between 9:35 and 9:45 PM).  I was noticing the bright moon nearly directly overhead casting a short shadow as I walked and I turned around and looked up to admire it.  A bright banana yellow object caught my eye&hellip;it was far off in the distance (low on the horizon)but increased by double in size in just about 15 seconds&hellip;it still was very far off and at first looked like it might be an airplane (except for the unusual color).  After 15 seconds it looked more like a Coast Guard Helicopter with a search light on and it was much closer (I am estimating 3-4 miles away).I took my headphones off to listen but heard nothing.  The yellow light continued parallel to the beach and I looked very carefully to see the green and white flashing lights of an airplane to appear &ndash; which they did not.  When I first saw the light it was low on the horizon and seemed to have a contrail.  I thought maybe it was a space shuttle launch or a missile.  But then it kept getting closer and larger and was not climbing higher.  It did not seem to leave any further contrails after I saw it&mdash;it was like it might have been after a vertical climb.I am sorry but I am completely unable to surmise its size.  I had nothing to compare it to out over the water&hellip;but at its largest it would have been about 10% of a full moon (low on the horizon rising) at its closest to me -- I am estimating that to be a quarter mile to as far as a half a mile away.  I know that is no help.  I held my arm out and my thumb completely covered it and would have even if it had been four times larger.  The light continued towards me and parallel to the beach but and one point it turned directly to me and glowed very brightly, again in that banana yellow.  It grew larger and seemed to be moving very fast &ndash; about the size of a softball, held at my arms length &ndash; now dwarfing my thumb.  The light became so bright that it illuminated the water like a ray of sunshine&hellip;but again in that bright yellow&mdash;very similar to a ray of sunshine &ndash; not diffused at all.  At that point I felt that it must be a helicopter but none the less I felt a little scared.The light shifted slowly away from heading towards the beach (and me) to directly out to the ocean.  As it turned it looked half yellow and half orange with a fire-like flickering.  Finally it turned all orange and sped off impossibly fast due east and then grew very orange and doubled in size and then completely disappeared after a thunder-like orange flash&hellip;and the atmosphere looking all wavy like a heat distortion around where the light was.  I continued to watch for five minutes.  I looked all around the beach and saw no one else nearby.

We were driving up and down the lanes, suddenly facing the hilltop dorms. Hovering very closely over the buildings was a strange craft. We stared at it, and it began to move VERY slowly, without any sound.

She thought it was some kind of satellite, and when I looked at the sky I didn&apos;t see anything at once, but after some pointing, I (we) saw the following: (note: she saw it approximately four seconds before me. I saw the object(s) for about ten seconds, so the duration seen by the other witness is about 14 seconds).A v-formation with about 7 lights.  The lights had the same glow as a faded star, like the stars distant at the star sky.

The other six lights (three under each &quot;wing&quot; was spinning sort of around, then shrinking to one light and then expanding again.)

I&apos;m not a trained observer, but from experience, I know that this was something out of the ordinary.  Given the six lights and their abnormal behavior.The object moved south east, not in straight ahead, but like a weak half circle.  The object disappeared behind a hill (about 300 meters tall).  I would say the object was at the same standard height as an airliner about to land, and flying over the ocean.  According to my reference point, I would say it was flying approximately 2-3 kilometers from us.Note!  This was NOT an airliner.  Passenger planes fly over Oslo regularly, and they make a lot of sound!  This was completely silent, and way too slow to be a f. ex 747 which not fly in that direction anyway.

I am very interested in the phenomenon, and when my friend (which knows this) pointed and said &quot;look at that,&quot; I thought she was fooling me.  She was not. I also know of similar stories about something similar over &quot;Holmlia,&quot; which is a place east of Oslo.  (I actually heard this today after calling a friend who is very well read about the phenomena.Note: No sound what so ever!

Clear skies and very light out.  I&rsquo;m skeptical of other peoples reports as well as when I saw today.  At first I thought it was a blimp, because it appeared white and very slow moving, but I&rsquo;ve seen many blimps and this was much to thin and much longer than a blimp.  If I had to make a guess, I&rsquo;d say it was nearly 10,000 feet high from the ground.  It was long and cylindrical in shape.  My next guess is that it was a low flying plane at an angle where I couldn&rsquo;t make out the wings, and I&rsquo;m still open to that possibility.  However, if it were an airliner flying that low, then it would have been moving much faster, compared to this object to be moving at the rate of a blimp.  I was driving on the highway during rush hour so I couldn&rsquo;t stop and get a better look.  But it was clear as day.  Another reason it didn&rsquo;t seem like an airliner was that I couldn&rsquo;t make out any wings or a tail wing.    Even as the road twisted giving me a different angle of view, still no wings.  I had sight of it for over a minute at least.  Then the thing seemed to change direction pointing away from me.  I still had clear sight of it, while trying to avoid and accident, it seemed to move a little further in the distance then just vanished.  There were no clouds in the sky and visibility was great, so I don&rsquo;t know how this thing vanished like it did.  I&rsquo;m 31, and I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of blimps, airliners, jets, etc...  Whatever this was, well I just couldn&rsquo;t explain it or make sense of it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Earlier in the evening on this date, a large dark rain &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; had moved in from the west, moving northeast and was positioned in the Northern sky.  Within this rain &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;, which looked to be several thousand feet in the sky, and maybe several thousand feet in area, my coworker and I saw what appeared to be three white lights which appeared to be just skimming the underside of the cloud formation turning in a clockwise direction.  What I mean by skimming is how I think a light source would be observed just inside the bottom of a cloud formation without exposing itself to anyone from the ground.  They were more like seeing a light source in a fog or haze if you can imagen a view like this.  They were white and dim in places and brighter in other places as they were traveling closer and further away from our angle of view. The three lights were in a triangular pattern circling and synchronized with each other, meeting in the middle of the triangle formation moving in a clockwise direction.  Imagen three circles in a triangular pattern with rings touching each other and you can get an idea of these lights.  My coworker and myself watched these three lights for about twenty minutes before we decided to get back to work to finish up the night shift, which ended at eleven thirty. During this time while we were both looking at this event we were also scanning the horizon trying to find any kind of light source such as spot lights or other lights coming from the ground in this area which could have been projecting these lights from the ground. We were unable to observe any ground effect lights which could have been causing these lights. Of course this cloud could have been smaller or larger than described.  There was nothing really to reference this cloud&rsquo;s actual size that we could see in this area to give us a true indication of its size, but from past experience observing storm clouds and rain clouds like this it appeared to be very large in area as well as height.", "12:11am small greenish streak moving very fast through the sky over Lower Manhattan, traveling westAt approximately 12:11am on 3/31/09 I was standing on the north side of Houston Street between Avenue A and 1st Avenue in the Lower East Side of New York City and was looking southwest up in the sky at several recently built condo towers. I suddenly saw a small greenish streak moving very fast through the sky, traveling west.  I saw it for maybe 1 second and before it disappeared.  I initially thought it could have been a shooting star/meteoroid but then thought that it would have been surprising to see a meteoroid so clearly within the confines of a major city and all the lights.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

It was overcast.  I was heading in a western direction on  US 1 (south).  I was  turning in a shopping center to go to Walmart when I noticed some red/orange lights.  At 1st I thought it was a plane until I noticed a similar set of lights underneath at an angle.  They appeared to hover and then go back and forth.  This was strange and no typical of a plane.  I took my new G1 phone and tried to take a picturng fore.  It was dificult since not best camera. After taking several pictures, I spent some time looking  for the phone case.  When I realized it was getting late, I decided not to go to the store,but get something to eat.But the place I wanted to go on the other side of the shopping center was closed so it mus thave been after 9 by then. I got back into my car and headed in other direction on route 1 to go to a fast food  place.  I went to drive in window got my stuff and started heading back in western direction on US 1 south to 95 s toward my development.  It was now at least 20-25 minutes since I first saw the lights.  When I pulled in my devlopement Hopewell, NJ, the lights appeared closer. (Apparently, the sighting in the shopping center was at greater distance and the object(s) were actually closer to my home.) When I pulled in my driveway, I again took pictures.  When I looked at them I coulnt see any thing on the shopping center photos due to the distance.  But 2 taken from my front yard show a bomber range or v-shaped object.  Based on the brightness of the lights at opposite ends, it appears the object was larger than a typical plane.  There was no noise.", "Unusual amber orb in the nightime skyIt was around three in the morning when this strange event occurred. I was at the computer, up much later than I normally would be. The way the room is set up has the computer on a desk facing the window. Since the computer room is on the 2nd floor, it provides a decent view of the sky outside.Anyway, while playing an online game I was suddenly distracted by an extrememly bright, amber light outside the window. I looked up and in the sky was an orb, growing in size and brightness. It became so bright so fast I had to squint and shield my eyes. Once it seemed to reach its peak of brightness it suddenly dissapeared. It was floating right above the treeline, probably a good bit away. It was hard to make out a distance of how far it was away because it was so bright. Right afterwards I ran downstairs and outside to try and get a better view, but the sky was empty except for stars. Looking south I saw a normal airplane, but that was all.I dont know if this was an actual &quot;craft&quot; or not. It did not move, it was just grew in size and brightness. It was an interesting shade of amber, but what I found strange was the light it emitted did not light up the earth below.

From where we stopped we had a very clear view over the city center to the south west, and just over to the west was this stationary bright white object hovering around I would say 1000 feet or less. It was what looked to be pulsating in size and changing colour from brilliant white to red over in cycles. My partner being very skepticle about these kinds of things, struck me as unusual as she was very excited at what we were observing. Both myself and my father have a very keen interest in the UFO abduction phenomenon and so at this point I phoned my father to tell him about what I was observing. Only to have the phone answered by a very excited tone saying how he had too seen the objects and was observing &quot;them&quot; with my mother and brother in the sky to the west. At this point being very confused about them seeing more than one object, a red object of slightly smaller size appeared in the sky at a much lower altitude to the first, but pulsating hovering around i would say 500 feet. I am training to be a pilot and so I feel I have an accurate knowlege on jusging this height. At this point around 21:10 an airliner approaching from the south decending into Leeds Bradford Airport (at which may I point out was a Jet2 boeing 737 LS348 from Dusseldorf, and must have also viewed these objects) passed between them on its decent into Leeds. This was a very spectacular sight, as just as the airliner passed the lower red object, it ascended virtically at a very high rate of speed before winking out and disapearing. At which point the larger higher bright white and red object that had remained fairly stationary, although seemed to change in size and shape in cycles, now from what I could see began to move to the west, con! stantly pulsating red and white light, until it too winked out and disappeared into the distance at a very fast rate to the west. At which point I made the journey back home to talk to my family about what I had seen, who also had exact same accounts to what I had just witnessed. Now these objects were fairly stationary in the sky for at least around 10 minutes before making movement and departing sight. In that time not only did the previous airliner above pass through the airspace but another Jet2.com from paris CDG also on approach into Leeds. Both of these must have also seen the objects, as must have Leeds air traffic control. Thank you.", "Falshing lightIn the winter of 1979,  I was in  A.I.T. at Ft. Jackson S.C.  A-12-4.I and another soldier were on guard duty at an ammo dump. I was walking ten paces ahead of him (according the rules of patrolling) on the left side of the raised dump mound, as we both became aware of a light flashing in the sky.  It was lighting up the whole area, and seemed to be happening in regular intervals, about 15 seconds apart.  After a few flashes, although I couldn&apos;t tell of its origin, I could somehow sense the direction from which it came.  I sped up my pace to get to the far end of the mound, so I could better see where it was coming from.  When I got to the end of the  mound, I looked up at the sky in that direction.  It was a beautiful clear night, you could see forever, but one star seemed to stand out.  It seemed to have a bit of a green tint to it, otherwise it looked like all the other stars.  Then it flashed. I can only describe it as looking like a giant flash cube.  It lit up the whole area. Then it turned red and streaked across the sky, within a second it was out of sight.I freaked out, not being able to believe what I had just witnesed.  The soldier who was behind me didn&apos;t see it take off but he saw my reaction to it.  By that time &quot;to hell with the rules&quot; we were walking side by side like a couple of scared little kids, as I was telling him what I saw in every detail, when the area lit up again.  We stood there breathless, crouched down watching this thing do just as it had done before.  It lit up the entire area about 5 or 6 times in about 15 second intervals, turned red and streaked back across the sky, gone in a second.Another soldier who was in the guard shack saw the flashing but didn&apos;t see where it came from.We did report the incident, but it wasn&apos;t taken seriously, we were laughed at.The 1st duty station I was assigned to after training happened to be on a missile range.

I watched it to see what was so bright. The silver object appeared to be &quot;floating&quot; in one area with no movement from side to side or up or down.

Further to the west was another one, sitting still.  The three got real close to each other and then quickly moved off into opposite directions.  Off to the right was another light that was flashing and moving very erratic and fast. This one appeared to have a smoke tail.  Not knowing the distance, but having seen the shuttle in the sky a few weeks ago, the speed of this was more than a plane.

Craft not recognizable.At approx. 18:45 hours (1.5 hours after sunset) on January 18, 2009, I observed a &quot;fuzzy, bright&quot; object in the northwestern evening sky. It caught my attention because it was stationary, but wasn&apos;t of a shape I recognized. It was not a helicopter or other familiar aircraft. The object was fixed in the west-northwest sky, at approx. 60-65 degrees above the horizon. The weather was clear, warm, and no other flying objects, aircraft, or stellar phenomena were visible in that part of the sky.I used binoculars (10x50) to get a closer look, and was startled to see a grayish-gold oval with small red &amp; green lights, one on each side of the object, plus a white &quot;headlight&quot; - small relative to the object&apos;s size. It seemed to be oval, but it also had an oval &quot;ring&quot; or projection at the bottom. The &quot;skin&quot; seemed to have large (relative to the overall size) markings or texture. I figured the sunlight from over the horizon must be reflecting off this thing, so its elevation above ground must have been quite high to catch sunlight this late. I could not venture a guess as to the object&apos;s actual dimensions, due to the lack of background reference points.I thought it was an aircraft - this due to the fact that aircraft typically display a red light on the left wing, and a green one on the right.I retrieved my digital camera, zoomed into the area where the object was located, and took three photos in succession. I had to guess at the location, because the object was too small to be seen in the viewfinder. When I tried looking at the display, I thought I had taken photos of black sky, as I could not make out anything. It wasn&apos;t until I downloaded some other photos from the camera this weekend that I saw the two good images from that evening on my computer screen.As I checked the pictures I had taken in the camera&apos;s viewfinder, I noticed the object start to move. It moved from its initial location to out of sight (into the western horizon) in less than five seconds.

I called my friend who lives about a mile or so away, and she went outside and could see it as well.   It did not have blinking lights or white &quot;headlight&quot; type lights and thus did not resemble a plane (in fact, there was a plane near it in the sky for comparison, but it was impossible to tell how far away the plane or the object were from myself and/or from each other).

Spherical in shape and orange in colour. Exact location provided including latitude/longitude.I was driving to work and had just joined the Motorway (highway). I noticed 2 objects in the sky to my right which were clearly NOT a natural phenomenon.  They looked so strange that I pulled over straight away to have a better look.The objects were spherical in shape and glowing a deep orange colour.  They were both in close proximity to each other but one looked to be higher than the other one as though they were flying in formation.  They weren&apos;t too high up - defiantly a lot lower than aeroplanes fly.  They looked to be travelling at helicopter speed, not as fast as planes usually fly.The objects passed over the top of my position.  As they came into view on my left side, they instantly sped up and quickly went out of sight.I had tried to get my mobile phone out to record the objects but by the time I thought about doing it the objects had sped up so I wouldn&apos;t have caught them in time.Due to the time it was a dark sky but quite clear.  There weren&apos;t many clouds in the sky though the objects would still have been visible in thick cloud as they were well below cloud level.If you look on Google Earth, the exact location I was parked watching this was: M60 motorway, Manchester 53&deg;32&apos;25.23&quot;N 2&deg;12&apos;57.70&quot;W The objects were travelling from the direction of &quot;Middleton&quot; - a nearby town.They were travelling in a South Westerly direction towards &quot;Prestwitch.&quot; I was travelling northwards hence the object passing from my right to my left.I am open to science and had always been willing to accept there may be UFO&apos;s visiting us but had never believed most of the reports you read about.

At first I thought it was a flare or a very big shooting star.  However, during the time I watched, it moved across the lake at even speed, slower than what normal planes look like, which I have viewed many times.There was some clouds, light whispy, but the circlular red light could be viewed even when clouds were in the way.  About 20 seconds of watching brought the light about 70 degrees above me where it stopped.  Up to this point, I was expecting to hear a sound, plane or helicopter and to see running lights when it got closer, but neither happened.It stopped for about 10 seconds maybe more when I heard some people on the street and tried to alert them to what I was seeing.  However, and this sounds made up I know, the light then moved slowly to my left and got behind thicker clouds.  The reddish light could still be seen from time to time over the next 10 seconds or so as I tried to guide them in to what i saw but by then, even if they did see it, it would not have made much sense to them as you could not really define it or see the movement.Its hard to say if it was getting higher, but through the clouds when I did see it, the size appeared to have diminished.The only logical thing I can think of is that it was some sort of flare on a parachutte. However, if it was that then it was above clouds, so at least 1000 feet in the air, it moved in a straight line for 20 to 30 seconds I watched it, stopped dead in its tracks for 10 seconds at least and then moved to my left.

It was about 5:00 am and still pitch dark with a clear sky.  A very brilliant white light just above my tree line caught my eye from a small second storey window looking north.  It is hard to judge size, but I&apos;d guess it spanned two or three tree tops from my vantage point, which would make it very large projecting outward.I have to stress that I did not have my glasses on, so I could not dicern shape, but that made the experience no less strange.  The light moved slowly from east (Eastsound, Orcas Island) to west along the tree line.  There was a slow pulsing light seemingly attached under the primary light of smaller size, but also bright white.  The light was bright enough to send rays through the trees, as you will sometimes see when the morning sun shines through on a misty morning.I cranked open a window to try to hear what this was.  It was virtually silent except for an almost imperceptible reverbant humm.  Velocity was constant, I&apos;d guess it passed out of view well inside of thirty seconds.  This is the first time I have experienced anything like this.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I heard a kind of warp sound but didn&apos;t think anything of it.   All of a suddenly, one of my friends said, &apos;Oh my (explitive) god! Look at that!&apos;  I looked up in the sky and I saw a spherish light floating there with an orangish-red aura coming from it. We watched it for about 10 seconds when it zig-zagged around about three times and then shot off about northbound.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was driving north on Route 252.  I was coming down the hill right before the damn at the Springton reservoir. Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I see a flash of light coming from my right.  The flash was turning on and off. The object was moving very fast. It almost seemed like it was skipping through the sky because its light was flashing on and off. It seemed like a white light with maybe a hint of blue to it. It zipped from way far off to my right across to my left. I was driving and trying to keep an eye on it as I was searching for it through the trees. As I was close to losing sight of it because I was not stopping my vehicle, I saw the craft hovering near the top of a nearby tower (possibly a cell phone tower) with its lights still flashing.It was the craziest thing I have ever seen.

Approx. 8:30 pm EST in McMurray, PA 15317.  Overcast.Drove out of driveway and noticed 4 lights in the sky that were revolving in a large circle.  Initially thought someone was having a party with strobe lights, but the temp was only about 50 degrees F.  and there was no party outside.   The four lights were revolving in a circular pattern parallel to the ground, but not obviously attached to one another.  Sometimes two would join and revolve together while the other two continued the revolutions.  They were rarely perfectly symmetrical from one another revolving in a circle like shape.   Each orb was approximately 4&rsquo; in diameter.As I continued to drive slowly down our road the lights remained and moved ahead of me on the left side of the road over the houses and were approx. 5-6 stories high.  Before I got to the main road I wanted to find out what would happen if I stopped.  I turned off the car and radio and lights after opening the window to determine if I could hear anything.  The four lights/orbs remained in place circling above the houses near the end of my street &ndash; where I had stopped.  A few cars entered our subdivision and left it during the approx. 15 minutes I sat watching the lights, but the lights never varied or went away.I had to go to CVS to get medication for my husband and decided that I couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer.  Started the car, went to the stop light and crossed to go south on Rt. 19.  The lights crossed ahead of me and were now on the right side of the road.  Due to lots of streetlights and business lights on Rt. 19 I was unable to see where the lights were and thought they might have disappeared.  When I arrived at CVS about  1 mile from home, the four orbs now were circling over the rear of CVS.I went inside, made my purchase and returned to my car &ndash; the orbs were still there circling.  I was tempted to call someone from CVS out to see the lights, but wanted to keep it to myself because it was so fascinating.  I returned home and could not see the lights on the return drive until I got to our subdivision again.  Again the lights were on the right side of the street (where they originally were when I went out).  When I pulled in my driveway I called my husband outside.  All I did was point to the sky and ask him what he saw.  He saw lights spinning and there were four.By now it was about 8:55 pm/20:55 and I wanted to find out if I could get any closer to the lights so walked toward my neighbors&rsquo; houses where the lights were.  They revolved in a clockwise messy circle (not attached to anything and not particularly round) and retained a constant speed.  I could not determine the exact color, but they weren&rsquo;t bright enough to be white so I thought perhaps bright blue or green.  As I watched them and the clouds started to clear, I noticed that as a light/orb passed through clear sky, it virtually disappeared and reappeared once behind cloud cover.  There was no light on the ground (no flashlight effect) from them.  The color may have been blue since disappeared when passing through dark blue evening sky.As I moved forward down our street toward the lights, they moved forward as well and appeared to keep a distance of two house lots between me and them.  The clouds were breaking up and the lights disappeared more frequently with clear sky.  I went inside at about 9:05 to check on my husband and when I came back out at 9:15, the sky was clear and there was no sign of the lights.  Unfortunately I never thought to get my camera.((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD))", "This is a follow-up from last nights report.

I was standing on my back deck looking up at &gt; the stars (which I usually do whenever I go out to smoke after dark) &gt; and noticed what I first thought was a satellite. I see them on &gt; occasion as I&apos;m looking up at the sky. As I&apos;m watching it, it went &gt; from the dim glow of what satellites look like to a very bright point &gt; of light that kept moving, at which point I started thinking maybe &gt; it&apos;s space junk re-entering the atmosphere... even though it was &gt; moving slower than any shooting star I&apos;ve ever seen. It then dimmed &gt; again to what a satellite looks like, but I noticed at this point that &gt; it wasn&apos;t moving in exactly a straight line like a satellite would...&gt; I don&apos;t know how to explain the movement, generally forward, other &gt; than to say it almost looked like it was vibrating very tightly within &gt; a somewhat forward motion. It then turned into a very bright point of &gt; light again (still moving), dimmed, became bright again and did a 90 &gt; degree turn before dimming and moving behind some clouds. At this &gt; point I started backing toward the sliding door to the living room to &gt; call my 5 almost 6yr old son to come see it... I figured it was a once &gt; in a lifetime opportunity, and I wanted to have someone to back up my &gt; sighting... even if he is only about 6 years old. By the time I got &gt; him out, which was maybe 5-6 seconds after I lost sight of it&apos;s last &gt; position, a huge cloud had formed right over the area. I kept looking &gt; at the edges of the cloud at the parts of the sky I could see, but it &gt; never came out of the cloud bank, that I know of. It was originally &gt; moving from S to N and drifting slightly Eastward, when it made the &gt; right angle turn it was moving E.&gt; I know it wasn&apos;t a plane as it didn&apos;t have any of the other lights a &gt; plane would have, and the brightening/dimming wasn&apos;t regular time &gt; wise. The brightness is something hard to describe... when it got &gt; bright it kind of looked like a star but without some of the colors &gt; you might get from the light interacting with the atmosphere. The best &gt; way I can describe it was that it looked like a fluid like point of &gt; light. It definitely looked like it was outside the atmosphere around &gt; the level of where satellites travel, which is why I at first thought &gt; that&apos;s what it was. I also noticed that it seemed to increase in size &gt; very slightly whenever the brightness increased.&gt; &gt; I have NEVER seenanything like this before, and since I spend a fair &gt; amount of time looking at the sky whenever I&apos;m outside at night I know &gt; what planes, shooting stars, satellites, helicopters, blimps, para &gt; sailors, planets,etc. look like, because I&apos;ve seen them all in the &gt; night sky before. I also know it wasn&apos;t a high flying jet, or the &gt; international space station because those things don&apos;t make right &gt; angle turns.&gt; &gt; I&apos;m really still kind of in shock from what I saw...", "A line of lights over Scunthorpe traveling north to south west.looking into the night sky to the north a procession of lights were seen cicular to ovel in shape.

I noticed a bright light moving fairly quick, flying much higher than an airplane. I told my husband to take a look at it and he mentioned that it was probably a satellite, although it was much too low and moving much too fast to be a satellite. We watched it move east, and my husband then decided it was a high flying airplane, but then we noticed it move in front of a low altitude cloud. Meanwhile a descending airplane flew south above us and when the strange light intersected the path of the airplane it stopped and then quickly shot off to the west.When we came back out an hour later, the temperature had dropped significantly and I had become nauseous and my husband began to shake. We noticed that there was a lot of movement up above, lights flying past quickly, as well as several much brighter shifting lights in triangular formations. There were multiple sets of these formations. These were not stars because the lights that seemed to be hovering were not covered by passing clouds. My husband describes witnessing several lights emitting other, lesser lights. They did this in such a way that it seemed they were arching out of the bright light in symmetry. This seemed to be happening around, inside, and above faint clouds.We both thought these clouds were strange. The clouds seemed teaming with activity. Some lights just hovered in one spot, some would rock back and forth, other would rise softly and drop dramatically, sweeping away into the horizon, much like the very first light we saw.All these lights moved gracefully and moved at incredibly fast rates. We also noticed that some of these lights seemed to shake softly, in the way a pen would move across paper while writing. We kept watching this, and the activity never seemed to let up. We became colder and more nauseated and had to go back inside. Once inside, we felt drained of our energy and fell asleep quickly in all our clothes, and slept uninterrupted for the next 10 hours.", "large clear ball shaped orb  in Glendale..  day time sightingIn my back yard facing West at 11 am..

I stopped and adjusted my backpack and looked again at it and it seemed like 2 or 3 led lights that were together (but orangish colored) close together and I couldn&apos;t tell what it was-looked like it was staying in one place which was weird.So I started moving toward it and walked down the trail after it.  It stayed there slightly off the trail.

Similar to a column (about 20-25 ft tall and about 1 1/2ft wide) Within the column were vertical 2-3&quot; beams that were amber and yellow in color.  The whole column slowly rotated from the left to the right, in place and smaller beams the same (2-3&quot;) would move from the center of it like it was scanning the grass bellow it from the column out around it about 3-4 feet out -from the center about ten feet up.  It hovered above the ground by a few inches, it slowly moved within a small area along the field less than six to ten feet that I saw it move.  I don&apos;t recall it making any sounds.

These were large commercial jets, likely 737s or larger, and from my vantage point were separated by no more than one mile.While we live smack-dab in the middle of a very busy air-traffic corridor, we never see commercial planes traveling this due-north trajectory (instead, most commercial jets pass over us at a lower altitude, heading west on final approach to MacArthur or Kennedy airports). And these planes were VERY close together -- as I said, no more than a mile between the first and fourth in the line, and probably less than that.In fact, the third and fourth planes almost seemed to be jockeying for position, racing extremely close to each other before falling into line. Worthy of note: All four appeared to have their anti-collision lights on full and were very bright.I suppose my eyes could have deceived me; this could have been a military formation heading north toward Connecticut, or perhaps the planes were not as close together as they appeared. But I&apos;ve lived near major airports my entire life, and I believe I can identify commercial airliners; I also believe they were traveling at the same approximate altitude, and most certainly the same speed.My 6-year-old son also witnessed the jet formation.I noticed a triangular UFO was reported last month in Riverhead, which is our town here on Long Island (Wading River is our hamlet). I doubt that report was related to this event, and these planes did not appear otherworldly in any sense. But it was very, very strange to see commercial jets flying like this, and I thought it was worthy of mention.", "03-15-09 ROUND VENSUS SIZE OBJECT MOVING SOUTH TO NORTH JOGING EAST TO WESTat aproximately 19:48 I SAW AN OBJECT THE SIZE OF JUPITER( THAT WAS WAS VISABLE IN THE WESTERN SKY) COME OUT OF THE SOUTHERN SKY AND PROCEED NORTH AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED, AND MAKE TWO OR THREE QUICK JOGS TO THE EAST AND THEN WEST AND THEN CONTINUE NORTH, DISAPEARING EITHER BEHIND A CLOUD OR GOING DEEPER INTO SPACE", "An incandescent white circular object passed over Pasadena, CA and ejected a smaller version of itself.This UFO (meaning Unidentified Flying Object) sighting occurred in the four-year interval starting mid-year 1952 to mid-year 1956. I was 16 to 20  years old at the time.  I am now 73.  The observation occurred in Pasadena, CA.My mother was working  in her garden behind our house in mid-afternoon on a beautiful sunny day.  There were no clouds, the sky was blue, and there were no winds.  She called me to come out of the house because there was something in the sky she wanted me to see.  Her voice was urgent.According to my mother (now deceased), the Unidentified Flying Object was heading South, made a 90 degree left-hand turn and then was headed East.  When I came out, it was headed East.The object was incandescent white, like a light bulb, and had a perfectly circular cross-section.  There was no exhaust of any kind or any vapor trail. It was completely silent.The object was flying very close to a jet aircraft.  After 50+ years, I&rsquo;m not completely  sure of the following, but I believe that the object was trailing the jet aircraft and to its right.  I could see very clearly the swept wings of the jet aircraft, one jet engine under each wing, the two horizontal tail stabilizers, and the fuselage. When jets fly at 35000 feet, you can hardly see them. This one was much closer, possibly 10000 to 15000 feet. If you placed the circular object on top of the jet, I believe it would be just large enough to cover up the jet. Since the direction and distance from the jet to  the UFO did not change, I believe both were at the same altitude.As the UFO was traveling  toward the eastward horizon, it ejected a smaller version of itself (maybe one-quarter of the diameter, incandescent white, circular cross section) to the South. It moved South through a 30 to 45 degree arc in about 3 seconds. It stopped at this point and just faded away. Possibly because it was moving radially away from me. The jet aircraft and the main UFO continued until they disappeared over the eastern horizon.I have never seen anything like this UFO. It was either from this Earth or it was not. I wish I knew.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The last issues of the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda published a series of five articles under the loud headline &quot;KGB Unveils UFO Secrets&quot;. These publications were based on materials from the so-called &quot;blue file&quot; that the KGB once compiled concerning the activity of Russian ufologists. However, the newspaper unveiled no secrets at all, the publications mentioned just several instances when UFOs were registered over Soviet military objects. What do these KGB documents testify to?  Do extraterrestrials actually exist?   Or, is it possible that the truth is more prosaic?   A researcher from the Russian city of Krasnoyarsk Pavel Poluyan tells the story.Liquidation of UFO   I saw a UFO for the first time on April 26, 1989:  there was a large luminous ball flying over the Kama River.  In fact, it was a thin air stratum around the ball that was glowing while some part of the ionized gas was blown away by an onrushing flow, and a short flickering track remained behind the apparatus.  The case was later refered to as a &quot;UFO over Perm&quot; and was described in the press many times as lots of witnesses saw the phenomenon.It took me several years to outline a practical scheme for explaining the phenomenon that I saw.  As it turned out, everything could be explained without any fantastic hypotheses, just simple rare aerodynamic effects.  The effects are perfectly known more or less now; at least nobody recalls antigravitation when they see the flight of a disk-shaped mini-plane designed by the Saratov EKIP concern.  How does it fly without wings and propellers?  When my article on the principles of UFO flights was published in Komsomolskaya Pravda on November 1, 1995, the editorial staff illustrated the text with the picture of the &quot;UFO&quot; produced in Saratov, the mini-plane I&apos;ve already mentioned.Later, Afontovo TV, in the Russian city of Krasnoyarsk, produced a video where the story that I narrated was supplied with material filmed in the laboratory of superlight aircrafts in the Siberian Aerospace Academy and in the laboratory for experimenting with strong magnetic fields in the Krasnoyarsk Physics Institute.  In 2001, I brought my materials to the editorial office of the popular Russian newspaper Top Secret, but instead of getting my material publicized, I was met by a strange man.  Some man found me in Krasnoyarsk and asked different questions in exchange for generous financing.  He wanted to know whether I knew what material the UFO bodies are made of, if it can land on water; what is more, the man wanted to find out with what scientists I cooperated when I wrote my materials.  After that I understood perfectly well that my surmises concerning secret aircraft designed in the USA (and later in the Soviet Union as well) corresponded to reality, and that I must expound my version in detail.  This is how my book &quot;Liquidation of UFO&quot; appeared; now it is available at many Internet websites.You may ask why the KGB left me alone and allowed me to publish my works.  The problem is that I already guessed and publicized the scheme of the first UFO, those that the USA tested at the end of the 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s. Modern models are more complicated, as I learned from those who were somehow connected with design and production of such aircrafts.The recent publications in Komsomolskaya Pravda has come in handy. My opinion is that it&apos;s high time for the KGB to &quot;unveil the UFO secret&quot; so that people could learn the truth from Russia, as it obviously cannot be obtained from American mystifiers.Some romantic readers may think that what I&apos;m going to say is just one of the many versions. However, what you are going to read right now is the truth. But first of all we must separate real &quot;flying objects&quot; from other unidentified phenomena, as such cases are observed as well.A group of ionospheric UFOs can be singled out from the unidentified phenomena: these are many-colored lights zigzagging the sky at an unbelievably high speed. These are not objects in fact, but ionospheric spots of reflected light that appear as a result of gas glowing in the spot where two radar rays with specific characteristics cross. Synchronized movement of the rays produces the spots of reflected light that cross the sky at any speed and along any trajectory. Such experiments on modification of the ionospheric environment draw the attention of the public.Another group of UFO phenomena is made up by those which psychologist Cal Jung has described. The fact is that a visual picture produced by the brain is exactly a picture. In other words, it is not transported from the retina into our consciousness, but appears as a result of processing of the information that the brain receives. Sometimes some alien images can intrude into this picture, just exactly the way when some uninvited banner comes up on your computer monitor when you surf the Internet. For example, when a child sees a dwarf going out of a wardrobe, he actually SEES the dwarf, as his brain cannot yet protect the visual picture from other signals.The same can be observed with adults: the brain&apos;s work is disturbed under the influence of high-frequency radiation, and strange objects invade the visual picture. It is no wonder that visions of this kind occur when people see &quot;flying objects&quot;. Unlike pilots who are in a shielded cockpit, accidental witnesses are not protected from microwave radiation that is emitted from these aircrafts.And now let&apos;s speak about real &quot;UFOs&quot;. I hope that readers will be able to compare the following kinds of apparatuses with those that are described in the &quot;blue file&quot;.  Counterintelligence agents collected only actual facts and knew perfectly well what kind of objects were flying over our military objects.We all remember the old newsreel in aviation history where some strange apparatus, something like a huge umbrella with an engine and a pilot, was demonstrated together with antiquated biplanes and gliders. The &quot;umbrella&quot; twitched up and down; when it went down, the apparatus took off and when the umbrella moved up, the aircraft went back to the ground. The umbrella plane was tested by inventor Chance Vought in America in 1911. This very flying device was the ancestor of &quot;flying saucers&quot;. The first flying saucers used the same scheme but on a higher technological level. The very form of the first flying saucers is flat from below, prominent and streamline on the top; which means that it was very important for these objects to be oriented  with its flat surface down and with a higher head resistance. This fact alone is enough to understand that such discs rest upon the air.As Zhukovsky, the founder of Russian aircraft construction, once said, there is someplce to rest on everywhere in the air. The umbrella plane from the old newsreel is certainly very funny, but do you think that practical Americans spent money on construction of the craft just for fun? Certainly not.The principle of flight based on formation of compression under a vibrating surface is not worse than that used in traditional planes, where the lift (the difference of pressures) arises at the expense of asymmetrical streamline of a wing&apos;s form in the oncoming air. In 1911, there were no technologies to use the principle of flight it&apos;s maximum.During WWII German aviation engineers employed this principle. But they managed to create only models of one meter long; however, those &quot;UFOs&quot; scared American and English pilots very much when glowing balls appeared right before their bombers.At the end of the 1940s, the first flying saucers resembling telephone dynamic speakers appeared: their huge membranes vibrated at a supersonic speed, and a streamline top part consisting of two spherical segments guaranteed the difference of the drag from above and below. A thin metal membrane was set to vibrate with a system of impulse electromagnets. (Later Russian engineers employed this technology in electropulse de-icers, on the wings of Il-86 planes for example. I can name the siberian impulse electromagnetic seismic sources too.)  What is the essence of the aerodynamic effect?  As long as a flying saucer doesn&apos;t push out anything like rockets do, there will be no lift. This something can be a ring whirl-vortex of air, as it doesn&apos;t draw the disc back. The disc must rest on the vortex just for a couple of microseconds because another vortex is formed within this period. Air rejection gives rise to reactive force, and the disc takes off, and a vortex that appears under the disc prevents the disc from dropping down until another vortex is formed. The time between these vortexes is insignificant. The vortexes draw in much air as they revolve, consequently, a saucer can give it a bigger impulse within the period when a vortex is being formed, and the disc then moves higher.However, the first flying saucers had many defects. First of all, the push surface couldn&apos;t resist and broke, causing catastrophies. It was this &quot;elastic foil&quot; that US Air Force Captain Jesse Marcell found on a farmer&apos;s field; this case gave rise to the sensation about the Roswell incident in July 1947. Secondly, the disc was unsteady and it fell sideways as it slipped off the vortexes. Thirdly, flying saucers with impulse electromagnets were heavy, with high power inputs and couldn&apos;t cover long distances (as one source told me, the American military had to deliver their flying saucers to the Soviet shores on submarines). Certainly, this kind of aircraft was improved, but another generation of apparatuses appeared by that time; their airframes were not shaken with electromagnetic fields. It was made of piezoceramics and vibration appeared as a result of the piezoelectric effect. Apparatuses of this generation were no longer in a disc shape, they were balls, ellipses and other volumetric figures surrounded with a halo of ionized gas.Finally, the third generation of flying discs consists of dark objects in which only small zones, vortex activators, are glowing. The light goes downwards when the disc takes off, to the side when it is to move sideways or the light shines in the form of a pointed bracket when manuevering. The zone of vortex activation appears in any part of the airframe covered with cells and contacts. Uneven cells are joined together (this is the base), and voltage is sent to the other cells through a regulating switchboard. The airframe is monolithic and doesn&apos;t vibrate, but the adjoining air is artificially ionized, and current impulses that slip by at a megahertz frequency make it expand. The principle of thermal sources of sound is known rather well, but it wasn&apos;t effectively used in other scientific fields.Now I would like to mention &quot;the mysterious material ray&quot; that flying saucers emit. Ufologists say that with the help of this ray extraterrestrials take people on board their aircraft. The situation is more simple in fact. Molecules are centrifuged and separated in the vortex whirl zone, moisture is frozen out of the air in the cooled area and as a result small crystals form. The light emitted by the activation zone is shining on the crystals. Thus, a UFO 50 meters high described in the article in Komsomolskaya Pravda of February 11 is not an object itself, but the area consisting of vortexes that is illuminated. The glowing zone stops where the lowest vortex loses energy as it expands and ceases to freeze moisture crystals out of the air.When the Soviet borders grew weaker as a result of perestroika, American spy UFOs flooded the sky over Russia. Unfortunately, they were not only collecting information. In December 1989, policemen in the Russian city of Krasnoyarsk saw that several dark flying discs were trying to experiment on electric mains going to the Krasnoyarsk aluminum plant. However, we should also feel for Americans as they have been fooled with extraterrestrial fairy tales all this time, and the misinformation was spread intentionally. I tried to demonstrate how it is done using  the examples from the book &quot;UFO FBI CONNECTION. The Secret History of the Government`s Cover-Up&quot; by Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D. however, when a part of my book was published in English, the author emailed to me to express his disagreement.So, the childish fantasy about extraterrestrial beings is currently being turned into a real spy novel. I would like to add that the disclosures I&apos;ve made were not inspired and financed by the FSB; they are the result of my private, years-long research. I used my personal finances to conduct the research.It is certainly very sad to give up the myth of extraterrestrials. But it&apos;s time to grow up and say good-bye to fairy tales. I am not saying so as a confirmed skeptic rationalist, simply as a grown up.Be sure, dear readers, there are more interesting things in the world than extraterrestrial beings. The immortality of the soul and its post mortem fate for example. And those who have been spreading lies in the information sphere and fooling humanity for 60 years already must remember this.", "we dont know if they where space crafts or not. htye where to high up. two of them would head strait for eachother then suddenly break off. they where to high up so we couldnt see the shape. they could have been stunt plains for all we know.it wasnt just me who saw them so i know they where there. like i said they where to high up so we dont know if they where space crafts or people in stunt plains.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

A bright light in the sky caught my eye, which at first looked like a regular star, but it was awfully bright and it would flash every 10-15 seconds. It was already starting to turn daylight at the time of this sighting, plus I can&apos;t recall seeing any clouds (it was mostly clear all night long with distant visibility) that might&apos;ve hindered this light. I shall add that there were trees outside, but quickly concluded that the trees were not causing the flashing, as I witnessed this light flashing without the branches blocking the view. To clarify location of sighting, it is located about 7 miles north of Johnstown and about a mile south of U.S. Route 22. There is also a small airport about 10 miles southeast, but I doubt it was a plane, the light was stationary too long.", "THREE ORANGE LIGHT SPOTS IN A STRAIGHT LINE,  MOVING EAST AT CONSTANT SPEED, THEY ALL DISAPPEARED AT A CERTAIN AREA ONE BY ONE.Today 15.03.09 at 19:30 PM I saw  THREE ORANGE LIGHT SPOTS IN A STRAIGHT LINE, MOVING EAST AT CONSTANT SPEED.

We watched for 30 seconds and then one second it was there the next it wasn&apos;t.", "Famouse historical case TAE&apos;s (former airline) Supercaravelle was the first aircraft involved in the incident. Flight JK-297 had taken off from Salzburg (Austria) with 109 passengers on board, and had made a refuelling stop in Majorca before setting course towards Las Palmas.Halfway through the flight, at about 23:00h, Pilot Francisco Javier Lerdo de Tejada and his crew noticed a set of red lights that were fast approaching the aircraft. These lights appeared to be on a collision course with the aircraft, alarming the crew. The captain requested information about the inexplicable lights, but neither the military radar of Torrej&oacute;n de Ardoz (Madrid) nor the flight control center in Barcelona could provide any explanation for this phenomenon.In order to avoid a possible collision, the captain changed altitude. However, the lights mirrored the new course and stayed about half a kilometer away from the plane. Since the object was violating all elementary safety rules and an evasive maneuver was deemed impossible by the crew, the captain decided on going off-course and made an emergency landing in Manises&apos; airport. This was the first time in history in which a commercial flight was forced to make an emergency landing because of a UFO.The flight crew reported the lights abandoning the pursuit just before the landing took place. However, three new UFO signals were detected by the radar, each one with an estimated diameter of 200 meters. The objects were seen by several witnesses. One of the UFOs passed very close to the airport runway, and emergency lights were lit by the land crew in case the object happened to be an unregistered flight experiencing difficulties.Given the lack of answer to all communication attempts, a Mirage F-1 took off from the nearby airbase of Los Llanos (Albacete) to identify the phenomenon. The pilot, Spanish Air Force captain Fernando C&aacute;mara, had to increase his speed to mach 1.4 just to be able to get visual contact with what he perceived to be a truncated cone shape displaying a changing bright color, but despite his initial efforts the object quickly disappeared from sight. The pilot was informed of a new radar echo, which indicated that another object might be near Sagunto (Valencia).When the pilot was close enough, the object accelerated and disappeared again. This time, though, the UFO seemed to respond and the fighter had its avionics scrambled -its electronic flight systems were jammed, a highly hostile action. At last, and after a third contact attempt, the UFO finally disappeared, heading for Africa. After an hour and a half of pursuit, and due to fuel shortage, the pilot was forced to return to the base with no results.[edit] Possible Explanations The public impact of the incident was such that on September 1980 it reached the Spanish Parliament. The High Chamber representative Enrique M&uacute;gica publicly asked for an official explanation, but a UFO sighting was dismissed and the incident was attributed to a series of freak optical illusions.The full official report, declassified by the Spanish Airforce on August 1994, states that the Supercaravelle JK-297 pilot Javier Lerdo de Tejada, the land crew in Manises&apos; airport and the Air Force Captain Fernando C&aacute;mara might had been misled by &quot;flashes emitted from a distant chemical industry complex&quot; (about 100 miles away from Manises) &quot;and some stars and planets&quot;. Although this possibility has been much argued and repeatedly rejected by all people involved it stands as the only non-UFO-related explanation.The on-flight difficulties experienced by the fighter were not mentioned in the public release. The electronic system failure on board the Mirage F-1 could nevertheless be explained by the fact that the U.S. Navy Sixth Fleet was stationed in the area, and was making use of a powerful electronic warfare equipment while awaiting the outcome of the Iran hostage crisis.Since in the late seventies all UFO phenomenons were promptly published by mass media and readily consumed by the public, it has been argued that the flight crew might have been influenced into believing that they were experiencing a UFO sighting instead of just witnessing an optical phenomenon, and had therefore been readier to consider, and finally undertake, such an extreme maneuver as an emergency landing.[edit] Bibliography Ben&iacute;tez, Juan Jos&eacute; (1980).

Possible hoax??  PD))", "A gelatinous lighted object in the midwestSeveral years ago, in late spring or early summer, I was sitting on my friend&apos;s deck with him and his young son (age 10).   We always liked to sit there and watch for satellites as they passed by and see how many we could find - making it a contest to see who could spot one first.As we peered upward - something caught our eyes, much lower, closer to the horizon.  We were sitting on the deck facing south when an object drifted across our field of view.It traveled from east to west, slowly, not changing speed, or direction of travel, remaining in a straight line. This was easy to determine as it moved in a direct line above the utility wires in the alley, in front of us. It was approximately  twenty degrees directly above the horizon. I could not say how far away or how large the object was. There was absolutely no sound coming from it.Normally, when one of us located a satellite - we would call out that one had been discovered one and point directly above us to show the others where it was.  Most of the satellites were moving in a south to north or north to south trajectory.  However, when we saw this object, nobody said a word.  All of us saw it at once, not like the satellites, when the others would sometimes have problems finding it.All three of us picked it up at the same time, which was strange because normally we were straining our necks to look straight up,  not directly in front of us.As the object crossed us from left to right, each of us turned our heads in unison as it passed.  Shocked, somebody said, &quot;Did you see that?&quot;,  &quot;Yeah, what was it?&quot;,  &quot;I have no idea.&quot;  Now, the hard part.  I have seen plenty of photos and video of strange objects in the sky before.  This was completely different from anything I had seen documented before.It did not have what could be considered an straight edge outline.  I know this sounds weird but,  the only thing I think of that would describe it - is either a giant Amoeba or Jellyfish.  It appeared gelatinous in form.  The object appeared transparent in color because it seemed like you could &quot;see through it&quot;.If that is not strange enough,  the object had what I can only describe as five very dim lights emitting inside of it.  These were not random lights.  Three of them were vertical, in a perfectly straight line, close together.   The other two were horizontal behind the vertical lights.  The best way I can describe it is - imagine a capital letter &quot;T&quot; laying on it&apos;s side, with the top or the &quot;cross&quot; of the &quot;T&quot; in the lead.    The lights did not move -  nor did they twinkle or change color.I have never observed anything like that before, neither have my friend and his son. Of us three, I am the only believer of &quot;other craft&quot; but, that night we all agree that we all saw something.Never knew who I could tell this to till I became a fan of George Noory and listened to Mr. Davenport on his show several times over the years since.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was tilted to my right as it flew above me and looked like an antenna for a cellular tower leading down to a spherical &quot;traditional&quot; saucer shape, only from the tip of the antenna(lights equipped), there were what appeared to be cables attatched at various points of the saucer, and then from(as though pierced by the antenna) the saucer to the tail end.

The other reason is that there was a dense fog and the objects were going what looked like into and out of the cloud cover.

I stared in disbelief, then I saw two more reddish golden disks flying (one slightly behind the other) much lower and extremely fast.  I started backpedaling and tapped on the window to the room where my fiance was and before she came out I saw five more heading northwest.  By the time she came outside they were gone, but I just said, look at the stars...then bam, 3 more just flew West right then.  We witnessed a few more flying west and then I called my parents (looking at my phone I believe it was 12:07 when I called my mom and I talked to her for 11 minutes about what I was seeing)  My phone wasn&apos;t working first, but just as it finally started ringing and she answers, (she lives in Kalamazoo Michigan) two more flew over heading due west completely silent and extremely fast.  I witnessed 3 more formations as I talked to her, but I started seeing so many, I lost count of how many were in which formation.  Every formation was heading west or northwest, except one lone formation of 3 that traveled southeast.  The whole time I was seeing them, I only saw one airplane with blinking lights and one helicopter which was extremely huge and loud (it was flying very low, so I could see it was like a Huey and had only red lights)...my fiance had went into the house to file a report and I stayed outside and kept seeing these things.  At about 12:30am she came out and we called a number to report what we had seen, and two flew over very low and fast heading northwest.  I talked to someone on the phone for 4 minutes, and the helicopter flew over during the call. then we tried to call the airport, but only got automated answers.  I also was shocked when I witnessed a small flash and shower of sparks in the sky to the north.  It looked as though something may have exploded. These things were a goldish somewhat red color and traveled in formations of 2, 3, or 5.  I lost count, but I saw at least 2 dozen.  They were silent, extremely swift, and mostly stayed in very tight rigid formations, that were shaped like triangles, or an upside down check mark.  Two or 3 of the formations were loose on one side, with the things weaving back and forth, while the other side of the formation stayed in a tight line.  The lights DID NOT blink ever.  The ones that were flying lower looked as though they had a ring of light golden light around them.  They moved easily 10X faster than the airplane I saw to the north (which had blinking lights that were greenish)  There wasn&apos;t a cloud in the sky, and I saw no moon.  If I had to guess, I&apos;d saw they were heading towards Muskegeon and Lake Michigan.  I have NEVER seen anything like what I saw tonight.  I have seen meteor showers, shooting stars, satellites, airplanes, helicopters, planets, and the MOON of course.  I can&apos;t say what to use for a background, but the formations with 5 all had objects the size of stars and were flying much higher I believe.  The lower flying formations which only had 2 or 3 objects were much larger than stars.  Probably 4x the size of a star.  These larger objects were moving incredibly fast.  Even the smaller objects moved easily 10 times faster than the airplane to the north. We do not have any camera to take pictures.  And these things were so fast and some of them were so high, I highly doubt anyone could capture them on film.  It would just be a blurry mess I think.  I hope someone has at least tried to capture them though.  It was unlike anything I&apos;ve ever witnessed in my life.  When I witnessed the shower of sparks, I did not see any objects around it and it was to the north.  It was around 12:30 when I saw it and my fiance just missed seeing it too as she was dialing a number for me and our house blocked her view. This is all I have to say.  I would suggest following up in Muskegeon and around Lake Michigan and the Gerald Ford airport here in Grand Rapids....  I hope someone else saw this besides us.

My route was on winding country roads, so as I constantly changed direction, the light stayed consistent.  I began to suspect this wasn&apos;t a jetliner.Oddly, as I drove I saw two jetliners on approach to RDU to the west of my location (about 30 miles away), and could see their flashing beacon lights.  The object I was observing did not have flashing beacon lights.  The object I had been observing seemed to be about the same altitude but farther west of the jetliners on approach, and the object shown much brighter than the jetliners.

England.UK  Saucer. 5mins    Moved from one side of wilndow view (house side) to opposite side. 04/30/09In 1958 living in hostel (nineteen year old males) sharing a bedroom with one other male. Early in  the summer morning (it seemed quite light outside but not really dawnlight). I was awoken by my room mate (the room was small and narrow, he slept at one end and I at the other, we were on the first floor up, the hostel being on the outskirts of a small village, our room had a large, long window which looked out above a small conservatory, flat roof, and over the large lawn, then into the middle distance of field and hill, then skyline. My room mate called me from sleep, saying, what&apos;s that out there, I eventually got up and went to the window (his view from his bed was to the left of where I stood, so I looked in that direction I did not see anything but I instinctively looked up to my right and there, above a leafy chestnut tree (it seemed just a few feet above, against the clear sky)was this saucer shape object (in the 1950s I, we, did not know anything about &apos;flying saucers&apos; or &apos;ufos&apos;, and indeed I had completely forgotten about the incident when wakenig up in the morning proper.)The size of the saucer was, or seemed, about four foot in diameter and about three foot in height. It was completely silent, I did not know what it was, it had, on the raised &apos;bulb&apos; shape on top, (or I&apos;m not sure now, whether it was lower down on the main body) a horizontal row of oval-like windows (frosted as I coud not see into them)I looked really hard into the windows and at that moment it just shot away, totally silent, no lights and in a blinking of an eyelid it had gone (oddly, I puzzled over at the time concerning the distance and speed which it became so small, to a pin prick of white light, then gone into the middle distance yet against the background of the hill, so it did not seem to go high and away in the sky but more of a trajectory curve - that&apos;s my adult word knowledge.)Years later I thought that my peering into the windows was an energy interference and so it made off. The saucer had a short s! tream of red behind it which seemed to be a connected to it, till the saucer had pinpricked into a tiny white light.I wondered why it, seemingly, had moved from left to right outside the window (only about eighty feet up in the air, and our window was say twenty feet up and I wondered and felt sad that if I had not of eagerly peered into its windows whther it would have stayed longer). Apart from another friend coming up to me the next day, saying that my room mate had seen this object in the sky, I had completely forgotten about it and then, I had never had it in mind until twenty five years later when my young son was all into ufos (1980s) that the memory suddenly shot into my mind, fresh again and since then it has been in and out of my thoughts.

We stepped outside to determine if other neighboring apartments had lost power along with my friends apartment when my friend noticed an unknown number of white/yellow lights traveling across the Franklin Mountain range above the western end of El Paso.  Pointing our attention to the western skies of El Paso, my fiance and he both witnessed the cluster of lights disappearing over the mountain traveling east.  I did not witness the lights due to a highway sign obstructing my exact view.  Not able to see the lights in the western skies I turned my attention directly to the skies above me and on an angle looking towards the east.  I then witnessed four dull blue/white balls of lights in a diamond shape pattern approximately two to three miles above me traveling east to west at an unknown high rate of speed.  The pattern of lights then slowed and came to a stop directly above me.  At that time I grabbed my fiance&apos;s arm and pointed directly to the lights above us. She witnessed the formation as well.  The four lights then seemingly holding its pattern turned directly straight to the ground the forward light now at the bottom of the diamond (creating the pattern of an upside down diamond), this all taking maybe two to three seconds.

Every once in a while, some clouds would roll in, but at the time of the sighting, the sky was clear.  We were facing the West and off to the SW I noticed an aircraft traveling West to East.  I pointed it out to my nephew.  From the lights and sound, I could easily tell it was a jet.  A few seconds later, right overhead (North of the jet), we see this bright, yellow light moving about the same speed as the jet, moving along with it, West to East, about the same speed as the jet.  It seemed like it might have had two very faint red lights on the rear, but no lights on any wings.  You could barely make out red lights because the yellow light was so bright.  We heard the jet briefly, but didn&apos;t notice any sound from the yellow light object.  Maybe it got drowned out from the jet noise.  I&apos;ve sat out on my deck lots of nights and see lots of aircraft flying overhead and am used to the light configurations on them, but I haven&apos;t seen anything really like this before.

The yellow light was a lot brighter than I&apos;m used to and no lights at all on the craft were flashing.  They just stayed on and were consistent in color and brightness the entire time.  Whatever it was I think it was flying around the same altitude as the jet, or maybe higher, because even though it was at night, I&apos;ve seen low flying planes and helicopters at night and can usually make out their outline.  I couldn&apos;t make out any outline on this.  Even low flying planes with their landing lights don&apos;t seem as bright as this thing was. At first I thought it might be ISS, but I&apos;ve seen it before and it seemed a bit too slow to be ISS, and brighter from what I remember, plus there were the two faint, red lights to the rear of it that didn&apos;t seem consistent with ISS.  I thought maybe this might be! some ki nd of new aircraft I&apos;m not used to seeing, maybe military since the jet was near.  If anyone can solve this mystery, I&apos;d greatly appreciate it.", "3 round lights in line horizontally hovering in place near a radio tower, disappear one by one.I was driving with my wife on our way back from a home we are renovating.

I was driving with my wife and daughter through this wooded area at night, and I noticed something resembling a helicopter hovering and bobbing just above the trees, at the very tips of them.  (These were not tall trees &ndash; about 30 feet tall.)  It had lights of different colors sparsely placed all over it, and it really did not look like anything otherworldly at all.  In fact, it appeared so mundane that I simply thought, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd that they would use helicopters to repair the telephone lines or whatever they&rsquo;re doing up there.&rdquo;  Then, realizing how unlikely that was, I stopped the car, and my wife, my daughter and I all saw the same thing: a craft that resembled a helicopter against the night sky.  We were close to this thing!  It was literally right over our heads.  And it made no wind and no sound!  It just bobbed up there.  We must have looked up at it for 15 seconds or so until it drifted farther away, over the forest, so that we couldn&rsquo;t follow it.

I have about a 20-30 minutes drive home. It was dark and cold, and the road I was driving on is near a park area. There have been many deer accidents on this road, so I always go cautiously especially after dark.  While scanning the empty fields on both sides of the road, I noticed a fireball in the sky to my left. It was very large. Behind the ball of fire, was a tail. I believed it to be a meteorite, but had never seen one so large. A shooting star, it wasn&apos;t. I slowed down to about 20-30 miles an hour. The road was dark, and no other travelers either way. I should have stopped the car, but knew there was no place to pull over. I watched the road and the fireball. The fields on the left had been harvested, so my view was clear. The fireball was going the same direction as I was, perpendicular to the road.  I watched it for about 3-5 minutes. The fireball went behind some distant trees, then it was gone. I believed it to crash. There were also 3 blinking &quot;strobe like white lights&quot; ahead of the fireball, which I assumed to be on towers of some kind in the distance. The fireball crashed before these lights.  I haven&apos;t been able to locate these strobe lights since. I looked for them, knowing they would be my reference point.  A few weeks later I saw on the news that Canada had a meteor crash to the ground. From the video that they showed,  it looked exactly like what I had seen...except mine was more red and orange. Also in the Canadian video, the ground and sky lit up on impact. My fireball did not make any light when it hit the ground.

We were on a road (Settlers Pass) heading eastbound when I saw an orange fireball in the southern sky.  At first I didn&apos;t know if what I saw was a street light or a helicopter with a spotlight in our direction or maybe a meteor.  As I slowed down the bicycle I briefly lost view of the fireball behind a house.  I wanted to make sure what I saw so as I kept rolling east I saw the object again and it was flying northbound towards our direction.  I was surprised that it did not have any blinking lights like all the other aircraft that I see fly over.  I told my wife about it, she had already finished her jog before me spotting the fireball and was walking to cool down.  She thought it was strange too.  It flew almost directly over us, just a little to our east as it kept going north.  It moved the same speed as any other aircraft that I have seen.  By the time that it was some 2 or so miles north of us, it must have sped up because the light got small really fast and eventually we could not see it anymore.  I wondered if anyone saw it.  I did not report it to the police because they probably can&apos;t do anything about it.  I don&apos;t know if this was an extraterrestial craft but if it was all I have is two eye witnesses.

I parked my car off the edge of the freeway as I felt I was directly in the path.  It slowly passed directly over my vehicle and myself. I estimate it was about 1000 ft.

I am not saying it was a UFO or anything, but I have never seen something like it and was wondering if you have heard about anything similar to it.To start out, I live in a small town(about 25 thousand people) in central Nebraska no where near any large busy airports and airplanes are not a normality to see.  During the day, the only planes we see around here are small privately owned planes or crop dusters.  Within my town, there is also a large hospital with medical helicopters that often fly through the sky, what I initially thought it to be.  However, they have a distinct chopper sound and can be easily heard.I was leaving my apartment walking out to my car.  When I got in and started it up, I noticed a strange large round light in the sky.  What confused me was the fact that it was sort of a reddish amber color in the sky AND it was flying very low and very slow.  I stopped and just stared at it.  It took forever for it to traverse the sky.  I got out of my car to get a clearer look of it, and also noticed that there was no sound.  Seeing this light completely perplexed me because it couldn&apos;t have been any aircraft normally seen around my town especially at that time.  I don&apos;t know of any aircraft that ONLY has a red light either.  Furthermore, I have never seen anything fly so slow or low to the ground.  The fact that the light was so large (I would estimate it to be 60-75 feet in diameter) was even more strange because it didn&apos;t match any aircraft known to me.  I stared at it for a good 5-10 minutes because I didn&apos;t want to miss anything else if it were to happen.  It finally got too far away for me to see.  As stated earlier, I am not saying that it is a UFO, but to me, I can not personally explain it.I am not sure what I saw that night and have never seen anything like it.  I would just like to know if this description matches any known aircraft or if what I saw truly was a UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

As I looked ahead, I saw what appeared to be a plane taking off.  It was flying at a height of about 250 feet, in an eastward direction at about a 30 degree angle.  It seemed strange, but I didn&apos;t pay much attention to it until I saw it make a dramatic climb in altitude.  It went from flying at a 30 degree angle to flying at about an 80 degree angle. It was practically flying vertically, and it was climbing altitude rapidly. After about 5 seconds of flying, it had probably risen to a height of about 600 feet. Then, it gradually began to level - off.  Once it was level, it slowly turned left and headed north towards me and my dog.  It banked, and its triangular shape became apparent.  It was probably flying at around 70 miles per hour.  As it approached and passed overhead, I was able to see its underside.  It was clearly a triangular aircraft. It was black or gray in color, and it had one small white light on each corner (which made 3 white lights altogether), and one small red light in the center. It continued to fly north, and I watched it until it disappeared behind the trees. Throughout the entire flight, it made a low whistling noise, similar to a quiet &quot;whoooosh&quot; sound. It sounded similar to the sound that an airplane makes as it moves through the air, but I didn&apos;t hear the humming of an engine.

My sleeping bag and pad were on the ground with my head at the SE and my feet pointed toward the NW.  Far off to my left, at a point near WNW, I saw a &ldquo;white light&rdquo; moving in a straight line across the sky (toward ENE.)  Because the &ldquo;white light&rdquo; was moving, I decided it must be an airplane. At first, because the &ldquo;white light&rdquo; was moving at what I call a slower than normal airplane speed, I thought it was a small, private plane -- yet there were no blinking red/green lights.  Due to the lack of blinking lights, I decided it was a much larger airplane and must be flying at approximately 30,000 feet or higher, and I probably would not see blinking lights from that distance. I presumed the &ldquo;plane&rdquo; had have taken off from Portland or Eugene, OR and was heading for Boise, ID, or Salt Lake City, UT &ndash; and might have been ahead of schedule.  Therefore, the pilot was flying at less than normal speed so as not to arrive too early at the terminal.  I continued to watch the light for approximately 35-45 minutes (or longer) as it continued to move in a straight line across the sky. When the &ldquo;white light&rdquo; reached the middle of the &ldquo;cup&rdquo; of the Big Dipper, it stopped moving; it just hung there!  Puzzled, I continued to watch it very carefully expecting to see some movement that would explain why I had thought the &ldquo;white light&rdquo; (airplane) was staying in one place.  Yet it did not appear to move.  Again, it just seemed to be hanging there. I continued to watch the light for at least another 20-25 minutes as the &ldquo;white light&rdquo; remained in the same place.  Then, suddenly I realized, whereas the &ldquo;white light&rdquo; was still in the same spot &ndash; it was getting smaller and smaller!  I watched the light for many more minutes &ndash; until it disappeared. In thinking carefully about what I had just observed, for that &ldquo;white light&rdquo; to have covered the distance to the area of the Big Dipper &ndash; he was really moving!  Then, at the place we call the &ldquo;cup of the Big Dipper,&rdquo; where the light made a 90-degree turn to its left and moved away from Earth until it could no longer be seen -- again, to me, that meant he was really moving!  Until, and unless, proved otherwise, I firmly believe the &ldquo;light&rdquo; was not an airplane, but must have been a UFO &ldquo;way, way out there.&rdquo;", "I was driving down the NC 41 between White Lake and Tomahawk, North Carolina and I saw a bright green light strike the ground.  It came down from left to right traveling at a high rate of speed (Probably west to East).  The light turned red before striking the ground.  I saw an explosion and the Earth move, but as soon as the light hit the ground everything was completely black.  No residual fire or such.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was leaving a restaurant and walking to my car.  It was a clear night and there were a decent amount of stars out.  I paused to look at the stars for a moment when I saw three lights in the sky.  They were moving from a SE to NW direction.  Because they stayed the exact same distance from each other, I quickly assessed that they were part of the same object.  The lights themselves were a sort of neon greenish color and if you connected them, they would form a triangle.  I couldn&rsquo;t tell you for sure what the color of the object was but it &ldquo;felt&rdquo; like it was black.I knew within seconds that what I was seeing was unlike anything I&rsquo;d ever witnessed before.  I knew within seconds that I was seeing a UFO.  There is no doubt in my mind.  It moved across the sky at an incredibly fast speed, way faster than anything man-made.  It made no sound what-so-ever.  It simply&hellip;..glided, is the way I would describe it.  Because it was moving across the sky so fast, I probably only saw it for less than 10 seconds.

It was moving at what I would call a normal velocity for an airplane (i.e. did not zip by). It was moving in such a way that it passed by all the windows in the classroom, so I had about 30 seconds to look closely at the object. At first I thought it was an airplane, but did not see any wings or tail; the object looked just like a saucer or the generic idea of what a UFO might look like. I honestly couldn&apos;t believe my eyes and kept watching as it passed by, looking intently because I expected to recognize it as an airplane.  I&apos;m terrible at gauging distances, but the object seemed close enough to where I would have expected to hear some noise from the jets, were it an airplane.  I did not hear anything. The lack of tail was especially puzzling and I&apos;m still convinced the object was not an airplane.", "Pinpoint flash of light in stationary position four times, fifth flash off to the east then it was gone.My husband and I were standing out on the carport watching the sky. I was facing him (facing North) and he was facing South. He called my attention to something that flashed in the sky. I turned around and didn&apos;t see anything at first but kept watching because my husband told me to just wait that it was flashing at intervals (roughly one minute). I kept watching where he told me to look (we used two stars in the sky to locate it) and I caught the flash. It wasn&apos;t something &quot;twinkling&quot;, it wasn&apos;t going off quickly enough to be considered a blink, it was just like a pinpoint flash. It didn&apos;t illuminate the sky around it. I know it sounds idiotic (and I&apos;m not saying this is what is was) but the best way I could describe it is if someone was setting off a flash bulb really, really high in the sky. I kept standing there and watching in the exact same location and in about a minute it flashed again in the exact same spot. Sure enough within another minute it flashed again, in the exact same spot. It didn&apos;t move a single inch because as I said, we were using two stars to guide off of with the location. The last and final flash was to the left of the stars and then we didn&apos;t see it again. It flashed very brilliantly each time we saw it, the last flash that was off to the east of the spot it was initially holding position in was just as intense as the others. It was just a very bright white flash. The light didn&apos;t reach the ground or anything it just looked like a star flashing really intensely at one minute intervals from really far up in the sky. The final flash we saw, as I stated before, was not in the position it initially was and after that we didn&apos;t see it anymore although we were both keeping our eyes on the area we saw the flashes in. The final flash was far enough from the first ones that it couldn&apos;t have been a &quot;star&quot; moving. If it would have stayed lit up, the distance it was with the last flash, you could have definitely detected noticeable movemenet. But since it didn&apos;t stay lit, an! d we did n&apos;t see it move, we just saw that it HAD moved pretty far from its first location. There were no clouds, it was clear and we had a half moon that wasn&apos;t visible because it was low on the horizon. We didn&apos;t see or hear any planes or helicopters and the flash seemed to be coming from so high up a plane or helicopter wouldn&apos;t be at that altitude anyway. It looked like a star (as bright as Venus) would light up for a split second then go back out only to light up again about a minute later. I know my report was redundant as far as the descriptions, but I want to make sure what we saw is understood as a single light and not an affective &quot;flash&quot; although that is what we would call it. I also want to make it clear that it moved far enough from its original location that there is no way it could have possibly been a planet or star.

Moving approx. 120 mph south to north. maybe 5000 feet. seen by six peopleHello Mr. Davenport,  I would like to let you know of an event that happened approximately 40 years ago in Reading, Pa. From what I can recall of the people present, there were probably five or six of us playing baseball in a large lot between two buildings. Don&rsquo;t remember who said look at that up in the sky but we all froze when we saw the object. I recently checked out on google-earth the direction the object was traveling and it seems that it was going exactly south to north. The object was a large ball, but not fire. It had molten liquid flowing over its entire surface. The colors were blending and constantly moving. I can still picture it after all this time. The colors were green, purple and red and with other colors. It was moving horizontally with the earth. It also was an overcast day but not raining. The sky gave a good backdrop of the object. It was the size of a hardball if it was at ceiling height. There was no wind that could be felt at the time. As it went past overhead you could hear it make a slight whooshing sound. Its speed was probably about that of a single engine plane, not fast at all. I remember saying to my brother how can it stay up in the air going so slow. I also thought it odd that the liquid stayed on the object and did not drop off of it. I just can&rsquo;t remember what year it was exactly, probably 1966 or 1967. At the time I was fourteen or fifteen. It has just bothered me all these years as to what it was. I wonder if you have heard of anything like this from other people?

So I&rsquo;ve been out every evening with binoculars looking for UFO&rsquo;s or whatever they are. So five days have pasted and I have not saw anything else. On the sixth day after my first sightings it is Thursday night, March 5th , 2009. I have 3 sighting that were note worthy. These objects were not at all like the objects in my first sightings on Feb. 27th, 2009.(1)  March 5th, 2009 in the evening about 8:05 I spotted 2 odd bright white lights close together above the mountain range NNE of down town Salt Lake City. I didn&rsquo;t recall ever seeing any lights here before so I watched them. About 8:15pm an airplane flew near these 2 lights and over the mountain range, so I decided to watch the plane. The airplane was flying across the valley from the east and heading west. Because of this I spotted an object with my 10x50 binoculars while I was watching this  jet fly over the valley from east to west. The object I spotted was coming from the north west and heading south east ward and just a little lower than the airplane. The object was a small dim light with a slight amber color to it. It flew close and under the airplane and then arced up and stopped at about the height that the airplane was. It stay at that spot for about 3 seconds. Then the object moved north a very short distance before stopping again. During this very short movement towards the north I could see 2 circles of lights on the bottom with one light in the center. The lights were white in color, one circle of lights with a smaller circle of lights inside that circle and inside the inner circle was the light in the center.(The object was mainly visibly clear with my binoculars and too far away to bother with photographing it.) The object was fairly high up and hard to get any real detail once it stopped and hovered. At this time I could only see that it had a cluster of lights on the bottom of it. It hovered there for 20 minutes before it flew north and disappeared at about 8:35pm. While I was watching this object, at times I would put the binocular down and give my arms a rest. It was during these periods of resting that I would check out the 2 lights that were close together but never moved. (This sighting is pictured in the northern west area of the map picture with the white line showing its flight path. In the &ldquo;V&rdquo; of this line is where it hovered for about 20 minutes.) I am viewing this sighting jus! t south of the red dot marking where West Valley City is on the map.(2)  The other object that I first saw (8:05pm) was the two odd bright white lights that were side by side and a little above the mountains (NNE of Salt Lake City). I had not ever seen anything bright there before and this was about 8:05pm when I first became aware of this. I felt that it didn&rsquo;t belong there. I watched it off and on with the binoculars, it never moved at all.  It was during this that I saw an airplane flying near these 2 lights and decided to watch it fly across the valley and if not for this I would have not saw the sighting I first described. During about a 4 minute period of time  while I was watching it, to my surprise, it took off and headed west and then sharply turned north. It didn&rsquo;t appear to bank at all during this turn. Shortly after I saw it moving north I could see other lights on it and after a short distance a few of the lights  began blinking. Soon it was out of my view. ( 8:20pm) The lights were mostly white and one red light. It flew away at a normal speed similar to a regular aircraft? It was at a good distance and I didn&rsquo;t bother with trying photograph it. It would have only been another unknown light with no way to identify it. (On the map picture of Salt Lake City in the area NNE on the edge of the mountain range is a red line that goes northward. The start of this red line NNE of Salt Lake City is where it hovered for several minutes before flying north ward) I am viewing this sighting just south of the red dot marking where West Valley City is on the map.(3)  Later near where I spotted had saw the 2 odd bright lights hovering above the mountain range NNE of Salt Lake City, but north of this area. I panned across this area with my binoculars and I saw a multiple colored light darting back and forth, up and down at times. It mainly zig zagging up and down in &ldquo;Z&rdquo; pattern laid on its side! It moved in this jerky fashion as it traveled south ward across and near the mountain tops. At times it was higher than the snow topped mountains under it and other times it was lower than the tops of the mountain. The multiple colored light was only visible with my binoculars. The colors were white, green, red and blue, I didn&rsquo;t see any of the lights blinking. At times the colors were very sharp and vivid. It kind of reminded me of a buttery flittering about. (9:40 pm) The sighting was about a &frac12; a minute in duration. I don&rsquo;t understand why anything would be so erratic in flight. (On the map picture is a squiggle greenish line just north of where the red line starts. This is about where it was sighted moving south ward.)

I don&apos;t recall the exact date, but I have seen a couple of reports on your website of similar sightings, so I thought I would report it.  My wife, my daughter and I were travelling home at approximately 9:00 pm.  We were heading east on Jericho Turnpike, in the eastern portion of Commack, approaching Smithtown.  My wife was driving, I was in the front passenger seat and my daughter (17) was in the back seat.  Traffic was light, as it was a cold winter evening.  We were stopped at a red light when suddenly I saw, above and ahead of us, what looked like a shooting star....except it was very large, and bright green!   The first thought that entered my head was a meteor.  It was heading in a northerly and downward direction, so it passed in front of us from right to left.  It was only visible for a couple of seconds, as it was moving very fast, but as it flashed by, it momentarily lit up the sky around it in a bright green color.  As I stated , it was moving in a downward trajectory, so much so that it looked like it might crash in the neighborhood to our north, and I silently braced myself to hear some sort of explosion.  But nothing more happened.  After the object had passed, I waited a few seconds and then asked (trying not to sound too excited) &quot;did anyone just see that?&quot;  To my relief (that I wasn&apos;t having hallucinations), both my wife and daughter replied, tentatively, &quot;ummm...yeah&quot;.  I then asked whether either of them had any idea what we might have just seen.  My wife, almost too quickly, blurted out &quot;oh, it must have just been a shooting star&quot;.  I could tell by her voice that she really didn&apos;t believe this, but my wife is someone who does not like to engage in any discussions about anything paranormal, etc.  So, I just let this go, and didn&apos;t bother to comment that I&apos;ve seen many shooting stars in my lifetime; that they are not this BIG; and that they aren&apos;t BRIGHT GREEN!  I tried to make more light conversation about what we&apos;d just seen, but I ! got the distinct impression that both wife and daughter were a bit creeped out by it, and didn&apos;t want to talk about it, so I dropped the subject.  However, one last postscript to this....about a mile east of our sighting, we encountered a County police car coming in the opposite direction toward us.  The officer was not using his siren, but had all of his emergency flashers on, and was driving at a high rate of speed.   He was obviously making a silent response to something urgent, and as he approached us, he made a screeching right turn onto a side street and headed north into the neighborhood where I thought our &quot;shooting star&quot; might crash.  (He made the turn almost on two wheels, and was drivng so fast that my wife commented, &quot;Whoa....where&apos;s HE going?&quot;)   I don&apos;t know if the two events were just coincidence....or if the officer saw the same thing that we did!  I have no idea what it was that we saw...I am not saying it was a &quot;flying saucer&quot;....just that it was NOT an ordinary shooting star.  I won&apos;t say it was unlike anything else I&apos;ve ever seen, because I did have a similar sighting several years ago, late at night, while sitting on my deck.  In that instance, however, the same type of green &quot;shooting star&quot; went directly overhead, travelling west to east, and did not appear to be travelling downward.

PD))", "Looked like end of a Q-Tip, beachball sized object appeared from north to south, daytime, color matched cloud horizon, 80mph at 60&apos;.I am a fifty-six year old male and I&rsquo;ve debated about reporting this event for several days.  A friend of mine is a believer and he encouraged me to tell you about what happened last Monday.  My son and I were working on the exterior of one of our customer&rsquo;s buildings.  My son was on the roof at the northeast corner and I was on the ground looking up at his position.  It was a beautiful day with bright blue skies and wispy clouds at the horizon.  I was observing all the planes that were in the sky above us and was amazed how many there were at that time.  The contrails were long and well defined.  As I was watching the planes and keeping an eye on my son I noticed an object coming into to my line of sight from my left.  It was traveling from my north to the south, directly behind the building we were working on, at about 60 to 80 feet above the ground.  When I first focused on the object to determine what I was seeing, I dismissed a bird because there were no wings, no head, no movement a bird normally makes when it flies, ie; beating wings, up and down pattern as the a bird raises and lowers it&rsquo;s wings in flight darting back and forth, etc.  Was it a radio controlled plane?  No.  Then I really started to focus, because this was making me uncomfortable.  I yelled at my son so he could verify what I was witnessing.  He did not acknowledge me.  He was busy.  I really yelled his name again and he raised his head in frustration.  What!  He yelled back.  Look! Look! Look!, I said.  Did you see that?  I said to him.  See What?, he asked.  That thing that just went behind the building in the sky.  No!, he said.  See what, Dad?  I paused for a moment, not believing what I had seen and that no one would ever believe what I saw.Well, here comes the important part.  Details of what I saw last Monday.  There was a railroad track behind the building and the object was following the tracks or at least it seemed to be.  This, whatever it was, was about 60 to 80 feet above the ground and traveling at about 80 miles per hour.  It was small, about the size of a beachball.  (Not sure because things don&rsquo;t look as big when they&rsquo;re elevated that high.)  With my first description, to my son, I thought it was the size of a bowling ball and white in color.  After I replayed this sighting in my mind I changed that description.  It looked like the end of a Q-Tip.  It was almost fuzzy and the color matched the clouds in the horizon.  The only reason I saw it was I was looking up and the blue skies allowed me to spot it.  If I had been on the same plane with the object it would have blended into the clouds in the horizon.  One of the more interesting things to me was that it was traveling as if it were on a rail.  It never varied in it&rsquo;s path.  It never ascended or descended.  I&rsquo;ve never seen anything that didn&rsquo;t vary a bit one way or the other.  Anyway, I watched the object until it blended into the clouds in the horizon at about &frac12; mile to the south of my location.  The fuzziness that surrounded the object seemed to be consistent.  It didn&rsquo;t change or pulse.", "Star-like UFO moving like a bloodhound from side to side &amp; backwards across the sky in S.F. AreaOn March 6, 2009 at approximately 19:45 hrs. my husband and I were walking in the hills of Point Richmond, California.  We were looking upwards at the constellation of Orion and my husband brought to my attention that one of the brighter &quot;stars&quot; was moving.  Even though I was not wearing my eyeglasses at the time (I am near-sighted and thus have trouble focusing on far objects) I could see the movement of the object quite clearly.  It looked almost exactly like any other star.  It was so far distant from us; however, that we were unable to discern any distinct shape other than that it looked like a star that was moving.Neither my husband nor myself have either seen nor witnessed any other UFO that behaved in this manner. We have both seen the Space Station and other satellites in the sky as well as comets and meteor showers at other times, but this &quot;apparition&quot; did not behave in any way like any of those other objects.  We are also very used to seeing many different types of aircraft in the sky, as we are on the flight pathways of various airports in the San Francisco Bay area, and this object did in no way resemble any aircraft or the manner in which any aircraft could possibly fly  The UFO appeared in the constellation of Orion and moved in a Northerly direction, but not in a smooth or straight line such as a satellite or comet might, its pattern was highly erratic and it &quot;wandered&quot; along a Northern pathway.  To me it appeared to &quot;jump&quot; from side to side, probably due to the fact that as I was not wearing my eyeglasses and my eyes kept trying to focus on it as it moved.  However, my husband said that the objects movement was fairly smooth, but that it was moving erratically from side to side as it moved &quot;forward.&quot;At one point it suddenly stopped and it moved backwards quickly and then just as quickly it returned to its forward progression.  It continued to move erratically in this manner and traveled approximately halfway across the visible sky before it rapidly faded and disappeared into the Earth&rsquo;s shadow. To me it appeared as if it was moving away from us and thus was getting smaller as it progressed on its path.  .My husband describes its behavior as being like a bloodhound during a tracking exercise, in other words it did not move forward without varying from side to side.  Due to how small it appeared and how very far away it seemed to be, it must have been moving at an extremely high rate of speed to cover such a distance in the sky while it moved in this strange pattern.The entire event lasted perhaps 5 minutes, maybe a little less, although we were very spellbound by it&rsquo;s appearance and movement so it may have taken a bit longer in actuality.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded quite mature and sober-minded to us.

We were standing in roughly the shape of a triangle.  One of my friends, whose shoulders were almost parallel to the object&rsquo;s path, got a really puzzled look on his face and pointed toward the sky.  I turned, my shoulders about perpendicular to the path, to see a very bright, light green object about the size of the moon traveling quickly from roughly south to north.  My second friend turned all the way around and saw the bright light travelling quickly behind the clouds.The object was definitely circular, possibly spherical.  It had a tail about twice the length of the object that gradually came to a point.  It was only visible for a second or two due to clouds and trees but I was able to see it cover about 40 to 50 degrees of sky (the angle created by pointing where I first saw it to where it went behind the clouds).  It looked very much like the green ball a Roman candle shoots but without any smoke.  There was no noise except that of the cars on the street and the wind blowing through the trees.I&rsquo;m not sure what it was.  I grew up by an airport and have seen all different types of planes come in all types of whether at all types of angles and it was definitely not a plane.  I read that green meteorites sometimes occur but if it was, it was either big enough that I&rsquo;ll be hearing about it on the news tomorrow or close enough that we would have an impact noise at least.  We were standing on church property, which is quite large, so short range fireworks are out of the question.

Around 8pm ((deleted)) said come outside as he saw something so I grabbed some binoculars and the camera and we climbed on the roof of the house.  We could see over treetop level to the secret part of the base where was hovering just above the trees a saucer shaped object with spaced flashing red lights on the rim.  After about fifteen minutes two large jet aircraft (possibly C134) circled around and one would dive at the UFO continuously for several minutes until the UFO shot a white pencil beam of light like a lazer at the nose of the jet.  The jet flew directly over us and I saw the jet numbers but figured I better forget and the jet left.  Five minutes later a jet fighter came in diving at the UFO.  I noticed that the width of the saucer was about the length of the fighter about 60 feet.  I didn&rsquo;t take any pictures this whole time for certain reasons but we could see clearly especially with the binoculars. Finally the UFO must of got the hint and settled down below the trees.  The two jets circled for about 45 minutes then left.

Some airplanes were flying very high, others, mid altitude, others landing.  Suddenly I noticed a silver ball moving from what I thought was east to west and a steady speed and not higher than any of the airplanes flying.

I believe 100% his story and observation as he is a very credible and responsible person. My brother who works for my company overseeing my night operations of my business got off work at 3AM. He lives in Maricopa so he travels from Phoenix to his home driving I-10. At around 4AM while traveling eastbound on I-10 as he approached the queen creek exit in Chandler he observed a dark diamond shaped object to his left rise up from a field about 100 feet and it then headed in a easterly direction towards casa grande. My brother said he was driving about 75-80 MPH and there were a few other cars on the road. He said the object made a few moves that made him think this was not a known civilian or military aircraft. It had 3-4 lights similar to navigation lights and it moved faster then his vehicle. He guessed it speed to be around 100-125MPH. He turned off his exit to queen creek/Highway 347 and proceeded on to the Town of Maricopa where he lives. He did not see the aircraft anymore once he left the Interstate freeway. I have lived here since 1996 after getting out of the military. I was in aircrat maintenance for F-14&apos;s and have been exposed to many types of military aircraft. What he described and its movements and speed along with no typical aircraft sounds associated with a jet engine aircraft or any normal chopping sounds of a helicopter type aircraft I conclude what he saw was either extremely new military technology not yet known to the general public or it was a UFO. I know there have been many unexplained events and sightings in the Phoenix area since I have lived here. Bottom line, I believe my brother saw exactly what he described as described. In my opinion, there has been to many sightings by too many people of various types of aircraft doing maneuvers that are just not known to be capable of modern aircfraft both military and civilian. Our current aircraft designs and more specifically, their power plants do not a! llow for this. Even a Harrier jet can not stop on a dime and hover, and when it is hovering, it is very loud because of the nozzel thrust it produces in the downward position. His sighting was a very silent aircraft leading me to believe it utilizes a high energy magnetic type power plant propulsion system and the earths natural magnetisym. Opposite type polarity propulsion system that have been engineered to allow for quite flight, speed, and maneuverability such as the new high speed trains technolog that use magnetics and ride on a cushion of air exist today, just not known to exist on aircraft at this time.", "Dark blue light moving sideways, but apparently suspended under something like a white parachute?At about 23:15, March 17, 2009, I saw a bright dark blue light in the skies, about 100&rsquo; (rough estimate) in the sky over a wooded area next to the freeway in Lexington, Ky.

It was moving slowly about 20 feet from the ground and on an interception course with our pickup.  It was heading SW.  As we were traveling there was a light nearby next to a radio tower and between us and the tower, the UFO moved past the tower, becoming invisible as it passed by the light.  It made its way, silently, across the highway behind us.  I could barely make out what it looked like.  It was definitely pyramidal in shape, as I could see it from the side.  It looked black in the night sky, but when it passed the light, it was invisible.  When I first saw it, it seemed like my eyes were playing tricks on me, until it passed across the road.  It happened so fast, I didn&rsquo;t even know what I saw until after it had disappeared into the night.  None of my family believed me!  That partly discouraged me from telling anyone else.  The duration of the sighting also discouraged me.Like I said, it was completely silent, nearly invisible, flying slowly (same speed as we were driving), partly moving in tune with our direction, keeping up with our vehicle for a short time.I never saw anything like it again, but wished I had.  Ever since that sighting, I have been interested in other people&rsquo;s UFO sightings.  Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t seen many convincing videos or convincing stories.  I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people make up sightings for fun, however, I know what I saw, and it is the truth.", "Pulsating Red/Green/White light off Puerto Rico.My wife and I were recently on a NCL cruise when I spotted something strange from the balcony one night.  It was 10:15 PM local time (11:15 PM EST), and we were approximately &frac12; ways between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.  My guess is we were 25 miles north of the two islands, traveling due east and closer to Puerto Rico than the Dominican Republic.  The sky was crystal clear and the visibility excellent when viewing the horizon.  Looking straight up was diminished due to the ships lights.I went out on the balcony and immediately spotted a pulsating white/red/green light to the south, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.  The object was stationary and appeared to be rotating.  The color changes were at regular intervals of approximately 1 second each.  There also appeared to be a solid white light just above and attached to the color changing lights.After a few minutes my wife came out and I showed her what I was looking at.  We both confirmed the color changing and the stationary aspect of the object.  We continued to view the object for 15 to 20 minutes.  In that time the object did not move up, down, or side to side at all, nor did the intensity of the lights change.  What ever it was, it was definitely in a stationary position.The object did not appear to be close.  I would guess it was 10 to 20 miles away as its relative position did not change in relation to the stars in the background and the motion of the ship.  I was very tempted to call the bridge and ask what they thought of my sighting, but eventually never did.It is worth mentioning that my wife and I live in New England, close to the ocean and just a few miles from a major airport.  We have seen thousands of airplanes over the years and often watch them come in over the water from 20+ miles away.  Never has one appeared like this.  Airplanes at a distance at night start off as a solid white light, move left/right/up/down, and then as they get closer the red and green wing lights come into view.  The object we saw that night did not move at all and was easy to reference to the stars in the background.  The red and green was also just as bright as the white.I am a casual astronomy enthusiast and fairly literate with the movements of the planets and constellations.  The object we witnessed was far below the planetary arc and could not have been Venus or any other planet.  In luminosity though I would say it was as bright as the brightest Venus I&rsquo;ve ever seen.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Sirius.  We will contact source.

It was about the size of a medium star, and the glow of blue seemed to pulsate, but I can&rsquo;t be sure due to the distance.As I watch it go across the sky, a white &ldquo;light&rdquo;(again, more of a glow) suddenly appeared right behind it. It also was about the size of a medium star.Both were, to my ears, completely silent.The blue one blinked out and re-appeared slightly further east in the sky, and was at a complete stop...no motion that I could detect.The white one seemed to slow down and did a little zigzag in the sky, at what seemed to be the same altitude as the blue one.While the white one did its maneuvers, the blue one blinked out of view a couple more times, and after each would re-appear in a slightly different part of the sky, at a complete stop, but still within the area of the white one and its zigzag movement.After about a minute (60 seconds) of this, they both took off, the blue one slightly ahead of the white one, at what seemed to be the same altitude, in a due south direction.Needless to say, I was quite mesmerized by the performance I witnessed.I have provided contact information on the Report Form.", "A very bright object over Austin TX that follows plan then passes it like nothing seem to be investigating the plan.The object seem to shine like a welding tip as the object came from a very high altitude it seem to me from outer space it appeared to fall from a higher altitude directly above and then feel behind the air plan that was at a very high altitude because i could only see a very small outline of a plan and the contrails of the plan where very sort as the object got brighter then seem to stop and follow the plan then speed up past the plan at same time got dimmer then could not see it anymore this all happened very fast less than 10-15 seconds on a crystal clear blue sky. never seen nothing like this reminded me when the space shuttle came crashing down over Texas and all the peaces that where burning up was the same brightness of object but this object did not burn up.", "Light or small object, drifting slowly E-W on a clear afternoon.

From that location I can see most all of the southern half of the sky (horizon to horizon), but only about 20 percent of the northern half and no horizon.  Unfortunately there is a utility company office and repair facility south of my home that has large floodlights, that are on all night and kind of fades out the horizon area directly south, but directly up and most of the southern sky is quite clear.  I am in the habit of scanning the skies at night for about 30 seconds, most every night, and sometimes more than once.  This night I did scan the southern sky and it was clear and all stars were very visible.  I looked to 12 o&rsquo;clock straight above me and I saw what I would have to describe as one of those clusters of faint stars that you see in the sky on a real clear night that almost appears to be a circle of foggy light.  But, what I was seeing, was instead, an object moving very fast.  No light was emitting from the object, but most of the object was discernable by what appeared to be reflective light, but not sharp or bright.  It was a very dull, again as if it was one of those star clusters, but you could see that it was a hard object.  This object was moving extremely fast from straight above me towards the SSW horizon.  I believe that it was a very large object, very far above me.  It&rsquo;s shape exactly was very hard to determine as the edges of the object were blurry and it&rsquo;s apparently very fast speed.  It could have been round or triangular and appeared to be fairly flat.  If I had to guess, I would say that it was 10,000 feet or more above me, and with that size of an object, it would have to be traveling at several thousand miles per hour.  Within 4 or 5 seconds, it vanished as if it faded away.  The object made no sound.  I looked for and found a star cluster and it did have a similar size and appearance, except the object I saw, had a surface! look to it, especially in the center.  I stayed out there in the cold for about 5 minutes in the hope if it retuning, but it did not.  I am absolutely certain of what I saw and that it was as I have described to you.", "We saw a UFO in the sky over the Wenatchee, WA, 98801 valley.To whom this may concern:    RE: UFO sighting  I was standing outside in Wenatchee, WA, 98801 at 21:45 on 28 MAR 09, having a cigar with my friend, looking up in the sky.  All of a sudden I said &quot;look up&quot; and we both saw a tube like object 20&apos; x 50&apos; (foot) long in low part of the sky.  It had a blue ora of lights around the object with white light in the center.  It appeared that the object turned its lights on for about 2-3 seconds then it turned off.

This evening while in our spa we again heard the sound of the F16s. This time when we looked up we saw something very strange.At approximately 9:10 PM on Monday the 16th of March 2009 we heard an approaching aircraft. We looked up and to the east since this is the normal direction these jets take. As soon as we looked up we saw a white light moving extremely fast from the east to the west. This light was about as bright as a semi-bright star moving nearly as fast as a meteorite. There was no tail or sound coming from it at all and the light stayed constant. We could hear the jet coming w/afterburners on but by the time he was overhead the &quot;light&quot; was nearly out of sight to the west.These jets normally head north towards the guard base after reaching the valley but this one headed straight across the valley as fast as he could (without breaking the sound barrier) As fast as the F16 was moving, it was nothing compared to the &quot;light&quot; he was apparently attempting to follow.Over the next several minutes 5 more jets (jet 2 also had afterburners on) headed in the exact same direction as the object and first jet.I believe if this was a meteorite or space debris the object would have been burning leaving a trail behind and would not have been traveling in perfectly straight line from east to west with no noticeable elevation change.On clear nights we can see the city lights across the central valley to the base of the coast range, tonight was one of those nights.", "exploding star the object went from a faint to a very bright colourAt 23:11 on this date I saw what I believe was an exploting Star.

My fiance says she thought it kind of flapped slightly like a large slow moving bird mind you she agreed on its size, she said &quot;If it was a creature it was still the size of several football fields.&quot; The best way I can explain it is if you took a paper plate, cut out the middle leaving only the curved edges, then cut out a quarter section of the edge giving you a rainbow arc shape, now make it see through, like glass. I could even see the stars through it. I kept looking for it hoping to see it again, but I doubt I will it looked pretty set on its course. I didn&rsquo;t see it flap and she said it wasn&rsquo;t very noticeable movement, I think since it was transparent the way it moved in front of the stars did give an appearance of it rippling, I think that might have been what she saw. I hope someone else besides us saw it, it was an amazing sight. Even if it didn&rsquo;t last long. As for us, I am a 20 year old Male. I have lived in this city most of my life. I have very good vision, and hearing.  My Fiance is 18 years old, and has also lived here most of her life.  She also has excellent vi! sion and hearing. I&apos;m a normal adult, I spend my time taking care of my dad and hanging out with my friends. My fiance is a senior in High school, and will be graduating this year. We live in a normal city, and I have never seen anything like this as long as I&rsquo;ve lived here.

Then another appeared on the same path, further behind. The second object caught up with the first. Then the first object went into a tight, elliptical orbit, heading back the opposite direction as the second object followed. When these objects began their elliptical turn, a third object came towards them, quickly, from much further away. When the third object was close to the other two, it slowed down. The three objects were moving slow at this point, then faded out of view.  All three objects looked the same, like dim, blue stars. I was standing at the edge of the, Columbia River, Washington, off State Route 401, facing east, looking directly across the river towards, Astoria, Oregon, when I saw this. As it was, I was observing the sky. My line of sight was 60 degrees.  The objects came from the north and were heading to my south before they turned. At first, I thought that I found a satellite, whereas it was moving quickly. My eyes followed it from my left-north to right-south. Then I scanned my eyes over to the left again and spotted another one moving much quicker on the same trajectory until it appeared to be behind the first one. I held my hand up, and the length of my thumb was the distance . Then they made the turn, one following the other heading north. Then I looked over to my complete left and saw the third moving the fastest...in about four seconds it was in my front view, slowed-down to almost a stop. At that point, it appeared to be near the other two, which were moving slowly, also.  From there, they faded away, as if their lights dimmed out.", "Mr. Davenport,  I would like to comment on a sighting dated 2/12/09 near Russellville, Arkansas. I live very near to the described location of the reported sighting.  Based on the description furnished by the witness, I believe what was observed was a flight of three C-130 aircraft from the Little Rock Air Force Base.  These aircraft fly directly over my home every night with out fail between 8 and 10 p.m..  The usual flight path is from the northeast to the southwest. Along this flight path, the aircraft pass approximately 3-5 nautical miles west of Arkansas Nuclear One (the nuclear plant metioned in the report).  Additionally, the aircrafts&apos; usual approximate altitude is less than 1000 feet and display the ligting characteristics described by the witness (on one occasion they were so low that they momentarily blocked the signal to my satellite television receiver). My personal opinion on the reported hovering of one of the aircraft is that if the aircraft is observed flying directly away from the observer it could appear to be motionless or hovering, as I have personally observed this with these aircraft on several occassions.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this comment.

Based on the volume, it seemed close to us, and even made a &ldquo;Doppler Effect&rdquo; as it passed by. There were clouds so I couldn&rsquo;t see it, but I did see what appeared to be a shadow on the clouds, as if something was passing by over them. The shadow was somewhat oval shaped, almost cigar shaped, but was moving &ldquo;sideways&rdquo;.

I am a transportation specialist specializing in the transportation of life sustaining, essential goods. Supplying key cities in the United States. I was returning from the southern portion of Virginia, to my home in New York. I was traveling northbound on interstate 81, through Winchester Va. On the north-side of Winchester, away from the city lights the road gets dark at night. I was listening to the radio when my phone rang, as I picked up the phone I happened to look to the west side of the interstate and when I did I was shocked and awed. There was a formation over the distant mountain. A triangle shaped formation was flying towards me. It immediately caught my attention because of the sensitivity of the cargo that I had on-board. There was a triangle formation with another light perpendicular to the lead light. The size of the formation was enormous. I also noticed before I decided to report this, that others in the area reported the same sighting. The formation then seemed to travel northbound, staying perfectly above the mountain and following the interstate. I first saw the formation in Winchester, Va, and watched it the entire way to north of Carlisle, PA. Between Mechanicsburg, Pa and Harrisburg, Pa is where I lost site of the formation. I saw the exact same formation on U.F.O. hunters on the History channel, a month later. These were clearly not man made craft as the maneuvers they performed were impossible to achieve in modern aircraft. We don&apos;t have anything that can stop in mid - air and make a 90 degree turn.

To start my report, I would like to say, that I do not believe in UFOS (I mean the extra-terrestial ones that is).  I believe that what is up in the sky, and I can&rsquo;t identify, I call it a UFO.  And that is what happened about 10 months ago (It could be a year ago) .  Why report it now?  Well, I was just watching a program on TV tonight about UFOS and it brought to mind the day, about 10 months to a year ago that I saw one.It so happens that it was about 6:20 to 6:40 p.m. and I was in my back yard cleaning my lawn equipment.  When I finished cleaning, I raised my arms to stretch and between two trees that are  about 25 feet tall and spaced from one another about 15 feet, in that small space (I was about 20 feet away from the trees),  and for about 5 second or less, I saw what appeared to be an extra-large black Jet Engine moving (by itself) from Canovanas to Rio Grande to Luquillo.  I know what a Jet Engine looks like because I worked in the Airport and that is what it looked like.  It was flying alone!  The &quot;extra-large black Jet Engine&quot; that I saw was about 500 to 800 feet up in the air and about 800 feet (could be a little bit more) away from where I was standing.   I saw it so clearly, that I could see orange, light yellow and blue streaks of a thin flame streaming from the front to the back of the engine.  From the distance that I was standing I would say that it was probably moving at about 100 or more miles per hour.  If I were to figure out it&rsquo;s size from the distance and height that I saw it, I would say that it was probably about 8 to 10 feet high and 10 to 12 feet long.  I may be wrong, not sure.  I did not hear any sound.I proceeded to tell my wife about it and I called my daughter, who lived in Luquillo to her cell phone, but she told me she was in San Juan, but that she had not seen anything strange and told me to call the radio stations to verify if some else had seen anything.  I did not call the radio stations.  My wife, daughter and son believe in extra-terrestial beings and were delighted with my &quot;sighting.&quot;About an hour later I turned on the radio to check if someone had seen anything, but no one talked about any sightings.I Thought I should tell my story to verify if anyone else had told a similar story in that time frame for the Puerto Rico area.

It was at about 6:30 PM local time, when we suddenly observed a cigar-shaped object moving noiselessly fast from North to South.  It was emitting orange flickering light from window-like openings of this object.  Then it suddenly stopped, reversed its direction of movement, stopped again, begun to continue its North-bound path, and finally performed a zigzag kind of a dance and finally rapidly moved over the horizon.We have to stress that are both scientists and are not easily subjected to illusions.  We have never seen anything like that in our lives, and now we are convinced that we were seeing a true UFO.  After coming back to Boston, we checked at Internet and found out that Cancun is the location at which numerous UFO sightings were reported by many people.

While we were looking up in the sky, we saw 2 enormous formations of 10-12 individual lights.  They appeared to be very high in the sky, as they moved southwest, and the other branched off and moved southwest.  They were moving at an incredibly high rate, moving accross the entire sky in less than 10 seconds.  The formation was that of a V, and was slightly distorted.  The lights seemed to not be moving still while flying, but rather dancing around a bit while going very fast.  They eventually ran accross the sky, and disappeared before they actually left the horizon.  They just seemed to melt into the sky after awhile.  Also, everything around the V seemed to disrupt as well.  The clouds along with the starts out seemed to dissapear and reappear and fluctuate as the V went by.  We at first were convinced that it was the shape of a stealth fighter, and since our proximity to the CIA as well as Quantico meant it was simply just a plane such as that.  However, we decided it couldn&apos;t be that, because those planes do not have active divises to hide like that.  The lights were just dots in the sky, slightly larger than normal stars in the sky.  They were moving at an incredible rate, and had no other comparison to anything on Earth.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

These formations were approximately two miles south of Peyia.Each formation comprised of four bright circular red lights, one in each corner of the square. As I have said, there were two of these formations.  The lights appeared to be identical in colour and size.  Even the formations were at the same altitude, but were maybe a mile away from each other. Commercial airlines were above the area heading both toward and away from the Island and I would say that the air traffic was medium-busy.  It appeared that the lights were below these aircraft, so I would say that these lights were at between 5,000 to 10,000 feet in the sky.These eight lights (one for each corner of the two formations) remained constant in strength and did not pulse or flicker and neither of the formations moved (they appeared to &apos;hover&apos; in the sky as aircraft were passing them).  The weather conditions were fine and for the entire 4 minutes of which we viewed these lights nothing obscurred our sight.  Although a few photographs were taken, none actually managed to successfully capture the lights.  We were unable to notice any sound from the lights.  After a breif period, the lights just &apos;went&apos;, as though somebody had flicked a switch.Although not linked to the above, I witnessed something similar in 2002 in Norfolk, UK.

We laid down to enjoy the day and we both spotted plane flying over head.  It was a normal passenger plane.  We are near an Air Force base and an International airport.  My wife and I are under a pine tree.  The plane disappears into the braches, and then we spot a very small yet super shinny object up In the sky.  It seemed to be higher than the plane and further away.  The plane crossed between us and the object in our field of view. The object was stationary.  I thought it was an astronomical event, maybe Venus shining very brightly for some odd reason.  So we did not try and find the plane after it flew over the tree we were under.  But neither of us ever saw it again.The UFO stayed in its position for approximately 15 minutes.  After a while we both had taken our eyes off of it, only too look back to its location and not see it there. Instead it was heading northeast at a decent pace, blinking like a light.  Its speed was maybe a little faster than a cruising passenger plane.  However we could not judge its altitude well.  It flew too far away and out of sight for us.  We did not have a video or picture abilities with us.  My wife and I were surprised and proceeded to try and interpret what we had saw.Then after we were digesting what we had saw, we looked back up and she spotted two more objects that were the exact same luminosity and size.  They were floating very slowly in the same direction as the previous one.  They floated away over a period of ten minutes and out of view, however they never blinked or sped up.  My wife and I did not spot anything else that day.", "12 spheres spotted over NW Side of Chicago-light colored. Traveled NE.I am reporting a UFO sighting that my fiance and I saw while driving to a restaurant on Chicago&apos;s NW side (not too far from O&apos;Hare airport). I saw a few light colored spheres in the sky above an airplane and my fiance confirmed it was there. I pulled over on Oak Park Avenue and took her camera to grab some photos. She counted 12 of these spheres, which seemed to be very high up. I was so busy trying to get her point and shoot Lumix camera to focus that I really didn&apos;t pay attention to any other detail about these things. I don&apos;t know if they all moved in unison or if they were all moving individually. They were traveling North East.My fiance says they may be balloons, so I checked the weather. The wind was blowing southwest at the time. Also, these wouldn&apos;t be planes because they were not only too high up but, I really don&apos;t think that many planes would be at the same altitude traveling North East (to Canada?).I called 311 (information) to make a report, and they transferred me to the Police. I was sort of embarrased so I asked them to just let the military know what I saw.The spheres eventually dissapeared into the distance and could no longer make out where they were.I have 1 photo of the luckily zoomed in capture of only a few of the spheres which I circled on photoshop with a pen. The camera had an auto focus which, unfortunately, couldn&apos;t find the things in the sky to focus on. So, out of the 10 or so pictures I took most were all blurry. I do have 1 picture or two that you can make out these things. I&apos;d be willing to share the photos with someone who&apos;d be able to help identify the objects.If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email. If you can find anything about similar sighting of these, please let me know.", "Single suspended sphere seperates into multiple pulsing spheres and departs rapidly after warping back to oneI  was driving south bound on the overpass near Gila Bend, when I noticed an object hovering on the right hand side of my car, I was immediately drawn to the object, due to its unfamiliarity.  I took direct notice of the stars and realized it was not a planet, star, or satellite.  The object stood stationary as I pulled off to the side of the road to analyze it further.   There were no buildings, lamp posts or any object near the sphere, which was a bright orange/red in coloring.  I had my camera near me, for earlier I had taken some landscape photos while on my drive.  I lifted my camera to the object and the object began to move, I captured a movement picture of the object, I could not quite get a clear picture so I switched my camera to video mode.  The object then began moving drastically as if trying to avoid being captured on film.  The object darts drastically in my video, and the camera starts making noises with every movement of the object, and an interaction between the two is obvious, which is also captured on the video, you can also see rings in the object with an almost nucleus center. I then lowered my camera to grab another photo and while switching over the camera the object separated into multiple spheres now white in color, the spheres were in two lines, the spheres from right to left glowed and pulsed out light with greater intensity one at a time, when the the last sphere pulsed with light the spheres joined from right to left and formed back into one to disappear at a phenomenal speed. When zooming in on the photo of the object multiples of colors can be viewed.Like I mentioned before, I have video footage of what I have described but I&apos;m not to positive of how to send video via internet.If somebody could  get back to me and explain how to do so, I&apos;d be happy to send over the footage.", "While looking up at the stars I noticed what I thought was a satelite.

I believe it was Sunday, September 4th 1983, but it could have been a later Sunday that month.  Dan was in his late 20&rsquo;s at the time, an insurance salesman, married with a 7-year old child.  I was a just a boy in high school, editor of the school paper, active in the marching band and school plays.  I went on to a successful career in radio broadcasting and commercial voice-over.Dan was driving, and I was in the passenger seat of his black 1978 Gremlin.  We were going approximately 50 miles per hour, due west along Washington Street Road between Argenta and Maroa, roughly two miles west of Maroa and Illinois Highway 51 North.  It was sometime past three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, as we were near the intersection of Washington Street Road and Greenswitch Road, just where there&rsquo;s a junction tower of high voltage lines, where two sets of north-south lines and one set of east-west lines cross.  The temperature was in the mid 70&rsquo;s so we had the windows down and the radio playing, but not very loud.It was at this moment that I noticed what at first looked like a cirrus cloud--it was a very bright white &quot;cigar&rdquo;&quot; shape, tapering in a very shallow curve from the ends to the middle, the same shape top and bottom, like a discus viewed edge-on.  It was approximately 200 feet above the ground, directly above a farmstead on the left side of the road, about a &frac34; of a mile ahead.The shape was noticeably larger across than the farmstead, which consisted of a house, some trees, a couple of equipment barns and large round grain bin.  This would make the size of the object between 100 and 200 yards across, and about 30 to 40 feet thick in the middle, top to bottom.  Immediately, I realized that it couldn&rsquo;t be a cloud, because it was far too low for a cirrus cloud, and there were no other clouds visible in the sky.  Also, it appeared to be brighter white than a cloud should be.  It appeared to be shining with it&rsquo;s own bright white light.  In describing it to people, I have sometimes said that it looked as if the sky were a light blue sheet, and someone had cut a horizontal gash in it with a knife, and sunlight was shining through from behind.It was so bright, I immediately thought it might be a glare on the windshield, so I moved my head from side to side, and forward and back, to see if the &ldquo;glare&rdquo; moved respectively with me.  It did not.  It just appeared to hang motionless above the farm house.  At this point, I&rsquo;d been watching it for all of about ten seconds, and I was starting to wrap my brain around it.  I realized that I was looking at a very large luminous solid object floating in the air above a farmhouse.  I felt adrenaline kick-in hard, and I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off it&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t even dare blink.Then I began to be afraid, because we were essentially heading right towards it at 50 miles an hour!  I could hear no sound from it, but with the windows down and the radio on, I can&rsquo;t say conclusively that it was silent.  My mind was racing, as I could hardly believe my eyes.  I didn&rsquo;t know whether Dan had noticed it, and I had just thought about telling him to stop the car, when the object moved.  It didn&rsquo;t seem to accelerate.  One split second, it was absolutely stationary, and the next split second, it was moving at incredible speed, toward us, parallel to the road.  It covered the half mile or so between the farmhouse and the car in less than two seconds, and passed above the car.  Though it moved very fast, I could tell with absolute certainty that it was a circular disc.  It appeared simply luminous white, with no discernable surface features at all.  I lost sight of it as it passed above the car at an altitude of about 200 feet.  I turned around to see if I could spot it out the rear window, but I couldn&rsquo;t see it.  As I turned back to the front, I caught sight of Dan (a very religious Christian, incidentally.)  He had turned white as a bed sheet.  It was so striking that for a moment, I just sat staring at him as he gazed ahead, eyes transfixed on the road.  Slowly, he turned to look at me.  As his eyes met mine, he snapped his head to the front again.  I could tell he was breathing hard, and his heart was racing.I asked him, &quot;Dan, did you see that?&quot;  &quot;That had to be a glare on the windshield,&quot; he said.&quot;That was no glare on the windshield, and you know it!&quot; I said.  He refused to acknowledge what he&rsquo;d seen, or describe it for me.  He was in an almost catatonic state of denial.  But when I described what I saw, and why I was sure it wasn&rsquo;t a glare on the windshield, he didn&rsquo;t contradict my description.  He simply refused to accept that what he&rsquo;d seen was real.The entire duration of the sighting was less than thirty seconds.I was very agitated and frightened for hours afterward, and I had trouble sleeping for weeks thereafter.  As long as I live, I will never forget the sight of that huge disc above the farmhouse.  I was skeptically curious about UFO phenomena before then, but ever since, I have taken reports of such sightings much more seriously.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I am a registered nurse holding a masters degree in health care administration.I had just gotten off work and was traveling East on Hwy 64 when I encountered a strange sighting. Around milepost 155 I passed numerous bill boards along both sides of the road, and then there were tall trees on both sides.  All of a sudden around milepost 144,  a single golf ball-sized bright light was centered on my rear view mirror.  It was so bright that it was blinding me, and  I had to put my hand up in front of the mirror.  At first I thought it had to have been a motorcycle, but it was way too close to my window. Also, it just came out of nowhere very quickly;  one second it wasn&rsquo;t there, and then the next second it was.  I turned off the radio and rolled down the electric window, but the only sounds were that of my 2001 Buick, and it was a quiet vehicle.  The object stayed right with me without moving for about four minutes.The road was getting ready to turn to the left, and the area opened up on both sides.  An 18-wheeler was coming around the bend, and would be passing me in about 30 seconds.  Right before the truck reached me, the object jetted quickly to the left-hand side of my back window, just out of view of my side view mirror.  As soon as the truck passed me, the object swept toward the truck and then disappeared.  I kept looking back toward the truck, but I never saw the light or a single headlight following the truck.  I then followed the road to the left in the turn, and lost sight of the 18-wheeler.  After this happened, about three minutes down the road, East 64 slowed down in preparation of entering the town of Plymouth, North Carolina.", "A small, flaming- looking object that moved strangely.Circular flaming object.

There were about 25 people in the backyard with me, but they were over near the house while I was away to the side a bit just star gazing.Suddenly I noticed movement in the sky and saw a triangular shaped ship moving across the sky at a smooth, quick cruising speed, dead silent. I couldn&apos;t tell how large or far away it was, but if you were looking in the sky, it was about the size of a large tostito chip.The ship could have been black, or possible a grey (it was dark outside so it was difficult to tell, but I could see the whole outline of the ship.) Along the sides there were lights in a V pattern pointing in the direction that the ship was moving. You could barely see the ship in the sky, as the lights were incredibly dim. They may have just been white circles on the bottom of the ship, but I could see the V pattern made with 7 dim small circles.While I watched it fly over, the significance of what I was seeing set in when it was already directly over my head and moving away fast. I turned around and started yelling and pointing so someone else would see, but everyone kind of lazily looked up, and noone else saw it. I immediately went and called 411 to hook me up to a UFO hotline, and the guy just cracked up and sent me to the FBI which was an answering machine.Interestingly, this coincidentally happened right after. I wanted to head out to find where to report it online, but I thought I would stop at the beach first and star gaze for a bit (hoping another one would show up). I actually couldn&apos;t stop looking up for the rest of the night. Anyways, these 2 guys were walking up from the beach as I walked over. We started talking and I told them what happened earlier. I was talking about how crazy it was that I just saw this article, and heard an interview of Dr Edgar Mitchel (6th man on the moon) basically confirming that aliens were real, the gov knows it and has for 60 years, and area 51 was actually a crash where they have bodies.

Apart from the observed airplane activity, a genuine UFO sighting occurred and was videotaped, and that is the purpose of this report and video submission.

One does not report such things unless he is willing to be scrutinized.  I was not so willing.  I am grateful that I can share this anonymously and be taken seriously.It was mid summer in Beloit, Wisconsin.  Some friends and I were sitting around a bon fire that night talking and laughing.  I enjoy looking up at the stars, wondering what else is out there and who.  As I was gazing into the night sky something, a shape, caught my attention.  There were no lights or sound.  There was only that large triangular shape obscuring the starlight as it glided stealthily across the sky.  If you were to hold your hand up, it would have been approximately half the size.  I watched it move silently for about 45 seconds.  It didn&rsquo;t move fast, but it maintained a constant speed.My mind raced for a logical explanation, but I could find none.  I thought perhaps it was a stealth fighter plane.  I then deduced that it would have moved faster and made some sort of sound as it passed by.  Not to mention, it would have had lights being over U.S. soil.  I also thought about telling my friends, but I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable with being called crazy or told I was just seeing things.  That was the only time I saw an object as such, yet I still stare up at the sky hoping that I might catch a glimpse of it one more time.I know it&rsquo;s not much, but it is what I saw that night.

I looked out the bus window and saw two large flare shaped lights hovering over the city (one green and one blue).  I asked the Chinese guide what they were, and neither she nor anyone else could explain them.  They were not fireworks.  A few seconds later, a red one appeared in a different location for a brief moment when it quickly vanished as several white lights flashed around it.  We arrived at our hotel and my roommate and I looked out our 8th story window to see a pentagonal formation of five lights as well as two green lights with long flickering tails slowly moving over the horizon towards the formation.  The formation spanned a distance several miles wide and several miles high in the night sky.  The light on the far left of the formation was rapidly changing color from blue to green to purple to red to yellow and so on.  The other four lights were yellow or white in color and were slowly moving along the perimeter of the pentagon.  My roommate and I watched the lights for nearly two hours.  A couple of times during the event a red light shot out from the colorful light and eventually returned to the colorful light.As we watched the green lights rise toward the formation we noticed that once they reached a certain height in the sky, they lost their shimmering tails and green color and joined the formation of yellow and white lights. The most shocking moment came when three of the green lights with tails were traveling toward the formation. At the same time as if connected by an unseen force, they all swayed quickly to the left, and back to the right. We continued to watch the lights and even tried to take some photos and video, but lights of the buildings in Beijing were too bright to get a ! clear sh ot, and the images and videos barely show the lights. We thought of every possible explanation for the source of the lights, but nothing could explain their unique movements.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They were heading toward Pardee Lake outside town.  This happened on a 3 mile stretch of back road.  There were no other cars to witness.  My son was very scared when he arrived home.

I am the most skeptical sort of person about this type of thing so it&apos;s still really hard for me to believe what we saw.  There were four circular, oval light shapes in the sky.  They were flying in a repeated pattern in a circular motion, with absolutely perfect precision.  They would then converge towards a centerpoint between them and then repeat their circular pattern.It looked to be an exercise of some sort.  The precision was that of a machine or computer.

Since I live near the Boulder Municipal Airport when I saw two orbiting red spherical objects (they were orbiting each other) over in the west of where I live (which is slightly to the west of the airport) I called the police non-emergency line. As the phone was ringing I saw a slight flash of green come from the east. A solitary green sphere was floating right over where the airport is emitting occasional bursts of light. As I watched the three orb/spheres I told the police what was going on. Then I saw something I knew I should not tell them. The green orb detached two smaller green orbs that chased the two red orbs off to the north. When I went inside to email this off, the large green orb was still there. All the time there were aircraft passing by at normal flight altitudes but what I found disconcerting was the fact that I could not hear the trains I normally hear this time of night going by on the tracks just under half a mile away.So you know, I am a firm believer in UFOs and have twice before seen them but never this many in a single sitting, it has always been silver doughnut shaped UFOs before now and in pairs.

I became very familiar with the flight pattern into and back out of the airport, having taken over 15 trips by the date of this sighting.  After arriving at the airport I would rent a car and travel East on Touhy to my hotel in Skokie.  Each week I enjoyed watching the incoming flight line.  Planes would only be about a few hundred to a couple thousand feet up at that point.  I knew this by listening to the flight deck communications when I would arrive.  On this Sunday early evening I noticed a particularly large aircraft with the typical front fuselage and side wing lights in a triangle pattern.  Usually the larger aircraft appear to be moving slowly due to their size.  As I traveled east on Touhy, however, I noticed that this large aircraft appeared to be moving too slowly - not what I was used to seeing.  Within a few moments I realized it was hovering, and the motion was mine.  As I approached Western Ave intersection I noted that it was hovering above buildings to my right.  I turned the corner on Greenwood to make a run around the block to hopefully see it from behind.  Instead I saw it in the same place as I rounded the block - it definitely was hovering, and it was a large dark triangle with a few lights to define its shape.  On Touhy again I decided to round the block one more time and stop on a side street to get out to have a look.  By the time I got to a stopping place it was gone.  At no time did I hear any noise from the object.  I am a research scientist with trained observation skills, and can say for sure that I saw a hovering triange shaped aircraft that was out of place in this area.

I live in Claremont, Ca, a suburb of Los Angeles, a city that lies against mountains, on the other side of those mountains is desert.  I believe we are stationed in a path on the way to a military base, as I have often seen military helicopters flying over, and we are stationed on some sort of air travel path as many vehicles fly overhead often.  I noticed that it was a very clear day.  I was standing looking westward, which I consider to be Los Angeles, and I noticed a bright white light in the sky.  Which is unusual, as you don&rsquo;t usually notice lights in the sky during the day.  It was metallic and white looking and I thought it moved unusually.  It was extremely bright and from a distance just looked like a spot/metal.  It was very far in the distance and seemed very high, so I thought if it moved closer I could tell if it was a plane or a helicopter.  As it came nearer and closer, I noticed there was a red tint to it as well.  I thought it maybe a blimp.  As it moved towards me, along this northeast path, along the mountains, and the same direction as the weather clouds today, it became brighter.  The white/diamond light became stronger and it also flashed red.  The lights were unusual, more high-tech than most planes or other flying objects.  The shape was cigarish.  I became slightly frightened as the light was very bright.  It continued moving on its path over my home and along the northeast latitude along the mountains, and continued until it was out of sight.  The entire time was approximately five to seven minutes.  I did not have the time to go inside and get binoculars in order to get a closer view.  I have seen an unusual light at night one other time, but this was by far the rarest and most unusual sighting.  The movement was also strange, as it moved in a very fluid and smooth/high tech manner.  As far as I could tell, it was not emitting sound that I could hear.  I have heard other auditory flying vehicles in the air ! since I sighted it, but I cannot see what craft is emitting that sound.I tried to do a quick research as to weather this could have been a weather balloon, but my immediate response that I&rsquo;ve found seems to be that weather balloons do not emit light.  My background is mostly that I have an interest in many things, but I do have a slight knowledge of ufo subject matter, and I do sometimes listen to coast to coast, and sometimes read on the internet.  I noticed when I went on your website and looked at other sightings that someone in Rancho Cucamonga has written to you, which I find interesting as that is a neighboring city, although we saw two different colors of lights, we did see things in a similar time area.

He claimed to have seen a UFO on two occasions near his home.Incident #1 Date:  Actual date isn&rsquo;t exact though he remembers somewhere in mid January 2009.Time of day: approximately 7PM Location: My cousin was out in the yard playing with his 2 dogs, a golden retriever and a chocolate lab.  He claims that the dogs actually spotted (or heard? or sensed?) the UFO before he did which drew his attention to it.   He spotted a UFO hovering just below the tree line that was shaped like a &ldquo;stretched cube&rdquo; (rectangular block shaped) &ndash; the trees were approx 80-90 ft tall (estimated).  My cousin estimated that the UFO was about 1000 ft away from himself.   The grayish-black (charcoal) colored UFO looked like a &ldquo;square house with rounded corners with lighted square windows all around it on every side except for the top and bottom which had smaller round white lights&rdquo;.  The UFO then came above the tree line and started doing different flipping and turning movements.  He said it didn&rsquo;t look like or act like a plane or a helicopter or anything that we know of or make in the US.  He described the pattern of bright white lights along the windows as going all solid and then flashing very quickly in an ordered sequence one after the other and then back to solid.  The lights on the top also flashed in the same pattern.  He claimed that after the craft went above the tree line that it was &ldquo;watching him&rdquo; and sort of &ldquo;showing off&rdquo; as it did its maneuvers.   He estimated the size of the craft as approximately 30-40 feet long and about 10 ft high.  He mentioned that it spun slowly 3 to 4 times on different axes (Y then X and then like a 45 (or 135) degree angled axis).  He noted that after spinning on one axis that it would very quickly move linearly to another position and then spin slowly on a different axis.  Both dogs were trying to get inside the house when the craft appeared.  They were barking and yipping to get inside the house and didn&rsquo;t appear comfortable around the UFO.  This whole event lasted for about 3-4 minutes.  He didn&rsquo;t hear any sound at all though because his dogs were barking loudly so that pretty much dominated any audio.  However he noted that he didn&rsquo;t hear any loud jet-lane type noises.! He men tioned that while the UFO was in the tree line of pine trees that the branches were shaking and shuttering.  He only watched for 4 minutes and then went inside because it was unnerving.  And after inside the house he looked again quickly and it was gone.  He told his parents who didn&rsquo;t believe him which is why I am penning this for him (Uncle Age 43) Incident #2 Then about 1.5 months later he claimed to have seen it again in the same spot though only for about 30 seconds this time.  The UFO appeared to execute the same maneuvers as described above in the first incident.He drew some pictures that depict the UFO and how it turned axially and also the lights on the side.My cousin gets good grades in school and isn&rsquo;t lying about this.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "cloaking ship  over Yuma, AZOn Monday, March the 16th, 2009 at approximately 2107 hrs. I was sitting on the west side of the place where I live. At that particular time I was watching with my binoculars (20x50) at the night sky when I spotted what looked like a triangular cloud, at least that is what it look when I first saw it. I straighten myself so I could get a better look as I was in uncomfortable position never taking my eyes on the mysterious shape.  The cloud travel at about forty five degrees from the west horizon, from south to north. It sort of looked like the Star Trek Romulian war ships when they are cloaking, sort of blurry trails behind the front cloud  but I could only see the outer edge. I followed this shape until it disappeared in the northern horizon. I want to point out that you could not see this with the naked eye nor did it make any sound. The whole event took about thirty second since I spotted this in the middle of the sky or its trajectory. I also have to confessed that this sight gave me chills and made me a little nervous since I have seen other &ldquo;strange&rdquo; objects before but nothing like this big or weird.At approximately thirty minutes after this event two marine jets took off from the MCAS base  in the direction that the device had taken but instead of  following all the way north the sort of cut in the middle of the sky and continued on an northeasterly direction.I am submitting this report with the hope that there may be someone else that saw this object.", "Chevron shaped craft with dim lights on the botton looked like 3 on each wing. Super quiet.I Was in my backyard playing with a laser pointer with my dog from my hottub and he was chasing it around.  Once in a while I would shine my laser up to the heavens and the moon wondering if anyone out there might be able to see it. I had turned it off and laid back in the water when I sensed something I was already looking up at the stars and a couple of planes that were in the area. They were kind of crisscrossing across the sky, anyway what I sensed or heard was a kind of  a whispering sound like the sound of a small fan or something like that kind of quiet but fright above me then I saw it, it was a craft and it went right over me from south to north it was v shaped kind of like the stealth with three dim lights under each side of the chevron it disappeared from my view right away and I know those planes couldn&apos;t see it. I think they were looking for the sourse of my laser pointer it was weird and I believe they are out there but I never saw anything like this. It was black or real dark grey and very stealth. I was by myself but I swear on my Parents grave I saw it. I&apos;m kind of wondering if I shouldn&apos;t point my laser up the the sky at night anymore.", "Bright white light in the north eastern sky of Claifornia High Desert,changes to small red light , disapears.The UFO that my husband and I witnessed was a bright white light.  We thought it was a planet at first.  We continued to watch it though and it continued to descend slowly downward for about 3 minutes, at about the 4th minute it changed from being large white light to a small red light, and then it shot out towards the Southern desert of Nevada. Our location was the high desert of Southern California.  We were located in Hesperia, CA.", "Two red circular orbs low in night sky.SIGHTING   It was February 26, 2009 sometime around 10:30 - 11:00 P.M. while returning home from Thursday night&rsquo;s class, traveling westbound on hwy 114 approaching the outskirts of Rhome, Texas, that I became aware of two red objects low on the horizon just slightly to the right of the roadway ahead of me.  These two red orbs were pulsing on and off at a rate of about 20 -30 times a minute.  The on to off timing was uniformly equal and pulsing in unison.  The size of the red orbs were slightly smaller than your thumbnail held at arms&rsquo; length and the shape was perfectly circular with a very defined edge, no fuzziness or light diffusion.  The distance between the two orbs was approximately the width of your fist at arms&rsquo; length.  There was some relative motion between the two objects:  the one on the left appeared steady on its course while the one on the right changed its altitude dipping down and then back to its level position.  As I continued driving due west the objects appeared to be drifting to the left or southward and now the roadway was turning slightly northward to a west-north-west heading and the view of the objects were being obstructed by trees.  I thought I would pull over and stop to watch these red orbs and continued forward to have a clearer view now appearing through my side window.  The clear view was now coming up, but before I pulled off to the shoulder there appeared what I would describe as a burst from between and above the plane of the two orbs not unlike a jet going supersonic with its wing producing a shock wave.  I had traveled about a mile in this episode so it was visible to me for about one minute.  I continued onward where the road crosses over the railroad tracks to view southward the moonless night sky but could see no lights or movement there.In review of this event I could not make any determination of the distance, speed, or direction involved or if any sound was made as my car windows were closed.  Looking at a map of the area shows that when I first sighted the object it could have been over Rhome, Aurora or Boyd, or beyond by 100&rsquo;s of miles, or it could have been just beyond the tree line right over hwy 287 just a mile in front of me.  At the time, I thought the direction of travel was southward, but who&rsquo;s to say that I was actually seeing it departing straight away from me (west) on just a slight southward track.  If that were true perhaps those who reside in Newark, Azle, Reno, or Springtown may have seen this occurrence.  I was a passive observer of this non-threatening event and I know of no other witnesses as traffic was very, very light and the only other car well ahead did not stop.", "Finally, I have the courage to speak up.On the above date and time approximately, I and two of my cousins&apos;, one female and one male.  We were returning home to Oglala, South Dakota from Rapid City, South Dakota.  My female cousin was in the front with me and my male cousin was in the back seat. We were driving in a newer model Geo Metro, only about two years old or newer.  About a two or three miles before we got to the junction to start making our south on the tribal road that we were traveling on.  We were traveling through the Badlands on the north-west side of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota coming from the town of Red Shirt Table.  This road is part of the Ellsworth Airforce Bomber Training Run(B1-Bombers and Stealths?). We hear them but when you look they are already gone. They are fast and loud.Anyway, about a few miles before we got to the junction, the radio on the car started to fade in and out, it was weird because the car was new and had was inn great mechanical condition. The needldes on the dash started going all over, like the gas gage looking when the tank was three-quarters full. The motor started to act weird to, like stuttering or startling. The car seemed like it was in the wrong gear and was lugging. I tried to put it in a lower gear and give it gas. But nothing happened. I looked at the radio and the clock read a few minutes before 17:00. Then, that went off too. It was scary, and I tried not to panick as my cousins&apos; were a year or two younger than we, I felt responsible for them as we were out in the middle of nowhere. I tried to stay as calm as I could. It got really bright inside the car. I could see the fibers of the carpet in the car. I could see the dust in the car moving in the air of the car. Things started to go in slow-motion then. Things started to move really slow in the car. I could hear myself breathing, and feel my pulse. We seemed to sort of float or leave the ground. I looked over at my female cousin in the passenger seat and she was screaming to me to go and she was hitting the dash. I looked back at my male cousin and he had his head between his knees&apos; and was screaming too. He was grabbing my shoulder and trying to shake me. It seems like we were playing on slow-motion, time was slow.Then, finally, it seemed like a few seconds later the car slammed down on the road and started back up. It went back into gear, a lower gear and the motor revved up really high. The headlights came back on and so did the radio. I could hear my cousins&apos; now screaming and crying irradically for me to go. The were scared and so was I. It felt like we went over a big bump in the road, because we bounced really hard. I got control on the car and put it into third gear. We picked up speed really quick like we were going that fast already. I just happened to glance at the clock and the one on the radio said 20:30. The radio came on really loud, the light was still above us. I tried to slow down to see what was going on. My cousins&apos; were screaming for me not to stop. The were screaming at me to go fast. I looked up on my side of the window to see what was up there and it hovered above us and kept our speed. The light was so bright, I could see the weeds in the ditch plain as day.Then, just as quickly as it all begin the light went ahead of us about twenty feet and took off, really fast. It was gone. That was a whole hour and a half that was missing, as I kept telling my cousins&apos; to remember the time. They just kept crying and were not talking to me.I was scared and I have never spoken to anyone about this except to my cousins&apos; who get scared when I even mention what happened. I have been having dreams&apos; and weird nightmares&apos;. My female cousin refuses to tell me if she has the same thing going, and my male cousin will not listen to any talk at all about this. They get this look in their eyes&apos; and they actually stand differently body language-wise.We have had people on the reservation talk about these lights&apos; and things that race those bombers&apos; and those other planes&apos; that fly out there. These jets&apos;, bombers, and etc. make their runs at all hours of the day and night. People have experienced things&apos; and seen things&apos; out there in the middle of nowhere. Alot of them refuse to talk about what they have experienced or seen, for fear or rejection or ridicule. I need to talk to this as it is a part of my PTSD(post-tramatic stress disorder) I need to tell somebody and get this out of my head. It feels like somebody is always&apos; watching me, I asked my cousins&apos; and they say the same thing too. That is one of the reasons&apos; that they are afraid to say anything. I&apos;m not afraid, whatever happened changed me and changed my physical body and how I handle diseases, sicknesses, and etc. My cousins&apos; are the same about this too. We feel watched.A few weeks before this about ten miles out of Rapid City I had car trouble, and I saw a big triangle. It was shiny,like gun metal. I thought it was one thing, but another one split off of it and they were floating or hovering or something. They were headed north towards&apos; Rapid City. They came out of the Black Hills&apos; from the west heading towards&apos; were I was in a easterly direction before the turned north. The were quiet, really quiet. I never talked about this either until what had happened to me and my cousins&apos; in the Badlands&apos;. Again, I have never spoken to anyone except my cousins&apos; about all of this. Out of fear that I&apos;m being watched or listened to. I don&apos;t know maybe I&apos;m just paranoid about all this. But thanks for your time. With respect. Thank you reading this.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were going home from a friend&rsquo;s house after watching a show together. The time was approximately 12:30 AM.Almost immediately, I saw two bright orange balls of light in the sky, diagonally north of where we were driving. I yelled for her to pull over. We quickly parked in a parking lot facing the objects, in front of the Towpath Hotel. We jumped out of the car, and at that time, a man in another car pulled into the hotel and parked. We did not get his name, but the three of us watched this phenomenon together. These two objects moved at a very fast rate, independently, in all different directions, around each other, then they suddenly stopped and seemed suspended, parallel to each other. They were large and appeared to be at about the height that a plane would fly when descending.My friend took a picture on her cell phone. After a couple of minutes, the ball on the right very slowly seemed to recede and disappear. After it was completely out of sight, the ball on the left slowly receded, on a parallel path to that of the first one, until it disappeared. The three of us talked about it briefly, with all of us agreeing that they could not have been lights or aircraft that we&rsquo;ve seen before. My friend and I felt thrilled to have witnessed such an event, as we have never had this happen to us before.We both have our masters degrees; I am a fifth grade teacher and my friend is a computer programmer.Last night, we bought the book, The Phoenix Lights, and agreed that what we saw looked exactly like the orbs on the cover.

We heard a jet passing through quietly from the East heading West.  As I looked up I glanced to the North and another passenger jet was on a South East heading when I noticed a white light rushing toward the airliner.  It was about half the size of the plane and it swirled around close to the jet and then shot back to the west.  While moving it had an orangish white color and then it flashed reflecting the sun for second or two very brightly.The object then wobbled back and forth two times and shot off in a northern direction very fast appearing to be all white at that piont.  The sky was very clear and only a few clouds were present.  I have seen video of these craft before on tv and I can say the flight charactoristics were very similar.  At first it seemed like it was playing a game with the passenger jet.  I thought It might have been a bird but I have concluded that it was something very diferent.  Birds don&apos;t reflect the sun the way this thing did and they don&apos;t look orange in color either.

We had just arrived home, and I stepped out of my car to urinate, facing due north. I noticed a yellow-white light, just above the treeline. The trees are fairly close, within a mile, but the object was obviously much farther away and higher in the sky.It moved toward the east at a steady clip, moving from due north to nearly northeast within a matter of  2 minutes. At this point, now in the northeast, it began to ascend. The UFO climbed then disappeared momentarily, for maybe 5 seconds or so, and then reappeared much smaller and still climbing. It had gone from being visible at about the size of a pea, and once it reached it&apos;s highest point it was the size of most noticeable stars in the sky. The light then began to move in all four cardinal directions, always coming back to a central starting spot. There seemed to be no pattern to this.At this point, I called my mother to explain this instance to her. She was able, without my direction, to pick out the point in the sky that I was talking about. She noticed, as we did, that it was a different hue than what the surrounding stars were putting off. The object stayed in the sky at this distant point for about an hour.

Howevre I feel like it is important to report what occurred.I was on my way back to my girlfriends house after her, myself and our two friends went to a local store in Orland Park. She rode with our two friends and I drove by myself.I should mention a little about our background.  I&rsquo;m a student at a local college as is my girlfriend.  My friend is the General Manager of a restaurant and his fianc&eacute;e is a student also.I arrived at her house in Frankfort Square before they did so I waited in my car for them to arrive.  As I was waiting, I received a call from my friend who was driving the car my girlfriend and his fianc&eacute;e were in.  He told me to drive to  St Francis Road and turn east towards Harlem Ave.  He said that there was a huge triangular object in the sky and I should be able to see it.  I immediately did just as he  said and the was a large triangular object in the sky.There were three lights on the object on each point and they appeared to be changing colors from red and blue constantly.  The lights were far enough in the distance that the shape was not clearly visible but when the lights moved, they stayed the same brightness and appeared to be equidistant from each other.  The object appeared at times to be pointing downward and then it would appear to turn and be pointing up or to the side.I told my friend that I saw it and we decided to see how close we could get to it.  We decided to drive south on Harlem to Rt. 30 and head east.  Two other cars appeared to have noticed it as they pulled over and were taking pictures on their phones.  I got out my small video camera and attempted to record the object but it would not appear on my camera.  I kept the camera rolling however to at least capture the audio of our conversation.  My friend called both 911 and NBC5 news to report what we were seeing.My car got  separated from theirs and they got close enough to the object where my girlfriend and my friends fianc&eacute;e were both almost in tears because they were scared.  They followed Rt. 3o to Indiana and when they got to the city of Dyer, IN,  they reported that they had gotten really close to the object and then it disappeared.  By this time I was about 5 miles behind them and I could see the object clearly as a solid triangular object.  However when I got close to it, the object also appeared to just flicker out.I caught up with them in a parking lot in Scherriville, IN where my girlfriend got in the car with me and showed me some pictures she had taken on her phone. Only a single light was visible on all of her photos. As we talked in the parking lot about what had just occurred, my friends fianc&eacute;e said that she &ldquo;got a weird feeling that if we keep going east we will see it again.&rdquo; I looked at her and my friend and said that we should probably head back home because I got a bad feeling about her last statement. However, my friend decide that maybe they should keep going east towards Merriville, IN.Well they decided to keep going east on Rt. 30 and my girlfriend and I decided to head north on Indianapolis Boulevard. We stopped at a bookstore so I could try to relax after what just happened.  About 3 minutes after we had stopped at the bookstore, my friends fianc&eacute;e called my girlfriend crying saying that the object did in face &lsquo;reappear&rsquo; and it looked &ldquo;a lot more menacing.&rdquo; I told my girlfriend that I wanted to talk to my friend so she handed me the phone and I had his fianc&eacute;e put me on the phone with him. He sounded kind of scared and he told me that he yelled at the object and the lights appeared to &ldquo;flare up&rdquo;.  I kept talking to him as I went outside with my girlfriend and we saw the object to the south east.  It appeared that there were one or two aircraft flying in the area of the object. I cannot say if they were commercial or military. I do know they were apparently circling and were flying pretty fast.My girlfriend and I got in my car and we drove south down Indianapolis Boulevard  back to RT. 30 and headed east. I called another one of my friends from Valparaiso, IN to tell him what was going on and to keep a lookout because it appeared to be heading his way as my girlfriend talked to my other friends fianc&eacute;e. They decided to turn around about half way to Merriville, IN. We followed the object to I65 in Merriville where the object vanished.  We went home after that and my girlfriend was talking to my friends fianc&eacute;e on the way home and all she kept saying was that she kept &ldquo;wanting to look up&rdquo;. We did notice that the aircraft that were circling the area were still there as we drove home on I80.The whole event lasted about an hour and a half.  It was first noticed at about 8 :00 PM.", "V- shaped, fast moving formation of dimly lit trianglesMy wife and I were sitting in the hot tub at the time.  We were not drinking or under the influence of anything.  The hot tub was shut off, no music playing.  Just before getting out, I was looking at the southwest corner of the sky and it was completely dark. The stars were very visible to the south.At that time I noticed an objects(s) traveling northwest.  My first impression was a gaggle of geese.  I directed my wife&rsquo;s attention to the UFO and she asked if they were geese.  It was moving way to fast to be any kind of bird(s).It all went by very quickly, but the best way I can describe this object is that it looked like a &ldquo;v&rdquo; formation , with very dimly lit triangles in a very light orange or yellow luminescence. Maybe a total of 8-10 triangles forming a large &quot;v.&quot;  It moved very quickly and there was no noise whatsoever.  In a very short time it faded out of sight.My last thought was maybe it was a military stealth bomber-the flying wing?

I spotted a white colored object, as I peered through my Arnette polarized sunglasses.  The object was between the 10 and 2 o&rsquo;clock position.The object appeared to be about the size of a bright planet at night.  The shape was similar to a large jet.  The object was moving in an easterly direction at a relatively low rate of speed.  The object turned to the northeast and appeared to be ascending when it quickly disappeared.  There was no contrail and no sound from where I stood.  The elapsed time was approximately ten seconds.", "Large triangular craft over Oakley, Kansas - multiple sightingsI was standing outside having a cigarette at 21:30 24 March 2009, and as I have become accustomed to doing I look directly up.  I noticed a large, silent craft in the shape of an equilateral triangle overhead, moving due south.  The craft had three white lights, one at each point of the triangle, which did not flash or blink, and one red light in the center of the triangle which flashed like the light of a &quot;normal&quot; aircraft.The craft was completely silent and left no vapor trail.  Although it made no sound, I could &quot;sense&quot; the craft, as though it were somehow silently moving air or altering the pressure around it, much the way you &quot;sense&quot; a person moving behind you even if you don&apos;t hear them.The craft appeared approximately one-half the size of Orion&apos;s belt on each side.  I am no expert on estimating altitude, but I do not believe it was at commercial aircraft altitude.  My best guess is that the craft was maybe three to five times the size of a large commercial aircraft, assuming it was indeed flying comparatively low.  If it was at a high altitude, based on observations of hundreds of commercial aircraft during both day and night, it would be dozens of times larger than even the largest commercial aircraft that fly over Kansas.I also briefly noticed several (didn&apos;t get a count) flashing lights, alternating between pale blue, green, and red, along the two front edges of the craft.  As it moved over my head, I could no longer see these lights.  This is the fourth time I have seen this particular craft (or others just like it) in the past month or so, but this was the first time I noticed the flashing lights along the front edges.The craft moved at a steady pace without any fluctuation in speed, roughly the observed speed of traditional aircraft.  Again, depending on altitude, it was either moving very fast or extraordinarily slowly.  The two rear white lights were visible for nearly fifteen minutes as it moved out of sight to the south.  In two of the other instances, the craft similarly moved south.  In the other instance, the craft was moving due north as it passed over me, then turned northwest (toward and over Colby, by my estimation) before turning due south and disappearing.During one of the earlier sightings, maybe two weeks prior to the 24 March sighting, I had noticed a number of other odd happenings in the sky, including two very bright lights about five or ten degrees off the southern horizon that flashed on for about two seconds, then slowly dimmed like stadium lights being turned off.  These flashed on and off for about two minutes before disappearing outright.  I also noticed several larger-than-usual aircraft flying due west over a roughly half-hour period on either side of seeing the triangle, these could have been passenger aircraft but they would have had to be flying lower than usual to appear as large as they did.  I was on the phone with a friend during this whole time, and recall relaying to him several oddities that night.  No aircraft followed the triangle, but the other oddities happened in a time frame centered on the triangle flying over.  I remember commenting on the fact that almost all the other aircraft were moving due west, as usually the aircraft at this time (this sighting was right around 20:30, just before the time change) are moving in various directions and are not as highly concentrated.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

At first I thought it might be a tree on fire but I could see the tree line and the orange fire ball was above it.It was 11PM.  So next I could not write it off as the sun and have never seen the moon this bright and orange so  I determined it was a ball of fire.It was still visible when I got home which was about five minutes north of Elkhorn.  I awoke my husband and we looked out the window at it and another smaller ball of fire appeared.  After a few more minutes it just disappeared.  I don&lsquo;t remember the month or the year but it was in the late 70&lsquo;s.We called Janesville police and they suggested that they had got other calls but would not comment.The next day at work I was dying to tell somebody and when I did, a few others had seen it too.   A mother and her daughter claimed a flying object buzzed their car when they were traveling to Janesville on their way home.Then the next day, the mother and daughter brought in a paper article that there were multiple reports of  UFO sightings the night   I had seen the orange balls of fire.  If anyone has this article from the Janesville paper, I would love to see it.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Three pulses of dim yellow light that grew rapidly in intensity, dimmed rapidly then reappeared very close to the preceeding pulse within a half second before the first light had dimmed fully like 3 lights from the same object just happening at different intervals. Same three pulses happened further down the coast within 15 seconds and further out to sea, estimate distance travelled in the 15 seconds was 5 miles.  That was the last sighting.  All who viewed the lights were around 45 to 50.  The reason for the report is the pulses of light were unusual and everyone noticed how unusual they were.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The objects were turning very slowly in one place.  They were changing various colors such as red, orange,yellow, white, and blue. One of the objects faded and disappeared in a blink of an eye.  The other object moved very fast to the west and headed toward us. As it past over it made no sound. Soon after we went inside we came back to find 3 other bright multicolored lights in about the same place as the others.  This time the objects turned the same colors but one stayed white.  They were in a triangular shape while flying and soon broke off quickly into different directions.  As they broke off one went to the side and stopped turning colors then vanished for 10 seconds and came back.  The next one went the opposite way that it started and stayed turning colors.  The one that stayed all white went to the south side for a couple minutes then started heading toward us again.  All of these made no noise and soon dimmed into the night.  After about 30 minutes we went back to look again and there was nothing.   It was all clear except one tiny little star.

His initials are PD.  This is real not a hoax.  I described what I saw as a flash and you want more detail-ok.  As i was driving south bound on the 605 south coming from santa anita- I was probably near passing Duarte.  As I was driving south bound i looked up just below my blue tint of my wind shield.  I seen this glow-it looked like a flash not the speed but the color.  Its shape i would say like a parallagram or like a diamond a smashed diamond- thats the closest i can say because it was bright in a sense that I could not make out the exact form.  As i was looking at it I thought it to be a reflection of a commercial planes wings to the sun, but I did not see any plane after- I repeat-I did not see any plane-planes are not that fast as we see them flying from the ground.  I am looking at this UFO for about 6 seconds or so then I reach for my cell phone.  My cell was in my center console-so I looked down just briefly maybe 3 seconds i get it then I looked up the flash was gone so I am continuing looking for a commercial airplane- as I thought it was a reflection from the sun to its wings.  No plane in sight.  I called my mom and told her because i freaked out- I was gonna tell her what I was seeing and I did.  Then when I happened to look up after i got my cellphone it was gone.  Yes-I seen a UFO.  I will never forget that.  It looked like a smashed diamond the color was-well look at flash from a camera that was the color.  It was still-it was not moving it was still.  I cannot give an estimate in feet but like i said - I thought it might be a reflection of a commercial airline to the sun, but it was not.

Upon getting closer to the object, I was able to see the object in greater detail. The object was around 600 to 700ft. high and was hovering at the time. It was now 7:52am. The object was about 100 to 150ft in Length and appeared to be about 40ft in Width. The object was rectangular in shape and had 2 black colored areas on both sides of it that were about 5 to 7 ft long. In the middle of the object, I could see a long opening/slit than span between the black sides. Right above the opening/slit, there was a Pulsating Amber Colored Light. I observed the object until approx. 7:55 and it appeared to just be hovering over an open area to the west of us. While rounding a curve, I lost sight of the object as it went behind some trees.Second Sighting  At approx. 7:57am I was able to regain site of the object and it was now moving more in a WNW direction. Then, all of a sudden, it began to bank/turn towards the North and this is when I could see just how massive the object was. At this time, the Amber Colored Light on the rear of it was no longer Pulsating, it was a Solid Amber Light. While the object continued to bank to the right, I was able to see the top of it. The Top of the object was Metallic in color in the rear and front sections  The rear of the top section was rectangular and had a pattern on it that resembled mosaic tiles. The middle of the top section was completely round and Metallic looking with Dark Grey Lines covering the entire circle. The front of the top section was also rectangular in shape and had a mosaic looking pattern on it as well. I noticed a Triangle shape on the very tip of the front of the object and it had what appeared to be a metal pipe that was angled toward the ground. The object remained at least a &frac12; to &frac14; mile from us the entire time.Shocking Ending just before losing sight of Object  The time now is somewhere between 7:59 and 8:00am. The object has completed its turn and all of a sudden, the object splits into 3 Orb shaped objects and appears to be attempting to fly in formation similar to how jets would fly. All 3 objects are black in color and have some how reduced in size. Although now split into 3, the object in the front of the formation still has the triangular shape on the tip of it along with what appeared to be a metal looking pipe pointing toward the ground. I was only able to keep my eye on the object for about 45 seconds due to traffic in the area around the school.", "Three minutes hovering silent, orange-red fireball 10 feet across 400 feet high and the vanishedI was 11 years old  it was a warm summer night while riding my bike on a dark lane when I saw over a half mile long field an orange red fireball hovering in the sky.  I stared at it for about one minute or so. It never moved side to side, up or down, never changed in size or intensity of brightness or color.  It was over the golf course maybe 400 feet up and seemed to be 5 to 10 feet across.  At this time I dropped my stingray climbed under the fence.  I ran through the knee high grass as fast as I could toward the fireball for maybe 60 yards and stopped to look at it.  The ball was still there, so huffing and puffing I continued my pursuit at the thing.  Now I ran maybe another 50 yards again stopped to look up at it and it was gone.

I noticed a couple of bright, yet discernible,lights moving from a NW to SE direction.  Often times I have seen Jetliners moving at a recognizable pattern involving a straight line flight or satellite movement which are very high above normal commercial aircraft flight patterns.  This was during spring break so my two children were at home and outside with me at the time,in fact, my oldest was the first to spot the bright approaching lights and coined the term &quot;Space wars&quot; after the event.The leading craft was moving much faster than a normal high flying jetliner and was moving in a 30 degree zig-zag as if it was &quot;swimming&quot; (best way I can describe it) and it suddenly passed another very bright and stationary object.  Then, For the lack of a better description, it &quot;dematerialized&quot; and faded away after it passed the stationary object.  Once passed and it was no longer visible,immediately in a split second, it seemed as if another craft equally as bright with a streak trailing, shot/zipped past where first craft had been headed ,  As if it was attempting to intercept the first crafts position in one of it&apos;s zig-zag motions.It honestly looked like something was attempting to shoot it down and was making a &quot;leading shot&quot; just as if you would if you were shooting a fast moving object.However,instead of hitting the first object by anticipating it&apos;s location,  The first object had disappeared leaving whatever it was that was attempting to intercept it shooting off into the distance with a big bright streak behind it. Then the stationary craft illuminated very,very brightly and shot off into the distance.I have never seen anything like it in all my life. My daughter kept saying, &quot;They are shooting at each other&quot; over and over again until it woke my wife who was sleeping upstairs on the other side of the house she was so loud. My son, Who is 6 was there to he ran inside to grab is toy gun and a set of cheap tasco binoculars.20 minutes later there were several fast moving aircraft all over the place at about half the altitude of these objects.

The night sky is unlike anywhere else I have ever seen up there because we were so far away from lights.I noticed a point of light, which at first just looked like another star (a relatively bright one) moving across the sky from right to left. When I looked closer I could see that the object wasn&rsquo;t exactly round like a star but rather kind of elongated, like an oval or very short cylinder. Think of it this way: I will compare a normal star that is circular in shape to a BB (like a BB Gun BB), but smaller, and this object was similar to a grain of rice. The overall size difference wasn&rsquo;t great but I could definitely tell that this thing had a long side and a short side, although it was very minute.After seeing this thing moving I got my friend to look at it too. He saw it moving and said how unusual it looked. After about 10 or 15 seconds the object got much brighter instantly and within a few seconds disappeared completely.This was not a shooting star because it was going much slower than that. I think it could be a satellite because I have read that they have been seen to brighten when they hit a certain sun angle and can also disappear when sunlight is no longer reflecting from them. However, it seemed like once we started talking to each other about how odd this thing was an what it could be, that&rsquo;s when it got very bright and then disappeared like it knew that we were aware of it.I wonder if anyone else has had this kind of sighting.

It was circular and yellow/orange in color, with a bright center and slightly dimmer radius.  At first I thought it was a meteor, but it was moving slower than that and appeared larger and less bright.  Its speed was very consistent, and was becoming more dim as it moved from south to north.  I didn&apos;t think any of this was particularly unusual until it INSTANTLY changed direction, almost but not quite 90 degrees to its original path.  It continued in this direction and became more and more dim until it faded completely from view.  At one point it was obstructed by a bush in the yard, so I ruled out some kind of hallucination / visual artifact.  There was no sound accompanying the object.

I was only able to see it for a few seconds before it went behind a tree line.  The sun reflecting off of it burnt the retina of my eyes from being so reflective.  Someone else I know has seen it on two separate occasions, where when they saw it during the night time it flew past some trees and the next day when they went back to the same location the trees were burnt around where it was at.

I said to both my brother&apos;s look look what is it?  Nobody knew, so I told my brother to pull over to the shoulder of the road and he did hesitantly.  The car was still running and in park, as the object go closer he said I am leaving, and  I said no I want to see what this is, I than grabbed the keys out of the ignition put them in my hand, got out of the car and sat on the hood of the car while this object came closer and closer.  It was oval shaped, no lights, but a very bright white glow that did not hurt your eyes.  By this time it was moving right over the front of the car at a very slow rate of speed, and was absolutely quiet.  I would estimate the object was about 100 feet in diameter and it nearly directly over us and I could hear my brother saying lets get out of here.  My response to him was why if they wanted to do anything to us we couldn&apos;t do anything about it anyway. So while I was sitting on the hood looking at this thing I had a really weird feeling that they knew everything about me.  It&apos;s hard to explain.

On this particular night, we had been sitting outside approximately 30 minutes, when we saw a light passing from south to north at a speed that I estimate 20 to 25 times faster than the airliners flying overhead.  I said to my wife and children that obviously this was a satellite because there were no jets that I knew of that could fly at this rate of speed.  Also, we heard no sound and didn&rsquo;t see any navigation lights. Anyway,  as I was telling my family what I thought this light was, it came to a complete stop right above our heads for a split second, then  made a right angle turn to the east at a speed as great  or greater than we observed  before it stopped.  Then we observed the unidentified object disappear into the eastern sky.The object we saw was a white light, not particularly bright or large. However, the rate of speed this object was traveling is what caught my attention initially.I was a Georgia state trooper for over twenty years, and my last seven years on the patrol, I flew helicopters and airplanes.  I retired because of a physical disability with full benefits. My wife is a mortgage bank officer and my children are 9 and 12 yrs old.The date I am giving is an approximate date because at the time I had decided not to report this to your agency.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a weird whirling noise, looking outside to investigate, nothing.. at all moving, not even a newspaper on the floor, just that noise, in a earlier incident I thought I saw a black object, however passed it off as a figment of my imagination.While at someones house, a similar noise happened, the previous Wednesday, however in this case the house had several back outs, for apparently no reason.", "Bright light ball seen over Ballard extraordinary  speed.I was in my room looking out of the window northwards when I saw a very bright (yellowish gold) round object (bigger than a star but about an eighth the size of the moon) traveling in front of the clouds shoot from the west at an upwards angle towards the east and disappear (not behind the clouds from what I saw).It was too fast for any commercial aircraft and was certainly not Venus.

The lights were much larger than any star and I would compare the total width of the 3 lights in a row to that of a full moon that is just rising up. (When the moon is brighter orange and appears to sit just above tree top levels.)  I watched the bright amber lights rotate towards the north, (my left facing east) and witnessed another complete set of 3 amber lights, with the rotation the lights appeared to stay within the same proximity of one another and also appeared to be what I would say part of the same &ldquo;craft&rdquo;, being the one set of lights rotated around out of my sight and another set appeared.I witnessed the bright amber lights for approximately 15 seconds, and just as the lights had rotated I witnessed 3 or 4 smaller white lights, what would appear the size of a star in the sky, these white lights were moving around very erratically in the same general area of the amber lights.After contacting the National UFO Reporting Center, I contacted the local law enforcement and was informed by the deputy sheriff that he had also witnessed the same lights as well as another witness that was in his squad car at the time.  The sheriff&rsquo;s location at the time of the sighting was approximately 12-17 miles east north east of my location, and he witnessed the lights to the west of his location.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be both sincere, and sober-minded.  PD))", "An object that ommitted a very bright light, almost looked like it had three lights on itI was driving with my finance and son in the car towards property his grandparents owned.  He had a trailer on the property and we needed some stuff from.  On our way to the dirt road to get to the property I noticed a big bright object below the moon.  I didn&rsquo;t want time seem weird but it stood out more so, but I thought it was just maybe Venus because it was normal to see Venus kind of big during this time of year.  It was brighter then Venus though and looked like it had three lights from it since it was giving off a very bright glow.  It still has my attention though and I keep my eyes on it, since it looked out of the ordinary and I was just trying to reason with myself. When we got up to the piece of property, my fianc&eacute; got out of the car to get to the trailer.  I was still watching this object trying to figure out why it was so bright. Then it started to move side to side, up and down, even looked like circles. I was alarmed since I was trying to figure out if I was out of my mind. I tried to debunk it too, but I was seeing planes in the distance flying and I could tell it was a plane too. But I could not tell this was a plane, it started to get closer then further away and it looked like it was flying at an angle to the left and tilted. It was weird. I told my fianc&eacute; when he came back to the car to sit in the driver passenger seat and look at this. He asked me, &ldquo;Look at what?&rdquo; and I replied, &ldquo;Just come look.&rdquo; He sits down and I point at the object and tell him to look. I asked him if I was the only one seeing this and he told me, &ldquo;No, you are not. I can see it moving weirdly.&rdquo; He left for a second trip and I told him to hurry since I was still alarmed. The object was still moving in a weird fashion and went out further in distance. It was still in the far distance and looked like it was searching for something. But we left at about 8:30pm and it was still in the far distance, when we hit the main canyon road we could not see it anymore.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD))", "Three bright lights illuminating from behind clouds darting in irregular patterns at very high speed... also hovering and circling.My neighbor came over to ask if I had noticed the unusual lights. We went out on the deck and watched for about 30-45 minutes. Three oval lights moving at a high speed were hovering, randomly darting, and going in circles. We considered some kind of advertising beams, but found the overall patterns to be very fast and random, not mechanical. Lights appeared in the northern sky over a residential part of the city. We reported it to 911. My neighbor who used to work for the military thought suggested some sort of reconnaisance mission. She is in her 40&apos;s and I am in my mid-50&apos;s. Neither of us had ever seen anything like it before.", "An apparent star in the night sky which exhibited anomalous behaviorI had this experience as an 11 or 12 year old child, but I have always remembered it precisely.  I have long thought that I should submit a record of this to someone who would add it to the data on this topic, and I am finally doing it.Let me preface by saying that through the years, I have observed several objects that people who were with me at the time thought were UFO&rsquo;s, but I knew they weren&rsquo;t because I knew what they were.  One was a weather balloon, one a jetliner near the airport (when they have their landing light on at sunset, it is a striking sight), one a meteor close enough to hear the roar and light up the night sky and one a military missile in an inexplicable location.  However, the one sighting I can&rsquo;t explain was the least visually striking.  I say all this to demonstrate that I have a decent amount of knowledge in explaining explainable sightings.One soft summer night which I believe was 1963, but may possibly have been 1962, my father, my three sisters and I went out on the patio to watch the Perseid meteor shower.  It was sometime in August.  We had a rollaway bed out there, and we all lay down on it sideways and side by side with each other.  We scanned the sky for shooting stars, which appeared at the rate of about one per minute.One of my sisters said, &ldquo;look, two stars are colliding!&rdquo;  We all looked where she indicated, and indeed, you could see two stars moving toward each other.  As we watched, they did, in fact, meet and merge into one, only to separate again after a few seconds.  After that, everyone else went back to looking for shooting stars, but I kept observing this phenomenon.  After a couple of minutes, I realized that only one of the two stars was in motion.  It kept moving on its steady path, and I kept watching.My first thought was that it was a satellite.  Some months earlier, forewarned by a news broadcast, we had gone out to watch one of the early manmade satellites pass overhead.  It looked just like a moving star.  I suppose it reflected light from the sun, which enabled us to see it.  It had a steady progression across the sky and kept a fairly steady level of brightness.  After ten minutes or so, I realized it couldn&rsquo;t be an orbiting satellite.  I noticed its apparent path across the sky was noticeably slowing.  I kept watching, and the next thing I noticed was that it was dimming.  I kept watching for perhaps half an hour, and it gradually slowed until it was essentially motionless in the sky, and it gradually dimmed until finally, it slowly became impossible to make out.  At first sight, it had the appearance of a medium to medium bright star.It was clearly not a satellite or a meteor.  The only scenario I&rsquo;ve ever been able to think of that matches my observation is that of a space ship in the process of leaving Earth&rsquo;s orbit.  In 1963, we had no space ships which left Earth&rsquo;s orbit.  What I saw was truly an unexplained flying object.I would be glad to answer any questions concerning this.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "3 objects one flared up. GR MIMyself, my girlfriend, sister in law, and her friend, were standing in our back yard chattin. I was lookin skyward wen i saw a object comparable with the stars. It was headin N-NE. Since it moved so fast i said look at that, everyon looked and found the object, we chatted bout satellites for a few seconds, when the whole thing flared up. It was so bright that it looked like it grew bout ten sizes larger for 3-5 seconds, then it went back to the normal tone. It never varied its heading this whole time. We could see it for prolly another three to four minutes before it covered the other half of our horizon an went outve view. As you could expect everyone was excited an watching the sky. Prolly 5 minutes later someone pointed out two more objects flyin close together from the east. We watched one object turn from headin NW (mostly west) along with the other an switch to N-NE. It seemed to follow the first object we seen, there direction mostly N by a lil NE. They both followed the restve of there headings true  till they crossed the horizons an disapeared. One that switched seemed to increase speed an dissapeared a few minutes faster then the one headed NW. Both outve site in round 5 minutes.", "Bright orange lights were seen, at one point forming a triangle in the sky.My husband and I witnessed a bright orange light in the sky which slowly disappeared.  Another one appeared in the same area and also slowly disappeared.  Three more lights appeared in the shape of a triangle, one by one they seemed to fade out.  We managed to capture the next light on film, this one split into two.  One half remained stationary while the other seemed to fall to the ground.  We witnessed two more lights after that.  The sky flashed throughout all of this and for a while after all of the lights were gone.  It looked like heat lightning.", "Crescent shaped object gliding soundlessly overhead through sunny skiesI was in the parking lot of my health club, walking from my car to the club door. I climb mountains a lot &ndash; the Cascades are only 30 minutes due east of my house. My instinctive habit is to look up to check the clouds for possible upcoming weather changes. I looked up and noted it was sunny but slightly hazy, with some high clouds to the southwest.Almost immediately after noting the weather I saw a black object gliding from my left to right, which was southeast to northwest. It was about 2/3 of the way up from the horizon to the zenith; I had to tilt my head back to view it. It appeared black in color, but due to the background of a bright light blue sky black may have simply been the default color not the real one. The apparent size of the object was approximately 1 centimeter at my arm&rsquo;s length.It was shaped like a crescent with end points that extended slightly farther than a classic crescent, to where the points of the two ends started curving into a slight &ldquo;C&rdquo; shape. I was tempted to originally say batwing shaped, but it was actually more like a slightly extended crescent. It was thickest up front, then gradually tapered in thickness toward the end points of the crescent. I saw no protrusions anywhere along the object, so the outline of the object appeared as a smooth curve with pointed ends. It made no sound.For about 3 minutes it went relatively slowly in a perfectly straight line on the original southeast-northwest course. As an idea of its speed, it was about half the apparent speed of a commercial airliner flying overhead on its way to land at SeaTac Airport, which was about 30 miles from my viewpoint. 3 commercial airliners cruised through the sky descending for landing while I watched the object. By comparison it appeared to me that the object was smaller in size and lower in altitude than the airliners. For some reason I got the impression that the object was about half the size of the airliners. However if the object was bigger than an airliner its true altitude would have been higher.After about 3 minutes the object turned smoothly to its left. It now traveled on a nearly due west course in a straight line. Its speed did not change. The turn was not 90 degrees like a classic UFO description, nor was it a long curved turn as I would expect from a plane or a bird. It was a small, tight little curve as it turned. Maybe an 80-degree turn.The object continued west at the same speed in a straight line for about a minute, then did another small, tight little curve to its left that put it on a nearly due south course. Again it moved in a straight line at the same speed. It continued on this southerly course until I lost it in the distance after about 2 more minutes.During each turn I observed no apparent tilt. The object&rsquo;s appearance remained exactly the same during the turns. The object&apos;s speed remained constant from the beginning to the end of the sighting.I see military and civilian fixed wing aircraft and helicopters on a somewhat regular basis in my area. This was not one. It did not appear to be a bird either flapping its wings or gliding. I spend about 30 days a year in the wilderness and I see many hawks and other birds gliding through the air. At Lake Sammamish, a mile from my home, bald eagles nest and I see them gliding through the air fairly often as well. Their wings are always extended in a roughly straight angle as they glide. There is no crescent shape to their appearance. When a bird turns, I see the tilt in the direction of its turn and I see a relatively wide curve as it turns.The object I saw was not in the shape of a bird or an aircraft. The turns it made showed no visible tilt, and the turns were much tighter than those of a bird or aircraft. The object&rsquo;s appearance was simple enough that I drew a rough example as it appeared to me and I will mail it to the National UFO Reporting Center. I will also send a map pinpointing my location as I viewed it.My background: I am a lawyer and a lobbyist, a father of two, an avid mountain climber, and an amateur astronomer. I am 43 years old.", "Jets take off toward the north then orange lights glow in succession repeatedly.While sitting on the balcony of my apartment We saw and heard 2 jets take off from Nellis Air Force Base( less than a mile from my home)The jets shot off towards the north mountain range and were gone. A few seconds later my wife and I were looking to see the jets and saw 2 bright orange circular lights flash on then off, then one on then off slowly, then the other on, then off slowly. We watched to see if we could see what it was and quite a ways to the left saw another orange light, same type, turn on then slowly off, then next to it another on, then slowly off, then again, and one more time, then they were gone. The second time there were 4 in a row. We then saw what appeared to be the jets circling as if the were searching for  the lights. Two or three jets appeared to be circling in the distance above the northern mountains of the las vegas valley.", "A Whitish/Orange Light in the sky made no sound as it traveled overhead.I don&apos;t know if anyone has reported this or not.Wednesday Feb. 25, 2009 I live in Ridgely, MD (Eastern Shore)  On the way home from my 2 daughters&apos; dance class (8:25 PM), we saw a strange light in the sky.At first it didn&apos;t seem to be moving.  I pulled into the drive way and stopped about halfway down, opened the window, and turned down the radio to see if I could hear anything.  I could not hear any sounds other than the car engine.I parked the car and we went inside. I pulled out my Binoculars, went to the back porch and proceeded to watch the object.There were no visible flashing lights on the object.  It was a very bright whitish/orange and traveling at a steady speed in a North/Northwesterly direction.I observed aircraft pass over my house and in the distance, all with the telltale flashing lights. This object was considerably brighter than any light on an aircraft.  Too contrast, I witnessed an airplane pass under the object, in relationship to the horizon, and could easily see the flashing lights.I went inside and brought out our telescope to get a closer look at the object.I could not make out any visible edges, only light. The object seemed to pulse but never left it&apos;s course.My youngest daughter and I watched it until it vanished over the horizon.As a clarification: We live on one of the flight paths used by Dover AFB.We have seen combat helicopters, regular helicopters, Chinooks, A-10s, F-16s, and C130s pass over. Growing up, I lived near Andrews AFB, and we have a small airfield on the outside of town (about 4 miles from me) and Easton airport to the south, So I have a lot of experience with identifying aircraft.What we saw on Wednesday night wasn&apos;t anything I have ever seen before.I wish I had had the foresight to bring out a camera, but I wanted to identify the object first.

An hour later, I went outside to go to the grocery store. I passed the spot from where we observed the flare, stopped, and looked up. I saw a straight line of about 5-7 dimly lit objects moving through the sky, first appearing at about altitude 30 degrees and azimuth 6 degrees. It appeared to me that the objects did not emit light on their own but were reflecting light from the sun below the horizon. They moved about twice the speed of the satellite we had seen earlier. There seemed to be a bit of haze surrounding the group. They were almost pinpoint sized objects, dim yellow color (which makes me think it was reflected sunlight) and as they approached about azimuth 0 degrees, they changed formation from a straight line to a cluster. The rearmost objects caught up with the foremost objects to make this cluster. As the group continued across the sky, they disappeared at about azimuth 310, which appeared to me that the objects moved into the shadow of the Earth and could no longer be seen. The objects made no sound and seemed to be very high above the Earth and moving at incredible speed.

It was several miles to the west, hovering high in the sky. I noticed it because it was hovering atop a darker image. The darker image was a tall row of trees that sit to the west of the house, about a quarter mile away.  The object was a considerable distance away, yet visible.I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it because I thought it was a star at first.  I was watching a movie with my son, and my peripheral vision caught it yet again, minutes later. It was now hovering slightly lower. I thought again that I was making this up, when I would glance at the television, and minutes later I noticed it was now only visible through the tree limbs.  I asked my son to take a look, noting where to look and asked him to tell me what he saw. He said he saw a silver light, sometimes flashing and sometimes not.  There was no sunlight at this time, so it could not have been a reflection of light off of some craft like a plane, or blimp, etc.We went outside and looked with the binoculars to get a closer look. This was now some 20 minutes from the 1st notice of this object.  As we looked with our own eyes, and then with the binoculars, we noticed it wasn&rsquo;t a star. Now, we had a few stars out so that we could make a comparison.The object was probably 10+miles off to the west, near the city of Tampico.

The light appeared to be shifting colors slightly from white light to very slow flashes of very faint red. It was located somewhat low on the horizon at about a 30-35 degree angle.  It was not a hovering helicopter, as I heard no noise and it was completely stationary, with no bobbing or shifting of its position whatsoever.

Sky was clear, except for a few very high thin with several light lines of these high clouds, moving from the Southwest to Northeast. I kept looking for it for about 15 minutes no where&rsquo;s to be seen. It had it&rsquo;s mirrored, shiny, aluminum bright body, opposite the Sun, which was also about 80 degrees, up in sky.

As I observed it, trying to see its flap position as I always do, I noticed a white object that at first I thought had fallen off the plane. It slid to the rear of the plane, and then began to rise in altitude. I kept my eye on it to figure out if it was a weather balloon.  The object then began to pass directly overhead, at such an angle that I could still view it out of the side window (slightly to the east of perpendicular). I then spotted 5 more small circular shapes with a weird shadowy look, in + configuration, and one dead center.  The 6th object was then out of formation and slightly to the north of the formation. When all the objects were directly overhead, they were hazy, and not quite &quot;white&quot;.", "Bright Red-Orange-White Ball of Light in Cuernavaca, MexicoWhile at a bar in Cuernavaca, Mexico, which is south of Mexico City, the bar owner told my wife and I and her sister and friend who were sitting at the back of the bar that the people sitting out front saw something in the sky.  When we got outside, there was one glowing red-orange-white orb of flashing light in the distance.  There seemed to be a large hill in the distance and the orb was maybe a few hundred feet above the hill, but it was hard to tell.  It was perfectly stationary for the minute or so it stayed there.The surprising thing was that the people outside said they saw it speed across the sky very quickly to it&apos;s current position and just stop there.  This is where and when we saw the light, which was glowing like a disco ball, but flashing a thousand times faster and much brighter.  We did not see it fly across the sky, but if I had I would have been even more astounded.  I had never seen anything like this before in my life until the summer 2008 when I saw something very similar in Croatia over the Adriatic Sea, amazingly about 30 seconds after I told this story about the Mexico sighting to my sister and cousins in Croatia.  I will post that one as well.After about one minute, the object slowly dimmed over about a period of 30 seconds and was gone.  The children of the family we were staying with said they have seen orbs of light over the trees in their backyard while they played golf there.  The father said that near or in Cuernavaca there is a hill or mountain where many &quot;hippies&quot; come to visit because of all the strange lights, orbs, etc, and that the Mayans and Aztecs both thought this hill was of special importance.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They picked up a little girl who was hysterical, she said an object bigger than the bus was above the pond across the road from her house. When the bus came up over the hill, the object began to ascend.  The bus driver and all the kids on board exited the bus and saw the object. It was cigar shaped with three lights. Mom says it was silver.  It was still rising then the three lights separated and shot off into different directions. When they arrived at school, no one believed the bus driver or any of the students.  Mom saw this same little girl now an adult years later and asked if she remembered the event and she said she did and would never forget it. There is some confusion as to if the object rose from the pond.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Then my neighbors wife and I observed one which was just screaming across the sky (same size as the others)  This was no plane which we see a lot of up here in the mountains. We watched it for 30 seconds and in that length of time it had traveled half way across the sky  Then it just blinked out?  Satellites just dont blink out!

The same flash of light was seen south of the Leo constellation between the star Regulus and the planet Saturn, observing with binoculars the light is closer to Regulas (about 2/3 of the way) but about 4 degrees to the south perpendicular to a line drawn between Saturn and Regulus, it is hard to determine whether the light moves during the observation period but appears to be farther north than two days earlier but less than 1-2 degrees.  For the last three nights it has been observed at a 15 minute earlier time in the evening.  The light flashes with a period of 60 seconds and only lasts for 10-15 minutes. It is possibly a satellite but is unusual in that it has very little motion across the sky and is at a very high azimuth from the horizon (approx 80 degrees), I would expect to see geosynchronous satellites at about 30 degrees azimuth from the horizon at this latitude.  I will try observing again tonight but it will probably be too light out at 7:15-7:30 local if the pattern continues of earlier nightly observations.", "several objects spotted over Tavistock, Devon, UK1.

At this point i was so engrossed in this phenomenon that i did not have time to take a picture or record a video.  It actually looked like it was landing on the building as it was lower than the height helicopters fly at.  As it disappeared from view several other random people witnessed it too. To my amazement we all said the same thing to each other &apos;did you just see that?&apos;  I ran round the other side of the building to see if i could see anything on the roof but it was gone and couldn&apos;t be seen in the sky either.

Me and my cousin were on my terrace on the 1st floor. It had just become dark and we were chatting enjoying the cool air when I happened to look up (I like to look up at the sky a lot) and saw this huge light. I say huge because no star, meteorite, satellite, planet etc is that big and bright as this object was. It was around 4-5 times the size of Venus as seen with the naked eye. My first thought was &quot;it&apos;s a plane&quot;. But then I thought planes didn&apos;t fly that low (it was pretty low for an aircraft) and also planes weren&apos;t circular in shape and I had never seen a plane with lights that huge. The object was seen as a huge circular light slowly gliding through the night sky heading towards the north. Me and my cousin rushed to the 2nd floor terrace to get a better view of the object and followed it until it was lost from our sight. I hadn&apos;t noticed it at first but my cousin pointed out a circular cone of light extending down from the circular object. After seeing that circular cone of light pointing downwards I was pretty sure this thing was not something made by man. Up to that point I had entertained the thought that this might be some type of secret military aircraft. Also I forgot to mention that the object made absolutely no sound at all.

They would move left or right and sometimes drop altitude then ascend again, then hover in one position and fade out, then flair up again, and it started the sequence all over again.They looked like they would sometimes form a pattern. For example, two of the lights got into a straight line, but with some distance between them. Then they both moved away from each other, and then eventually faded away. Many of them did this randomly all around us, but mostly just in pairs. We saw a few of them seem like it dropped another light (aircraft) from under it.

Group of objects seen in pursuit of object.Three unexplained events experienced March 28th 2009  The First Event  It was a very late Saturday night, Sunday early morning at 2:00am. After staying up late to watch a few movies we decided to step out on our apt patio to get some fresh air to be alone and look up at the stars. Our 3 yr old son lay tucked away in bed sleeping. It was unusually very windy earlier that day but although an amazingly clear and calm night. We sat there on the patio for a bit, maybe 15 min. I noticed a shooting star off to my left that shot from right to left downward diagonally. As I tugged at my husband I was able to catch the tail end of it as it fizzled out across the sky.  We both in fun, made a wish and then looked back up. I said to my husband looking up, &ldquo; It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense, that there wouldn&rsquo;t be more out there, it&rsquo;s just so beautiful.&rdquo;  As I looked at him I watched as he pointed up to the sky but totally away from where we were looking before. He said, &ldquo; Oh my God&rdquo;. I looked up and was completely frozen solid. I could not believe my own eyes. We both were stunned. We saw a silvery pearl colored spherical shape in the sky that glistened. If you&rsquo;ve ever looked at the North Star it looked just like that, but a bit larger, maybe the size or thickness around as the pencil lead inside a pencil. We definitely did not notice this being there before on account of how bright it was and my husband and I noticing it so immediately.It seemed to reflect the moonlight, which was to our left in the sky. The object just sat there. It then quickly shot off in a diagonal direction to our left over our building out of view, but something weird happened. It had made no sound, left no trail, and sped up at first, then almost slowed down to a stop and then shot off very quickly again, shooting out a bit slowing down and then shooting out a bit again like it may have been in trouble or something. This could definitely not been a shooting star or a piece of debris coming in from space. It quickly traveled until it was blocked from view because of our patio roof, as we are located on the second floor.  We felt a rush of adrenalin come over us as we both practically jumped in each other&rsquo;s arms in amazement to what we had just seen. We were so excited we actually yelled out in excitement.This 1st experience lasted maybe about 10-12 seconds from the time we spotted it until it was gone from view.The Second Event  We both immediately redirected our view back to the sky and saw 5 more of these same objects out in the distance. At first they seemed to just be bright stars but as we kept looking we could see them moving strangely. Each flashed very brightly for just a second as they approached after seeming to drop noticeably in the sky. At first these objects were very far away in the distance and in seconds were flying right over top of us in the same direction as the other one had gone. We noticed they were moving much faster and even more rapidly than the first. These as well made no sound. Their movement was much more fluid as they flew in and out of one another, one coming close to even hitting another but then formed up in a random group, in a formation but not. As they passed overhead most noticeably we pointed out one in particular moving just like the first one we had seen earlier. One would shoot out faster like the movements of the first one out in front and then reform back into their clustered formation. It was apparent their clustered formation and randomness were obviously patterned as if to match the randomness of the sky and its stars. At a glance you would not notice them for it not for the moonlight reflecting off of them. It seemed as though one wanted to move out faster ahead but then would have to adjust its speed back to the groups, as the main group stayed one constant speed.This 2nd experience lasted maybe about 12-15 seconds until they were out of view.Again, we yelled out and even jumped up and down a bit as our excitement for a second had got the better of us. This had been the most amazing thing we had ever seen together aside from our son being born it was that exciting. What we saw was unlike anything we had ever seen before in the skies and did not resemble anything natural or man made. The speeds most notably were to sporadic and fast to be changing speed and direction like they did. We sat there for a bit more, like 10-15 minutes, rambling back and forth to each other like excited little kids. Our neighbor in the building to our right and across from us came out to see what was going on, after hearing us and we stated that we had just seen the most amazing thing.That&rsquo;s when we experienced something so amazing; it would forever change all of our lives.The Third Event  We apologized to our neighbor for being loud and disturbing him. He said it was no problem. As we turned to walk back in the house we noticed he had said something pretty loud, maybe to us. We stepped back out to see he was as well looking up and was pointing at something. I yanked my husband by the shirt and practically tripped as she fell trying to get to the railing of the patio. Expecting to see the same thing we were quickly frozen by what was there. My husband noticed the neighbor ran inside quickly and came back out. I was so excited and scared, all at the same time but didn&rsquo;t take my eyes off this thing. It&rsquo;s hard to explain how I felt. Looking at it did not scare me at all. My husband said later he couldn&rsquo;t even move or talk at first. He also said that he didn&rsquo;t know what to think of what he saw and that he didn&rsquo;t really want to talk about what it meant. What he saw actually scared him a bit. Just in the last week he has been acting a bit different because of what he saw.Traveling in the same direction again, but much slower and closer was an object that was approximately the size of dime in the sky. It was the shape of a jellyfish or mushroom and had brighter light emitting from the center and bottom that was reddish orange. Its sides were almost translucent like a jellyfish and more solid reddish orange in the center. It looked like its sides were moving in on themselves like a mushroom cloud does from an atomic blast with its billowing reddish smoke. It made no noise and traveled at a very slow speed, like about 4 inches in the sky, for like every 5 seconds and then just stopped. This thing just didn&rsquo;t make sense. It was amazing.My husband pulled me down just below the railing and out of the moonlight where we both now crouched and watched it. For some reason during the event I put out my arm to grab the railing.  My husband quickly grabbed my arm down in fear. We both sat there in the dark motionless looking up at this thing for about 3-4 minutes. We were very afraid there for a second there almost hardly breathing. Then suddenly calmness came over both of us when it started to move again. The large object slowly again started to move from its fixed position and slowly in the same direction prior, headed over our building like the others.We have a huge central train yard just about a &frac12; mile away, in Roseville. You can always hear the cars booming together and crashing in the distance, sometimes very loudly. Sometimes it&rsquo;s very quiet. This night we would hear them about every 5-10 minutes. You get pretty used to them after a while and block them out. We could hear off in the distance a few pretty loud bangs and then suddenly this object sort of flashed and made a few crackling noises. Like wood burning in a fire. The sounds actually did echo pretty loudly. As the train cars thudded it looked effected by the sounds of them crashing together. It suddenly became very translucent not emitting any form of light. Almost like it shut down, for a second. It appeared to look kind of like a jellyfish head in the sky. You could sort of see through it. You could only see a kind of shimmer glare around its edges from the moonlight and a kind of blurriness in the middle. It sat there for about probably 2&ndash;3 seconds doing this crackling noise. Then with the next crash of train cars it moved so fast over top of us, we lost it in our vision as it passed over our building. The object disappeared before my eyes could even adjust to see where it had gone.This is the only way I can describe what we saw on March 28th 2009. The whole series of events occurred between 2 and 2:45 in the morning. They occurred back to back in series. These events were witnessed by, me, my husband, and the two neighbors, a husband and wife who live across from us that witnessed the third portion of the event.", "HIghly reflective very small object took off from ground + accended to sky and beyound very quicklyFriday Aprii 24 2009 approx 10.15 am. I was in Langley in the Murrayville region and not very far from the police station it was on my right side - I was on foot and decided to sit at a bus stop for a moment as I felt something was kind of  watching me.  Friday was a beautiful day with good visability and just a flew fluffy clouds.  I was looking out North and appearing high in the sky was a [dot] very very high up in the sky -  This dot  wasn&apos;t moving at all.  I then watched this stationary dot for about a minute and it just assended upwards towards space until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  I then continued on foot to the local coffe house and had a latte.  I then headed back in the general direction where I had just come from and noticed a vacant field.  I decided to place my jacket on the gound and sit there peacefully for a few mins and bask in the spring sun.  I was aware of my surroundings including several men working to the right of this field (city, municiple workers) suddendly from my left side of the peripheral vision I saw something very strange.  I thought it was a metallic butterfly (taking off from the ground) or field where I was sat.   This highly reflective object was probably no bigger than compact disc in size.   It wobbled and had the motion of a jumping butterfly.  I would guestimate this object&apos;s distance to be 20 metres from me.  It moved across the field left to right and also lifting up higher and accended upwards towards the clouds and beyond.  I then took out my cell phone and tried to video cam this (checked video afterward but couldn&apos;t see anything on replay due to very poor video quality)   Also to verify what I was seeing I then ran over to the City Municiple workers and asked them to look in the sky way up to see this shimmering object - One guy said yes + the other guy couldn&apos;t see this until I gave him my sunglasses.

At first, I thought it was a star, but it had a silvery shine to it, so I ran to get my camera and binoculars.  As I first saw the object with my binoculars, I could tell that the stationary object was not a plane, or anything that I have ever seen.  It was about two hands above the horizon directly East from my location. My wife is a witness to the incident.The object remained stationary for about 10 minutes.  At this point I tried to take some pictures but could not find the object in the viewfinder so I just randomly took some pictures in the hope of capturing the object.  I was not successful.The object then began to move NWN and made a 45-degree travel in a matter of about 30 seconds and then disappeared behind some clouds.  About two minutes later, my wife spotted another similar bright shiny object.This second object was about three hands above the horizon and SE from our location.  I saw the object with my binoculars and it had the same configurations as the first object.  After a couple of minutes clouds covered the object and when the clouds cleared, the object was nowhere to be seen.  I tried looking for it but could not find it anywhere.About 15 minutes later a twin-engine propeller plane flew a route of east to north, exactly the same route the object took but at a lower altitude.", "silent triangle craft in North PhoenixWhile looking thru binoculars at stars, planes,etc. I noticed a large triangle moving slowly from the Northwest. It is slightly overcast and thought at first it was the clouds making the stars look like they were moving. I noticed the craft was moving with a cloud , or what looked like a faint cloud.  So I placed the binoculars on top of my childs swing set and sat on the slide, as not to touch them and cause a false sighting. To my surprise the craft was moving and I had to keep turning to follow the it. It flew directly under the big dipper and blocked out many stars as it passed in front of  them. I eventually lost sight of it in the Northeast sky.each tip of the ship had a faint white light on it. The lights were not of a normal plane of any kind that I have seen, they looked like a very faint stars.

We pulled up at a small business plaza and i drop him off at the front of the place.  I continued on to park and found a space a few feet fron the cell phone payment store.As i was waiting for him i was looking around and looked up to my left and saw a white object flying in the sky, at frist i tought it was small business jet plane, but when i looked at the object i realized it did not have a tail or jet engines, i statrted my car and pulled out of my space to a spot where i could see the object better, and saw it was white with a strange glow and had a small set of wings 3/4 of the way to what looked like the end of it.What really startle me then is that it was flying real straight and then all of a sudden it sped up fast and vanished. It was a clear day with blue sky, and i know what a plane looks like, because, in this area i was located at you can see the planes after they take off or when the are begining to decend, because the airport is over 12 miles away. What caught my eye was the fact that this object was flying real low and fast and had no engines and no tail and made no sound, I was hopeing my brother would come out quicker to see what was happening, but by the time he did it was gone. I know some people are going to say it was a military drone or something like that, but i was in the military for almost 14 years and i know what airforce drones all look like.

I noticed a small dark object, stationary unlike a bird or plane.  I watched it for a few minutes to see whether or not it was a plane, helicopter, bird, etc.  It had none of these obvious characteristics.  It just hovered.  It was difficult to determine exactly how far away it was, but I would guess between 2 and 5 miles, based on the geography of the hills.When I saw the object rise, I would guesstimate a few hundred feet, I alerted my friend Phil.  He immediately wrote it off as a bird or plane. I told him to keep watching it, it was stationary and would move slowly up and down, then horizontally some distance.  We measured the movement and it&rsquo;s position by the distance between the telephone poles that are about 3 to 4 blocks away.We continued watching it for about &frac12; hour as planes flew by it and we then realized it was not an aircraft, plane or helicopter.  My next-door neighbor &quot;Elli&quot; had stepped out of her front door when I pointed it out to her. She was as mystified as we were.The only explanation I had is that it might have been a kite.  The only problem with that explanation was there was little or no wind, plus the altitude of this object was at least 1000 to 1200 ft high and it would not swing from side to side as a kite would naturally do. After about one and a half hours, the object seemed to drift in a south west dierection out of sight.((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))The Anaheim report of 2-01-09 was 3-01-09, I submit this correction.This is to correct the date of my first report.

It was around 10 p.m. PST in Gaston, Oregon.We were sitting on her bed looking out her window to the East hills when just above the hills we saw 3 lights.  They seemed hover for a bit in a triangular form but then they started moving randomly.  One dropped vertically quickly then moved to the South on the horizontal like a right angle.  This really surprised me.  I have never seen anything move this smoothly or quickly.The lights changed colors as well.  We saw them become red, blue, green and whitish/yellow.I must say my behavior changed dramatically for a couple days following the event.

At first, I thought that it was the moon but it was way too low to be the moon.  So I stepped outside and the moon was behind me, this thing was huge. I went upstairs and told my wife and had told her I was going to get a better look. As I started driving towards it , it started to move quite quickly and then it was gone.

This thing was absolutely huge.", "it was a cigar shaped UFO with three lights, two sometimes white or blue and one always red.Ok so I was out smoking a cigarette with my girl friend and I noticed something in the sky that was moving very oddly. I burst with excitement. I had seen this same exact object or &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; if you will, in the sky about a month or so before at night while smoking a cigarette out on my deck. I was the only witness that time. So anyways, I asked my girl friend &ldquo;do you see that?&rdquo; and she said &ldquo;yes I see something in the sky moving fast then slow and in weird directions&rdquo;. &ldquo;Yes that&rsquo;s exactly what I see&rdquo; I said. I then ran in to my apartment to get my roommates so that they could take a look. They both saw it too and they thought it was odd also. But they didn&rsquo;t stick around to watch and they went back inside. I stayed a little longer to see if the objects behavior would change. It seemed to get further away. The UFO was in the sky in the direction of Lebanon NH a neighboring town to Canaan. The UFO seamed to stay in the same kind of region of the sky.Ok so the UFO looked like a saucer from the side. It looked like it had a row of sequencing lights along the length of it. It had a red light in the center and two lights on the sides of the red light. Sometimes the two lights on either side of the red light were blue and sometimes they were white. Most of the time they were white but when they were blue it was brilliantly bright like the red one. So at all times the UFO had three lights constantly blinking. When I stood still it seemed to move more and when I moved around a lot it seemed to &hellip;.well try and hide from me like it could see me or sense me looking, and it would stop moving and would stand still or even stop blinking and look like a star. It was bizarre. This object was making shapes with its movements such as triangles, half squares, what I mean by half squares I mean shapes like this. It would go back and forth and up and down or in a direction but at an angle. It was doing half circles like this C. I mean seriously I&rsquo;ve never seen any object in the sky make these movements before. I&rsquo;ve watched lots of shows about UFOs in my life and they seemed very similar to some of the things I saw. From what I understand humans don&rsquo;t have the technology to make movements like that. The movements were absolutely acrobatic. It was so unnatural.So that&rsquo;s my report, hope it can help in your research or do something for you somehow.", "Two lights moving slowly south while perfectly parrallel to eachotherAs I proceeded down U.S. 74 East coming to the border of Richmond and Scotland county I noticed two lights to the north off the highway.  At first the lights were stationary and I believed them to be towers of some sort because of the lights perfectly spaced apart from each other and because of there close proximity to the ground.I continued down the highway at the posted speed limit until I noticed the lights beginning to move south crossing over the highway in front of me at about half of a miles distance from my location.  I also noticed a darkness between the two lights as it continued to cross the highway as if there was a mass between the two.  I immediately followed it south onto Guinns Mill Rd then Scotland County Line Rd and continued pursuing it at high speeds.Going through curves and valleys I kept track of the object at sporadic moments until I lost complete sight of it.

We then proceeded to an open area on the edge of town for an unobstructed view.Upon getting out of our vehicle, we noticed numerous aircraft in the area of the sighting, only to be followed by military jets.  As a matter of fact, we are only 25 miles from Grissom Air Reserve Base, in Bunker Hill, IN.  These jets were low, and at a high rate of speed and seemed to me they were aware of the lights.I have never experienced anything of this kind and was in shock at first.

It had a bright red light and a couple other white lights but none were blinking. I parked my car after seeing it and waited for a minute to see it move, but it didn&apos;t. I noticed that 2 police officers were outside looking at it. There were many more people around but they did not notice it. It seems that most people don&apos;t see UFOs when they do show up. I started to get closer to it but then it started to move in the opposite direction. I chased it down the highway going 60 miles per hour, but I still couldn&apos;t catch it. After a mile down the road, it turned of all white lights and it only had its red light on. Again, no lights ever blinked.I was the person who reported the last 2 sightings in Columbus, GA.

All directional references and measurements should be interpreted with this in mind.At the approximate time listed above, we both simultaneously noted a point of light around 4 times the size of any star in the sky.  This point of light travelled from right to left (I can obtain compass direction if needed) from appx. 60 degrees above the horizon on the right across the sky to around 30 deg above the horizon on the left.  This point of light appeared to travel at satellite speed for a duration of 3-4 seconds, covering only a few degrees of night sky.  In &lt;0.75 seconds, the object sped up, covering the remaining amount of sky in 2-3 seconds, until it passed out of our sight.  We did not observe a light trail behind the object, and needless to say, it was too far away for us to discern any noise.For reference, I am an International Relations major, and my friend is a Physics major with an Astronomy minor.

It was 10:45 PM. I felt so elated that I called a friend and the cell phone call recorded the time.At first, due to all the light in the intersection, we did not think much of it. As we drove closer and came into a darker area we noticed five and six bright lights formed into a triangle shape in the sky (we were surrounded by trees and, therefore, the visibility was slightly impaired; nevertheless, we could clearly see the triangle formation) .They were slightly swerving into each other but essentially maintained the triangle shape. I asked my girlfriend to stop the car and I got out to get a clearer look at this unusual phenomenon.As I stood there, all of the bright points of light disappeared, except one. They zoomed out at an unimaginable speed leaving no trace whatsoever. The bright point of light which remained did so for another 20-30 seconds, and then slightly dimmed and suddenly it was gone. The color of these lights was a blend of red and orange and they were very bright relative to the surrounding stars.These bright lights might have been hovering at 500 feet or more; it was hard to tell the exact altitude and distance, but they were near enough for us to see what was taking place.The two of us were pretty baffled and amazed but we were convinced that we had witnessed a UFO, and I employ this term in the strict sense of the word as in Unidentified Flying Object.", "One white light in the north and 10 minutes later an orange teardrop shaped light that was followed by two jets patroling the night skyI was out taking a walk with my boyfriend just enjoying the beautiful night and I happened to see what I thought was a satellite in the sky, so I was trying to show my boyfriend what I was talking about when all of a sudden (left of where we were looking) there was a bright white light that was brighter than anything else around in the sky.  We could tell the light was moving and that it was moving away and fast.   Almost just as soon as we had seen this bright white light it dimmed to nothing in the distant horizon.  As if that wasn&rsquo;t weird enough, about 10-15 minutes later I was by myself and I saw an orange teardrop shaped light in the sky (south of the white light.)  I stood there and looked at it for about 1 minute or so and then it just went out as if it hadn&rsquo;t moved or went away, but it just dimmed out.  5 seconds (or less) passed and there were 2 fast planes/jets that cruised the sky kind of close to one another side by side which made me wonder if they were U.S. military.", "UFO cloud/Hollowgram seen over Dallas Texas in the 1980&apos;sIt was around the middle of summer in the early 1980&apos;s.  I don&apos;t know the exact date because I was only around 12 years old at the time.  I was in the family room watching TV with a few other family members which included my father. My older brother was out in front of the house trying to make time with his girlfriend. He saw something in the sky and came running into the house to tell my father to come have a look. Being a big fan of Star Wars and Close encounters at that time I wasn&apos;t going to miss a chance to see something that maybe out of this world. We grew up down the street from a Dallas navel base. To this day my brother clams that it was directly over the base. I remember it being directly over the house. What we saw was not a disk or craft of any kind. It wasn&apos;t scary to me at the time but has become so, as I have still to this day never even heard of anything like this being viewed by any other UFO observer. It was a cloud that had the center of it&apos;s mass erased. In the center was a series of neon blue lines that changed every 5 seconds or so. First look it was parallel blue lines. Then the lines would change direction. Reverb and change into something like dots. Then wavy lines and continued to do this kind of thing for about 5 to 6 minutes. It looked like a TV that was having trouble getting a signal. As if this cloud was one big hallow gram that was having trouble getting the center portion to work.  By this time a crowd of about 10 people where standing in the front yard looking up at this thing. At first I thought it was a blimp. I know that blimps have display screens but at the time couldn&apos;t do this kind of thing. I stayed in the front yard looking up for the next 2 1/2 hours thinking I&apos;d see a blimp exit the clouds. Nothing! No noise, No craft, No blimp! I lived with my parents in the house from 1971 to 1993. I&apos;ve never seen a blimp that large Nor have I seen one in the area because of the naval base being so close (4 Miles). I&apos;ve been pouring over the UFO web sites to ! try and see if anyone has heard of or seen anything like what I&apos;ve described. I&apos;ve had no luck at all. I do have witnesses of the event. This includes 2 of my brothers, A sister and my father.I&apos;m 37 now and It would be great to talk to others that may have seen something like this.

One night I was the only car on the road in the Ayer area which is pretty rural alot of trees and some houses on a 2 lane divided highway.  In the distance straight ahead of me was a single white light in the sky.  It looked about a mile away about 3/4 up the windshield I was approching it at about 50 MPH with my lights on because it was dark outside.  The craft was just hovering in one place dead ahead of me as I approached. All of a sudden it shot to the south (my left) at a speed that we are not capable of, maybe 10,000 MPH. Now heres the proof that I know it was not made by man, it did not need any distance to get up to speed.  It was like moving at top speed instantaneously.I have always wanted to know if anyone else ever saw it that night thats why I came to this site to look it up historically.I was not close enough to hear any sound((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Saw a shiny metallic object when first pulling into the parking lot so assumed it was a plane since it was the same relative size and shape as a plane and was reflective like the metallic body of a plane very visible in the afternoon sun.I parked, checked the craft again and noticed it had not moved at all.  I then assumed it was a blimp. But I do not know of any metallic blimps and this one was extremely reflective.  And it was not the typical blimp shape, it looked more like a large jetliner from the side profile but I did not note a rear vertical fin.  It also confused me since it appeared to be the same distance away from my position that I see the airplanes take as a path to land in Miami International Airport.  I was running late to class so I did not observe it much longer.If it was the distance I believe it to be, relative to my position= ~10 degrees CW from N @ 1 mile.  So it would have been almost directly above International Mall.  I know some stores fly balloons but this would have been very unlikely since planes take a direct path over the mall to land in the airport 3 miles to the east.  And it&apos;s altitude was roughly the same if not slightly higher than planes that use that path to land.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I could not make out the exact shape of the UFO but I could tell about how big it was by the alternate flashing of lights on either side of it.  The lights appeared to be a red-orange color and were quite large.  I pulled over on the side of the road and rolled my driver side window down and turned down the radio.

I then noticed a bright light in the sky, and we went outside on our 3rd floor balcony to see what it was.  At first we believed it was a plane flying straight towards us, but we then noticed other planes in the air. This light was much brighter than anything we had ever seen in the sky at night before and much lower than any plane I&rsquo;ve seen fly in our area. It made absolutely no noise and appeared to be two lights connected together. We grabbed my digital camera and took three pictures and one video.  The light kept its brightness and didn&rsquo;t move from its original position in the sky for approx 4 minutes.At 10:49 p.m., it began to dim, move left, and increase in altitude. Once it gained a bit of altitude, the object leveled off and started to pick up speed. It then began illuminating brighter again. We recorded this part on my Cannon digital camera.  The object continued to travel leftwards in the sky and then decreased in altitude. It moved behind a tall building in the distance. At this point the object was the brightest that we had seen it.

It was travelling at the same speed as other satellites we had seen but then it stopped abrubtly and headed off on a north west direction.  It travelled in that direction for about 5 seconds and then gave a bright flash, it then travelled further in the same direction for 2-3 seconds and then gave the same flash again, we followed it for a further 3-4 seconds until it disappeared.

I could judge the speed of the light to be going at or faster than 50000 miles an hour because when you see a satellite in the sky it is usually a small light traveling at a nice steady speed and it will travel around the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.   The reason this light was so different was, it was about 10 times the size of a satellite light, and this light was a steady light it did not blink, it did not change color, it was just a big white light. Now the other reason it was so different that any light  I have seen in my life was it was very far away and it was traveling away from or solar system.  I saw the light for about 2 minutes the light did not get any smaller or bigger as I was looking at it, which was weird to cause after 2 minutes the light just vanished.   Like it was traveling though a port hole or something, and when I saw the light it was just ripping through space at very high speeds it came in one side of the port hole then when it vanished it disappeared though the other side of the port hole.  And when I say port hole you could refer it to ripping a hole in space time continuum, or it could be a worm hole, in one side out the other.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I had just spent an hour at a roadside rest area and slept for an hour before continuing on my trip.  Not long after continuing my drive, suddenly I saw what looked like a circular shaped glowing ball of fire. About the size of a Frisbee it flew in toward me out of the western sky. In the total darkness, I could not judge how high up it was.I marveled at it as it flew directly overhead and followed it threw my sun roof.  I did not think of it as a UFO because I kept thinking about how this thing resembled a bright red and orange amber in a fire.  The inside of the circle sparkled with white flashes as the orange color graduated to a cooler red at the perimeter.  The outside of the circle was not well defined and wavered slightly. I did not think of it as a UFO because I had a preconception, from what I so often have heard, that UFOs are glowing white lights in the sky at night.  I also never really believed that there were such things as UFOs.As fast as I could, I crossed over two lanes on the interstate, stopped on the side, opened the sun roof, and stuck my head out to continue looking at this fireball.  To my surprise I saw yet another similar object approaching from the east on a collision course with the first. When they were relatively close to each other, they both made sharp turns to the north.  They continued flying in formation until they disappeared in the horizon.  I was driving a hybrid car so the car engine was completely silent and no traffic was on the highway at this moment. Yet I could not detect any noise from these objects in the sky.  I have seen thousands of aircraft in the sky and live near an airport, so there is no mistaking these items for airplanes.Shortly after these items had disappeared into the horizon, I witnessed what I thought at first was a shooting star. However, as I thought about it, it dawned on me that this could not have been a coincident. This beam of light, coming from space, intersected the pathway of the two flying objects. It appeared to me that if this beam of light had appeared ten, fifteens seconds earlier, it would have been right on top of these objects or even possibly hit one of them.It is also worth noting that these UFOs were in this geographic location on the same day that the shuttle landed at Cape Kennedy.  The shuttle landed at 3:14 pm and this sighting occurred at 11:45 pm. I realize that these occurrences are many hours apart, but never the less it is on the same day and only a few hundred miles apart.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The average shape seemed to be a sideways oval. 21:10ish it began gently moving side-to-side, still flashing.

I had two events on my way home but only told my family once, most of them said I am crazy.I was driving on a main road fairly close to the West Michigan lakeshore.  I was driving from Holland Michigan to Grand Haven Michigan, heading in a northward direction.Durring my drive, I noticed the area being illuminated with an orange light.  I automatically assumed this was from the sun at first.  I got to thinking about it and it was way too early for the sun to be out. This was around 04:10.  I noticed the orange light becoming brighter and there were some clouds over Grand Haven that were glowing bright orange, there were no other clouds in the sky except the giant ones that were glowing orange.As I was driving closer, I continued to keep my eyes on the clouds.  There were eventually three giant glowing orange what appeard to be thrusters, there was also a shape that appeared, could see the back where the thrusters were and the bottom.  This thing looked like a star destroyer from Starwars! It was huge! The backside where the thrusters were was possibly a mile across, maybe more. The craft was about as far off from the ground as low storm clouds, so not very far. I drove within a third of a mile from being under the craft and it just disappeared. The clouds it seemed to be hiding in went with it. The area also turned completely dark again, it had been brightly lit from the thrusters of the craft. It made no sound.After this sighting, I continued to drive home.  I was already worked up from the giant ship, which was very close to my home.  I continued down a back road so I could get home quicker.  As I neared my street, I saw a pair of red eyes glowing in my head lights.  The eyes were at the end of my street where I had to turn.  As I neared the creature, it stood up on its legs like a human!  It was thin, stood taller than my street sign and was black in color, it was standing in the middle of the road and I could see fairly well.  I planned on turning and hitting the gas to drive past it, however I was distracted by a flash that appeared to be like a camera flash that was in the back seat.  I looked in my rear view mirror to see what it was.  There was nothing! I had only looked in the mirror for a split second then looked back because I had to turn. In that split second, the creature had disappeared.Sorry folks, I know how to defend myself quite well and even have a weapon in the car for self defense, but I was not about to wait around to see what that thing was! I have seen bears, it was way too thin to be a bear. People don&apos;t have red eyes and I don&apos;t see many people that skinny or black in color. I ran to the door of my house! That was a freaky night! I am glad to get it out there, I don&apos;t care if people don&apos;t believe me.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date in November 2007 is approximate.

After a couple minutes of trying to figure out what they could be they began to move.  They had been fixed in the sky and now were moving towards one another.  They were in very close proximity and moving all around each other.  The best way to describe them is to compare them to gnats or moths flying around a light source only a lot slower.  When they first started moving I thought maybe they were lights from helicopters but I don&apos;t think helicopters fly that close to one another and not in those kinds of patterns. After 30 seconds or so of being confused by what I was watching they moved, in unison and fairly quickly, over the tree-line and I could no longer see them.

It was not on top of a tower or a hill. It was not traveling (moving) like a plane. It was too bright to be a helicopter. We did determine after sitting in the same spot for about 12 minutes that the twinkling light was moving NW as it had drifted from our reference point between two trees  We grabbed our tri-pod, got in our vehicle, and headed in the general direction of this twinkling light. We decided it was above West Richland, Washington or Benton City, Washington. We went to the Union St. Library in Kennewick, which is about 3 miles or so west of our home. We got out of our car, walked to the darkest part of the field, set up the tri-pod, and began to snap photographs.The light changed shape. The light made perfect cylindrical clouds that were red, white and green in color. We snapped two photographs where it appears there is a HUGE unidentified (by us) flying object.

At first I was just looking at this hawk circling over head, watching it closely then something reflective caught my eye.  At that instant I stood up in the pool and rubbed my eyes to make sure that water was not causing me to see things then I peered up again and noticed that the object had become more visible.  I turned to this really attractive young woman and asked her if she could see what I saw.  At first she said &ldquo;yea I see that bird&rdquo;, and then I said &ldquo;no&hellip; look higher&rdquo; and she gasps saying &ldquo;oh yea&hellip;.what is that?&rdquo;  At this point I realized I was not delusional from drinking heavily the day before.  Also at this point I noticed everyone at the pool starting to look up as well and I looked back up to view the object and noticed this: it started out stationary over I-275 and Ford road, as a silvery twinkle and slowly turned into a silvery doughnut shaped liquidly fluid like structure that seemed to reflect light very well.  At about a minute and thirty seconds past the first observance, the object started to rotate sideways until it became a twinkle again and vanished.I have reported ufo&rsquo;s before but this was by far the strangest and most impressive.  After the sighting I ran back to my apartment and told my fianc&eacute; of what I had just witnessed and she believed me but my gut instinct was to research this a little more and wait for others to report it before making my own report.  I thought it was possible that it was unique weather phenomenon but after searching the web and Utube for doughnut ufo&rsquo;s, I came to the conclusion that it was genuine.  I believe that what I observed was just the tip of the iceberg and that what ever I saw was somehow distorted by either its means of propulsion &rdquo;gravity?&rdquo; or by its cloaking device.  I also believe that this is a repeated pattern and that there will be something in the skies above Ford road and I-275 sometime in July of 2009 probably around the time of 15:00-16:00 hrs, hopefully or I&rsquo;m going to look bad. Maybe this year I will take my video camera to the pool, but that might look creepy.Thanks for your time", "Me and two friends saw an alien ship that looked like the ones on Star Wars.I was walking home from school with my two friends.  We decided to take a hike in the woods.  We went about a mile out, and a aerodynamic ship flew across the sky.  It sort of looked like the star destroyers on star wars, but smaller, about 500 metres.  It was made of chrome, and quickly flew across the sky.  None of us had cameras, and we don&apos;t know if anyone else saw it.  It made a vibating noise, like a quiet car engine.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

WHILE FISHING!My wife and I were out on our pontoon boat with some friends and we were about an 8th of a mile past the jettys in the Murrells Inlet, S.C around 2:00pm on a Saturday and the sky was clear and sunny. I saw a hug bright flash-like hit an oject that I saw in the sky, and it was as a flash bulb from a camera. I looked up and saw the sunlight was reflecting off of a large curcular object in the sky.  I thought, what in the world could something so big be in the sky?  I knew it had to be a (UFO).  It was the size of about 100 feet across, and it shined like polished stainless or aluminum. The distance from where I was on the boat to where it was sitting in the sky was around 300 to 500 ft. above the marsh, and about 3 miles away from where we were fishing.  I watched the object level up and move due south real slow until it was almost out of sight.  The object stopped in the sky and then moved back due north and it passed back infront of me and it was almost straight above me.  It moved alittle father north and it took off at a high rate of speed to the north west and I never heard a sound.  The sighting lasted about 10 minutes.  I also saw 2 black helicopters flying with no markings around the same area. I have seen (UFO&apos;s) for over 15 years and I hope we will learn about what we see!  Thank you", "I saw an ovel craft very high in the sky moving very quickly and changing directions from east to west it was glowing blue in color.", "Shiny, symmetrical, metallic object against deep blue sky on sunny day  that really stood outI was driving north on Main St. in Bradford, PA at around 3:30PM. It was an un-seasonably hot sunny day and the sky was a deep blue with a few sparse, wispy white clouds. I looked to my left, out the driver side window and saw a very distinct symmetrical, shiny, silvery metallic object hovering motionlessly in the western sky. My first thought was that maybe it was a helicopter because it was just hovering there and not moving, although its perfect symmetry and chrome-like appearance did not make that seem likely. The only way I could describe it would be that it was shaped like an acorn or upside down bell with the wider end up. I looked later on the internet for photos of &ldquo;acorn shaped UFO&rsquo;s&rdquo; and was surprised to find that they were not that uncommon. The only difference was that the pictures that I found showed the object inverted, with the wider end facing down. I continued to watch the object for about 15 or 20 seconds and then to my amazement, it just faded away into the blue sky over the course of 4 or 5 seconds. That&rsquo;s when I was convinced that I had seen a UFO.

It was underneath some light fair weather cumulus.  I watched it go southbound until it was out of sight - it did not accelerate or change altitude, estimated speed 250-350 knots based on the speed of the jet that the fleet described below was following.  About two minutes later on the same heading there was a fleet of identical objects headed south, it was not packed into one tight formation it was spread out so there were groups of two or three craft in formation.  The lead object in the fleet was tailing an airline jet on the same heading by about one mile. The objects made no sound and emitted no light however I did notice a &apos;fuzzy&apos; aura around them. Based on the size of the aircraft and the fair weather clouds, I would estimate that the objects were about 3000 feet altitude and approximately 30  to 50 feet in diameter.  I tried counting the craft but lost count at around 8.   I was trying to focus on viewing one group, when another group would fly into my field of vision, confusing my counting.I also noticed cross-traffic, an airline jet crossed overhead higher than the cloud and higher than the fleet at about the same time.Yesterday was one day when I really wish I had my camera, I could have taken really good pictures, probably could have taken closeups with my zoom.The objects were all headed directly south towards the border.((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date of the sighting.

I had left work late.  I first noticed the bright shining object as I started home on US Route 12.  I gave a casual glance at the sky, as I often do. The stars were visible.  When I first noticed the flashing object, I thought it was an airplane.As I continued driving south on Route 12, I continued to watch the object.  I noticed that it was not moving.  I then thought it might be a cell tower, but quickly realized that it was too high in the sky to be a tower.I lost track of the object as the road curved through the valley.  I spotted it once again as I turned onto Route 122.  It was still in the same spot. I was able to monitor its position in the sky by the other star formations present.I again lost sight of the object as I went down the mountain toward my home. As I turn onto the road to my house, I again spotted the object.  I had a good view, so I stopped my car and sat about 5 minutes observing the bright flashing object. It had not moved from its position in the sky from my first sighting about 20 minutes previous.As I watched, I glanced down at my clock.  When I looked up it was gone.  I searched the sky.  It was gone.  It disappeared in the flash.I am reporting this because I believe it is note worthy.  I often take time to observe the night sky.  I have observed the Sky Lab as it transverses the sky.  I have seen shooting stars.  I have observed many airplanes in the night sky.  This object was different than any thing I have observed. It was as bright as the brightest star in the sky.  It was as large as Mars or Venus in the winter sky.  It appeared more oblong than round.  It was flashing very fast.  It was stationary.  It disappeared in an instant.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I decided to go out on the balcony of my bedroom and smoke a cigarette.  I was watching a large star over the horizon and was wondering what planet was out at this time of year.  I knew it had to be a planet because it was to large for a star and not twinkling like a star.  I was looking at the moon and Venus and just hanging out by myself.

There was a small building beneath it, where the light was shining. We pulled over to the side of the highway to get a better look, but as soon as we did this it sped away and was gone.  There is no way a plane could have flew away that quickly. In only about 5 seconds after it started moving, it was completely out of sight. There were no trees around or anything else that could have blocked the view. I was told that planes cannot stay in one place while in the air and this thing had definitely been there for awhile before we got close.

I was not able to judge distance except to say that it was far past my digital camera and video camera range. There was no way to focus on this object with consumer level equipment and may have even been difficult for professional equipment to focus on.I tried to photograph it in every way I could think of but could not.When I first noticed the object it was in the area of being North / North-East moving southerly toward a position east of my view.  The only reason I noticed it was due to it&rsquo;s movement, it was clearly slower then an airplane and going approximately at satellite speed but it&rsquo;s position in the sky and luminescence was all wrong for any satellite and there are no stars of that magnitude in this area of the sky and no objects that move horizontally without gaining altitude. It also changed appearance with a range of colors from white to bright yellow into deep red and back again.The color shift happened only during the time it traveled but stopped shifting once it stopped traveling.It began, or I first noticed it, at 42.5&deg; N moving to and ending at a point just over 41.5&deg; N or in other words a horizontal southerly distance totaling about 40&deg; along the horizon.It ended up being exactly east of my viewing position. I suspect it also came toward me but had no way to judge its depth other then an increase of magnitude, its size appeared to stay somewhat constant.(Please note the longitude, latitude and angular measures are only approximations; I have not gone back and measured those.)  While it traveled and changed color the red shifting was most notable because it appeared to have a deep red sphere inside of its shape that swirled counterclockwise. The red color was contained within the sphere and was about 30% of the total size, the motion of the red shape was erratic and wild but the main motion was counterclockwise the motion was almost like a pinball machine gone berserk.. Within the first few minutes of spotting this I called my wife to verify what I was seeing, she then said &ldquo;I see those things all the time, around 3:00am and they are closer to the house&rdquo;. She takes these things with a very cavalier attitude and doesn&rsquo;t share an interest in any extra-terrestrial activities and treats these occurrences as everyday events for some reason. If she were to see an E.T in person she would say &ldquo;oh that&rsquo;s nice&hellip;&rdquo; and then walk away.After questioning her it appears this has happened before in much the same way only closer to the house and moving faster.She does not understand why I have any level of excitement over this. The event lasted until the object stopped and remained stationary, it moved for a period of about 15 minutes yet was stationary for at least two hours, anyone seeing it after it now stopped would believe it to be a star, it had no outstanding lighting or motion and stayed in a fixed position, eventually after unsuccessfully trying to photograph it I gave up on viewing it, my wife&rsquo;s comments took a lot of wind out of my sails, my total viewing time was about 1 hour.Her total viewing time was around 10 minutes and she verified the size, shape, motion and color of this with no emotion.Now that I know this is / was not a one time event I have my eye to the sky more often.", "Odd craft, egg shaped in front, straight part connected in rear, flew across my home headed due north, maybe 300 yards in the air.At approximately 6pm Eastern Standard time, my girlfriend, her 3 1/2 year old son, and I were standing in my back yard.   He was playing in the dirt with some trucks, her and I were just talking, looking around.  I was looking around at the mountains, and all of the sudden I see this thing come thru the sky, and it was heading due north across the next mountain, which is a strip job. (coal mining operation) I watched it go all the way across the sky and out of sight.  It was approximately 300 yards from the ground, and went straight north. It did not slow/speed up, it did not turn, the altitude never changed.  It was almost like it was on autopilot.In the front, it was shaped like an egg, with the pointy end pointing forward. There was a straight part coming from the rear of it, and it was about as long as a car.  It definitely was NOT a helo, was NOT an airplane, was NOT a toy...I looked for 3 hours to see if I could find a picture of a spy drone or something that would have been it, but no luck.  I posted this on a message board and was told to report it to you guys.  All three of us saw it, it made no sounds, no smoke, had no external attachment looking pieces, it was a dull white color.   I have no idea what it was, but it DID scare the crap out of me.  MY gf&apos;s son said &quot;what is that?&quot; and all I could say was &quot;I have no idea.&quot;     This thing wasn&apos;t way up in the sky like a prop plane, it was low , I&apos;d have to know how high the mountains are, but I&apos;m gonna gess maybe 3000ft at the MOST?

As I observed this and about 4-5 seconds the object made an almost 90 degree right and headed north for maybe one or two seconds. I then pointed it out to my fiance , but the object made another 90 degree right turn and in about another 5 seconds was gone heading east. I jumped out og the hot tub and ran to the north side of our home but it was gone. There was no sound and it was moving quite fast.

I was on my way to an appointment, and had just turned onto northbound Wadsworth Blvd from Center Ave, in the Belmar area of Lakewood. A second or two after making the turn, I noticed this white &quot;line&quot; (could have been cylinder, cigar, disc or almost any shape) moving fairly quickly from left to right (west to east) well ahead of me - I estimate at least a few miles, maybe several miles (could have been over Wheat Ridge or Arvada...). As it got further east, the white color dimmed to a gray color, probably from going underneath the shade of a cloud (just a good guess). It was difficult to keep a really good eye on it as I was in rather heavy traffic, which was slowing down as I approached Alameda Ave., so I had to also keep a good eye on the traffic. I lost sight of it as it went out of view (an office building on the NE corner of Wadsworth &amp; Alameda blocked my view). Once the traffic had moved forward enough, past Alameda Ave, I looked for it again, but could not see it, and had to continue to be careful driving. It might have still been there, but harder to see perhaps because it closely matched the color of background clouds? It also would have been getting farther away (farther to the east). I did not have a camera with me, and even if I had had one, I wouldn&apos;t have had time to turn it on, aim it and snap pictures while driving in heavy traffic - would have been very unsafe, also. However, I went back to that stretch of Wadsworth Blvd and took 4 pictures, approximating what my views were as I was driving this morning. I then used software to draw in what it looked like to me. I will upload the pictures in the sequence of the viewing; you will be able to see it as a white, angled line, west of Wadsworth and roughly above a bank building on the left side of the street, past Alameda Ave. The 3rd and 4th pictures show how it dimmed to gray as it moved farther east. I was on the phone with a friend this afternoon and told him about it. He a! sked me if it could have been an airplane banking in a turn. No, it could not have been that; if it had been that, it would have not appeared to move relative to my position, as it would more or less be flying away or toward me, not moving to my right (east), and it maintained this &quot;tilt&quot; throughout is movement eastward. If it was an airplane, then this would mean that the nose of the plane was inclined about 45 degrees, the nose pointing up and the tail pointing down. When a plane is landing at an airport, the nose is slightly raised so that the rear landing gear touch down, then the nose lowers and the forward gear touch down. This was a much greater angle. If it was a plane, then something must have been very wrong and the passengers would have been very uncomfortable, to say the least. So, no, I don&apos;t believe it was an airplane. If it wasn&apos;t an airplane, what was it?", "trianguler craft seen with bright yellowish lights on the corners.50 ft. long or so!I saw a trianguler shaped craft flying from north to south.

We were on Fork Shoals rd. and heading towards my home.  A huge light, It was the brightest light I had ever seen in my life.  It was so bright that we could hardly seen how to drive.  The faster my date drove the light stayed right with us.  Finally after about 5 minutes driving about 70 mph, the light just disapeared! We had no idea what it was or where it came from, all I know was we were young and never had seen anything like it before until in 1999 and I was driving a friend of mine&apos;s straight truck that we was going to Georgetown,SC to pick up her 2 mirrows and gas lanterns for her new house.  We had just left Florence,S.C. where we had stopped and eat and it was late, around 9:30. I had just pulled out onto highway 20 leaving Florence. I had just stopped at a red light and was not speeding and all of a sudden we saw a bright light behind us. The first thing I thought of was the police! I told my friend, oh, No! I said it&apos;s the police, and I started to pull over on side of the road and said to her...what I&apos;m I been stopped for? I just pulled off from the red light! As I started to stop, The light vanished! NO Police, NO Lights, Everything was gone! Not a car around us anywhere, and there were cars there at the light when we stopped. Everything went from bright light all around us, to no light and Nobody around us!! It scared us so bad, we didn&apos;t know what had been behind us, because no cars, no police went around us at all.

As the plane approached, the disk ascended upward out of its range. A second larger plane with a higher operational ceiling was then sent up to continue the pursuit, and again the disk ascended upward until it disappeared.Apparently, this incident was witnessed by a number of the facility staff.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was dark out and the sky was clear. I could see the constellation of Orion clearly. In fact the event occurred in close proximity to my view of Orion.My brother and I were just closing the front door of our house from the inside when my brother called me outside. He said look up there &ndash; he pointed to the sky above the area of the Woodbine shopping centre. My brother exclaimed that there were two objects in the sky. I said they must be planes &lsquo;cause we live only minutes from the airport. I saw the two lights, one that I am certain was an airplane cause of the flashing light pattern and the relative size of the lights. The object of concern was a very large yellow light and was shaped like a star in the sky (basically round). This yellow object did not flash or blink like an airplane nor did it grow or shrink in size. It just stayed in the same spot for approximately 60 seconds, then moves to one side very quickly and disappeared. When I first saw it (and my brother too) an airplane had been in the same airspace as the yellow orb light thing. The airplane seemed to have come from behind the light (UFO?) and broke away hard from the shared airspace and the plane continued towards the airport and then out of sight. I have lived by the airport all my life (33 years) and I see airplanes every three minutes (I live 2 minutes from the airport). Oh, as I am writing this I can remember the absence of noise. I could only hear the faint hum of the highway off in the distance. Overall, I must say that the yellow orb (UFO?) is not like any aircraft I&rsquo;ve ever seen. My brother (older than me) was slightly shaken by the unusual sight too.Thank you for your attention to my observation report.C.M.", "Pure white, floating 747  or 737.I was traveling from Salt Lake City, Utah to Mesquite, Nevada.

The jet was pure white, with no markings anywhere, whatsoever.  I was looking for a Presidential seal actually, because Bush was a lame duck, and I thought he might be sneaking in a trip to Zions National Park, which is a short drive from Cedar City.  However, the longer I looked at the jet, the weirder things go.  I mean, it was only about 200 feet up, traveling below the line of a mesa...and, it was going about 50-75 miles per hour, AT MOST.  Also, it should be noted that the local airport there was (A) not in the area of the jet, and (B)it just looked like it was FLOATING, not flying.  It made no noise.I am posting this, as I read of someone on your site who saw something very similar.  I continued to watch it...then, thought it may be a good idea to watch where I was going.

When I saw it, I knew what it was; at the time I really didn&rsquo;t know much about UFOs and Ets.  But after that day, ever since I&rsquo;ve looked up everything I could about them.  I don&rsquo;t think it was a alien space craft, I do think it was a government imitation ufo not the real thing.  Ill tell the story now so you can understand why I think this.I was in school at the time and every body had to go inside.  To go inside you would have to line up in front of the door.  Then the teachers would count the students.  While we where lined up a kid on the side of me said &ldquo;hay what&rsquo;s that&rdquo; and he pointed to the sun.  At first I didn&rsquo;t see it the sun was really bright and the sun was right behind the ufo so I had to squint my eyes to see the ufo but a cloud went in front of the sun and I got a really good look. It was just sitting there not moving no sound.  Ok hears the description it was silver it had metal plates with bolts holding the metal plates on, there was no window or door or any way to see who was in side the ufo.  The ufo was not spinning like in the movies it just was very still no noise it was very right over the play ground. I could of through a ball and hit it but I wasn&rsquo;t allowed and I didn&rsquo;t want to get it mad because I didn&rsquo;t know what it could do.  The teachers by that time where scared.  See this was a Christian school but I don&rsquo;t go to a school like that any more it was like a one time thing for a year.  The teachers where scared because I don&rsquo;t think they believed in ufos so they quickly rounded us up and sent us inside.  Later I came out to see if the ufo dropped anything but there was nothing there and the ufo was gone.

I was slowing down for a stop sign at the end of the road when I noticed on my left side (north) a very large light traveling parrallel to the ground. I looked up and watched it cut from left to right (north east) and descend rapidly at an angle towards the ground. The light had turned into a fireball at this point with a bright red-orange tail. It descended quickly into the trees and dissappeared. There was no smoke, no sound, and no falling fragments. I then called my husband to tell him and he advised me to call 911. I called 911 and the operator took my report.

It was headed NE from here looked like it was going at a smooth clip but didn&apos;t seem too fast because it just glided through the air (my opinion) but I imagine it must have been going very fast. &lt;--- Ok that sounds contradictory... what I mean to say is that it must have been going fast because it was going about as fast as one of theses LAPD choppers when they are cruising by but silent and I guess because of the lack of noise, it just seemed to glide by effortlessly which in my head made it seem like it was just strolling by.Sorry i really suck at explaining this...Bright white light... no blinking just solid Didn&apos;t have time to grab a camera but i did have binoculars nearby, through them, god help me I&apos;m gonna say it... it looked triangular but that could be just what was exposed by the light. From what i could tell it seemed like the size of a Helicopter but in no way did it make me think it was one... just a size reference! The light on it was bigger than an LAPD chopper spotlight and it wasn&apos;t emitting a beam or anything, at least in my opinion... I see enough LAPD choppers at night to know the difference.Unless he was running with no lights but that one and somehow made his chopper completely silent.Made no noise whatsoever... I even started talking to it, saying &quot;hold on&quot;, &quot;come closer&quot;, sounds corny but I really wanted to communicate.God, I&apos;m shaking I&apos;m so excited... this was about 20 minutes ago 8:20 pm PST  Ok, so right after I typed this I heard some LAPD choppers over in the NE direction for awhile and then I heard them pass by my complex heading to what sounded to be in the SE direction.I also noted that the whole time this was going on, including while I was typing this post my cell phone kept turning off and rebooting itself over and over again and stopped after I heard the LAPD go by. Could be the phone though...

I was eating a snack and my 8 month old son was facing me.   As I was talking to him, I slighlty glanced in the cloudless sky and noticed a disk like object that is so shiny. It was moving very slowly towards the west and looked like it was 1 mile away.  From my vantage point, the object was the size of a penny.  I called my wife and tried to show it to her but then as I kept on pointing to it so that my wife could see it, the object slowly vanished in thin air.

It moved in a swift figure eight pattern, paused for a half-second, then blasted off into the atmosphere at impossibly fast speed leaving no trail or glow behind it.  The best way to describe it is like in the movies when a ship blasts off into light speed, except this was an extremely bright blue object, which made no sound and left no trace of its existence behind. It was like nothing I&apos;ve seen before and it what I saw doesn&apos;t even seem humanly possible.  This thing just took off and disappeared completely in less then a second.

I remember her eating some raw onions and I was questioning her.  I decided to role down my window some more and saw a very large dark object from afar slowly moving towards the back of the truck.  i saw it in my side view mirror. it was not a sand storm. I saw other people turn their heads towars the object and told the spec 4 to look in her mirror. when it got over top the truck, it seemed like it was so close that if there was a building in the way, it might have knocked it over.  I looked forward and could see the light of the horizon, but I could no longer see any horizon on the sides of us.  but then when the object was completely over all of us, our area became pitched dark.  the spec 4 started to hollar for jesus and I told her to lock all of the doors and roll up the windows.  I did not hear any noise.  We turned on our flashlights and there was no reflection on the flashlight or our headlights or anybody elses headlights.  i could only see the circle of light from the flashlight, but it could not shine on anything. we could not start our engine. It seemed like a very long time, almost like a half hour.  I knew that it happened about 1500 hours because i could not wait to go off duty at 1600 hours.  I remember telling the spec 4 to be very quiet.  I was calm, but nervous.  It seemed like a real long time, but it was only about 3-5 minutes when i looked at my watch again.  I am not sure if my watch stopped during that time or not, but it was a few minutes after 3pm, then i looked in my side view mirror because I saw a glimmer of light.  I could see the horizon behind the truck,come back again and then I could see the sides of outside light again.  I could not see the top of the object, only part of the underside which was very flat. ! It seeme d like the object was a mile wide because I could not tell how big it was.  Looking at the beginning edge moving over us, it had a slight bend like a spherical shape.  The color looked like dark copper underneath the object. It looked kind of rigidy like symbols too.  The object was moving at a very slow pace over us. I rarely talk about it.  I had always wondered if anyone else ever spoke of it in the blogs, but I just learned about using blogs this year.  It was only one mothership of an object.  Afterwards, one of the brass (officers) approached us and was just as baffled as we were about the object.  He said that if he wrote home about it no one would belive him anyway.  I agreed. I did not want anyone to think I was bananas too.

Every once in a while, one orb would shimmer a bit, and then stop and another one would shimmer, and finally the other would shimmer. Almost as if to communicate with each other. They flew in a triangle but would frequently form a straight line and then form back into a triangle again. During the final five minutes, they were drifting away from us, and one on the left flew very fast off to the side, away from the others. Then one of the two left flew off to the right very fast.

We were sitting outside at our picnic table, because it was such a nice day outside - the sun was shining and there weren&apos;t any clouds in the sky.  I looked up in the sky and saw a trail running vertically between the NW and NE portions of the sky, which we see often when outside.  I pointed the trail out to my parents, and not but two seconds later I saw the object come flying out from behind the top portion of a pine tree, seemingly out of nowhere.  It moved fairly quickly, I&apos;d say quicker than airplanes that we always see flying by.  The area of the sky that we saw the object in is the same area that we always see airplanes and helicopters flying in the same direction.The object was silver and shiny; we noted after seeing it that it was the same color as a silver chain-link fence.  We did not see any wings at all and it made absolutely no noise.  I&apos;m not sure if you would classify it as cylinder, cigar, or oval shaped, but we described it as looking like a submarine.  It was flat looking on the top and bottom and rounded on each end, just like a submarine.  It was flying lower than the airplanes we normally see flying by (and we see lots of airplanes going over where we live and they are extremely noisy), and it was low enough that if it had writing on the sides, we&apos;d be able to read it (but there was no writing on it).  It was obvious to us it wasn&apos;t an airplane or a helicopter, and it was low enough that if it were a blimp, we&apos;d be able to tell.  It literally looked like a flying submarine.I would estimate that the object took about 6-8 seconds to get out of our viewing and get behind some more pine trees where we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  About 5 seconds later, a commercial airplane (the kind we always see flying over) came flying from the same direction, NW, flying towards the same direction that the object went, NE.  The object didn&rsquo;t have any lights that we could see (though it was the daytime and sunny, so we couldn&rsquo;t tell for sure) and it didn&rsquo;t leave any kind of trail behind.My father told me to report it here that very day, but I wanted to wait and see if anyone else saw something and then I forgot about it.

Later on in the day on the local news, they reported that everyone in the area had heard the noise and they think it was some kind of a sonic boom.  People who were outside said they saw a fireball in the sky, including some police officers.  The electricity also went out at about the same time at one of the hospitals in the area.  After hearing that noise, I thought I&apos;d better report what we saw earlier this month, in case there is some kind of connection with that sort of thing.Here are some links to some of our local news organizations that reported on the sonic boom/fireball incident to give you more information on what happened:  WJBF News Channel 6 - http://www.wjbf.com/jbf/news/state_regional/south_carolina/article/talk_around_the_csra_is_the_big_boom_in_the_night/11997/  http://www.wjbf.com/jbf/news/state_regional/georgia/article/breaking_news_mysterious_boom_rattles_csra/11990/  WRDW Channel 12 - http://www.wrdw.com/home/headlines/41580572.html  The Augusta Chronicle - http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2009/03/21/met_515443.shtml", "Barrel shaped object, slow speed, daylight sighting and possible search for said object.My father &amp; I were traveling down I-10 between Balmorhea and Ft.

It was some sort of light that moved strangely in the sky.  I glanced up and the moment that I did, I saw a bright egg shaped light that flashed and grew smaller within a fraction of a second.  It was like when you turn off an old TV and the light goes to the center of the screen, or a Sci-Fi movie where a spaceship zooms away at light speed.I distinctly got the impression that it had moved away at an incredible speed.  This would have been over Renton or 405 depending on the distance.  It happened so fast that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to judge its exact location or distance, but I believe it was at least a hundred feet up.The light was such a bright white that it left an imprint in my vision like when you stare at a light source for too long and you see a pink or green blob when you turn away.  I would have dismissed this whole event, had it not been for the fact that I could still see that imprint.I had a strong impulse to pull over and look in the sky in the direction it had gone, but there wasn&rsquo;t a convenient place, as that stretch of road has no shoulder.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was playing with my friends, just goofing off, and I jumped in a circle. When I turned I saw something in the sky that, kind of resembled a smaller moon. It was just below and to the right of where the moon was positioned, and it was really close to our houses. I stopped jumping and watched it; I could feel that everyone was still jumping.

While that object was directly above me, I saw the different but same type of object flying in the distance toward me from another direction,  It was much farther away from me, but still close enough to see its size in relation to the previous one.  From my eyes, it was in the direction of the lower corner of the University parallel to the main entrance at eagle road. It flew in direction parallel to King of Prussia road.  After I crossed the soccer field towards my residence at Kea Guffin Hall, I walked toward the back parking lot of Kea, and as I was walking up the hill, another object flew over the trees, and over Kea Hall about 80 degrees above me.  I tried to take a picture of it with my cell, but the resolution was to low for the lights to be seen.  The duration of this sighting lasted 13 minutes. I witnessed 4 objects in total.These four objects were triangular in shape. There was a full moon out tonight (or what seemed to be), and in relation to how close to the ground these objects flew compared to the size of the moon, the size of the object was of equal or a little larger than the moon tonight.  These objects had 7 lights. In the middle, there was a red light, and at each point of the triangle there was one, as well as two between the front light and the two side lights.This is the first time I have seen unidentified objects that close to me, they couldn&rsquo;t have been over 300 feet above me.  It was spectacular. Oddly enough, I wasn&rsquo;t scared, but felt calm and at peace.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be a quite sincere person.

Our table was located right next to a large picture window, facing North at the end of Main Street.  As I looked out, I noticed a small Cessna airplane flying slowly on its final approach to the Bismarck airport.  Just as I was losing sight of the Cessna, I looked back to my right and spotted a silver metallic object flying extremely fast in a straight line from East to West.  The object appeared to be disk shaped, similar to a double-convex lens if looked at from a side view.  The object was approximately 1/4 mile to the North and appeared to be flying at a lower altitude than the Cessna had been, I estimate about 300 to 400 feet above ground level.  I believe the airplane would have been moving at about 80 knots, therefore, I would estimate the disk shaped object was moving at between 500 and 700 mph, as I lost sight of it within 2-3 seconds.  The object appeared to be a little smaller than the airplane, approximately 18 feet in diameter.I am an amateur radio operator and trained weather spotter.  I have taken fixed wing flying lessons and have built and flown R.C. model aircraft for many years.  I am familiar with most types of aircraft and I have seen anything in the sky like this before.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone whith this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally lucid and eloquent.

I was heading eastbound towards Kingman, Az.  . I was approximately one mile West of Landon Drive. Just past the last run away truck ramp.Directly in front of me, I observed what appeared to be a very large shooting star near the horizon line directly in front of me (Over the black mountains.) The falling star was very bright and lasted for approximately three seconds. It appeared to be falling in and West to East direction. The coloration of the falling star was a bright greenish color.The falling star appeared to pass behind the mountain range from my point of view. Approximately one or two seconds later, I observed a large flash that illuminated the eastern horizon behind the mountains for less than a second. The flash was similar to heat lighting.This lead me to believe that the object actually struck the ground.  Or, can falling meteorites cause lightning bursts?

The 2 distinct glowing items were around the size of a thumbnail at arms length. Their glow was diffuse so that they did not look yo be a sharp singular point of light but more like a glowing object.It was hard to discern their altitude. But there was an impression that they were close because of their speed. This did not really seem close because of their speed. They took around 20-30 seconds to travel across the sky. At the end of their course through the sky the lights crossed and then split into 3 before going behind a tree.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I wonder whether or not other people saw it.At about 1 minute before midnight, I looked out the window of my bedroom in the 1st floor apartment I live in with my family, up at the sky in the direction of the apartment buildings about, I&apos;d say, a few hundred meters away. I wasn&apos;t looking for anything in particular, just wanting to enjoy the night sky.I glimpsed what I first thought to be a half-moon. It was about a semi-circle in shape, though with further inspection it seemed like one of the corners of the semi-circle was elongated. The color was kind of a really light orange, and I remember thinking, &quot;Hm... The moon looks rather golden...&quot;  The position of the object was just over the top of two of the buildings, positioned kind of in-between then but above. The apartment buildings were about 20 stories tall.Then, I thought I could see the object quivering, like when an image projected onto a wall by an over-head projector quivers when the projector is lightly touched; it was like it was hovering, or something. And the outlines of the object were also kind of blurry. Also, when I shifted perspective, the object also changed position in my sight like any object in normal distance, completely unlike a body at moon-distance.I was confused, but then it seemed like my subconscious had already come to the conclusion that it was not the moon, because then I realized that it was much too large to be the moon, and the color was off, anyway.At the time, I just tried to put it out of my mind, and returned to my own business. Then, at 0:14 of the 3rd of May, just 15 minutes after, I looked outside again, unable to resist my curiosity. To my absolute astonishment, the object had shifted, like the moon was setting, or something. Now, it was positioned at about the top floor of second-top floor of the apartment building; I don&apos;t remember clearly which. That was when I came to the conclusion that it was definitely not the moon or any ordinary celestial body.Furthermore, it the edges of the object looked very blurry or scattered, like I was looking at it through tears, but the buildings did NOT look like that; only the object. I had mixed feelings at that point, kind of scared, kind of curious, and kind of uncertain, as well as wondering if there was anyone else seeing the same thing. I was working on my computer, and it briefly occurred to me to use my web-cam to shoot some footage; I have no idea why I didn&apos;t.I looked away again, again trying to put it out of mind. Then, a while later, I looked out the window again, trying to catch a glimpse of it. It was gone. It couldn&apos;t have been more than a few minutes since I had last looked. Now that its blurry light was gone, I could see that in between those two apartment buildings, there wasn&apos;t much of a gap at all that I could see from my vantage point; definitely not wide enough for me to see the entire Object. (I think the reason I didn&apos;t notice that when the object was still there was simply because my attention was riveted on the object.) But then that begged the question, &quot;How could the Object have remained visible to me when  it appeared to have lowered to the level of the top two floors?&quot; Unless it was in fact in FRONT of the buildings. That could only mean it was an UFO, right?  Hopefully, someone else also saw it and have photo/video evidence.", "I got the attached picture from a weather satellite frame (GOES 10) http://satelite.cptec.inpe.br/acervo/loop/loop.jsp?id=5726&amp;idFonte=61&amp;top=3&amp;idProd=2011&amp;idProjecao=2 ).Near  45&ordm;05&rsquo;S and 59&ordm; 12&rsquo;W exactly at 14:45 UTC you can see a little spot which enlarged at 150% zoom looks like an diamond shape UFO beneath earth add GOES10.", "Possible Blimp?I first saw an object moving slowly with the wind south of Amstelveen-Amsterdam,Netherlands.

The blimp then slowly halted and remained stationary for 30-40 seconds.Then in awe I observed the blimp roll on its side and slowly &apos;peel off&apos; over school/college/office buildings. I beleive that at this point the blimp climbed at 15-20m/s perfectly vertically and disappeared into the cloud covered sky.I had drunk two pints of lager, but I believe that what I saw was not imaginary.  I was within 400 meters of the blimp and although I was in a poorly lit street, the internal illumination made it look just like a blimp with a thin non-metal skin.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I think I was looking at the pine tree seen in the video first, then i noticed what i thought was a balloon. Didnt think much of it at first till i noticed it wasnt moving with the air how a balloon would typically do. I&apos;ve seen balloons float before in the area because people usually have partys around holidays or on the weekends and they always float in a north east direction and these objects were and stayed in  a south east direction from where we were standing. Thats when i told my brother if he was seeing what Im seeing and I told him how it was weird how its kinda just sitting there. that when i started recording and i noticed it was moving back and forth, told my brother and he noticed it too. We noticed it was moving back and forth because of the tree. Of course the tree is stationary and you can see in the video how the star/balloon UFO was moving back and forth. my brother ran inside to get the tripod kuz it was difficult to zoom and focus of the object, then we lost it. I continued to look for it up in the sky and found it again, I tryied recording it but it was too small to focus on.

We all saw a bright orange light moving roughly from west to east, and we stopped all of our festivities (musicians included) to watch.  The fireworks for the evening had ended several minutes before. The sighting took about 4-5 minutes before the sphere was out of sight.  It flew (floated) directly over the restaurant. I estimate its height to be no more than 4,000 feet above the ground. The object appeared small, maybe a few meters across, and, just like last year&apos;s sighting, emanated a fuzzy orange color that looked a lot like a plasma.  There was no sound, and several other attendees said they had also seen the same kind of event last year.From there, I walked back to my home, and continued to look for more orange lights.  I wasn&apos;t disappointed.  I sat on my rooftop, and after about 5 minutes, another orange sphere came from the north and traveled almost exactly south, until it was out of sight.  It floated quite a distance away over the ocean.  So from where I live, I was looking directly west.  There was no sound. About two minutes later a third orange sphere, this time maybe 300 yards closer to my home, floated by, north to south. Again, no sound.  These orange spheres were then followed by two red spheres, each about two to three minutes apart, and each one slightly closer to my home, by what appeared to be equal distances.  It looked as though they were all following a specific north to south direction in a grid pattern, all of the objects acting together.If I take all of the spheres as one complete sighting, then the sighting lasted a total of about 30-35 minutes.", "Bright large white ball of light fell through clouds and pulled up then vanished of IBM headquaters in Portsmouth in the UKI am a taxi driver (obviously sober).

It traveled down through the clouds and dropped very quickly downwards in a 70 degrees angle but pulled upwards at about 100 feet but disappeared from view over the motorway bridge toward IBM North Harbour buildings.  So not to coerce each other about what we saw, man in back told the other rear passenger what he saw and I told my front passenger what I saw.  We then both concluded we saw the same event at the same time.  freaked us out.  Was far to fast for a helicopter, and the movement was to fierce for a jet or plane when it pulled up.

On Sunday night March 15, 2009 at approximately 8:15 p.m., we were sitting on our balcony with a southeast view out toward the Caribbean Sea.  My wife and I both noticed an orange ball of light moving at three times the speed of a satellite heading due North parallel to the ocean.  The light seemed a bit hazy or fuzzy in appearance. The light also seemed to slow down and it zigzagged in an S shape before speeding off.  Within five to ten minutes we then saw another light in approximately the same location.  So after the second light, we really started to keep an eye out.  Over the course of the next three hours we spotted an additional fifteen to twenty more of these lights.  Sometimes they were by themselves other times they would appear in twos or threes.  Some would move across the sky and then stop completely and reverse direction two to three times before continuing back in a northward direction.  They would also tend to get fainter as they slowed down or stopped.  One light even appeared to travel below a cloud when we thought that it would have traveled above the cloud out of our view.  There was no sound and speed would change as they crossed the sky.

I guess my first question is, has anyone reported something odd in the sky over the NW Indiana today (4/30/09).   I ask this because myself and another person witnessed a strange object moving very slowly beneath the heavy cloud cover.   The object was dark color and very large.  I first thought the object was a low flying jet.  Then I realized it was moving way to slow.    As we watched this thing we kept asking each other what we thought it was.  We vocally passed ideas to each other that it was a helicopter, Balloon, Blimp but the shape was all wrong for any of these aircraft. We couldn&rsquo;t figure out what it was.The movement was SLOW, very slow.  Had it been a big jetliner it would have fallen out of the sky, it was moving that slow.   The shape was sort of round but more elongated or cigar shaped and the color was dark greyish black.  There was no sound and we saw no lights of any kind.It was well below the very heavy cloud cover and it was extremely easy to see as it passed behind the tall leafless trees in the distance.  As for the distance from it to where we were was about 400-800 yards.  I know this sounds like it was pretty far away but the size of this thing was quite large.  Someone else had to see it.    I kept comparing it to the Semi Trucks traveling below it and how much bigger it was and wonder what the hell it was.The object was moving in an easterly to south easterly direction.    After about 3 to 4 mins of watching it, it stopped and looked as if it was turning (North) and we thought is was going to come toward us.  But it immediately zipped way at a much faster speed due south and out of our sight.I have no idea of what this object was and it has left me wondering about we saw.      One thing we both kept saying to each other was that the outer shape was obscured or had a fuzzy appearance.   What I mean by this, is for some reason we couldn&rsquo;t make out a clear outline of the object.    It was like when you look at the road on a hot day and you see the heat waves coming of the road creating a watery appearance.    You could see it but it was very hard to focus on.Let me know if anyone has seen anything like this or if anyone has reported seeing this strange object over northwest Indiana today on April 30th 2009 at approximately 3:00 Pm or a little afterwards.Thank you for your time", "Three anomalous stationary lights over Bowie for over an hour.At 0505 EST I went out on my balcony for my morning cigarette before getting ready for work. My balcony is on the second floor with a southwest-facing view. This was early morning so the sky was very dark and the conditions were calm and clear. As I looked to my far right I saw three lights in the sky. One white light was on the left and to the right were two white lights fairly close together. The two lights on the right were both strobing in regular frequency, but never disappearing between strobes. The three lights maintained the same distance between each other giving the impression that they were all connected. There are normally many aircraft in the sky and my location is within the southeast approach to Baltimore-Washington International Airport. I can also see planes on approach to Andrews Air Force Base to my southwest. My immediate reaction was that this was a C-17 Globemaster (which I have seen on approach to Andrews from my office outside the Beltway) banking very slowly away from me on approach to Andrews. As I continued to watch the lights however, they appeared to be stationary and at a slight angle &ndash; the left light maybe 15 degrees lower than the two right lights. I am familiar enough with aircraft to know that this is not a conventional landing light configuration for fixed-wing aircraft and deduced that a fixed-wing aircraft would also not bank indefinitely. There were no red or green navigation lights also making me suspicious that this was not a fixed-wing aircraft. With the distance between the left and right-side lights at approx. 150-200 feet, I deduced that this was also too large to be a helicopter. I estimate the horizontal distance of the lights from my position at about 2-3 miles at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. The configuration and position of the lights never changed; the two lights on the right continued to strobe in regular frequency. I continued to watch the lights for 20 minutes &ndash; never changing formation. I hopped in the shower and got ready for work. I was looking forward to daylight so that I might get a better view of any mass associated with the lights. After getting ready for work approximately 40 minutes later (60 minutes total), I returned to the balcony to find the lights exactly as they had been &ndash; same three lights, same angle, same formation, and same strobing. At this point it was now 0605. I left the house and drove across Route 301 to the gas station to fill up. The lights were still in the sky and daybreak was setting in. I proceeded in my car heading westbound on Route 50. As I looked out the driver&rsquo;s-side window, I noticed that the lights were in front of me on my left-hand side (southwest). At this point daylight was setting in and I could make out grey mass associated with the lights, however, driving in 80 mph rush hour traffic meant that I had to pay attention to the road and I lost visual. While I thought this might have been a large blimp such as the Skyship 600, this was inconsistent with the grey mass which appeared more cigar-shaped from my cursory observation. When I arrived at work, close to Route 50 and the Beltway, I looked in the general direction from my office and was unable to see the lights. After discussing the incident with a couple of co-workers I conducted an online search for &ldquo;lights over Washington DC&rdquo; thinking perhaps others might have reported witnessing the same event. I came across the incident report on ufocasebook.com from October 26, 2005. This report shared similarities with my experience in terms of number of lights and formation. They were able to get close enough to see a Blackhawk helo along with two lights and witnessed vertical and horizontal movement. I did not witness any movement at all and while I did see grey mass associated with the lights, I was unable to make any concise determination as to shape while driving down the highway. When I arrived home that evening, I plotted the trajectory from my balcony in the direction of the lights (which obviously were no longer there) based on the corner of a Kohl&rsquo;s department store across the street. The trajectory caught me off guard seeing as it crossed from the southeast side to the northeast side of Route 50 &ndash; I thought it would have been southwest. While driving down Route 50 on my way to work I witnessed the lights on my left (southwest of my position). I also did a little local research to see if any strange events were reported in the media. Well, something did happen the previous night (Feb 26) at 2200 hrs. An 81 car train carrying coal had derailed in a residential area of Bowie. In the derailment, 13 cars had skipped the tracks and tipped over including the locomotive. The incident is almost consistent with my trajectory of where the lights had been. However, the derailment occurred on the NORTH side of Highway 50, while I witnessed the lights on the south side of Highway 50. If this was a series of helicopters, how were they able to stay stationary in perfect formation for over an hour? Why would they be so high in the sky if they were monitoring an accident? And why would they hover over a residential area for that long that early in the morning? It just doesn&rsquo;t add up for me. I have no idea what the anomalous lights were. If there is some type of aircraft that does have this lighting configuration I would really like to know. So far, I have no answers.

It was a normal morning at my place of work.  I opened the door to the outside to take a deep breathe of the cold morning air to help wake up.  I happened to notice what I thought was a meteor entering the atmosphere from the East coming in from the North.  I wanted to tell the others because it looked like a good one.  I decided just to watch it because it would be gone if I yelled for the other two people who were working.  It was coming in from the north and I was looking to the east it had a tail and appeared exactly like a shooting star or meteor. But then it appeared to turn east and as it came closer it had 3 circular lights in the middle of it in a row.

After about an hour of being out under the stars and clouds, I spotted a stationary light towards the east start to move, at a similar speed as satellites do in the night sky.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but the speed of the &quot;satellite&quot; seemed to be varying.  I remember thinking, &quot;no way, if that&apos;s a UFO I am going to flip.&quot;  The light then completely turned and started moving 90 degrees in a different direction.  That&apos;s when I got giddy!  And it continued its erratic flight for a good four or five minutes, increasing and decreasing in speed, even stopping every so often for a couple seconds, zig-zagging around the same area in the sky, and changing directions quickly, too fast for a plane to be capable of doing by my estimates.

At times the white lights comprising the circles, measuring perhaps 2 feet in diameter each, blinked and occasionally each circle would seem to disappear for about 10 seconds and then reappear.  The circles appeared to &quot;dance&quot; in the sky and the display in its entirety lasted for about 5 minutes. The circles then moved on, flying over the golf course and heading toward Fashion Island.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Almost exactly the same craft.My wife, child and I were visiting my Father-in-law today at his place by Medina Lake here in San Antonio, Texas. I took my daughter on a small tractor ride through a dense wooded area about a mile from the lake itself. My daughter was on my lap steering when she suddenly pointed up at this object directly in front of us about 100 yards and around 30 feet off the ground. She turned around quickly and hid her eyes on my shoulder as I tried to stretch my leg out to get my cell phone out of my pocket and take pictures. I was extremely nervous that it was so clearly in plain view and that I knew I needed to get the pictures. But not being able to take my eyes off of the object made for fumbling fingers and tight pockets, not to mention that my daughter was scared to death. This whole process from first sighting to getting the cell phone out took about 7 - 9 seconds. By that time the object tilted slightly and the sun light gleemed off of its surface as it disappeared. I tried to see a trail but there was nothing. I told my daughter to relax and when we got back and told everyone they said we were pulling their legs. But it happened. The entire sighting lasted an estimated 11-12 seconds. NOTE: I DID post this to a different website earlier tonight but forgot that there WAS an aura or fuzziness to the stability of the crafts &quot;flight&quot;. I apologize for this error. 1. The craft (object) was semi-circular 2. A mercury - mirror type shell 3. Slight protrusions from top center and maybe bottom as well.4. No sound 5. No lights 6. No windows 7. Slight acidic taste to faint odor (may have been any number of outside scents though) 8. No exhaust trail visible 9. Craft (object) was around 12-15 ft side to side and 5-6 ft top to bottom 10.

AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE A COMET, BUT IT REMAINED STATIONARY WITH STREAKS OF FLAMES, SO TO SPEAK, COMING OUT OF THE LOWER RIGHT SIDE OF THE GLOWING OBJECT.   IN AN INSTANT THE FLAMES STOPPED, IT REMAINED GLOWING FOR AN INSTANT, THEN LOST IT&apos;S GLOW AND LOOKED LIKE ANY SMALL AIRCRAFT, AS IT&apos;S LIGHT LOOKED NORMAL, EXCEPT THAT I DIDN&apos;T SEE AND STROBE LIGHTS OF ANY KIND LIKE YOU WOULD SEE IN A REGULAR AIRCRAFT.

It wasn&rsquo;t something from this planet and somebody or something was in control of it.It was like it came out of now where, but I wasn&rsquo;t afraid and I don&rsquo;t know why I wasn&rsquo;t afraid I just wasn&rsquo;t.  The light was very calming not blinding at all When it got close to me before hitting the ground it veered up what seem like just above the trees and I watched it as it disappeared into the distance.

The lights were about a quarter of the size of the moon and appeared to be 1.5 miles away from us (witnesses).  I estimate they were .5 mi. above ground level.  The two objects first hovered stationary for over a minute and seemed to move independently of each other.  They then spiraled upwards around each other, then floated back down to a similar altitude as before.  They rested in this position for approx. 5 seconds then shot straight up out of sight.  No noise was recognized as being related to the objects.  I believe them to be two separate objects because when spiraling around each other nothing blocked the light produced by the other.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There was a 1.1 mile loop that I ran several times a week.  On a cool day sometime in the spring I was running up a large hill near a local middle school.  I looked up at a large cumulus type cloud and noticed what looked like a tiny silver sphere hovering next to the upper right part of the cloud.  It was very shiny, reflecting the sun like a car would on a sunny day.  I immediately stopped running and stared at this object trying to figure out what I was looking at.  I could tell the cloud was moving slowly towards me, but the object seemed to remain stationary.  After a few moments the object moved to the left, appearing to go inside of the cloud.  It stayed hidden for a few seconds, then moved right and again hovered in the same spot.  I watched it for a few moments, and it seemed to begin to move vertically very slowly.  Then it again moved left into the cloud and didn&apos;t emerge for what felt like several minutes.

They were flying together, but not in straight and level flight. They were moving up and down and weaving in and around each other.The objects were flying at the bottom of some low clouds, sometimes visible and sometimes hidden in the clouds.After viewing them for 15 seconds I grabbed my Nikon 12 x 50 binoculars from just inside the patio door.I was able to view them again for another 30 seconds before they were out of view. I was able now to see more detail.They were round circular flat objects, which appeared to taper down from the center to a fine sharp edge. I was not able to see any lights or windows, because of my distance from the objects. The diameter of the objects is difficult to determine but I think they probably were less than 50 ft in size.The objects continued to fly North above the 205 freeway area and disappeared from view.Total viewing time Aprox. 45 seconds.", "Strange low flying lights over Seward Park in Seattle, Washington on March 25, 2009.OK, this was a strange night.  After walking my dog at Seward Park, we sat at the picnic table near the clay studio so my dog could have his treat break.  It was about 8:00 p.m., the sun had already set and the stars were finally coming out.  I&apos;m fascinated with stars and as usual, I am looking up at the Big Dipper in the Northeast direction.  As I glanced at the I-90 Bridge, a flash of light caught my eye above and north of me.  I noticed that there was a small light followed by a larger light flying directly behind the smaller light, if I had to guess, the lights seem to be four blocks apart from one another, it was moving slowing to the east and it didn&apos;t seem to be more that 600-800 feet above the evergreen trees of the park.  As I pondered where the these planes came from and why they were so low, I realized that they were too close to be flying behind one another.  I noticed that they moved at the same speed and the distance between the two lights never shifted but remained straight across from one another.  In addition, there were no strobe lights as there are on all airplanes and helicopter&apos;s (as far as I know) and the most amazing thing was that there was absolutely no sound at all.  All this I described happened within a minute of me noticing the lights and I was chatting with my mom on the phone at the time and told her I was pretty sure I was seeing a actual UFO.  Although it was not completely dark I could see there was no outline of a vehicle between the two lights, however, it was just too strange that the lights moved as if they were connected to something.  The only example I can offer is this, if you see a ship on the ocean at night and there was a light on the front of the ship and another on the back of the ship, you would not see the ship but you&rsquo;d know that there must be a ship out there because the light spacing never changes.  I could see that the larger light was globe like with either vents of blue light or some feature that I was unable to clearly make out at t! he dista nce I was at. However, I could see there was something more to the light.  As the UFO disappeared over the tree going east, my mom grabbed her camera and because her house sits on a hill over near the airport she was able to see the lights as I had described and she said that she could see them going a little below the tops of the Cascade Mountains going south.  Then she lost them.  A minute later she was again able to see the two lights heading south.  They still appeared to be near the Cascade Mountains.  I hope there was others who reported this because it was truly an amazing sight for me and I will always regret not carrying my camera or binoculars.

We noticed off in the distance North of Ester Dome, West of Fairbanks, in between Ester Dome (which has all of fairbanks communication towers) and Murphy Dome (which is a unmanned radar tracking station for the Air Force.)Some flickering semi red tinted lights that were moving slowly to the sky.  They seemed to follow one another then one just faded away.  We now only have 3 flickering UFO&apos;s.  They got into a formation that resembled orions belt.  They just hovered for about 6 min.  The one on top seemed to then move East the other 2 went North and faded out.  The one that moved east then faded out.  I don&apos;t know what they were but I never have  seen any activity in that area from the Airforce or anyone else for that matter. We heard no helicopter sounds, no sounds at all from that direction.  But we could hear jets taking off at our airport all the way across town.  We have lived here all of our lives and never have seen anything like this.  I would like to contact the FAA but they probably think I am crazy.  So here is our post.

When I was about to get into the car I spotted some bright greenish light coming from above. I looked up, and then I clearly saw a somewhat huge disk of light floating steadily. It was over a Caracas zone called El Marques. It floated for around 30 seconds, maube a little bit less, and then, suddendly, like a breeze, it did move very very fast and, in less than a second, dissapeared flying straight toward the Avila mountain, (north of Caracas). Two other people at the parking lot also spotted it like me. I am 47 years old. The other two males are a little bit younger than me. The fun part was that the dog in the parking lot started to run, like wanting to chase the giant disk, right after it dissapeared. My heart it&apos;s still ponding.

Then we realized he actually saw the fireball not just the light flash like we did.He drew a picture of it for us and it was a roundish, white orb, with some red near the tail, with a tail about as long as the orb.  If you circle your finger in the OK sign that is how big he described it as being before it went behind the mountain, it was traveling approximately in the same direction we were west, but was out of sight quickly since we were in the foothills of the Black Range it was lost behind the mountain too quickly for the rest of us to see it.I could tell it was very big just due to the light it emitted.", "Simple truth as seen.

My seven year old was riding with me when he pointed to a tall water tower that he thought was interesting to our left (Looking East).  The sun was just setting off in West.  My son looked in another direction and I happened to glance at the tower which was inside the states prison campus.  I noticed just above it in the sky near the tower and there were two shiny silver objects like what you see on TV (saucer shaped) shiny silver. At first I thought it was planes because TF Green is nearby, but then I looked back at the road (because I was driving) for a second.  I turned back to my left (looking South Eastward) and the the two objects which were diagonal from each other jolted upward just a bit and shrunk out of sight vanishing into the blue sky.  It was a clear section of the sky too.  So there was really no clouds to hide behind.  They jolted upwards and vanished.  I watched this with my own two eyes.

I have to tell you that our military and government makes me so mad. Everything has to be a cover-up with them. Maybe they should be more honest with us; don&rsquo;t we at least deserve that? I was 17 years old and I was teaching a Pop Warner cheer squad on a football field out in Goodyear. There were also other Pop Warner cheer and football teams there practicing. I don&rsquo;t remember the exact time but it was between 8:30 P.M. and 9:30 P.M. from what I remember. There weren&rsquo;t less than 500 people there easily, parents, coaches and kids. I noticed that in the field next to us there were several bright lights, almost like street lights. I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to them because they weren&rsquo;t moving and it wasn&rsquo;t interesting. It did get interesting though when they starting floating towards the field where all of us were practicing.Everyone just seemed to stop and look up. It couldn&rsquo;t have been more than 200 to 300 feet above us. We couldn&rsquo;t see anything; it was just dark like the night sky. We just saw that the lights moved together in perfect formation and floated right over us until it faded off, almost like it disappeared. I didn&rsquo;t really pay attention to its shape because it was so large in circumference, and so close to us. The lights were not too close together, but close enough together that we could see that it was an object. It also made no sound at all.I am angry because the military says that the lights were caused by flares. That is crap. Do they think we&rsquo;re stupid? Last time I checked, flares could not stay in perfect formation with each other, as if they were connected. And I also wasn&rsquo;t aware that flares could float over a crowd of people without moving up or down, and then all go out at the same time. These lights all went out together, at the same time as if they disappeared.

I was able to see structure on the underside; it appeared to look very like a starship as you would imagine it to be with various pipes, channels, etc. running underside.   There were dim yellow lights at the apex of the angles of the triangles, 3 in all.  The thing moved totally silently from west to east in no hurry; I would estimate no more than 50 mph.  It was HUGE.  Wife and I both exclaimed amazement to each other at the size and silence of the thing and the dim yellow lights and the structure on undercarriage of the thing.

I was outside on my back porch smoking a cigarette, when I noticed what I thought to be the light of a plane to my left. (west or south/west) then I notice it wasn&rsquo;t moving so I thought it to be a star, however too bright to be, then I remembered my wife telling me of an asteroid that recently passed earth.  So, I began to think that&rsquo;s what I was seeing, for it was too big and bright to be a normal star.  I then heard what I knew was an airplane coming from behind me heading towards the same direction.  (I was in the back porch and the flight line is about ten blocks in front of my house give or take.) At that time I notice the &quot;star like&quot; light rise, then I began to notice a flashing light from the bottom left and the airplane was passing under it.  The object began to slowly move to the right in front of me.  As it did it did the airplane was coming up on the object and the plane looked different from what I was used to at night.  I definitely could identify the airplane, a little further away than the object, in a normal flight path that I usually see them.  For airplanes tend not to fly too close over base housing from what I&rsquo;m used to.   However the plane was darker than usual. The object moved at a slower pace closer to me, allowing the plane to pass below it.I thought it was a helicopter, trying to convince myself with the fact that it was a hovering light in the distance at first. But there was no chopper sound, for it how close it was.  I then noticed the dark outline similar to a large helicopter or even a shoe.  I saw a bluish light on what would be the tail of the helicopter. The bright light was now towards what would be the windshield of the helicopter now a little dimmer since I believed to be seeing it from the side, a blinking light under the rear and a red light on the bottom towards the front about a third of a distance from the front.  The lights were definitely brighter than the plane.I also saw that the lights of the object were projecting on the body of it. Giving me somewhat of an idea of how the body was shaped other than a silhouette. So as it flew away to my right, (East, north/east) it was very wide in the back.  The bluish light still visible.  The bright light dimmer, but still visible.  Narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. And a smaller blinking white light towards the left center of the rear. Reddish light also still visible, but also dimmer.  There was also a glow coming from the center of the object, running in a line almost the entire rear.  I believe it could have been interior lights or just the exterior lights projecting on the outside curvature.The reason I believe it to be strange was the fact that the airplane was darker than I was used to and also that it appeared to be there only to make a sound everyone was familiar with to make up for the strange object in the night sky tonight.  Also, the fact that it was close enough for me to see the outline and the lights projecting on the outside and the fact that it was hovering for about five minutes.  But considering the hovering and the distance of the object, there were no sounds of a helicopter, nor any other aircraft coming from this particular object.   As it flew away the plane was ahead of it to the left.That was about two hours ago.

It stopped,and a smaller red star dropped out of the bigger blue star.The bigger blue star continued moving towards her. Midway into her back yard it shot straight up into the sky and disappeared. She turned and watched the red one slowly start coming her way. She started backing up towards the light on her porch. The red star moved slowly towards her,kept moving,but even slower as it came over her. She heard a low humm coming from the red object only.She felt that she was being observed. She figured the hell with it(she has seen so many in her area)that she waved at the red star twice. On the second wave she stated bye,and it took off straight up towards the Southeast sky into a pinpoint and was gone.During this whole experience her dogs where barking uncontrollably.

Source does not indicate the duration of sighting.  PD))", "On August 5, 1975, at 6:31 P.M., while I was riding a bicycle, I stopped, along with my friend to watch a beautiful UFO. It was undergoing some changes in function. It was generating brownish-gray smoke back and forth among chambers/holes on its surface. The holes were about 12 inches in diameter each and formed a matrix (grid) pattern spaced 2 feet apart. In the first instance viewing the holes, there were about 25 holes (secont time: 20 holes, third time 9 holes). The craft was semi-egg-shaped, but perfectly oval, not irregular shaped not smallish on one end as with an actual egg). It was about 250 feet long and 150 feet in diameter, about the size of eight houses. It was at first about one-half mile high distant from me, and later moved on about a mile. It seemed very close and very plainly visible to me. It was travelling at the speed of about 20 mile per hour. The smoke was being transferred from each chamber hole to each other chamber hole (as if trying to hide the whole craft maybe, or to generate the propelling system function).A fine cloud or mist of semi-frozen gas, like frozen carbon monoxide or frozen oxygen, nitrogen, helium, amonia, hazy neon, or other gas covered most of the craft, but would be partly covering at an area of one percent of its total surface for one minute while the rest was covered. The uncovered surface measured about 50 feet in diameter on the first uncovering and 40 feet in diameter on the second uncovering. The third uncovering (each uncovering was actually a clearing and diminishing of the misty gas which hid that particular area)was much smaller around 15 feet in diameter. While the partly covered area was visible, I could clearly see the functionality of the craft and watch it while it underwent changes in the skin covering (part of the function of the propelling or the disguise, possibly both a propelling and a disguise). I was aware that I should stare and focus because I knew that it was an important event I was watching. If I had had a picture camera or video camera I would have had an opportunity to capture very intensly important images of the craft and its peculiarities. As I watched for about 4 minutes the craft moved over the intersection at Broad Rock Road and continued travelling but got very fast and left a white cirrus cloud as it went very quickly away. This was a very clear warm day, sunny, with some cirrus clouds around the area of the sky. The sky was blue. The temperature of the air was about 90 degrees fahrenheit. The object left a trail but not necessarily a trail that it had generated, but a cirrus cloud which might have existed with or without the craft. The clouds of smoke of which I have alluded to seemed to be generated for the purpose of causing the craft to be visible or invisible at will as if the craft could manifest itself at will. Or, possibly the craft was absorbing the earth-born water clouds for fuel of some other purpose. I include my personal opinions because I think that my observations are inter-related with the experience, but not in the sense that I creat! ed the e vent in my own mind. I actually saw these things.", "Odd lightMy sleep was interupted by a bright light above my garage.  At first I thought it must have been some kids messing around with a light. I looked outside and the light had gone and there were no kids around.  Just as I was about to turn around I saw a bright white light zoom into the sky from behind the garage.

The vibrations rumbled the house, somewhat like when a loud clap of thunder shakes your house.  Then the object proceeded to take off corner ways to the house, it started out fast (faster then a jet plane), and gained speed, I ran down the hall to get a family memeber and by the time I looked out another window the object was gone, but the noise could still be heard.

The sky was completely clear, and as we were looking at the light, we noticed that it was moving slightly, back and forth. Then, it went out completely for a few seconds, and flickered back to light.

These objects flew side by side at a high rate of speed emitting no sound and leaving no vapor trail. They flew at a steady speed and at a constant distance apart from each other. There were no lights on these craft and seemed to be reflecting ambient light from the material they were made with. It resembled a semi polished aluminum or titanium. The craft flew in a North, Northeasterly direction.The speed at which the craft traveled was comparable to that of a low flying military fighter. The craft seemed to be approximately 20-25,000 feet in the air. I am no flight expert but it seemed to be at an altitude slightly higher than what a helicopter would fly.The craft appeared to be flying in a formation with one slightly ahead of the other.As stated before, these craft traveled without making a sound. I only noticed the objects because I had went outside to smoke and happened to be looking at the stars noticing what a clear night it was. The objects seemed to be round or a slight elliptical shape.This is the second time I have witnessed unidentified objects. The other sighting was approximately 17 years ago near Warrenton, VA. That sighting was confirmed by documentation with a government agency of other reports.", "Sighted an unusually bright light off of my balcony low on the horizon.

The object moved in a way that conventional aircraft cannot.  It would moved from side to side up then down while covering large distances in a split second.  When the object did move it would remain stationary until it moved again.", "I observed a hovering object along N.M. highway 11 south of Deming N.M. at 10:40 am for 15 minutes as I drove north.This sighting occurred while driving north on N.M. highway 11 between Columbus, N.M. and Deming N.M. near the Mexico/USA border.  I left the border town of Palomas, Mexico at 10:32 and had traveled approximately ten miles north on New Mexico highway 11, within a couple of minutes after passing thru a permanent Border Patrol check point I noticed an object in the sky to the north west of my traveling vehicle, at first glance I thought it was a commercial aircraft, after two or three minutes I became aware it was not moving.  I estimate the object was over 1000 ft. above the ground.  The object resembled a tube that was larger on both ends similar to having a 747 bulging cockpit on both ends size large but size relative to a 747 is unknown and I could not identify any wings, white on top shaded on the bottom and I observed the object for 15 minutes while I traveled. After about six minutes total time it was directly to my left and still not moving. I estimate its distance from the road to be four miles plus or minus one mile. As I continued moving I kept looking back, the object remained where I had originally seen it but it became harder to find as I was driving. when I was about eleven miles from Deming New Mexico I could no longer identify it. It may have moved or it was just to difficult to see in the scattered cloudy sky while driving at 60 mph. Please don&apos;t criticize my looking behind while driving, there was only scattered traffic and at least I never use a cell phone while driving.The strange part of this is the object did not move, it hovered or at least from a moving car it appeared to hover in one location throughout the entire time.I have an engineering degree and I firmly do not believe in alien aircraft. There were other vehicles on the highway that should have seen the object, the border patrol agents at the checkpoint may have seen the object although it would have been behind them as they faced the traffic they would be checking. What I saw is unidentified, at least by myself, Einstein&apos;s theories seem to preclude the possibilities of space travel and until somebody, as advance in their thinking as Einstein comes up with a better theory I will continue to not believe in space travel, but I saw what I saw.", "Bright blue-white round object moving south to north, very fastOn 03/15/2009 about 1948 hrs I was on my back porch looking at the sky.  My attention was drawn to an extremely bright, round object approaching from the south.  At first I thought it was a satellite, but it was too large, bright and fast.  The object was circular, bluish white in color, with a faint reddish corona-type effect around it.  Its&rsquo; speed was too fast for a satellite and too slow for a meteor.  The object&rsquo;s brightness remained the same as it passed overhead, traveling from south to north.  It did not flicker, sparkle or leave a trail as a meteor would and it made no sound.  There were commercial and general aviation aircraft in the sky at the time, and the object seemed to be much higher than the aircraft.  I watched it until it disappeared behind some scattered clouds that were forming to the north-east of my location.  The object changed its course slightly to the east just before it disappeared for good.

Yesterday, 03/04/2009, Wednesday, I was on my way to work. I was east of Neosho, MO, between Netonia, MO, and the MO hwy 86 and US 60 and MO 59 junctions. The exact time was 3:10 a.m.  The sky was clear and I could see stars.  As I passed East Newton High School on hwy 86 I looked in my review mirror and noticed two amber lights approaching me fron behind.  The lights approached me at a steady pace and then back off to keep distance between me and the amber lights.At first I thought someone was coming up on me without head lights on and just had their parking lights on.  As I had this thought, the amber lights came up behind me again this time very fast, I then tapped my breaks and slowed some.  I watched in my review mirror as I did this. My tail lights then illuminated the outline of what appeared to be a wedge shaped object behind me and the two amber lights where in the bottom front of it and the bottom front was wedge shaped like the front of a snow plow.I then sped up to 90 mph to get away and the object then dropped back about 10 car leangths. As I approached the intersection of MO rt H and hwy 86 the object was once again on my rear bumpper , with the amber lights glowing.The speed at wich it approached me was AMAZING. It was right behind me and a amber hugh then engulfed the car on the inside. As I looked in my review mirror I observed the amber lights on the front of the object look as if they shuddered. I could feel heat on my neck, arms,face, and back.I could also hear a very distinct humming sound.I continued to drive 80 and 90 mph until I approached a curve in the highway. when I hit my brakes hard and slowed for this curve.The craft then dropped back again and the amber hugh then left my car.As I went around the curve I observed the craft leave the road behind me and travel diagonal to the southwest from my position across a vast open field, but the amber lights were still facing my direction. The object was now about 150 yards to my left. It was now about treetop high.  The craft then continued facing my direction with the amber lights facing me and started moving to the southeast and climbing slowly as it did.  The craft then paused in mid air, turned were the amber lights now faced the northeast and shot up at an angle to the northweast horizon.  When the craft went to the northeast it was a very bright flash of amber light and a silver streak.  If I would have blinked I would have missed it.  That is how fast it left.", "i saw a bright light that i though was awfully bright, and low to the ground to be a normal plane. i also noticed there was no flashing light as normal planes have. i actually got close enough to where i had to look stright up to see it. and i noticed there were 3 lights in a triangular shape, and off to the side, outside of the triangle made by the lights, there was a small, flashing red light, it was a fraction of the size of the other lights. it appeared to be hovering, then it would move slowly, then stop then move again finnally it just keep going at a high rate of speed. then on my way back from where i went, i saw a nother craft coming from the area i saw the first craft heading, this was about 15 mins later. this craft was brighter had many small lights in a row, and one large bright in the front with 2 bright rapidly flashing lights.it was moving at a quick steady pace unlike the previous. the law these lights flased looked very similar to a normal planes&apos;.", "Strange fast moving silent orbs seen over South Dakota skies.Last night I went outside a little after midnight to let my dogs outside and water my strawberry plants.  When I was done watering my plants I leaned back on the trunk of my car to light a cigarette facing north, when I thought I saw a shooting star in the sky and did a double take.  This was unlike anything I have ever seen and was not any civilian or military plane at least not any that is publicly known.  It appeared to be one craft however I could not make out an outline of the object.  One very dim orb was leading the other dim orb except what made this so strange to me was that the orb in the rear was visibly offset  from the other, meaning it was not directly behind the first, almost diagonally behind and to the side of the first dim light.  It moved from east to west, then almost lost sight of it behind a big tree, but I ran excitedly to the other side and caught a clear view as it proceeded west until it faded off on the horizon line.  This object was extremely fast and did not make a sound. I ran inside after I lost sight of it, and grabbed my camera and walked westward for half an hour but was unable to see anything else.  It was very exciting, I am still very excited,  I live by a small airport and often film the airplanes, and growing up I lived by Forbes Field Air National Guard Base, one of the largest airstrips in the United States, and I would often see F-117&apos;s and B-2 Stealth fighters and bombers, even flying low and in formation in the day and at night, and though stealth&apos;s look very creepy at night and fly in triangular formations, I can identify them for what they are, and this was no military plane that I have ever seen.

The light was round and approximately 4-5mm in dia.Keep in mind that my dorm is roughly rectangular, three stories tall, and has a courtyard in the middle. All dorm rooms open towards the courtyard.So as I exited my room, the light was just above the line of the roof. My best guess as to cardinal direction would be West-Northwest, but do NOT treat that as anything but a guess. I can tell you that I could see the moon clearly from where I was standing, and that the light was below and to the right of the moon considerably.The light was moving slowly, but visibly, upwards. I would say it moved about 1mm up (to my eyes) every second or so; again, a guess -- I have a poor sense of distance.It kept changing color as well, and very rapidly at that -- at most, it stayed one color for 1/4 second, probably more like half that. Distinct colors were blue, white, and red, in that order. Very hazy, too -- its boundaries were blurry.

Each individual object looked identical to a faded star and but there were four all together that moved in a somewhat V-Formation.  3 moved in a straight line while one moved to the back left of the leading object, creating the V-shape perception. The lights remained constant, created no sound nor trail, held a constant shape and the lights were spaced out similar to the stars in O&apos;Ryan&apos;s belt.

I see those planes flying in a vector between south and southeast and I would estimate that the altitude is about 5000 feet when they pass the Dilhorne area.  I also see planes flying from east to west over Dilhorne at a similar height and assume that these are heading for Liverpool. These flights are controlled by the Manchester ATC people and are obviously coordinated to avoid any chance of a collision.At approximately 9.40 pm on Saturday 18th April 2009 I happened to notice headlights to the North similar to those of planes taking off from Manchester but coming from a point probably about 15 degrees east of the usual location.  Furthermore the headlights were orange, not the usual white. I will now refer to this plane as the object.  I then became aware that a Liverpool bound plane was passing almost overhead.  I must admit that I was somewhat concerned.  My vision of the orange light became obscured when the object passed behind my house and I had to move to the front of the house for a clear view.  The Liverpool bound plane cleared the collision point by about 10 seconds before the object reached it but it seemed as though the object had slowed down. Because of its unusual flight path and the orange light I was wondering if it might have been a helicopter.  However by the time that I reached the front of the house, the bright orange light had dimmed and I became aware that the orange light was in fact in the centre of an array of seven or eight lights forming a slender arc. The object made a slow sharp turn to the west and just a few seconds later disappeared.  I would estimate the trajectory at this point was about 40 to 50 degrees.  I have no doubt that the lights indicated that the object was saucer shaped.", "Light in the night sky following an airplane and then vanishing for no reason.  Cloudless night sky.First I was watching a small aircraft with headlight and flashing tail beacon then I noticed another light some distance behind it traveling roughly the same direction, however this one had no flashing light.   I thought it might be another airplane and I watched it for about 20-30 second and then it vanished.  The sky had no cloud cover and I can think of no reason why this light/craft would vanish suddenly.  I notice the same type of event two nights ago in the same area of the sky - west of Santa Rosa and fairly close.", "Observed pulsating multi-colored sphere 5 degrees above horizon south of constellation Orion.

It lit up the house roof line and several trees close to the house. It appeared to brighten and rise for only 10 seconds. It appeared almost as bright as a car headlight. Only the reflection of light was seen off the house and trees. No object was observed. This is the second time the same incident has occurred.

Law enforcement responded, and observed a light in the eastern sky, approximately 30-40 degrees above the horizon.  It appeared to be flashing red, green and blue in a rhythmic manner.  It appeared to be stationary.  Citizen advised that he had been watching it for approximately 15 minutes, with no change.  Law enforcement officer watched it for approximately another 10 minutes, with no apparent change.  Law enforcement officer checked NASA website and found that position of light observed appeared inconsistent with planned path of the International Space Station.

At first I thought it was a star, but it seemed way too large and bright.  The object appeared to be stationary at this time.  I did see an airplane flying by in a NW direction, at what appeared to be a much lower altitude than the large light.  By comparison it&apos;s lights seemed exponentially smaller that the bright object in the sky that I was focused on. The two did not seem to interact in any way. As I watched it began to look more like 2 stars very close together, then the space between the white lights appeared to grow larger. When the horizontal distance between them reached a certain size, the object began to move south toward where I stood. At this point I knew it was not stars, so I thought it might be an airplane, but it seemed strange that it had hovered in one spot for so long before moving, not to mention the way the lights went from looking like one light only to looking like 2. As it flew over me relatively slowly, I could see it was a matte silver color, and triangle shaped with 2 larger bright white lights approximately in the center of it and 2 smaller ones that were closer together and directly behind the 2 larger ones. It did not have the flashing red or blue lights that you see on airplanes. These lights did not blink at all. I think I could hear it as it flew above me, but the noise was very low, not nearly as loud as any aircraft I&apos;ve ever experienced that was flying that low. Also the sound was more of a deep low hum that the usual roar of an engine. And I think I almost felt the hum more than I could hear it. As it flew over the house. I ran back in the house, through the living room and out the front door. I should have been able to still see it somewhere in the sky, but it was nowhere to be seen. It was moving rather slowly when it flew above me, and it only took me a few seconds to get out the front door.!

My encounter took place in the back woods of Georgia in 1971.  I was visiting with some friends that were my age.  We were living in an isolated area that was home to 2 mobile homes.  There was myself, another boy and 2 girls.  There were no adults around at the time.  It was about 3PM and the 4 of us were sitting outside in lawn chairs removing peas from their pods.  We were just talking then out of no where a very large silver disk object appeared just above the treetops (Georgia pines) and approximately 50 yards away.  The object did not have any lights or make any sound it did have a large shadow.  The four of us saw the object at the same time and without saying a word to each other the 4 of us bolted to the inside of the mobile homes.  One boy and girl bolted into one mobile home and the other girl and I bolted into the other mobile home.  We still have not said anything to each other we were petrified.  When I got in the mobile home I grabbed a large knife out of one of the kitchen drawer and hid in a small closet in the kitchen that the garbage was kept in.  After what seemed a long period of time I finally got the courage and started yelling for the other girl that was in the mobile home with me.  She yelled back at me and we slowly left our hiding spots.  She was hiding under the bed in the first bedroom.  We eventually went back out and the disk was gone.  We then went into the other mobile home and got the boy and girl out of there.  When I returned home to Warner Robins AFB, GA the following weekend I shared my experience with my sister and she had told me that during the time I was gone there was a high level of UFO activity in the Georgia area.Why I would like to be hypnotized is to get a better idea of how long we were actually hiding in the mobile homes.  I have no memory of the actual time span that this took place.  I also believe I would be able to better describe the UFO under hypnosis.", "Large circular object stationary with very large white lights around it, more lights underneath &amp; above the circular lights.I was driving on the Taconic State Parkway North at approx. 11:20pm. I was in an elevated area where the road winds between hills, and I saw what I thought was a low flying plane. There&apos;s an airport in the area and we see the low flying planes landing all the time. When I rounded the curve in the road, the object was stationary up on top of the hill with very large white lights in a circle around the object. Every other light would dim as the others would brighten. There were lights underneath the object, and a few above the circle of blinking lights. It was about the size of 3 houses. I realized this was not an airplane being stationary and circular. I was alone, and too frightened to stop, and it was too close for comfort. I sped away. Returned the next day for an explanation - Just trees up on the hill.", "First 2, then 3 bright lights in the sky; lights eventually disappearedMy friend and I were heading home from Colchester to Barre after a night at the drive in.  We were on Interstate 89 heading south just past Exit 14 when I first noticed two bright lights in the sky.  I&apos;ve sat on the tarmack at O&apos;Hare airport enough to know what planes look like when they&apos;re &quot;stacked up&quot; waiting to land at night and have their &quot;landing lights&quot; on.  That&apos;s what I thought I was seeing.  After driving a few miles I could see a plane that was flying very low, coming in for a landing.  This was on the left side of the Interstate near the Williston exit, #12.  Looking to the right I then saw the lights, which I again thought were planes in line to land...but now there were three of the bright lights.  The two on the left were closer together than the one that was farthest to the right.  As we drove a bit further down the road either trees or hills blocked the view of that part of the sky.  I commented to my friend that it seemed very odd that Burlington airport would have 3 planes waiting to land...ever, let alone at that time of night.  He said he thought the lights were too close together to have been planes.  A mile or two down the road, the Interstate curves to the right as it goes down a hill...about 2 miles before the Richmond exit.  I figured that we would have a good view of the &quot;same&quot; sky when we got there and then we&apos;d have another chance to look at the lights.  However, we never saw the lights again.  The night sky was very dark, no moon...and no clouds.  I believe that, if the lights had been planes, we would have seen them again as they came in to land.  But we never saw or heard a plane landing (after the one we saw landing as we drove past the Williston exit.)  The lights appeared to be a almost an orange color, but a very yellow-white orange.  Size-wise, the lights appeared bigger than any star or planet I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky.  I can&apos;t say that I saw the lights moving at all, except for seeing 3 lights after earlier having seen 2.  I am reminded of looking a! t Jupite r with the naked eye...but about 4 times larger in apparent size and a corresponding increase in brightness.  The more I replay it in my mind the more I am reminded of how the planes looked at O&apos;Hare airport at night while they are in line waiting to land.  (They also don&apos;t appear to move when still far away in the sky because they are, in essence, heading directly at you.)

I didn&rsquo;t know what it was, so I didn&rsquo;t respond immediately to it, but kept an eye on it. The light was big enough to notice but the trees were making the light indistinguishable. As we continued to drive home, I then saw the lights much more clearly. There were four huge circular lights, each light being bigger than that of a streetlight, flashing - then would disappear, then one huge circular light would appear and disappear, then four more huge lights would appear, then disappear&hellip;and the cycle of circular flashing lights continued in that pattern: four then one. They continued to flash and move at a steady pace toward the south. My brother-in-law was amazed at what he saw and yelled, &quot;What is that?&quot;Neither of us knew for sure what we were seeing.  I had moved slowly down the road observing it, and then stopped completely in the middle of the road to observe this odd and unique sight.  After about one minute it just disappeared out of sight.

It was shaped like a square (8ft) that was dull grey in color.  It was 3:30 in the afternoon on Sat. the 14th of March.It was traveling about 45 miles an hour, headed north, just like us.  It either got larger, or closer as we began to see red, uneven coloring on the front of it, as if we were viewing a large TV screen.  We thought it was some sort of lettering, but not legible as it was blurry, not the object, but the face of it. We could see no depth to the object.  We followed it for about 1 mile and turned toward it, heading toward the bay so we could see it over the open water, but it disappeared by the time we got to the bay, about four blocks west.

I knew it wasn&rsquo;t a plane, although at first I thought it was because it had flashing lights like one. One light was white, the other red, and the other blue if I remember right.I haven&rsquo;t a clue how high up it was but it seemed a bit higher than the clouds and seemed small from a distance, and it was moving about as fast as a plane. No engine sounds although that didn&rsquo;t surprise me at all considering the height it appeared to be at.My assumption it was one of those spyplane things. Why it had flashing, blaring lights though when it&rsquo;s supposed to be spying is beyond me!

I had seen them before I went into the store, but didn&apos;t pay that much attention, thinking they were two planes together, because it was at a distance to where I was I only glanced that way and noticed it but went into the store as I was in a hurry and on the phone at the same time. When I came out of the store around 5 minutes later, the 3 amber lights were still there, hovering, not moving since I had gone in the store, in the same exact spot and they looked like they were twinkling. there were 3 distinctive lights. What I noticed was it seem way too large to be a plane on approach to SKY HARBOR {my son and I watch planes on approach all the time} when I was watching it intensely a plane was coming from the west and dwarfed in size to these three lights. If I had to estimate the size I would say 3-4 Jet plane size wise at least. Way to big to be a regular craft. Plus they were AMBER in color, not like any normal craft lights. It was not a helicopter as it was too far to be that big. And they run with white, green and red lights. As I was watching these 3 lights I called my son on the phone to try and see it, but he was in an area that the tree lines near our house blocked the view but because I was at the field at 51st and Olive I could see clearly the area it was hovering at. I stood there for 3-4 minutes watching then I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes as the lights started to twinkle brighter then dim then the center light went out first, then the one on the right, then the one on the left. It was not a plane or helicopter, nor was it a craft I have seen at any airshow I have been to in the last 30 years. The lights were in a line next to each other but what was weird is that it was parallel, or slightly above the nearby south mountain lights but not too far above the horizon. about .5 - 10 degrees abov! e the gr ound but more over the estrella mountains side of the southland.

I noticed the crescent moon, and filmed it for about 20 seconds, commenting on its beauty. Then a plane went by and I followed it with my camcorder. About three minutes later I wanted to get a better look at the moon, so I focused on it a second time, from the exact location. This time the crescent had a shadow about a 1/4 the way down from the right of the top, and it was moving! This shadow covered the entire area of the crescent, as if someone had taken a magic marker and drew a line through that section. For a second I thought maybe I didn&apos;t have a clear view, and that there was a nearby tree or something that was causing the shadow, so I pulled the camcorder away and verified that I had a clear view with no impediments. In those few seconds, the shadow had drifted upwards, and was moving quickly. I filmed it advancing until it was out of sight-- it was the exact color as the space around it, so I&apos;m not sure if the shadow was coming from below Earth and causing it, or the object was moving in front of the moon. Either way, it had to have been pretty large to cover that much of the moon.Within seconds of the shadow disappearing, I immediately noticed an unusually large number of aircraft around the moon, moving west to east, as if they were observing something. In ten minutes, I saw seven planes all on the right side of the moon where I had seen the cigar shaped shadow, and filmed two.While the sky had been relatively clear, when I went outside 40 minutes later, there was total cloud cover. I recall that at 21:00 I had filmed a couple planes that were emitting chemtrails, that I could barely make out due to the waning light. These trails were expanding into clouds. I filmed until 22:30, when I ran out of tape. Then at 23:00 I went outside with a new tape, and there was total cloud cover. For the next few hours I proceeded to listen to jets overhead until I fell asleep.I wanted to ad that the phenomena of planes making chem-trails which expand into total cloud cover had become so commonplace I don&apos;t bother filming it any longer. These planes are very well camoflauged, but they&apos;re noisy. They are two types but they follow the general description of having two engines, but the trail is emitted from the tail of the plane. It looks almost curly cue as it billows out of the end. In my opinion, some of these planes are spraying for moths and other perceived nuisance insects, and the other ones that are more camoflauged are producing convenient cloud cover for the passage of military planes.As I type this I am listening to the constant hum of jet engines, and there is total cloud cover in Bellevue this morning. Last week Monday it was clear and sunny at this time of the day, and apart from a passenger jet ever 7-10 minutes or so, there was not this activity.", "at around 7:20pm i steped ouside for a after dinner smoke. looked up to in the sky looking at the stars , and saw an extremly bright light not sure what it was but after about an half an hour of watching it, there was a quick bright flash to the right of it. aparently we are suposed to be seing venus right now, but it seemed to be way to bright and ive never seen anything so bright before, and well that quick flash just off to the right of it well that really got me thinking it was something else. i took pics bwith a 4 megapixel camera at full zoom pic looked diferent. can anyone help to explain this. it did seem to stay in one place for awhile. then move , then stop again then just went away just like the moon moves. thank u for your time and patience.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what caused the flash, alluded to above, but the bright light may have been Venus, we suspect.

Conditions were unusually clear, with no cloud coverage.  The stars were beautifully prominent.One of the witnesses observed a very bright light in the eastern sky, which initially he thought was a satellite.  The light was at an azimuth of approximately 80-100 degrees (true); angle of elevation was approximately 45-60 degrees (above the horizontal plane).The first witness called the unusual looking light to the attention of the other witness present, and they both stood, watching the object, as it coursed generally to the north, i.e., from their right to left.  It followed a flight path that was generally parallel to a horizontal line.  It was moving at approximately the same (angular) velocity that is seen for a typical satellite, i.e. approximately &frac12;-1 degree of arc per second.Suddenly, the light, which already was quite bright, e.g. brighter than the ISS when it passes directly overhead, flared up dramatically.  Following this dramatic increase in luminosity, and over the course of approximately 10-15 seconds, the brilliance of the object subsided to the size and illumination of a typical prominent low-orbit satellite, and the object continued its flight to the north.It was still visible at approximately an azimuth of 20 degrees (true), and at approximately 20-30 degrees angle of elevation.I have checked www.Heavens-Above.com, and no Iridium satellite was visible from the witnesses&rsquo; location for the evening of April 20, 2009.  Also, the ISS was not visible from the location on this date, and no Space Shuttle was in orbit on this date.My impression is that the object was not a tumbling booster (ullage) in orbit, many of which I have witnessed.  It was dramatically brighter than the many boosters I have witnessed, and there apparently was no regular periodicity to the flare-up of the object; it flared only once, during the observation.Note:  Both witnesses, who have normal color perception, had the impression that the object had &quot;color&quot; to it, when it flared dramatically.  The second witness reported that he thought he witnessed a &quot;purple&quot; tint to the light, during the flare-up, although the color change was subtle.Both witnesses are quite familiar with satellites in the night sky, and both have been witness to over-flights of the ISS, most recently on March 25, 2009, at 20:05 hrs. (Pacific) when both the ISS and Space Shuttle were visible, flying in formation, in the northern sky.  They had performed their undocking maneuver at 13:35 hrs., on that date.I remain mystified by this event.  If anyone can identify a satellite or ullage that would have been visible from our location, at the time and date indicated, I would be most grateful if you would please submit that information to NUFORC, so that they can post that information, to supplement this report.Thank you!", "Three red lightsI was in 8th grade and I grew up about 500 feet from Lambeau Field and my dad, brother best friend and I went outside to listen for the starting lineups when my brother noticed in the northeast sky 3 red lights the were horizontal in a line and then they slowly began to move and spread apart going from this . . . to making a vertical line up and down so like an I and then they were gone.

We were traveling west bound on a two-lane road, roughly 40 miles per hour.  We looked out of the drivers side window and noticed  the object.  It had multiple lights, probably around 5 or 6.  The majority of the lights were white but there was also one or two red ones located somewhere from the middle to the rear of the object.  At first we thought it was a plane, especially since there is a small airport located nearby, but it appeared to be stationary.  It was also extremely low but we were unable to hear any noise as we passed.   I couldn&rsquo;t say exactly how far off the ground it was, but the height was equivalent to an extremely tall oak tree.Now as we were both passing, we both started to comment on the object at the same time.  We both noticed how low it was and how it appeared to be hovering or moving at an extremely slow speed.  First instinct was that it was just a plane on it&rsquo;s way to the airport, but the speed, height, and sound just didn&rsquo;t add up to the normal sightings of planes in that area.  Then the thought was that it was possibly some kind of stationary tower, such as a cell phone.  So once we passed the object, we decided to do a u-turn and go back and get a second look.  We had trouble finding a good place to do this and finally just slammed the breaks on  and turned into the other lane.   By the time we got back to  the spot where it was located, the object was gone.In hind sight, I wish we had just slammed the breaks on the moment we saw it.  There were no cars directly behind us and I don&rsquo;t recall any other cars passing in the other lane at that same moment. I&rsquo;m also surprised  at how I felt.  There was no uneasiness or frightened feeling.  Just a feeling of confusion.  The area in which it was spotted is also heavily populated.

My husband was in the bathroom getting ready for bed (brushing his teeth).  Our house was silent, no tv on, no computer sound on. Both our kids were staying at friends homes.  I then heard this loud humming noise.  WOOoooWoooWOOoooWOOooo.  I looked towards the noise that was coming from behind the house.  I was frozen at what I saw.  There were double twin light beams coming from the sky, directly down to the ground.  The light was not dissipated as a flash light would be.  The beams were moving up and down within the beam itself.  There was both the noise and the double twin beams happening at the same time.  My husband came out of the bathroom asking what the weird noise was.  He thought that it was something on the computer or I had the tv on.  He looked towards the tv and the computer and seen there was no noise coming form either.  He looked at me standing by the large windows and said what was that noise?  The noise and the lights were gone, but he had heard the noise and it brought him out of the bathroom to question it.  He heard the noise over brushing his teeth and running water.   I told him about the lights and he believed me.  We have no noise out here.  We live on 25 acres with a few hundred acres of farmland, woods and crp land behind us.  Our house sits up on a hill with an unobstructed view of the sky.  Our sunroom has very large windows that go up to a peak.  I tell you this so that you can see that I had a very clear view of what I saw.  As far as the weather, it was snowing and the humidity was high.  Sound doesn&rsquo;t travel well in that kind of weather.  On days when it&rsquo;s calm and dry or cold, you can hear semis 4 miles south of hear humming down a highway.  This was not that.  The light beams had two separated strands on the left side going straight up and down from the ground to the sky.  The light beams on the right were also two separated light beams going straight up and down to the sky.  I looked up to see where they were coming from, but because of the snow, the beams went into what ever they call the low snow ceiling.  I then talked to my husband about what just happened.  We both went outside to listen for any more noise.  There was nothing.  Then he took his 10 million candlepower flashlight out and pointed it out in the backyard.  With a flashlight we did the same thing.  Both times, the light would spread out and you could see all the snow coming down.  With the double twin light beams that I witnessed, they were solid stands.  No breaking up of the beams, just straight lines down.   I then called my 19 year old daughter that was in the town 5 miles away and asked her if she heard/seen anything.  They were watching movies in her friends basement.  Nothing.   I decided that it did need to be reported, so after about 15 minutes, I decided to call the Rice County Mn non emergency sheriffs&rsquo; telephone number.  The dispatcher did take the call seriously.  She was nice about it and said that I did need to repeat the story to a deputy.  She transferred the phone to him.  I told him about what happed.  He was also great about what I told him.  I told him that I work as a librarian at a local high school, I don&rsquo;t drink and I don&rsquo;t smoke.  I am a middle age women that has 2 kids, a farm and would not make up what happened last night.  He had me describe in detail for their report, about what happened .  He said that there are too many reports world wide of this stuff happening for some of it not to be real, and the universe is too large for us to believe we are the only one here.     I felt the need to report this to them, and I also feel the need to report this on your sight also.  I did go outside this morning to see if there was any visible sign on the ground to where the beams were touching, but I could not see any.  It did snow about 2 to 3 inches overnight.  I hope this info helps.((NUFORC Note:  The witness, who submitted this report, appeared on the Jeff Rense Radio Program at 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 14, 2009.

We both saw it from inside of our car.We were driving back home to Montgomery County in Maryland from Howard County in Maryland on Route 108. We were driving from the east to the west, specifically from the northeast to the southwest, more or less.SEE MAP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Route_108    I believe we were still in Howard county around the town of Clarksville - or Highland - when we saw the UFO on the right side of our car - the passenger side.It was not very far away from us, as there were some tall power lines - or a cell tower of some kind - off the road in the field to the distance from us on the right of our car and a bit ahead of us as we travelled toward / by it on the left. It&apos;s hard to tell if it was one tower or a series of power line towers - but I will look more closely the next time we drive by and see what it actually is - and exactly where it is in relation to the road (Route 108).The UFO was moving toward the tower - and then STOPPED! It stopped by the tower right after we both noticed it up in the sky. It was NOT very far away from us.My girlfriend asked, &quot;What is THAT?!&quot; ... I saw it, too, at the same time and also said, &quot;Yeah, what IS that?!&quot; ... &quot;It&apos;s not a plane, I can tell you that.&quot; she added, as she rolled down the window to try to hear any sounds coming from it. I slowed down the car. Neither of us heard anything at all. Then I said, &quot;It&apos;s not a helicopter, either, because I can&apos;t hear anything - and that&apos;s too big to be a helicopter - and planes don&apos;t just STOP like that.&quot;  It had red and green lights that were slowly going on and off. The lights were the first things we both noticed before seeing the object itself. It appeared horizontally long, like a mettalic cigar in the sky by the tower.Then my girlfriend said, &quot;I have a creepy feeling. We should speed up. Whatever that is, I have never seen anything do that before.&quot;  So, I sped up, and as I did so, the object began to move again and was heading in OUR direction. My girlfriend said, &quot;It&apos;s coming this way, toward the road. ... GO!&quot;  So I went even faster, and she took her seatbelt off to look at it pass over the car and off behind us in the direction of the area behind my side of the car - back from the area of Howard county where we were coming from, back in the northeast direction sort of.She looked at it as it sped off quickly, and the lights disapperared - and then the object itself disappeared.There was no sound of a helicopter or an airplane going over us from up above as you would normally hear.Then it was gone - and we continued to drive back home.What WAS that?!  Do you know?  Has anyone else reported seeing such a thing on that evening?  Thank you very much!

As we were watching it it would turn directions while the triangle maintained its shape.At 6:55 pm I called Frankfort, IL 911 they said that there was multiple calls regarding the sightings.So I did the only thing I could, as I had no camera besides my camera phone which was not a very good at taking clear picture. So I started driving towards the UFO to get a better shot from a closer distance. after 30 miles we were into Indiana and the UFO was just a little too far out of Camera Range.While we were driving towards Indiana There was a lot of people sitting on the side of the road taking pictures. I never stopped to get any numbers and I would love to be able to contact those people.As we were driving into Indiana. The lights dimmed down as we saw 6 lights coming out of the south the strobe colors on the new lights were RED WHITE AND BLUE and they were fast movers. I think they were the air force because they circled the area for over an hour. I called all of my friends and family that were in the area and they went outside to look but they were too far away at the time. I also called channel 2, 5, &amp; 7 news and they said that they would look into it through the police blotters. I left my number and so far I haven&apos;t gotten a call back.But I&apos;m hoping that someone comes forward with pictures or videos that we can submit to the UFO hunters or the news.I never got a good picture of the Craft but we saw the objects for over 2.5 hours. The lights on the craft would switch from red to a bright orange about an half inch wide in the sky which is pretty big. there is no way this could be an airplane or a weather balloon or flares, because the lights would go out for a while then go back to a higher intensity and change color but it always kept the same formation. I lived outside of a air force base and have seen a lot of different aircraft flying and I have never seen anything like it. It reminded me of the &apos;05 Tinley Park, IL sightings (which i saw too after my friend called me to look outside) If anyone has any pictures or videos please submit them.

It was shaped exactly like the object from before, triangular and with a row of white lights with one red light at the end.

When we got home we turned on the recording and were watching it from 22:00 to around 22:58.  The signal was interrupted several times as we watched the recording.  This is not a common occurrence at all on recordings from our HD TV. We just kind of wondered why the signal was messed up and let it go at that.

He said &ldquo;It was HUGE&rdquo;&hellip;. And that jets from the Air Base (Dyess) had gone up shortly after the object appeared, streaking across the sky towards  Buffalo Gap, where we live. He said the object looked a lot like a meteor streak but was &ldquo;huge&rdquo; . He went on to say that the jets from Dyess were circling the area around and between Buffalo Gap and Tuscola (to our southwest approx. 5 miles).  We have no idea what he might have seen , but thought we should say something to someone.  Surely, many others must have seen this event as well.

The most apparent thing to me was that the figures were very short, no taller than a meter or so, and the table I was lying on was very close to the ground. I remember that occasionally the abductors would speak to each other, always in a high-pitched, rushed sort of way.Many hours later, I woke up. I was outside. I stood up, and I felt dizzy.

Then it burst into the brightest white light that I have ever seen and bathed me and the surrounding landscape in a bright white apot-light (I cannot convey to you how bright this was!  Like a Halogen spot or an MR16 or a Mercury vapor spotlight)  I was looking upwards and I felt like my face and arms were stark against my shadow on the ground-brighter in contrast than anything I have ever experienced, and the surrounding landscape was lime-greener with the illumination than can be immagined.  Time seemed suspended for a moment and then the light was extinguished and the afterimage of the light faded like a halogen spot fades after it is turned off and the glow of it remains for a moment.  Then all was dark again. The puppy was coward down and the horses on the hillside began to stampede around the pasture in confusion.  I stood there waiting and trying to listen and evaluate the experience:  I had heard absolutely no sound---no airplane or helecopter, no missle whine, no explosion, no sound of any implosion with the ground.  The night had remained calm and still throughout the event.  I have only a vague sense of the scope of the illuminated area since I was staring up at it.  I can only say that the surrounding hills of the hollow were black and my ! immediat e area was illuminated:  perhaps 1 to 3 acres.  I am curious to find out if anyone else saw this event and has an explanation.  Was it a meteor, but I have never heard of them flashing several times and then bathing-light so this seems unlikely to me?!   After about 8-10 more minutes, 2 airplanes flew from the north-eastern horizon across toward the area where the event had taken place and I could distinctly hear those planes which confirmed to me that indeed the even had been totally silent.", "formation of lights over Rothwellon saturday night around 21:30 hours while waiting to be picked up by taxi,myself my wife and two friends saw people looking up to the sky and as we looked were amazed to see lots of lights in the sky flying, or appeared to be flying in formation.We must have witnessed at least 20 lights.", "Looked like Saturn or VenusI work law enforcement on a lake in Bandera County called Medina Lake.

South Dakota.  We were in the first camping area above the dam on the South Dakota side.  I was young. it was at a time that women didn&apos;t work and many mothers and children were camping.  I looked at the road across the dam to see my dad (I was looking for him to come to camp from work) and the sky which had been full daylight turned black.  The sky was completely black there was no daylight.  From the sky came down a beam of light.  Not like a flashlight but slowly down to the river.The beam of light then went scanning the up the river and then the beam came back towards where it started still focused on the river.  The beam went back up as it had come down and the sky became blue.  Everyone at the campground was yelling UFO, UFO.  And then it happened again.  The entire sky became black and the beam came down to the river it scanned the river up and down.  And then the beam went back up and the sky became blue.  Everyone was yelling UFO, UFO.  And then the park rangers drove around with a blow horn saying &quot;what you have just seen was a rare phenomenon in the weather &quot;over and over.And that night or afternoon when my dad came home from work we (my mother and I) didn&apos;t tell him what happened.  We had forgotten, I think everyone forgot.About a year later I was in Omaha, NE and I saw the movie &quot;Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind&quot; and while watching the show I remembered.  After the show I asked my mom if she remembered and she said she did but I think she was humoring me.When In college I went to a lecture on ufos and they talked about the beam of light.  It was the first time I had heard anyone talk about it.  They invited anyone that had seen a ufo to talk to them after the lecture.  I wanted to but I was afraid.Later in  college I was taking a course in meteorology and they talked of rare phenomonens in the weather and I wanted to ask about what I had seen.  I was still confused by the rangers then.  I was to afraid to ask and also I knew sort of that it wasn&apos;t a weather phenomenon that  I would have been asking about.Some time later I was at a ufo convention in Lincoln, NE.  Stanton Friedman was there and I told him my story about what I saw and about my memory.  And he said there was a lot of government in South Dakota which I still don&apos;t understand.Besides having my memory stepped on I believe I was given a fear program.  I think it was to cause me not to talk about what I saw if I did remember.  The first time I told my story at the UFO bookstore to a group I was really unusually scared to say it.  After I told my story for the first time there was no fear of telling it again.I would love to hear from anyone that was camping that same day and saw it.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Later in the afternoon, I heard another chopper, went out, and there was the same green one.  I tried again, but it was too low to focus and I had my camera in zoom to take photos of distant objects, so I could not catch it.  Again, I continued to take pictures of the sky at random.  I waved goodbye to the green chopper as it went behind the trees and out of sight.The photos in the afternoon pictures look like triangular objects, I am sure these cannot be birds at a distance; they would have to be gigantic to photograph this way.The &quot;saucer&quot; like object photo was taken in the morning.

The thing can&rsquo;t even fly!   Yet there it is!   You&rsquo;re not scared of it, you&rsquo;re fascinated by it!   You loose track of time as you stand there gazing at it!  Is it a few minutes, or fifteen minutes or more that you stand there gazing at the huge craft?  There are portholes and lights around the craft and the sounds it made as it approached have stopped and there&rsquo;s only a high pitched hum.  There&rsquo;s a strange feeling coming over you like that some how you are drawn to whoever is inside the thing.

I told my wife,  but I had no other witness before she came out of the hospital clinic area for allergies. It was awesome and yet fearful as this didn&apos;t look friendly but more of a probing observation.My heart was beating so fast, my mouth went dry and I couldn&rsquo;t talk.", "Perfectly round, extremely bright craft appeared over central Utah traveling from south-west to north-east.Craft appeared near the south-west horizon and appeared to be traveling too fast to be a plane.  We watched it pick up speed on a constant bearing to the north-east.  At first the craft appeared to be a bright chrome like light. We put binoculars on the craft and it was so bright it was hard to keep looking at it.  Before it reached directly overhead, it became a dull orange.  At first we believed it to be an experimental aircraft from Nellis, Hill, or one of the other Air Force bases near our state.  When the craft was overhead, it slowed momentarily, and then picked up speed at an unbelieveable rate until it reached the horizon in the north-west.  There was no sound and no contrail visible. I have seen other such craft while camping in Utah&apos;s deserts over the years, this one was faster than anything I or my wife have ever witnessed!  When it headed for the north-west, it accelerated so fast it was hard to keep binoculars on it.", "3 circling lights, 1 stationary light, 5-10 minutes in one place, vanished mysteriouslyMy daughter, age 17, was looking out the living room window and said she saw some lights in the sky.  I looked out and saw 3 lights, rounds, a bit dim, moving in unison in a circle.  It looked like they were kind of chasing each other, but they also stayed uniform.  Then, they seemed to merge.  Then, they went back to their circling formation.  I thought it was kids with flashlights against the night sky, but when I went out side to get a better look, I couldn&apos;t see any rays.  Also, there was one stationary light to the left of the three moving lights.  If I was imagining a ship, I would say that the light on the left was like a window and the three moving lights were landing lights or whatever.  But I can&apos;t figure out how or why they would merge every once in a while.  I should also say that the light never stopped, and they always were moving in a circle.  The lights were behind a cloud.  It was the only cloud in the sky but it was big and it had stopped raining about an hour ago, so I figured it was leftover clouds.  However, I couldn&apos;t figure out what would cause such lights.  I got curious and told my daughter we would ride over to get a better look, since the lights seemed low and close.  As we drove, the lights did not stay behind but followed us!  This meant it was a BIG object.  Then, when we turned the corner, the lights vanished.  We drove about 30 seconds from the house and the lights were GONE.  We went back to the house after a few minutes of driving and stopping.  When we got back home, the lights were gone and the cloud was gone too.  The sky was totally clear.  Weird.  The cloud obscured the lights so that I thought they were coming from the ground but there was no evidence of any person or light, ambulance or party, near the area.  We live in semi-rural so that evidence would be easy to spot.  Nothing unusual on the ground.", "5 unidentified light formations with bright lights changing in color, and direction, lights go in different patternsFive different sets of flashing lights that very from red/white/blue,  four appear to be stationary, however one appear to be white traveling faster past the 4 appearing to be traveling south of the other 4...When view through binoculars the objects appear to change, to what appears to be a red/blue/white type of laser light zipping around.

I was in the window seat (15A) on the left hand side of the plan sitting directly beside the wing.  We were at cruising altitude of 3600 feet.  We were above the clouds and the sky was clear.I was looking out the window and could see several planes in the distance and started to look all around to see if I could see more planes.  I looked towards the rear of the plane and saw a dark object. It looked like a cigar.  It may have been a disc but I could not tell for sure because it looked as if I was looking at a side profile of the object.  The object appeared to be moving away from the plane I was on and was turning left.  It was also above the cloud line and there was no tail as seen with planes.After watching it for about 30 seconds I took out my cell phone and tried to get a picture of the object.  However, by the time I got my phone out the object was gone.  It looked like the object had move so the plane was covering my view.  I still took a picture and there appears to be an object like I seen in it, but I am not sure if it is the object or the tail wing of the plane.I continued to look out the window and about one minute later a jet fly by going in the same direct I seen the object go.  I could not tell what kind of jet it was, but there was black smoke trailing it unlike the white trails I was seeing from the other planes I saw.

It was several minutes until the sun light was gone. She was driving and I noticed to my right a County Squad car was parked on the wrong side of the road on an over-pass above I-94. The red lights were on and I could see the officer looking toward the west (the direction we were traveling) with his hands at his head as if holding binoculars. Traveling further west I commented on how fast the on-coming traffic was traveling. Speed limit is 45 MPH and cars were heading east-bound traveling at an estimated speed of 75 MPH or better (estimated of course). We had crested the first hill and I commented on a low flying what appeared to be an airliner. The &quot;plane&quot; and us closed distances after we crested the second hill and I said, &quot;I think he is going to crash&quot;. I then told her to speed up because I think that he is going to crash on us. It came to a stop above a 20 acre pond and just hovered there. I told her to stop the car and she slowed down to about 15 MPH. I opened the car door and looked up about 250 ft on an obtruse angle. I remember looking from one end to the other judging it to be approximately 300 yds in length and just as wide. At that time two huge bright lights came on shining straight down on the pond illuminating it like daytime. I told her again to stop and she floored it as she was scared and crying. When we arrived home a few short minutes later I grabbed my camera and returned to find nothing there. The object made no sound. When the lights came on you could feel the energy in the atmoshere. It reminded me of tank xenons. The craft appeared like cutting a 747 in half then adding that like fron section to the rear pointing backwards. The width of the craft was the same and intersected at the middle of the first described assembly. Light from the center of these sections (starting half way up from the center-line toward the top) graduated from dim to quite bright at the ! top. Thi s is what made it look like the cigar configuration. I called the Sherrif&apos;s Dept. (anonymously) and asked if anyone had seen anything that night. The answer was, &quot;No&quot;. I then called the Eau Claire Municipal Airport and asked if they had any traffic that night. Again I was told no. That airport has not had any airline (large planes) for years.

It was a white blue bright color that didnt change at all as it fell. It had no tail trailing behind it. It looked like a bright dot in the sky, like a falling star, but without the trail.  It made no noise, and the color stayed the same as it fell. A plane was in the sky as we were driving; when the object fell the plane changed directions and began to head towards the fallen object.

I thought that it was my eyes playing tricks on me so I didn&apos;t say anything , But my son said hey that moved back and forth real fast didn&apos;t it .I said with total surprise you saw that ?

After eating, we laid down on the blanket and found ourselves looking up at the sky discussing the airplane contrails we were seeing all over the sky.From our left (which was north) there appeared to be a ball shaped object (not a disk, but spherical shaped) travelling at great speed and directly overhead. It crossed our field of vision in about 10 seconds and then stopped suddenly at which time it appeared to simply hover and then disappeared to our right which would have been to the south. The shape was a two tone color, being a copper color on the bottom and silver metallic color on the top.There were no protruding features such as wings or a tail &ndash; simply round and featureless apart from the color.We both stood up and watched it saying &lsquo;what the heck is that?&rsquo; I am a private pilot and this was certainly not a plane or a bird.

The light shone through between a group of trees and a house in front of me but I could tell it was much farther away.  I immediately ran away to call someone in my apartment to the light, but when I went to get another glance before he came out it was completely gone.

The 5 lights were in a group of 3 with 2 lights off to the side.The objects made no sound. The 3 were making circles around each other as they moved. All of a sudden the 5 lights blinked off as did the very bright pulsating light. I figured the big bright light was at about 10,000ft and the 5 others were at about 8,000ft.

I called out for the others to look and my friend yelled for everyone to stop lighting fireworks and look. We all moved toward or fence, staring to the South as the craft grew larger. It was like a rounded square shape or sphere, a beautiful reddish orange color with a single bright pulse of amber light every 2 -3 seconds. It had no anti-collision lights and did not look like any conventional craft any of us had ever seen, and it was not a firework. Two of the adults are ex-military and very familiar with military craft. They both stated that what we were watching was not a plane or helicopter or any other conventional craft. The object moved slowly, with a slow, pulsing strobe of bright gold that would flash and light the center of it.  I believe it was about 1/4 to 1/3 mile away.  It was traveling North towards us and curved gently toward the West as it disappeared in a smooth flight.It seemed that the center was darker than the rest of the ship until the light pulsed, and as it traveled, it went from a reddish color to an orange - the object appeared to be lit from inside - Like a frosted glass shade on a lamp. There were 12 adults, most of us non-drinkers, and 3 children that all watched. We had been watching fireworks in the distance to the South and were alerted by the fact that unlike the fireworks that had been going on all around the neighborhood, this object was moving horizontally, did not explode, made no sound, and made a slow arc towards the West before it got so far away we could not see it. We all felt different - confusion, amazement, and fear -A few of us were excited and almost euphoric - Feeling lucky to see it.

The fire balls then shifted or jumped down to the left and disappeared after about 2 seconds. A minute or two after that, two red dots (that looked slightly different than the fire balls, more rounded and distinct) about 4x the size of a normal star appeared to the left of the first sighting. Then one by one, the dots would move in sequence to the left or north, horizontally, as if jumping one another, but blinking out as it would move. This happened for about 5 to 8 seconds with the dots jumping each other about 5 times and then they just disappeared.A lady in her mid 50&rsquo;s then came up to the beach access after saying she saw the red dots. The three of us then watched for about 10 minutes or so as randomized flashes of light could be seen off in the distance and scattered throughout the sky, but in the same vicinity as the other sightings. The flashing looked like the same kind of flash a camera would produce, but it was faintly obscured by clouds. There could have been close to 500 flashes, some bigger or brighter than others.Seven people, ranging in age from 13 to 35 began to walk onto the beach. Just as they got there the two red dots flashed again, off to the right and slightly above the moving/jumping dots.

The rain had let up some and as I passed a place where the trees opened up, I looked to the left 45 deg., and up 45 deg., and beheld, in the sky, a beautiful group of about four white lights, one above the other of the most pure brilliance I have ever seen.It, the group, was not bright in that would hurt ones eyes and make them turn away, it was its purity of light that I marveled at.My first thought, and one I held for quite awhile, was that I was looking across a small valley at the top of a hill where someone had several fluorescent dusk to dawn lights mounted close together on a pole. It wasn&apos;t until some time later that I realized that there is no hill there, because I have traveled that road every week and have for years.The lights were not all of the same uniform shape. One of the lights near the top seemed teardrop shaped with the point of the tear drop pointing up toward a 10 o&apos;clock position, the others were of a general square shape with rounded corners and sitting above one another. Although they were not centered perfectly along the same axis, all the lights were touching its neighbor and were nearly centered along a vertical axis.For some reason I just kept driving like it was something that happens everyday, and that&apos;s not my nature, to be so cavalier about anything so unusual. The google earth co-ordinates of where the lights were located is, to my best estimate, almost exactly: 40-01-08.00 N, by 79-47-00.00 W.

The first was when I was 15 in New Jersey, and I will report that another time.  However, this more recent on was last year in 2008, occurring in Lee Vinning, CA, on Feb. 27th, around 6:00pm  as my wife and I were driving north on Hwy. 395.  I have to estimate the time because it was just starting to get a bit dark, and we were probably a bit north of Lee Vinning as well, but this is the general time and place.  I remember the date exactly because we were driving from Georgia to my son&rsquo;s wedding on the 29th of Feb. in Fremont, CA. two days later.  Also, the reason I wanted to report it now is because I saw the exacted same thing a few nights ago on the History Channel&rsquo;s program UFO Hunters.  They had a sighting around 3am around Needles, CA of a blue-green glowing rectangular craft streaking across the sky and coming down, which was later picked up by 4 military helicopters and taken away still glowing.  This occurred only three months later in May of 2008.As I was saying, my wife and I both saw this blue-green glowing rectangle streak across our field of view in front of us from West to East, or left to right, since we were heading north.  It took about 2 seconds, maybe only one actually to cross our field of view and it was gone.  I was amazed to have seen such a thing and do not believe it was a meteor because of the unusual color and rectangular shape.  Also, it appeared to be arching upward rather than down.  I guess we assumed it was a secret Air Force vehicle, being that Edwards and Area 51 were not that far from us.  But after the UFO Hunters story, I feel as though I would like to add my sighting to your files.As an artist, I did a quick drawing of our sighting in Photoshop and my wife just now confirmed that this is what she also saw that night last year.  I will attempt to attach the drawing to this report.", "Unusual object over Wasatch Front Range.While on my front lawn just after dusk I saw a very bright object moving from west to east over the Wasatch Front Range.  The only reason I paid attention to it is because The object appeared to have unusally bright landing lights.  It is then that I realized that they could not be landing lights because the craft was moving away not towards me.I have been an airline pilot for the last 12 years and this was like nothing I have seen in my experience.

We was on a camping trip to dale hollow lake when we saw it, We was standing at the campsite and I looked up at the beautiful sky and all at once I saw a flashing light streaming across the sky at an extremely high rate of speed. I looked at two of my friends and pointed it out and one of them said it a shooting stare, I told her shooting stars don&rsquo;t blink and all at once it stopped moving and changed direction three times and then streaked out of sight.

My Grandfather was doing the groundwork for the Pleasant Hill Dairy Queen.  Earlier that morning my Grandmother had mentioned she had to go to the bank that is also located in Pleasant Hill. He had finished his CAT work and unhitched the trailer from the dump truck and we proceeded to move out east on hwy 58 to go home. We had gotten to the intersection of hwy 58 and Tillicum, as that street is called now, and I felt something weird in my tummy, like on a roller coaster ride. I remember saying &quot;what happened?&quot; My Grandpa then said, &quot;look down there, there&apos;s your grandma.&quot; There was no seat belt laws back then so I stood up in the cab of the truck and crawled over to my grandpa&apos;s lap and looked down. I could see the top of the bank and could see my grandma&apos;s Buick going into the drive-thru at the bank. I could also see east down the hwy, we were at what I believe to be now at 200-250 ft up above the hwy. I remember seeing the top of a tractor trailer rig and the tops of a few cars. I also remember looking down on the telephone poles. This lasted maybe 10-15 seconds and then we were back on the hwy traveling at speed moving eastbound. I immediately asked my grandpa &quot;How did we do that, what did I touch?&quot; He responded with, &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; You see it was pretty loud in those old dump trucks. I said, &quot;How&apos;d we go way up in the air!!?&quot; I stood up and started trying to mess with some buttons. He then said,&quot;Quit messing with that stuff , get up on your seat and just hold still!&quot; It seems he had no recollection of the event. We got home a few minutes ahead of my grandma and when she arrived I excitedly told her what happened. She said,&quot;(grandpa&apos;s name), whats he talking about?&quot; Grandpa responded &quot;I don&apos;t know he&apos;s been going on about being up in the air or something rather since we got back.&quot; I told her grandpa didn&apos;t believe me and I was pretty upset. When my parent&apos;s came to get me I immediately told them what had happened but I still wasn&apos;t believe! d. I can remember that day vividly. Sadly my grandpa passed away in 1998. I used to ask him about that day when stuff like that came up. He never recalled that experience.

At first I thought it was a falling star and had her make a wish but as it was falling it suddenly stopped. It then went back the other way like it was retracing its steps, and stopped again. And proceeded to do very elaborate circles, then shot east across the sky and did the same thing. This &ldquo;falling star&rdquo; for about 10 minutes was making very non-pattern movements in the sky. We stopped staring and left to grab my video camera but we never could find it again.

We were at the beach for bands on the beach that happens every Tuesday night.  It was dark outside and therefore no sunlight left in the sky. As I was talking to my girlfriend, looking over the gulf, I noticed what looked like a slow moving  white cloud that was very hard to see about 200-300 yards out over the water.  It was awkward because it was the only one in the sky and seemed to be moving in a smooth and slow motion.  My girlfriend then noticed it and we began to watch the object as it moved east, then stopped, and started moving west.  We both watched as the object stopped near the end of the pier, and then seemed to turn and move over the pier.  When first passing over the pier, the lights from the pier, which were orange in color, seemed to reflect from the front of this object.  As it moved over the pier, it was still very hard to see and determine its full shape. After reaching the end of the pier it was in a closer proximity to me.  I could see what looked to be very small and dim lights moving north to onshore.  These lights were in the general shape of a triangle or boomerang.  The shape was constantly changing though, as we watched the object move further onshore, the object(s) began to conform to more of a ball-shape.  Then the object(s) seemed to vanish. It didn&rsquo;t speed off, but was just gone.  The entire movement of this object was slow.

The duration was about five seconds and no sound was made.  The lights simply appeared then disappeared.  As a research scientist in the United States, I only make conclusions based on a sufficient amount of evidence, so I can make no definitive conclusion for what we saw.

After having our barbeque we sat and chilled talking for around 2 hours. At around quater to 11 at night, one of the adults said &apos; whats that bright light over in the sky. I couldnt see and ran around the table to see it, when i looked through the gap of two houses i noticed a ditant light that was pretty bright. It quickly moved from quite low to really high. Probably the maximum height you would see an aircraft. At first we all though it was a helecopter, but having watched UFO files and other programs i was sceptical. The bright orange glow dimmed and it looked like it was travelling towards us this was about 10 seconds in from we first saw it. It quickly changed direction and started travelling away from us, at this point it was very high in the sky. But i said to my mother that how could it be a helecopter as it was going away and the lights were still facing us and it was a constant glow, also it was way to high for a helecopter. Shortly after moving away it slowly started to fade and completely vanished. After woundering what it was you could tell the adults knew that this was no ordinary craft, however we didnt rule this out. At about 11 we all noticed the same bright light in the sky again at exactly the same place. It was high, had an orange glow, wasnt making any noise at all, and was hovering in the same spot. I ran upstairs to get my binoculars andmy dad fetched the camera, as i got back the light started to fade and we didnt have time to photograph. However a week previous to our sighting our next door neighbours had told my mum and dad that whilst in their back garden late at night, they to had seen a orange glow move extremely fast in the distance and slowly fade then see it around 5 minuits later once again. They recorded a video on their phone but once i had seen it i wasnt convinced. However after seing the object myself i am a strong believer and fullly believe them.

I went outside and saw what looked like 3 large white balloons grouped together. It seemed as though it was reflecting the light from the setting sun, but as the sun set the objects got brighter, a lot brighter. I also noticed that even with the light breeze, the objects were not moving.  I soon realized these were not balloons. There were no other stars out at this point and I started getting text messages from 4 other friends telling me to check out whatever it was in the sky.  As I was in my backyard looking and describing over the phone to my friend, I could see one large orb in the center with three other orbs around it, seeming to be attached. The outer orbs were changing location, but always remained equidistant from each other (triangular formation). The object was fairly close, less than 10 miles away. I could also see a faint glow or haze around the object. My friend who called me was on the other side of town and it appeared much smaller to him than it did to me. My neighbor was outside in his backyard so I called him over and we started watching it together. As we watched, the orb flashed pinpoints of white light around it. It then began flashing pinpoints of red light around it.  After a few more minutes the center orb began to dim and the flashing pin points of light stopped, then the outer three orbs turned red and got brighter, becoming the only visible lights. At this point my neighbor&rsquo;s roommate came outside with his camera and took pictures.  While I was on the phone describing what I was seeing, a small flashing light shot out of the bottom and headed northwest towards Albuquerque.  I could see a faint contrail behind the orb. This light was only visible for about 10 seconds before it was out of sight. The main object still remained in its same location but began to dim again.  Once in a while I could see a small light appear next to it, but I had to look away from the main object! to see it.  Several times I also witnessed the object to move slightly to the side or slightly upward, but always returning to its original location. Over the course of an hour, it remained it the same position in the sky, getting dimmer whereas the stars started to become visible and got brighter.  After an hour and a half it was difficult to see and was dimmer than the stars, but remained in the same place in the sky.I am sure there will be more reports, as I had 4 friends from different locations in town that all noticed it on there own and told me to check it out.  It was also nice to have my neighbor watch it with me as he was able to verify all the things I was seeing. As a side note, I found it interesting that it seemed to be directly above the NASA facility which is on the western side of the mountains from White Sands Missile Range.  I have seen other strange things in the sky before, but never have I seen something so clearly that remained in the same place for so long and have so many other witnesses.  I don&rsquo;t have the pictures, but when zoomed in, it looked like 3 orbs in a triangular formation with the light stretching towards each other.  It resembled a hot air balloon but was clearly not.

Then it went back up, and after that I sat outside and watched this bright light fade from bright to dim and back, sometimes disappearing altogether, only to reappear in another place all within what seemed to be airspace around Atlanta for almost 2 hours. This light made zig-zag patterns in the sky. It went really high up, then came back down several times. It truly did things in the air that no modern plane could do, like jumping what seemed like great distances in split seconds and hovered in place on several occasions as well.

Speed and trajectory was similar to ISS and other satellite flyovers, but the color was bright orange and didn&apos;t appear to change (i.e., no flashing).The light continued in a northernly direction, passing to the west of us and maybe an altitude of 70 degrees or so.  Somewhere in the NW direction, it faded in very much the same way that satellites do when they enter the Earth&apos;s shadow.Total observation time seemed to be 1-2 minutes, with the light maintaining its magnitude the entire time, except at the end when it quickly faded and disappeared.  The orange coloring seemed to be the oddest part, and given the time of day, I could see how this could be red sunlight from below the horizon glinting off of a satellite (though the length of time and the prolonged intensity makes me doubt this).There was no sound detected.The sky was overcast, and the position of the moon could be easily determined, but no features could be made out through the clouds.  The orange light was clear enough to appear to be beneath the clouds, but there was no way to determine for sure whether the cloud cover extended across the entire sky (i.e., it&apos;s possible that there were clouds blocking the moon, but not this light).

I initially thought it was a government craft since a major AFB was nearby.When we got home, my wife looked up information about it on the internet and it was the same craft that has been sighted in Belgium and Phoenix, AZ. After the interview with MUFON, I was given information that what I had seen was not a government craft. After explaining it&apos;s size in relation to my hand at arm&apos;s length, I was told it was a mile long. I was also told that someone else reported the same thing and the other person was across 92 HWY in a parking lot.have not experienced any sort of trauma as a result of this experience. The MUFON investigator said it was still possible.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I estimate the time of the event to be around 22:30, though I may have been mistaken since we had just been hanging out all night and not paying attention to time. My friend and I were outside smoking, and she looked up in the sky and pointed out to me what we both thought was a satellite. It was moving south-southeast We watched it briefly (about five seconds), only to see it stop mid-flight, jerk to the northeast (diagonally up and left from its position), and begin flight again. The object continued this pattern of stopping and re-starting for the next thirty to forty seconds. Its timing was very sporadic as was the degree to which it adjusted its flight path. When we started losing sight of it, I climbed up on top of my chair, but could not see it anymore due to the light pollution on the horizon. I walked inside and told my boyfriend, who was sitting on the sofa watching tv, exactly what we saw. My friend confirmed everything. My boyfriend told us that he had seen objects like that in the sky over the beach before.Neither my friend nor myself could discern a specific shape or color to the object as it was very high in the atmosphere. The area in which the sighting occurred is close to the Canaveral National Seashore, so there is a possibility that it was some sort of government intelligence.My friend and I are both twenty years old. She and I were room mates at the University of Alabama for one semester, after which I moved to the eastern Florida coast and she moved to a suburb outside of New York City. We&apos;re both hard-working students. My friend is pursuing a degree in nursing, while I&apos;m busy studying chemistry so that I can do research someday. I&apos;m also a waitress in a local wine bar. My friend had been working at a Red Lobster part-time. My boyfriend has a bachelors degree in economics from the University of Florida, but due to the economy he works at a local restaurant on the beach. Until February of this year, he worked overnight (from the time the restaurant closed until about 5:00) doing security and some maintenance.((NUFORC Note:  Error in date.

I would estimate the hight of the object at about 50 to 60,000 feet based on the hight if the highest jet in the sky.  This light made the jets in the sky pale in comparison.

I noticed a white object moving through the sky (heavy winds) as I scanned the sky looking for characteristics of tornado weather. I initially thought I was looking at a balloon or white plastic grocery bag moving across the sky easterly, due to the high winds. I then noticed the object glimmering with the reflection of the sunlight. It appeared silver &amp; shiny (shaped like a small hamburger/ thick frisbee) as it moved across the sky at a high rate of speed.

So this report is complete and includes all 5 sightings***  11:25 PM PST (2 Objects) Hayden Idaho  Two shooting star like objects appeared approximately 60 degrees above the West by NorthWest horizon. The two objects were exactly parallel to one another flying at a declining angle toward the east and about a pencil length apart. They began to bank North and as they descended and changed their course the objects morphed into these glowing iridescent reddish, orange, pinkish boomerang like craft. They disappeared to the NorthEast.My girlfriend missed these as she was viewing another part of the sky and could not orient on these objects because they were moving very fast.11:43 (2 Objects)  Two more boomerang like objects appeared over the Western horizon flying East by North East at a constant altitude. These 2 craft flew right over us and were much closer together than the previous 2. As they flew over us they split apart and came back together as if they were going around something so as to trace a sort of vase in the sky. When they came back together they were in the East and immediately banked to the North and disappeared out of sight.We both witnessed this event and were blown away trying to figure out what it could have been.11:50 (6 Objects)  As we were glued to the skies SIX more of these craft appeared directly above us. We did not see them fly in from any direction, they just sort of appeared. They were in a very tight single file formation and flying a snake like pattern through the sky. They moved from directly above us to the eastern sky before what appeared to be collapsing onto one another and disappearing to the North.Again, we both witnessed this and were in total shock. We ran through the house tearing it apart looking for cameras blankets phones etc.No other event took place and by 1 am my girlfriend went to bed.I stayed up.2:15 AM PST June 4th (9 Objects)  NINE more of these craft popped into my view in a triangle shape formation. They were flying from due South to due North about 30 degrees from my horizon. This was an amazing sight. The formation was very tight and the craft on the inside appeared to have this sort of electric glow to them and they appeared to be fluttering or wavering inside of this formation. They disappeared to the North.I was complacent by now and left my camera by the coffee pot.Approx 3AM (1 Object)  After the last sighting I vowed never to be without a camera again and began to make a record of what I saw. While I was describing the previous events I pointed the camera to the sky and I saw ONE more object.This object appeared to be flying much higher than the previous ones. It was darker and broader shaped and flying slower. It was about 70 degrees above the horizon and flew from due South to due North. I was in shock and praying that the camera would pick up the image, unfortunately nothing showed up.SHAPE AND DETAILED DESCRIPTION:  The first time I saw these and my girlfriend didn&apos;t I explained it to here as watching headlights in the sky point directly at you and then change course. I described the crafts as pinkish rose and glowing with a misty aura, angelic like. They appeared to have bird like qualities.After the next sighting I had a very clear impression of these crafts.They were a near perfect half moon shape with a protruding nose... there is a crop circle image that is amazingly identical to the shape of what we saw.  The link is here:  http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/IMAGES/cropcircle_walkershill1.jpg  They appeared to be glowing like the moon, sort of translucent and undefinable, but the colors red, orange and tan kept coming to our minds but there was definitely a mist or aura to them.As far as altitude goes, it is very difficult to say as there was nothing to reference.  My best guess is that they were flying much higher than a commercial airliner and traveling 10x as fast.", "Triangular shaped craft with red lights seen lowering from the sky.We were watching a movie when I noticed a bright red light outside in the air.

Then 2 seconds later a flash of light appeared in that same spot to where it dissappeared. I thought to myself, could it have jumped into lightspeed. To when I thought about our atmosphere when crafts breaking into mach or light speed there is a slight chance you see light at the end making a singularity of some sort which causes the air and water molecules to disrupt. Apparently, this one broke it to where it was like the light shinned brighter than a spot light or the north star.

We live in Spartanburg county about 3 miles from the Greenville/Spartanburg Airport. We were hanging out playing video games until about 10:30pm when we decided to turn in for the night.As I was getting our blankets ready I looked up and through the mesh door of the tent which was facing to the west. Through the mesh I saw an incredibly bright red light of considerable size moving slowly over the treeline. My first thought was that it might be an airplane, but I have lived in this area my entire life and I literally see planes come and go every night. This was like nothing I had ever seen and I immediately knew that it was not a plane. I fumbled around in the dark for my video camera, unzipped the door of the tent and was able to start filming the object about 20-30 seconds after it originally caught my eye.At first the bright red object continued slowly moving South, but then unexpectedly a much smaller white light emerged from the top and went upward at a fairly rapid pace. When the light was a good 2x higher from the ground than the red light, the red light quickly disappeared. The white light continued to stay in view and continued to move southward at a speed of perhaps 3x faster than the red light was traveling. After a bit it flickered and disappeared. When the red one disappeared, it just blinked off like a switch was flipped, but the white one flickered and faded more subtly.I got the entire thing on tape, and the footage of the small object emerging from the larger object is quite good. My only regret is that I zoomed in to try to get a closer look, and some of the footage is rather jerky... serves me right for always making fun of people who don&apos;t seem to be able to hold a camera still while filming a UFO. Still though, it&apos;s pretty exciting video. Here&apos;s the link to the video on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II9G-kvdzh0  I was very excited to see this. I&apos;ve kept my eyes open for stuff before when I&apos;m looking at the stars, but this was completely out of the blue and entirely unexpected. Plus, I NEVER carry my video camera with me, so the fact that my camera on hand is still amazing to me.Skeptics may point out that: 1. this sighting took place very close to an airport 2. the sighting took place on July 3rd (fireworks)  Had I not seen the object myself for the duration that it was visible, and especially the emergence of the smaller white light, I too would have argued these as possibilities. However, the footage easily dismisses these arguments. It made no sound, and it moved unlike any fireworks I have ever seen. Especially the way the white light speeds up after separating from the red light. My 4 year old can be heard in the background trying to figure out what it was that we were seeing. No mention of &quot;fireworks&quot;, but he did say &quot;maybe it&apos;s a rocket ship&quot;.Whatever it was, it was a blast being able to see it and film it.", "Elongated object spotted over Maple ValleyI noticed a small white object very high in the sky that appeared to be stationary or moving slowly.

My grandpa ran in the house and yelled for my mom and I to get outside.  When we got out there there was a craft that looked exactly like the drawing Kris made.  The three of us stood there and stared at the craft for probably close to five minutes as it went over head.The craft itself was triangular with a white light at each corner with a red light in the center, we couldn&apos;t see any details besides the light, it just looked like this pitch black void in the sky. The red light was, I would guess to be about twenty to thirty feet wide, and the white lights looks more like they were running lights of an airplane.  At the time, we guessed it was 200-300 feet per side. The craft was moving so slow that we couldn&apos;t understand how it could stay in the air, and it was no more than a a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet off the ground.  As the craft went over, we heard this very faint droning, the only thing I can really compare it to was like the hum of a turbine in a dam.  A ways behind the large craft was three white lights that were in a triangular pattern, we couldn&apos;t tell if it was one craft or three, but it was completely silent and looked like it kept a steady distance behind the big craft.

I was looking directly up for satellites/meteorites and noticed a burnt orange colored circular shape silhouette moving slowly (like a bird soaring) in a northern direction (this was nothing that came from the campfire as it was big and had a very high altitude).. it wasn&apos;t easy to spot unless you were looking in that direction as there were no lights and no sound, just a faint big circular dark/burnt orange colored object. I pointed my 300mW green laser pointer at it to ask the other 5 witnesses if they could see it and after tracking the object with the laser for 2 seconds it quickly (in less than 1 second) moved away from the laser to the west a few hundred feet (it looked like a few hundred feet from the ground, it could&apos;ve been a few miles at that altitude).. then it moved slowly more to the west, until i hit it again with the laser and it then quickly moved south.. then east.. then north again... and then east until we lost sight of it behind some tree&apos;s. It seemed that it didn&apos;t want to be hit with the laser, and would quickly moved away from the beam. The laser was shining high enough that when i hit the object the laser beam would reflect off the object (as if you were pointing the laser at any solid object) until the object quickly moved out of the way, then the beam would be high in the sky again. The object made turns between 10 + 90 degree angles and moved fast when the laser beam had hit it. The amount of time that passed between the first sighting of it and when we lost sight of it completely was approximately 20 seconds. 1 of the ladies got so scared she ran inside her house.There were fireworks 2 hours prior, and there is a small airport nearby.. but i know neither had anything to do with this as there&apos;s nothing that i&apos;m aware of that can move that quick or change direction so quick in our area or anywhere for that matter.Date: May 17th 2009 Time: 23:35 EST Hanover ON 44.157 -81.024 - exact coordinates of sighting.There were a total of 6 witnesses, only 2 had been drinking (myself not being one of them). The witnesses consisted of a truck driver, a construction worker, an on call fireman, 2 business owners and a housewife.", "Triangle shaped craft with 4 white lights and 1 blinking red light passed silently overheadI saw white lights approaching in the sky as I drove North down Oberlin Rd. in Raleigh NC. As I neared the bridge over Wade Ave., the lights got closer and closer until a triangle shaped craft passed slowy overhead. It had two white lights at the narrow end of the equilateral triangle and two on the broad end, with a smaller blinking red light in the middle. The craft passed over head with no noise whatsoever and continued in the opposite direction. It was about 300 feet over tree top level, and appeared to be the about twice the size of my car. Had I heard engine noise, I would have thought from the shape that it was fighter jet of some kind.", "AWOKE , AND LOOKED OUT TOWARD THE WESTERN SKY AND SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LARGE REDDISH-GOLDEN  ORB HOVERING OVER THE TREES.

It seemed lower than any niormal airliners.  Too scared to venture further to follow its movemant. Nothing in the news", "Disk-shaped saucer over house w/ a lazer light focused on homeI was driving on St Rd 136 towards the town of Clermont, Indiana when I saw 3 white lights low in the sky. As the airport is 15 mi. so., I didn&apos;t think too much of it at first other than the lights were too low for an aircraft on approach as well they didn&apos;t seem to be moving towards me, but me towards them. As I drove nearer the lights I stopped &amp; what I saw nearly took my breath away - permanently.  Suspended about 25 ft above a home, was a saucer.  There were 3 &quot;cones&quot; coming from the sides of the saucer: 1 in the middle and 2 others at 45 degree angles from the middle one.  At the tips of these cones were the white lights I&apos;d been watching.  On the underside of the cones were three colors: blue, red, green.  None of the lights were flashing, and there were no &quot;windows&quot;.  What terrified me most was that from the underside center of the saucer was the most incredible lazer of white light - about 4 inches wide focused on the roof of the house below.  I rolled down my window and sat to wait for another car to come to confirm for me I wasn&apos;t crazy; I even pinched myself hard thinking I might be dreaming.  There was NO sound at all coming from the saucer.   In 1975, Clermont was still a one-stoplight town on the outskirts of Indianapolis.  The saucer was just south of the Dairy Queen by about 3 or 4 houses.  After waiting 10 mins. for another car to come, I got scared and drove to the sheriff&apos;s station 2 blocks away but no one was there - at the time it was a 3 man operation.  I was so freaked out I drove around for half an hour before heading home.  The next night I was at a small gathering and hesitantly mentioned seeing a UFO when another friend said, &quot;I saw it too!&quot;  I told him, &quot;Okay - you go in another room and draw a picture of it and then we&apos;ll compare.&quot;  And by god he had the same picture w/ the cones and all!  He said he saw it around 23:30 flying towards downtown Indianapolis at a high rate of speed accompanied by 2 other saucers.  They flew directly east until they got to Merid! ian St ( divides the city E/W and goes N/S) whereby they took a 90 degree turn and sped down the center of the city!!  Hundreds if not thousands of people must have seen these saucers yet there was no mention of it in any media.  I believe the 12/20/75 sighting on your website is the same as mine - all I can remember is that it was likely a Thur or Fri nite and it was the week leading up to Christms. Of all the reports I&apos;ve read, none have ever mentioned anything about a lazer focused on a house anything and I&apos;ve always wondered these last 35 yrs what that white lazer could &quot;see&quot; for them. Oh, and the saucer was of a soft lustre like I&apos;ve never seen - like and egg painted painted a semi-matte silver.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "It was a bright light in the sky up only a few hundred feet in the airI was traveling west on Merrick road in Seaford when I saw this giant sphere in the air and I was heading towards it. I was going to the Shy Lounge in Levittown and on to Wantaugh parkway. I then it moved North and I lost trak of it. I was wondering if any body saw it.", "The UFO appeared straight overhead and was a hexagon.It was a clear night.  The UFO appeared straight overhead.  The UFO moved across the sky at about two times the speed of a jet plane.  The UFO was a hexagon.  It was about 50 feet off the ground. It flew right over us.  I saw it on my front porch. My grandfather and I were sitting on the front porch talking and we heard a swishing sound.  I looked up and I told him to look.  We saw a thin hexagon two times the size of an airplane fly across the sky at an amazing pace.  It had flashing lights that changed colors.  The colors on it were unexplainable and I never saw them before.  Then it disappeared and we never saw it again.", "Triangular Craft Traveling Across the Western Sky of East Texas:On June 2nd, 2009 at or about 22:31 Hrs., I stepped outside to the back of my house to continue a call on my cell phone with a friend when I witnessed traveling what I had originally believed was a blimp flying across the western sky from North to South.  However, within moments I realized something unusual about the crafts overall shaped.  I quickly excused myself off the phone and ran inside my house to call my girlfriend, Lisa, to the back of the house to also observe and further confirm what I was witnessing.Upon Lisa and I&apos;s arrival to the back of the house, just moments later, the craft was still in the sky and still traveling across the western sky moving from North to South through the Constellation of Leo, from above the 40 degree azimuthal grid line to below it.The can best be described as a Triangular shaped craft with three white lights appearing to be located on the vertices of the crafts underbelly and one red flashing light appearing to be located upon the center of the crafts underbelly (ventral).  In addition I was also able to hear what I believe to be engine noise emanating from the craft.  The sound was similar to that of a low steady rumble of a jet engine at high altitude traveling at cruising speed.The craft was also not traveling at any unusual speed or pattern and appeared to be moving across the sky at, would appear to be, a comparatively reasonable speed for any aircraft. In fact, if it was not for it&apos;s close proximity to my location I might have not took notice of it.I am a soon to be forty year old male (June 8th) who served honorably as a Security Police Officer in the United States Air Force from 1987 to 1993 and I am currently a Federal Corrections Officer with the Dept. of Justice/Federal Bureau of Prisons and have been for the last fourteen years.

One would leave to the West and one to the East to meet again in the middle.  My husband and I are sure that they are neither planes nor helicopters.Pattern of flight was simple and slow.

None had a jet stream behind them. The first object was moving west at a very high altitude. We watched it till it dissapeared farther into the west, then another object that looked like the same one reappeared quite aways behind and to the side of where that had dissapeared. Almost like it had jumped a far distance behind where we saw the first object dissapear at. That one soon was out of sight. It was probably 10-15 minutes after seeing that, and 2 objects appeared almost side by side, no jetstream, both were shiny, had seemed to appear out of nowhere and began moving further away from each other. One headed south and the other moved westward. There was no sound, no jetstream,they seemed to just pop up in sight out of nowhere and I couldn&apos;t tell you the exact speed, but they were moving pretty fast. I thought I noticed one speeding up at a good rate and another that just was kind of floating forward for a few seconds or so. I really wanted to try and notice altitude and speed change variation but it was really hard to tell. Both objects were extremely shiny bright. Metallic I would say. And, I don&apos;t see it everyday but every so often I&apos;ll notice something like this in the skies in my area. Interesting skies down here. Thank You.((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source of alleged sightings of UFO&apos;s.  Telephone number provided by source of report is bogus.

The color was a white ring.", "two aircraft flying in formation low to the ground, in the city, of an unknown aircraft design, with no noise.Friday, June 19, 2009, 9:15 am I was driving, 60 miles per hour, to work on Interstate 80 heading west just South of Salt Lake City, from about the 700 East Exit to the State Street Exit, approximately one mile in distance I viewed the following.   In the distance, some five miles away, an airliner that had taken off from the Salt Lake International Airport heading due south and slowly gaining altitude when I noticed two aircraft flying parallel to the airliner but most likely closer to my position.    The two craft, in formation, then made a right 90 degree turn and came directly east towards my position and then made another hard 90 degree turn and flying due north over me at maybe 200 to 400 feet, at about the State Street Exit.The time I had to view these craft including paying attention to traffic and observing was at least one minute.The craft appeared to behave aerodynamically.   They seemed to cover quite a bit of territory in a short time, at least four to six miles.  When they made their turn just before passing over me, they must have been near a stall speed to make such a sharp turn and for me to view them in as much detail.I heard no engines, prop or jet.   The Craft were approximately the same size as a military fighter plane, or smaller.   My window was down, but I think I would have heard something over the noise of the traffic.   I-80 is under construction and the max speed is 60 mph, and the traffic was light.The odd appearance of these craft is the reason for this report.  The fuselage was long and cylindrical, coming to a point at the front and rear in the usual aerodynamic configuration.   The wings began about mid point of the length fuselage shaft.    The appearance of the wing configuration, in plan view, is that of a bird with wings spread out.   The leading edge of wing seemed to sweep forward and then back again at the end of the wing, with the rear of the wing flaring back toward the fuselage.   The color was a white or silvery white.    I couldn&rsquo;t remember seeing any secondary wing or tail stabilizer in the rear.    There was no forward secondary wing in front of the shaft as one would expect of so long of a forward portion of the fuselage.    No cockpit canopy could be seen.Upon reviewing what I had just seen, the wings appeared to have a wide black line that followed the contour of perimeter of the wing, and set back from the edge of the wing.I latter called the Salt lake City Airport and talked to the air tower representative and described what I had seen, At first he stated that these craft could be from any number of different government agencies, he then stated that they were most likely VFR craft used in mosquito abatement.   I said they had pretty sophisticated equipment for crop dusting.I will send a copy of a sketch that I had drawn.", "Two Disc type objects of white colour were revolving around each otherOn saturday night,around 2130 hours, we were standing on the roof of our house,when one of us saw two lights in the sky that were revolving around each other.After a few revolutions they appeared to come down to us.The shadow of that object appeared in light,which means it was not an imaginary object.then we saw it again moving at the speed of light.Then it appeared to come near us and we ran towards our home.We heard the dogs barking at a very high intensity facing towards that object.It was a white light object with a disc type periphery.After a while we again went to the roof and for a few minutes we did not see the object but again after 15-20 minutes we saw both the lights  revolving in a variable orbit and making to and fro motion towards each other,we became scared and rushed towards our rooms.", "UFO Sighting in Tulsa, OKOn a calm night in April of this year, 2009, two of my friends and I saw something that we&apos;ll never forget. At least, I won&apos;t. We were down in an urban ravine, just hanging out and talking like friends do. I was the first one to look up and, in awe, see the unidentified flying object. I couldn&apos;t tell you how large or high up it was. All I know is that it was humongous, completely silent, and cruising slowly yet stealthily. Its luminous, phosphorescent lights made its shape out to be triangular or boomerang-like in nature, although the craft itself seemed to be cloaked. The whole spectacle lasted approximately ten to fifteen seconds until it just vanished. One of my friends later told me that he felt like he was being watched when it flew by. My other friend simply dismissed it as either a skein of geese, a weather balloon or swamp gas. But I know what I saw, and I&apos;m sure that it wasn&apos;t either of those things, especially since another witness told me that three helicopters, &quot;two &apos;regular,&apos; and one black,&quot; were scouting the area soon after the UFO had disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

However, the sightings around here seem to be tapering off a bit as I have not had any in the months of April or May, so out of boredom from a lack of activity, I submit this report. On the evening of June 5, 2009 at 9:00 PM, I stepped outside my house to scan the sky before retiring for the evening. The sky was extremely clear and all the stars were visible although somewhat dim due a nearly full moon. After slowly doing a 360 degree scan of the sky three times without seeing anything remarkable, I started walking toward my front door when I noticed an object lit up in the Western sky about 45 degrees above the horizon. The object can best be described as appearing somewhat like a very bright planet Venus, except it was approximately four times larger. The object appeared to just appear out of nowhere in the middle of the sky as it was headed North. The object was brightly illuminated for two seconds and would then quickly dim completely out of sight for 10-15 seconds and then reappear brightly for two more seconds. This sequence was repeated three times. Each time the object traveled approximately 20 degrees across the sky before it lit back up after 10-15 seconds. There was absolutely no noise at all outside during the entire 50 seconds or so of elapsed time of this sighting. I do not believe this sighting to be a normal aircraft due to a total silence during the time of the sighting, a lack of strobes and directional markers, and the relative size would be much larger than a jetliner at cruising altitude. Also, the speed of the object would have been much faster than a conventional aircraft. I also dismiss the notion of this being a satellite, as it was much larger and brighter than any satellite I have witnessed before. Besides, I have never seen satellites turn on and off before either.", "Flashing Light above LAWe saw several flashes of light blinking above Los Angeles in the same exact spot that lasted approximately 5 minutes.  There was no noise, but it was clearly not coming from the ground. It appeared that it was a beacon of light flashing around 500 feet above Los Angeles.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
