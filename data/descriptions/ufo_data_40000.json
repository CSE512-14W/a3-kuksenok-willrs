Me and my mother where watching the parade when they brought in the stealth bomber like they usually do.  Well just behind the bomber just a little above it i saw a strange aircraft that lookew like a grey tube with two other tubes sticking out of the back going up.  I kind of looked like the old star trek ship in the old series. well this thing was about the same size as the bomber.  At first I thought I was crazy but then I quickly asked my mom if she saw that thing, and she told me that she did and she was just as amazed by it as I was. Well I saw the english version of the parade on channel 5 and the didn&apos;t catch on theyre channel.So maybe if you can get the recording from the parade on the channel 34 los angeles i think you will definitely catch it to. call me back I would really like to see you investigate this thing.

When i looked out the living room window i didnt see anything but the triangular black ufo caught my attention. It was flying right over our house almost touching it. It also made no sound. I called to my brother to look and when he did he was just ammazed. We were both actually. At the time we only thought it was a plane cause we didnt know about UFO&apos;S and Aliens. It was flying like it had no speed at all. As it flew over the house we ran to the back window to look at it. The tip of the craft was out of sight already.After not too long we just let it go as a plane and went on playing agian. I didnt really get into UFO&apos;s untill a few years ago. Thats when i actually remembered that day and asked my brother about it. For some strange reason he has trouble talking about it, as if he wants to deny that day in all. He is a pretty to-himself kinda guy now. As for me, a while back i didnt soemthing really stupid as a dumb teenager that changed my life. Ill come forward and say that i smoked something that i wasnt suppost to. It was marijuana, but something was wrong with it i guess cause till this day i have panic attacks and just think really weird. It almost seemed like it opened a door in my head that i can&apos;t close.Im married now with a wonderful woman and family. Im more open to the unknown and can now except the fact that we arent alone anymore. I can say that i know more about life now then anyone should, or atleast i think i do. After that stupid thing happend to me, i feel that that day with the UFO had something to do with MY way of life.

There was suddenly a bright flash that lit up the whole sky-like lightning, except there were no clouds and no thunder followed. We both looked up in the sky and were searching for the source of the flash, when I saw an object moving slowly in a East-South East direction. To me the object appeared to be see-through, as I could barely tell it was there at first. It seemed to blend in with the dark sky and the stars. But, as it moved there were a few lights on the bottom and I knew I was no longer looking at stars. It was huge (If I hold a ruler 12&quot; from the bridge of my nose, the object would have been at least 4&quot; long x 3&quot; wide.) I asked my husband if he saw it and he said he did. As it moved away from us, it gained in speed and in an instant was gone. I have waited almost 2 months to report this due to the strange weather we&apos;ve been having in the area. My husband and I discussed what to do, and we decided to wait and see if it came back. Shortly after this sighting we were struck with a &quot;freak&quot; snowstorm and internet service was knocked out for 4 days. Then, last month, we had 2 severe wind storms, which we are still dealing with the damage from; and again we lost internet service for 5 days.

There were no blinking lights - it was constant and the same brightness.  The movement was from North to South and no sound.

It stopped in the sky in the clouds n got bright as the sun.  it was still dark out so it lit up the sky.  this was very frightening.  it looked like a black canopy with a hole cut in it with light on the other side.

When I say spinning on its side, I mean that it was roughly shaped like this &lt;&gt; except the sides were rounded. much like a 3d oval with pointed ends. the rounded sides was theoutermost spinning edge, like the Earth&apos;s equator, and the pointed ends were like the poles. after I noticed this, I also noticed it was much too low in the sky to be a conventional aircraft. even though it was directly above me, it scarcely cleared the tops of the trees. As I reached into my pocket to pull out my cell phone (which has a camera function) to take it&apos;s picture, it sped up slightly, and I managed to take the picture and save it. shortly afterwards, it stopped spinning for a half second, traveled backwards about 20 yards, and then turned on it&apos;s engines, which emitted 3 vapor trails and began spinning and traveling at great speed. at this time the vapor trails resembled a helix (DNA) without the ladder rungs and one trail in the middle. it zigzaged across the sky, shot upwards and then back down and upwards again, and then flew off at a speed impossible for an airplane or jet, and disappeared beyond the clearing through the trees. shortly after this, I looked back at my cell phone, and it had been turned off (not by me) and when I turned it back on, It had been erased clean of anything I had stored onto it. ringtones, pictures, my address book--all gone. 3 or 4 days later, at night,(approx 2:35 am) I woke up to a pulsing, buzzing, electrical/magnetic type noise directly outside my window. after a minute or two I looked outside, and there seemed to be nothing there.

The light fell at a very fast rate, faster than any falling star I&apos;ve ever seen.  It was also larger than a falling star or meteor I have seen.  It didn&apos;t have a trail, so I highly doubt it was a comet.  It was visible for approximately 6 seconds.  I would assume that it was approximately 1000 feet in altitude.

It had a blue blinking light bulb on each side of the outer disk and I noticed that the direction of the object was well centered to the lights.  That is, that the lights were always on the side of this flying object as if they were the wings of a plane. I immediately thought it was a remote control toy but what really caught my attention is that this one flying saucer was followed by another one, and another one after that, etc.  There were about 5 or 6 of them flying together one after the other.  They were going slow, at about 25 miles per hour and bordering the backyards of the houses that were parallel to this avenue.  They were flying parallel to the avenue.

The base of the object appeared to be off the ground but level with the second story of the house. The top of the object faded into the haze so we had no idea where the top of the object ended. It was very close to the house which gave us a little perspective. It was at least 5 times the size of this 2 story farm house. While it was not touching the ground, it seemed &quot;at rest&quot; hovering beside the house and remained there. I told the driver to turn off the headlights as we grew closer, and instructed him to pull onto the shoulder by the barn so we could take it all in. He turned off the motor and  we just stared. We were both terrified at the scale of this object. The top of the mountain was very dark. There were no lights coming from either the house or the out buildings. There was no moonlight and it was slightly hazy. We sat there for about 15 minutes. There was no noise except for a very low frequency the I can only describe as &quot;feeling&quot; the sound rather than hearing it. At this point, my friend decided he was going to get out of the car and investigate it closer. He opened the door and started to get out when the noise because more audible. I panicked, and literally tore the sleeve from his shirt to restrain him from getting out of the vehicle. I turned the key and started the car motor and told him to drive. I also told him to leave the lights off until we began our descent down the other side of the plateau, which we did. We were both so frightened we wanted leave quickly, but it was like groping for a light switch in the dark. The East Montain Road is very steep and there are several hairpin turns. The mountain pass runs parallel to a deep ravine. From some places on the road, you cannot see the bottom of the ravine (in daylight) and as we were heading down, shortly after we turned on the headlights again, I noticed something glinting in the ravine below. The reflective(?) object was not stationary and seemed to be traveling slightly ahead of us but with us. It was shiny, and traveling like a bullet, only sideways. We were going to try to find a place to pull over again, to let it move on when it seemed to shoot down the ravine on an S shaped course and disappeared. In a S/E direction very similar to the object we saw initially on Rt. 55. This however was NOT the object we saw by the house. These were, in my opinion, two different objects. We vowed never to discuss this with anyone because of the stigma attached. We were both New York State officials at the time. I honestly don&apos;t know why I&apos;m reporting this now, so many years later, but I am still stunned by it to this day when I think about it, and at least I have it off my chest.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

One of the neighbors happens to catch something out of the corner of his eye, and says: &quot;Look at that!&quot; and I turned to look. I had time to turn and see it for about a good 2 seconds. We all witnessed a large, (about the size of a quarter to your naked eye at arms length) orange light traveling in an arc (with the shape of the earth, or atmosphere) The reason I say it was large is that it appeared to be at a very high altitude. It traveled slowly for the few short seconds we saw it.  It crossed the sky on a heading or west to north west, and then simply vanished. Our first thought was that this was a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere. I have no idea what it was, but it was moving a lot slower than a shooting star would move.  I&apos;ve seen Russian Rocket bodies enter the atmosphere, and generally they tend to disintegrate and you can see different parts, or a shower of sparks as they fall. My other thought was that it had something to do with a Chinese Anti Sattelite weapon test, and could have been debris from that.  Again, it didnt splinter or spark. It was just solid. This was really odd.  We have no idea what it was.", "01/07/07  abt. 6:30am. Honey Grove, Tx. Circle  2 min. A circle of light just above the horizon/ stationary then moved east.My husband and I had just woken up, and I looked out the window.  I saw a light and thought &quot;I don&apos;t remember a security light there.&quot;   because that is kind of what it looked like, without the pole.  We live in the country, so any unusual light would be noticed quckly.  It was stationary. I asked my husband, &quot;What is that?&quot;   He looked out, but didn&apos;t know either, but suggested that it might be a hellicoptor with bright lights.  Maybe it was, I don&apos;t know, but it didn&apos;t look like that to me.  And when it moved away the light was the same during the whole event.  In other words, if it had been a light on a aircraft I would have thought you could see the lights direction change, this didn&apos;t at all.I had reached over to put on my glasses to see it better when I looked back it continued to hover in the same spot, but then it began its move to the east.   I was facing North, and thought for a moment &apos;wow, that star is really bright&apos;, but then thats when it began to move, so it definately wasn&apos;t a star.It&apos;s probably nothing, but it did look odd.", "It hovered until we stopped like it was waiting for someone to see it.We were headed east out of rapid city at exit 59 onto I90.  I was driving and noticed a set of landing lights pointed west like they were landing at Ellworth airforce base.   After a mile or two I realised they were&apos;nt moving and said so to my companions.  We continued east all the while watching the lights.  When we got to the last airbase exit I stopped the car at the side of the off ramp.  We all three got out and looked up directly above us at this large black triangle.  It was just hovering above us at about 200 feet.  My guess was about 60 feet from corner to corner.  It continued hovering there for about 20 sec. and then 1 corner went down, another went up, and it turned and floated south towards Rapid City Regional Airport where it disappeared.The weird things:  It was right along side the flight path of military planes landing which is s.e. to n.w.. It was just after sunset the sky was somewhat dark but it was still plainly visible against the light sky.  We were the only people who stopped and I got the feeling they were waiting to see if anyone would stop and look.  When it turned we were directly below and I heard barely audible very muffled jet engines.  When it flew towards the civilian airport it disapppeared.  At first we thought it had to have flown over the airport but after thinking about it we knew that wasn&apos;t likely as there was a plane landing at that time.  The civilian airport is up on a hill which gave me reference height and we believe it flew over towards there and disappeared in front of the hill.  How we don&apos;t know.  It had landing lights on it just like the military and civilian planes all do.  No other lights were displayed.  Distance from exit 59 to the last exit is approximately 7 miles.  It was facing straight west while the landing path is to the n.w..  I think it was a military plane as the airforce base radar surely would pick it up.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I watched it, and it seemed to be the shape of a small circle, silver colored.  It was moving slowly in the direction which I believe is to be south of where I was.  I was still driving, approaching a red light, and kept an eye on it. Once I had a feeling that it was not an airplane, I decided I would turn left into a buisness area to get a better look.  Stopped at the red light, I was able to watch the object for a good 30-45 seconds.  I noticed it was still moving slowly (I was completely stopped), and the color appeared to be a white/silver color.  But every few seconds it would turn a darker color, almost as if it was rotating, and the other side had a different color.  Maybe it was the reflection of light on it, but that did not seem the case to me. When the light turned green, I quickly turned and pulled into a parking lot.  When I got out to search for the object, I could not find it.  I had no idea where it had gone, maybe it was still around, but I could not see it.", "Exploding light in San Diego!I always see orbs of light in my area, at different times of the day.  This time it was different.  For about ten minutes, I looked up at the sky and there was this shining light in the sky,  at an east south east location.  It was wierd because the sun had not set yet and usually I can only see the moon real bright.  From were I was standing, the moon was to the right of the light.  At first I thought that maybe it was a star that was visible at that time but, I have checked and the brightest star visible from my location is Sirius, at that time it would be impossible to see.  Anyway, stars shine, and shift light when visible.  This was a stationary light, real bright.  After, about ten minutes or so the light exploded, or imploded.  It left a visible cloud of smoke and after this happened, you can see a small bright little orb falling slowly away from the cloud of smoke.  After a few seconds, that small light became stationary, then it disappeared.  A few minutes later, you can see two airplanes one behind the other fly by where this light was.  They were leaving those white trails of smoke.", "HUGE UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT SEEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT BY 2 WITNESSES WITH AMAZING DETAIL OF CRAFT DESCRIPTION AND NO DOUBT ABOUT WHAT IT WAS.My boyfriend was driving up the hill to our apartment.  As we went around the bend right above us we saw the what we would describe as the &quot;mother ship&quot;.  It just appeared above us and was hoverring. As my boyfriend kept driving he turned to me and said, &quot;Tell me what that is!!??&quot;  I could not speak so he repeated &quot;Tell me what that is!!?? (even louder).  Then I replied, &quot;I don&apos;t have to tell you what it is...you KNOW what it is!&quot; It was at the very minimum two football fields in size and it was not moving at all, simply hoverred.  It didn&apos;t make any noise, not a sound.  It was close enough above us that my boyfriend said he could throw a rock and hit it.  This was the craziest thing either of us have ever seen in our lives. According to both of us it was extremely similar to the &quot;bigger spaceships&quot; in the movie &quot;INDEPENDENCE DAY&quot;.  There were many lights on its bottom surface and had many exterior fixtures on it...it wasn&apos;t a smooth looking craft, it was very detailed and intricate in its design.  The vision of this craft is so embedded in each of our minds due to the fact that it was so close to us in broad daylight that if we were sketch artists we&apos;d be able to draw exactly what we saw.  As we continued around the tree lined bend it vanished without a sound, without a trace.  It was as if this UFO&apos;s cloaking device or camoflauge system was temporarily disabled allowing us to see it ever so clearly. There is no doubt in either of our minds of what we saw.  There is no mistaking what it was.  It was no small light moving above us in a dark sky. This part of our experience is very clear to us and totally the same.  For whatever reason the only discrepency in our account of this event is in the few hours following the sighting (time loss). If we had not been watching a program on the history channel about UFO sightings, we might not have ever reported this event.

I also woke my mother up to see it, as well.  At first we thought it may be a spotlight (a new club opening up or something), but the center of the activity was in a strictly residential suburbian area and the light changed its course, moving eradically slow then fast and not in a perfect circle, sometimes a square or triangular course, and small then bigger ellipses, but always clockwise.  We could see no beams coming from the ground either, and the light seemed to be radiating parallel to the ground from an invisible object.  (It seems to beam out some at the right and left sides of the circumference, the course being mostly elliptical.)  It is now after 4:00 am 11/27, and the light is still there circling.  Last I checked I saw other light trailing it.  It was breaking in two at the middle of the course (bottom of ellipse) and then the smaller light followed it to the left and upward.  Kind of like the Atari game &quot;Breakout&quot; where it is guided.  Does that make sense?  It moved slow then fast like that.  And, the main light surged, too.  Like I said, it seemed to radiate from a center point above the clouds.  I also saw the light skip and appear further along the circumference immediately several times!  The light is not circular, but hazy (even inbetween the clouds where it is clear sky) and shapeless.  Not like any spotlight I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and it&rsquo;s in the middle of the night and has been going on for five hours.  Also, it held it&rsquo;s position when we went to the front of the house, seemed to be circling over us at the same place as in the backyard.  So, it must have been pretty far away and high up over the clouds.  I hope this makes sense; I&rsquo;ve tried to give as accurate of a description as possible.  I tried to capture it on camera, but it was too dark to pick anything up (maybe I just don&apos;t know how to use the thing!)", "The face in the window was scary as well as amazing!I was driving out to Dennisport to visit my cousin as my uncle rented a house for a weeks vacation.

Exact incident in SingaporeI left work at 7:30pm on Monday and walked up Larchmont Blvd in Los Angeles.  When I got to the intersection of Larchmont and Melrose I noticed the sky lighting up towards the east.  One block east of me is Paramount Pictures and I figured it was filming (battle scenes for Transformers have been shot all over LA the past 2 months).  But the light got brighter and when I looked up I saw three things shooting down from the sky.  I clearly remember seeing green, purple, and a white/blueish color.  It got so bright I closed my eyes and it hit the floor.  Power on that street shut down (and just that street).  The floor shook and I remember hearing what sounded like an electrical voltage sound.  Besides Paramount Pictures, the area around me is mostly residential, including the section of Melrose that the light hit.  I saw several people walk outside to see what it was.  I also noticed that some cars stopped dead as if they ran out of power.About 2 minutes later I saw the LAPD arrive but they had no sirens on... just lights and they were don&apos;t anything.  The cop cars (3 of them) just stopped in the middle of the street and the police officers just stood on the street outside the main entrance of Paramount looking at eachother.  Cars continued to drive up and down the street.  My bus arrived about 5 minutes later and I saw the cops and leaving and several black cars showing up.  I also heard some kind of aircraft in the sky.  Once before I had seen a black helicopter in the sky that only let off a humming noise instead of the usual noise helicopters make.

He said he was texting someone from inside his truck and noticed lights.  He specifically recalled seeing 3 beams of light and seeing green.  He blow it off as electrical transformers blowing up (LA had a Santa Ana winds kicking up that day).  But from my angle and view, no electrical transformer could ever be has high as I saw those lights.Something we both noticed a short time later were hazmat trucks driving towards Paramount.Nothing on the news reported what I saw.  When I looked on the Craigslist, there was no talk to mention of what we saw.  And I know there were other witnesses because not only did I see people walk out of the restuarants and homes, but because it was in the middle of Los Angeles.The next day local news still had not reported anything, neither had the LA Times or yahoo.Today I found a story that on Sunday in Singapore people reported the exact same thing I saw.  3 beams of light or fire, most mentioned they saw green.  And the wierdest and scariest part that my roomate pointed out that I failed to look at, the Singapore newspaper story stated it happened at 7:40pm Sunday (they&apos;re a day behind Pacific time).I can&apos;t find any more information though.

Near the intersection of Cherry Lane and Shellhammer Road in a feild, we spotted the same image they had seen. Three lights moving in a circular motion. It was very creepy. All the dogs were barking hysterically. We looked away due to another car coming on the road, only to discover that the object was not there, but further away. The object seemed to dissapear rather slowly until there was nothing spotted.((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights??

On January 16th,I left my Royal Wood home to make my way to school (yes, I know it seems awfully early to leave, but I have a job to go to before I go to school). It was very cold, and usually I walk to my job listening to my Ipod blasting, so I cant hear anything. Bishop Grandin was deserted, it looked as if I was the only person in the Boulevard. As I approached the intersection at Lakewood and Bishop Grandin, I could see an odd shaped craft appear, hovering over the intersection. It seemed to be about 200 meters in diameter. Once I took my headphones out, I could hear an odd humming noise emanating from the object. It had orange and yellow lights in a pattern and appeared to be spinning quite fast. There was also an orangie-redish haze above and below the craft. The craft levitated for about 2 min., moving up, down, left and right. After it executed this manure, my Ipod shut off. This was strange because I had charged it fully before I left my house. The object hovered for another minuet and rose into the sky. It shot away at what seemed to be &quot;light-speed&quot; in a north-north-west direction. It was snowing when I had this sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It is located in the countryside in Royal Oak, Maryland.  I went out to the deck to smoke a cigarette when dawn was breaking.  It was then that I saw the brown cylinder hanging in the air.  It looked like a metal drum which was bark brown in color.  It had an antenna sticking out of the bottom.  It was floating above the water and started to move westward toward Easton.  As soon as it was light enough it disappeared in the air.", "It looked like a big mirror about 1000 ft above the ski area.  saw it for 30 sec then it went behind the mountain.Well,  a frind and I were sledding in my back yard with a clear view of the ski area,  just above the mountain about 1k off the top was a very bright light.  No wings no exaust and no propeller.  It stayed still for about 10 sec and then drifted behind the mountain so we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.   It looked like a mirror was in the air reflecting light straght at us.  Very Bright.  Total view time abot 30 sec then it was gone.  I would have thought that people @ the ski area would have seen it too because that is what time the mountain closed.  Lots of people getting in their cars.  but so far I guess it was just us that saw it.  I have spent a lot of time up on my hill and have seen all kinds of planes choppers and gliders,  This was none of the above.", "I saw a dark object that at times had a triangular appearance.  No noise was detected and there were no lights at all.I was walking the dog about 5:30 PM Wed..,  Jan 24th, 2007.  The weather was very clear and breezy with some clouds.  The sun was beginning to go down in the west.I saw an object way off in the distance approaching from the north west.  It was quite high in the sky and moving slower than a jet plane moves. There were no clouds obscuring my view of the object.  I watched to see if I could see any lights but there were no bright lights or blinking lights. I could see no wings.  It was difficult to determine the shape but looked slightly triangular at one point.  I thought I could determine some shifting of the shape but I couldn&apos;t really tell. It curved around to the west towards the setting sun.  It never varied in altitude, neither going up or down and the speed always remained the same.  I wondered if possibly it was a weather balloon but I have seen those before and usually the balloons relect white and this was dark brown.  I wondered about a large bird but it looked too big a bird and it wasn&apos;t a flock of birds but a solid object. I watched this object for about ten to twelve minutes and then had to go inside because of the cold air.  It was still in sight when I went in.  Unfortunately I did not have my camera and was the only person outside at the time.  From my vantage point it was high enough in the sky to be way above the two story buildings and trees.  The size from where I was was about one eighth of an inch to a quarter of an inch.  We have alot of air traffic in the area because of DFW airport, Lockheed, and  what used to be Carswell AFB.  It looked as if it was high over the base at one point.  I am familiar with all types of aircrafts and balloons and this looked nothing like anything I have ever seen.   I would really like to know if this was a weather balloon or if any other reports have come in.", "It appeared to be a white cylindrical object near Hollywood/Burbank airport.I don&apos;t know what it was.  I was driving north on Hollywood Way toward the Hollywood/Burbank airport.  I noticed a jet that had just taken off going southwest and was watching it climb (and I criticize cell phone users). Right behind it and moving toward the northwest I noticed a white cylindrical object.  I thought it may have been a private aircraft but private aircraft aren&apos;t permitted to be that close to the airport.  It wasn&apos;t directly behind it but probably a few hundred feet behind it. The object was kind of &quot;floating&quot; as it was moving.  I continued watching it as I was driving until the car next to me (I was in the inside lane) slowed down and began moving toward the lane I was in.  I took my eyes off of the object for less than 10 seconds.

I saw exactly what this guy saw.  But I have the feeling it may be a plane with a undermounted light sign.  Could somebody look into whether you can have a plane with an undermounted sign &quot;like a blimp sign&quot;. While driving home from SF on election night I saw a plane with a light sign advertising for folks to &quot;vote for so and so&quot;   I would really like to put my mind at rest.

I have seen what appears at first to be a really bright star, but as you look more closely with a pair of binoculars you see that this object doesn&apos;t fly but just hovers instead.  And when you look at it with binoculars you can clearly see red, blue, and green lights flashing.  I live right beside clermont county airport so I see planes fly over head everyday.  It just so happens that on one of the nights I seen this object a plane from the nearby airport flew by and you could clearly make out the difference between the plane and the object that I have seen now about 3 times in the past two months.  My mother who lives about 15 miles away called me up the first night and told me to go outside and look up.  I didn&apos;t think anything of it until I grabbed my binoculars and looked more closely.

It seemed to hover for about five minutes.  It was hazy out &amp; the lights appeared to fade back up through the haze after a few minutes.  Assumed haze was normal, but on the MD side of the Potomac River (that seperates WV &amp; MD in that area) was clear. However, I thought the red dot in the center might have been a plane, as the triangular lights appeared to move and rotate in synch, but I remember the red dot moving seperately.  The craft was at least as large as described in the picture, as it appeared over the town of Shepherdstown, WV while I was about a mile away from where it would have been hovering. On a randon side note, there is a Government Wildlife Area that is fenced off, but does have an above ground facility (can&apos;t remember the name off hand).  When I just tried to find it on MapQuest, there is no reference to it. People in Shepherdstown report black helicopters and SUVs frequently, especially on 9-11-01.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "These incidents occurred on the same night as the other incident that I posted about before in which a UFO star-like object moved in space/the sky.  This area of our hike was also the most silent and darkest.  A report that was submitted on 11/30/06 mentions that &quot;SETI wanted to put their Scientific Instruments near the Pinnacle National Monument area&quot; and that &quot;their was reports of local boys in the Pinnacles area that even reported seeing UFOS&quot;.  Indeed Pinnacles seems to be a hotspot for this kind of activity.  My brother and I saw the same lights that he and others saw two years ago.  The first set of lights were observed around 8 PM as we traveled toward the top of North Chalone Peak.  We were on Chalone Peak Trail looking eastwards and down towards a large uninhabited canyon.  My brother had told me about strange lights in that same area and I wanted to see them for myself.  I tried to convince myself that I was just seeing something natural but after several minutes, I saw one of the lights kind of float and move southwards in a very slow but deliberate manner.  The blue light seemed to move just like the star-like light I had observed much later in the sky.  This blue light on the canyon would stop and then move again after several seconds.  About two other lights appeared later but up further towards the south.  As we walked further, about two lights also appeared below us but in a southwest location between Jackass Canyon and Divide Canyon.  Incidentally, about 2,000 Native Americans were slaughtered and buried below that area.  This is where we observed one of the lights also float in the canyon except that this particular light seemed to very slowly travel in a parallel direction toward the trail that we were on.  We then continued our ascent to the top.  After about 40 minutes, we then began to travel back on the trail to head back home.  We again saw the same light continue to travel and float but we then continued on our journey.  It started to rain a few minutes after we ! began ou r descent. After it had been lightly raining for a few minutes and we were making our way on Chalone Peak Trail toward the bottom of the mountain about 10 minutes before Bear Gulch, we saw a normal-looking white light--the kind emitted by a light bulb--in the distance.  We took the wrong trail near Bear Gulch Cave when we noticed the light directly below us in the northwest at the bottom of a canyon.  I thought it was a light from the national park&apos;s employees&apos; living quarters.  After a few minutes, my brother commented on how the light seemed to be a guide for us since we had trouble finding our way back.  The most surprising incident occured when we were nearing our way towards the end of the trail.  This is when I saw that same light traveling passed us in the opposite direction, through a canyon that was to the left of the trail we were on.  The light seemed to be about 70 feet directly across us to the left and at the same height of our  heads.  I only noticed it slightly but my brother asked me if I had seen the light to which I answered, yes.  I quickly thought it was another hiker but realized that we were the only ones on the mountain, plus it was around 11:30 PM.  Why would a hiker be traveling up the canyon where there are no trails on that canyon at that time?  It was too late and it was raining.  I later learned that the light didn&apos;t just pass us as I thought.  My brother saw that same light floating and then disappearing in an instant.  He didn&apos;t tell me that then because he said that I might have gotten scared.  I then realized that the employees&apos; living quarters was far away from the canyon where we had seen the light.  I never felt any fear but I don&apos;t think I will ever travel there at night unless I do it with a group of people.  I hate to think what would have happened if we had come into contact with any of those lights.", "Perfectly round with blue and orange perimeter lights. Windows all around the perimeter.In the summer of Approx. 1977 my wife and I were in the Venture parking lot on 159th and Torrence when I notice lights on the hood of my car. I realized the lights were a reflection so I looked up and saw it. No more than 200 ft. directly above us was a UFO about 50 yards in diameter, orange and blue rotating lights around the perimeter. Absolutely no noise at all. It was not moving. Inside the perimeter looked like the bottom of a truck or car with lots of pipes. Windows all around the edge with the lights rotating. after a few seconds it started floating west of Torrence ave. When I went around the Ventures buildind it was gone.

Less than one block from our home, we turned off the side street and something caught our eye at the same instant.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of our pick-up truck and saw three large yellow-orange lights that appeared directly over several homes in our neighborhood.  The lights made a perfect large triangle shape.  They appeared to be just below the treeline.  From the angle I was viewing, I could see the lights (very orb like and very bright, but they were constant and shining straight down and not rotating). The object seemed to just hover right below the treeline. I could barely make out a rough outline of a large dark triangular craft. I would say the craft was about the size of two small homes, but I could not judge it&apos;s height. Just as I saw it, my fiancee asked, &quot;Do you see what I see?&quot;  I asked him what he saw.  He said he saw three bright lights shaped in a triangular form and as soon as he said this, the object disapppeared, just seemed to be gone. We could not believe what we had seen, and when we got home, I immediately asked him to draw on paper the shape of the lights and told him I would do the same.  Our drawings were identical.  However, he said he could not make out anything but the lights but that it did just disappear.  My fiancee&apos;s truck window was slightly down and there was absolutely no noise.  This was on a clear night.  We live near Wichita, KS where there is a large airport and many flights cross our skies, but my fiancee and I have never seen an airplane with a triangluar form and lights that hovered and then as quickly disappear, with no sound at all.", "Flew 50 feet in air, one after another, came back towards us, and then went back into the opposite direction.I was walking down the street near the EWG, north kingstown border with my friend late at night. We were walking from another friends house back to his house. It must have been 11pm to 1am. It was a few months ago, i don&apos;t remember the date. 3 circles of lights flashed through the sky, extremly fast, and low. About 50 feet in the air. They did not go in a triangle pattern. They flew one after another. Then they came back towards us, as we ran into the woods. Then they went back into the other direction. It was the strangest thing i have ever seen in my entire life. We ran back to my friends house. Two weeks later the same friend and I were in the same area walking a friend back to her house. My friends ran ahead of me, and i saw the lights by myself. On the way back to our house, both my friend and I saw these lights again, but they only flew over us once.", "A triangle shape of 3 rapidly flashing blue-white lights moving slowly over downtown Salem, ORI was driving on Mission Street heading west in downtown Salem with my 2 &frac12; year old son.  I heard a low humming sound and looked up to see a triangle of bright white-blue rapidly flashing lights.  The craft didn&rsquo;t appear to be much bigger than a prop plane. The craft was flying slowly (25 mph) due west at a low elevation.  The lights were moving in a clockwise rotation.  I called my husband at home (we live 1 mile south of downtown).  He went outside saw it as well, moving towards the West Salem hills.  I drove home and we watched it until it made a turn north and moved slowly out of sight.  I called the Salem Municipal Airport and the woman there said there were no aircraft over Salem at that time.", "back in 1974 I was 19 at the time and  lived in a suburb of Cardiff Wales UK called Ely, and in the distance there was a wood called Caerau woods.

A little after midnight on New Years Eve, our whole party went outside to ring in the new year. When we looked up we noticed what looked like a whole swath of stars that were amber in color were travelling in a column, we watched them for about 13 to 14 minutes.  I happened to have a pair of binoculars with me and managed to hand the binoculars to everyone in our party.  From what I saw, when I had my binoculars were these objects were spherical in shape and were slightly pulsing in 1 second intervals.  Some were swirling around one another.  At the end of the 13 - 14 minute window I saw the objects gather in a swarm on the horizon and split off, one part of the swarm going right the others going left with only a couple going straight up and disappearing.  A few minutes after the sighting I noticed a couple jets in the vincinity.Our party had one amateur astronomer and one fireman.  Our astronomer states they were not stars or airplanes.

It was apx 8:20 am and it was just beginning to turn daylight.  My daughter and I saw a single bright light in the sky ahead of us, slighly off to the left.  It looked slightly smaller than a dime from our view.  We watched this bright light, first it looked like it was hovering, but then it was slowly moving.  Real slow. The light was shimmering, not blinking, but like it would dim then grow brighter, dim again, etc. We watched for abt. 1 min and it just disappeared.  Like a light switch, it was on and then it was off and there was nothing there.   We saw it again about 2-3 minutes later, except by the second sighting it had moved it&apos;s position in the sky to where it was directly ahead of us.  We watched for about a minute, and again, like a light switch, it just vanished.  It was totally light out at this point now and there was not a cloud in the sky.  We found it a third time in the sky, and we could tell it was moving slowly again. We followed it with our eyes, and within a minute, the bright light went totally out again, but this time instead of being nothing there, as soon as the bight light went out, we saw some kind of object (resembled a rocket) with three blinking lights running parallel  underneath it ( two white, one red).  It had two small...wings, for lack of a better word, positioned midway on the object.  It looked black or a dark color.  The three lights were not the same bright light that we had originally saw when we first spotted it in the sky.  These were different lights, much smaller. This object just disapeared in the sky, just like it had the first two times we saw it.  No trail, tail, no haze, no nothing.  There one minute and gone the next.  It didn&apos;t fly off, it just disapeared into thin air.  This was unlike any plane I have ever seen.   I should also mention that this sighting was near the Fermi Nuclear Power plant in Monroe, Mi.

We would like to have the witness re-submit his report, using one report form per sighting.  PD))Lights in the sky and a shiny object that went behind a cloud, cloud disappeards after a whileI work in CampHill, get back from work at various times of the day since I have flexible work hours. I drive from my office on Erford Road to N. Front St across the Harvey Taylor bridge. I&apos;ve had 3 experiences that I found strange worth reporting, particularly after reading some of the reports from Harrisburg, PA. 1) About 2 weeks back from (12/29/2006), driving back from work around 7&apos;ish in the evening, I had just entered Harvey Taylor bridge and I was looking at the sky in front towards the state capitol and I see a set of lights in the sky, bright white lights in the distance off to the right side of capitol. My first thought was that it must be lights up in the mountain and then realized the mountains are to my left and I was still wondering what the light was, continuing to drive looking at the road and the sky, by the time I was getting towards the Front St. intersection I could see the lights were turning right to left and just disappeared. By the time I got to the intersection and had a red I was thinking it must have been a plane since there&apos;s an airport close by, but I&apos;ve never seen that many lights and they were very bright and gave the appearance it was in far off and it disappeared, since I have to use 2nd st to get to my apartment on Front St and there are buildings on 2nd I couldn&apos;t see anything more. When I parked my car at the apartment I scanned the sky in the direction in which I had seen the lights hoping to see something but there was nothing, and I thought nothing of it. 2) Today (12/30/2006)I was coming back from my weekly gorcery at Giants (Camp Hill), I was driving back on Harvey Taylor bridge, I had just entered the bridge and again a set of lights this time towards the left side of capitol and a lot closer than what I saw last time. I could count about 6 distinct bright white lights, I couldn&apos;t make out any shape as I continued driving I&apos;m looking at the sky and the road ahead, it&apos;s impossible to stop on Harvey Taylor without getting yourselves killed because a lot of people speed, I had covered about 3/4th of the bridge and the ligths as far as I could make out were stationary and then the lights just disappeared. I kept scanning the sky for anything a plane, anything that could explain the lights as I was driving on 2nd and again when I got to my apartment and parked. I usually see planes in the evening sky from probably the airport close by but they are identifiable becuase you see them, there are the lights which are not unusually bright and you can see them move steadily and then you hear them and if you keep looking you can see them go away from you. I have lived in this area for close to 4 years now, I think I have a fairly good idea of the Harrisburg skyline, I usually bike or walk and many I&apos;ve taken my bike across the brige to look at the skyline from the other side of the river. I think I can say those lights were not from any building, even though the lights I saw was low in the sky. I&apos;m not an expert and I have nothing to gain from this, just found it a little strange and I thought I should report. Coming to the third experience, I have not too much to report. I live in a high rise apartment on the front st, overlooking the river with my apartment windows giving a beautiful view of the mountains in the distance. Some time in the past 2 weeks (it was a weekend because I was home) probably around 2-3 PM, I was going in to the kitchen to make some coffee. There&apos;s a small window in the kitchen facing the mountain, I just instinctively looked outside, and saw a small patch of wispy clouds in the sky over the mountains, probably what made me stop and continue looking at the clouds was a shining disc like object just at the edge of the clouds. I kept staring, thinking that I should go to my living room window because it gives a better view but I couldn&apos;t move and kept staring and I saw the object disappear behind the clouds. I went in to my bed room pulled out my binoculars (I&apos;ve got a 15*70 Porro Prism Celestron) from the shelf and to look the clouds hoping the object would reappear. The clouds was not too much and the sky was really clear and blue, just a little and wispy, but I could see nothing but the clouds. So I put my binocular down, pulled my chair to the window and just sat there staring at the clouds, the strange thing was the clouds disappeared totally, usually you see the clouds moving with an air current but this just disappeared and the sky was totally clear. I sat there in my chair looking out the window and after a while I just went back to my routine life. I am an amateur astronomer and I look at the sky with my naked eye and at times with my binoculars (harrisburg city is not the best place to look at night sky). I have no idea about what I saw, just that it was not normal that I&apos;m used to. I am an engineer and I work in a field where my main skills are problem solving, I would rate myself as a person with a scientific outlook. I did not bother to look at the exact time and I did not even bother to note down the date, becuase I still hope that there is a simple explanation and maybe what I was just something very ordinary and easily explained, probably it was just that I found it strange. What brought me to this site was to try and see if there was anyone reporting anything like this in Harrisburg and google search brought me here, I thought for a long time before I decided to post what I saw.", "triangle with very bright lights on I-10 near Casa GrandeI have looked occasionally on this site to see if anyone else had posted about a sighting in near Casa Grande AZ in 1999.  To my surprise, someone else posted and apparently saw the exact thing I saw. Large, triange-shaped craft with three very bright lights on each corner.  The craft was darting very quickly across I-10 as we approached from the north.  My son was asleep in the back seat and I woke him to look.  The craft at one point got along side of the car and then &quot;shot&quot; at a very high speed parallel to the interstate..as if it was racing the cars.  At least two times, the craft seemed to stop in mid air and then spin, moving in the opposite direction.  I heard nothing. I slowed to watch but was too stunned to stop.  I saw only one car pulled to the side.  All others were going very slowing on the interstate.  I know what I saw and it was real.

The two groups of fire lines were oriented in different directions. The fire lines appeared to come from the sky and were bright enough to penetrate the light clouds that passed by.  The lines grew steadily brighter and then receded, but never appeared to change distance, heading, or other appearence.

I drove, and he asked if I could stop down in Chinatown so he could pick up some tea and some new teacups. I took 95-N and got off at the Washington Ave exit, and proceeded up Washington Ave to 7th St. A few blocks before I turned onto 7th, I was looking up at the clouds when I saw something just kind of sitting there in the clouds that I could not identify. When we turned south on 7th St., we pulled into a parking lot just off the intersection and across from Pho Ha where my father wanted to stop. I decided to hop out and use the DV camcorder my folks bought for my girlfriend and I back in Novemember when our son was born, and started recording. The quality is not the best, and there&apos;s a Vietnamese band playing in the background in part of the footage but take a look.It&apos;s clearly not an airplane or a helicopter.  Around 2:38, I zoom all the way out to show just how far away this thing is, and based on that (which you&apos;ll see), I don&apos;t feel confident that it&apos;s a balloon as from that distance, even with my good eyesight, I don&apos;t think I would have seen a regular balloon flying that high, that far away, with the late afternoon sun kind of in my eyes otherwise. So by definition, it&apos;s a UFO. What exactly it is, I don&apos;t know but enjoy, let others know for enjoyment if you want, and leave some comments if you want. I wrote about it on my website here - (http://phillybits.blogspot.com/2006/05/ufo-sighting-over-philadelphia.html)  Video can be seen here - (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKEk5nu00lQ)", "TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS ABOVE 134 FREEWAY PASS IN BUENA VISTA ST.AT VERY HIGH ALTITUDE ALMOST LIKE AIRLINER ON APPROACH FOR LANDING.

We had spent many hours in our planes and on this particular occasion we were getting ready to go to Colorado; my husband wanted to see if we would need oxygen at (not certain of the exact altitude) 12-13 thousand feet.  (I have his log book at our home in Indiana and I&apos;m at our home in Florida as I write this; this will give the exact date and possibly the altitude)  We drove our ElCamino from South Bend to Plymouth, where our plane was hangered, about 2:00 am, did our pre-flight noticing nothing out of the ordinary.  He needed night flying and also time &quot;under the hood&quot; for his IFR rating; so he decided to kill a few birds at one time.  (It&apos;s been so long since this happened and my husband would not allow me to talk about it while he was alive; but I&apos;ll try to get as close to what the distances are as I can remember)  He was going to do a 5 or 10 mile precision turn up to the 12 or 13 thousand mark and I was his &quot;spotter&quot;.  The 5 or 10 mile precision turn means that you keep making circles around a central point and climb so many feet per minute.  My job was to keep quiet and watch for any traffic.  The night was clear as a bell and there was no traffic at SBN who we had filed our flight plan with. We started our climb and the sky was empty; no traffic any direction.  About 20 minutes into the climb I noticed traffic at 1:00 o&apos;clock.  I looked up again and the same traffic was at 1:00o&apos;clock.  This happened the third time and I said to myself (because he had told me to keep completely quiet so he could concentrate); this cannot be happening because we are making a CIRCLE and the traffic is in EXACTLY the same spot. It came a little closer from the first time I noticed it till the exercise was finished; but not much. It only appeared as a light coming straight towards the plane. It seemed too far away the whole time that I never feared of it hitting us. I felt like they or someone knew exactly what I was thinking. I felt that it was magnetically &quot;glued&quot; to the plane because it NEVER moved an inch. I kept scooting around to make double certain that it wasn&apos;t a reflection of light from any place in the plane; it was not a reflection.  I even put both hands up to the glass and looked at it like that. When we finally were within 1000 feet of out goal my husband asked me to light a cigarette for him; at that time I finally said, &quot;We have something at one o&apos;clock&quot;.He said, &quot;Congratulations, it has been there since 3 thousand feet&quot;.  My husband had gotten the Bronze Star in WW2 and was never one who would become excitable; this is an important aspect in this event. I asked him to call SBN to see if we had traffic and he wouldn&apos;t do it; finally I coaxed him into it and they replied to us that not only did we not have traffic that he hadn&apos;t seen any in our area all night. We broke formation and headed for the airport and it came with us for two or three minutes and when we signaled for the lights to come on in the airport it changed position to dropping behind us; it had followed us down as we lost altitude. As we were landing it kept getting closer and closer to us; as we touched down it kept very still about 300 feet from us.  We pulled up to the hanger door; jumped out, even left the charts in the plane, quickly put the plane in, we did it so fast we broke the taillight from the top of the tail. There was absolutely no noise coming from the bright light and we were close enough to have heard any noise from it.  Jumped in the El Camino and drove as fast as we could to the highway; he started to turn north towards home and I screamed &quot;No don&apos;t go that way it&apos;s deserted; go toward town&quot;.  He turned south and by the time we came into downtown Plymouth we were going almost 100 mph.  He said &quot;Where ((three words deleted)) are the police when you need them?&quot;   Trees had kept us from being able to see the &quot;light&quot; because they are all along on both sides of the street. I was able to see that it was following us until we went under the trees. I couldn&apos;t get him to go inside the police station and he wouldn&apos;t let me go in.  He refused to report it to the FAA and made me promise not to talk about it.  He said he didn&apos;t want anyone thinking he was nuts.  He died Jan of 05. To this day I have a spooky feeling if I go near there; and will not go at night.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was still mainly dark but dawn was just beginning and you could still see the stars and moon. The sky was almost completely clear with only the odd low wispy cloud. After maybe 30-45 seconds the object caught my attention as I was looking in an E.S.E. direction. It appeared to be quite large although it&apos;s hard to say how high and how far away it was- I will guesstimate it at 4 to 10 miles away and at an altitude from 6 to 12 thousand feet. The object was a general triangle shape however the &quot;front&quot; seemed to stick out slightly in a semi-circle protuberance. The closest thing I can compare it to is a badminton birdie that has been flattened and then had its back flared end cut straight across to form 3 straight sides but with the rounded rubber end sticking out at the front somewhat. The object was travelling downward at about a 55 degree angle very smoothly at a fairly slow speed- it almost seemed to float or slide through the sky. The object made no noise and seemed to be made of white light or was luminescent. It&apos;s colour was very close to the bright moon&apos;s although it seemed to be less substantial- as if there was no actual physical{steel,aluminum...} structure to it. - The light reflects off of the moon so you can see it but this thing seemed to consist of light itself. It retained its clear shape for about seven seconds with no contrail and then over about the last 3 seconds it sort of slowly, uniformly shimmered and faded out of the absolutely clear sky- it just disapearred out of thin air and I was left there literally with my jaw hanging open. I was in awe of it and was excited,stunned,bewildered,delighted and in disbelief all at the same time. After about 30 seconds had gone by and I was pretty sure it wasn&apos;t going to reappear I ran inside to check the exact time and try to process what I had just witnessed. I can say that I am 100% convinced that it was some kind of craft utilizing technology far beyon! d what t he world&apos;s public is aware of.

So here goes. I was a high school senior with my boyfriend and another couple driving out one summer night to my boyfriend&apos;s family farm.  As we approached a hill near the farm I noticed a very bright light ahead of us up the hill slowing moving across the road.  It was so bright and unusual that we pulled over, stopped the engine and watched.  Scary as it might seem now, we were just in awe of what it might be.  In what seemed like eternity the object made its way across the road almost directly in front of us just above the tree tops with no sound at all coming from it.  By this time the object, which my memory now thinks of as a fat (in height) oval, was not as bright.  We had also at some point gotten out of the car just staring at it, not believing what we were seeing.  And there were maybe 3 or 4 other cars that had stopped and parked as well on both sides of the road watching the same event, but I don&apos;t recall talking to any of them.I don&apos;t know how long we stood there, but the thing I remember most is that the object made absolutely no sound and just hovered there with some kind of colored and white lights revolving on the top very slowly.  I felt then and still do now that whatever it was, it knew we were there. Then the object started very slightly backing up away from us.  Just a moment later it backed away much faster then stopped again.  Before we could blink it was gone!  A massive object was a small dot in a matter of seconds!  Gone.

In front of me were mountains, and as previously mentioned, we are in a valley surrounded by mountains. The time was around 8:00 PM, and it was mostly dark. As we were preparing our equipment, a light appeared to my left and a metallic object suddenly appeared, saucer shaped with little windows or portals around it, I clearly could see little portals on the craft. When I first saw it, it was as though it just appeared, yet it was moving across the sky. It was flying in front of me; I estimate its elevation was around 1-2000 feet above where I was standing, moving across the sky, from my left to right, towards Dillon Damn. it was around 2000 feet in front of me. The mountains where in the background and it was definatlely flying in the valley. It was traveling fast, but not to fast for me to observe the little portals. The object was very bright. I followed it for probably 8 seconds and it just disappeared right in front of my eyes. The friend I was with only saw the light of the object, as he was busy with his equipment and just looked up as it disappeared. He did see the outline and the light of the object, but for only a second, and was not able to describe it, only that it did appear.

My home is situated on almost six acres of woods near  the Ward Pound Ridge reservation.  I suddenly noticed a bright, bluish white, xenon light streak into view and stop. It began to zig and zag, stopping briefly at the end of each zig and zag and going from one skylite to the other. Almost as if it was looking in.  I screamed to my husband to come see and he ran from the bathroom.  We ran to the north facing windows of our room and observed its zigs and zags over the tree tops, in the direction of the reservation, for several minutes.  It moved laterally, diagonally and horizontally  and always stopping briefly at the end of its movement.  Its size, as we observed it streaking over the treetops, was similar to a small plane&apos;s from that distance.  It struck us as very similar to a firefly and we wondered if it might have been a firefly but later we saw real fireflies and they had softly green glowing bodies, clustered around each other, and did not move like this bright bluish white light did.  Fireflies also did not suddenly streak off into the sky at the incredible speed that this bright light did when it was done doing whatever it was doing.   The light returned two nights later and we were able to observe it once more, now really amazed and acting like children we were high-fiving each other and yelling &quot;we saw a UFO! and it came back to visit us!&quot; The incredible speed that this light/object was moving at was truly unusual.

I turned of the car lights, but left the radio on.  Then the radio station started messing up and completely stopped.  I looked over at my friend, who at the time was approxiamately 17. I looked in front of the car and there was, what appeared to be a very bright street light about 100 feet in front of us.  I asked my friend if they had a new street light installed because it was bright.  He said no.  Then, I looked again, and the light had moved positions.  It was now hoving over a rural farm house that we had stopped by.  I asked him if the light had moved positions, and he laughed at me.  We both looked again, and it moved a third time.  This time it was hovering over a tree.  The house and tree looked bright as day.  The light was so bright that it was like putting a spot light right on them.  Only in a big way.

I&apos;m not sure that whoever was flying the craft realized that we were in the car watching, but we didn&apos;t move.  We watched the object come closer and we started getting very scared.  It came very close and we got a very detailed description.  The object was a grey-metallic color, it was saucer shaped.  It had what appeared to be tiny windows in the middle of the saucer, going all the way around it.  The object just hovered there and then it happened.  They turned on the lights.  Oh what amazing lights.  They were almost irridescent in color.  Red, Yellow, green, blue.  I could almost see like a fuschia pink/purple color in there.  Like a christmas tree with flashing lights.  Only they flashed the lights so fast that I couldn&apos;t keep up with the color changes.  My friend was punching me in my leg and screaming to drive, but all I could do was put my face in the windsheild and! say, &quot;L ook at all the pretty colors.&quot;  Then I saw what seemed to be an almost transparent dome on the bottom of the saucer.  It was like a golden amber color.  I thought that maybe the bright lights were coming from that.  I mean the bright white light over the house and tree.  The dome wasn&apos;t very big at all.  Matter of fact, I would have never noticed it unless the thing was so close.  It was approximately 1 acre away, just hovering.  It was as close to me as my neighbors house is today.  I was completely mesmerized. Then, approximately 5 minutes after the last move and light show, it just stopped all lights and moved to the south as fast as it could.  It was gone in a flash, and I was shaken.   Of course, it was a very big ordeal and I told my parents about it immediately.  I stayed home from school for a while that week, as I was a senior in high school, and was very confused about the situation.  My friend had gone to school and when I went back, he had told people at school what we had seen.  I was embarrassed about it because I didn&apos;t want people knowing what we had seen.  I didn&apos;t want people to make fun of us about it or ask any questions.  Now that I&apos;m older, I&apos;ve learned to deal with this situation much better.  If anyone at the center has seen anything remotely close to what I&apos;ve encountered, please let me know.

The cabin owner came out and asked if we wanted to see the northern lights.  We went down to the lake and saw a pyramid of laser like lights emanating from a vertex 500 to 1000 feet above the lake.  There were six or eight beams of light that had no deflections in them like a flashlight beam has. These were like lasers shining into the water so that the base of the pyramid had to be at least 200 yards across.

The vapor trail was straight up and down but the horizontal vapor trail changed direction several times in an erractic succession. Upon meeting our freinds they were baffled as to what they saw. They asked us if we saw the vapor trail. They were much closer to it than we were, in fact they were transferring golf clubs into another car in a parking lot when they saw what they described as a small round object launch extremely fast , as a rocket would launch, vertically.It than seemed to drop back towards them at which time it again rose very rapidly and than turned on a dime toward the west and quickly disappeared to the west. They described it as a round metallic object that was very hard to see due to its extreme speed. What was apparent was its vapor trail off of both sides of it. They also said it was extremely silent.

We were hoping that someone else also had this sighting, as it was very strange indeed.What bothers me is when something this apparent is not publicized ,it seems others must have seen it also.

Magnitude was as great as Mars at it&apos;s closest. Then 2 more appeared behind the roof into view, so we stepped out to see if there were more moving across the sky.17 lights in total, all within 70 degrees of each other moving South-East from the North-West.  All were the same brightness and color. A bright Orange to reddish.As the first 3-4 moved through the 12 o&apos;clock(meridian) they started to change course. A few slowed then turned about 90 degrees and out of the path, then a few faded and made a left 270. 2 actually stopped, as noted against a clear sky of stars and a bright moon.

There were no stobe lights or red and green wings lights as associated with A/C.  There was no sound associable with these &quot;satellites&quot;. The time for the &quot;Non Dancing&quot; lights to traverse the sky was about 9 minutes, the same as a satellite or the Space Shuttle.

This object had no lights that flashed or strobes that identified it as a plane or helicopter. As it moved it seemed to be slowing down. My wife thought it was stopping and then moving slowly again. I pulled the car over and we got out and watched the object. It was stopped and motionless. The light began to pulse slowly. It also appeared to be swaying from side to side like a kite in a breeze. Then it began to move slowly north. We got back in the car and continued driving north, watching the light from the car. I pulled up to a stop light and the light was moving slower and then stoped again, then began moving back to the south for about 5 seconds then started moving north again.

I pulled up in front of my house and got out in a hurry and the light was still visible to the west and it was moving north. Then it moved a little faster and disapeared in about the same way it appeared.", "A montage of events, you figure out what this was, I really am not sure.While leaving a friends house in rural Monroe County, three of us stepped out onto the front porch.  I commented on a greenish glow in the horizon, but the other two friends thought I was being funny.  I didn&apos;t say anything more about it, but after about 1 minute, I noticed that the horizon had become substantially greener.  The neon green glow stretched from one end of the horizon, to the other.  This was a very large phenomenon.  I told the two I was with to look again, and they were very surprised by what we were now looking at. Very soon after the horizon had taken on what was now a very green glow, objects began to materialize then dematerialize, and move in an &quot;S&quot; shape for about half an hour.  This is a description of the objects that materialized:  First, let me tell you that the night was perfectly clear.  The initial object appeared and had a cloud like texture, which literally materialized right before our eyes, but then began to expand outward in the a diamond shape, with the center being empty, yet it was aligned with the outer diamond shape.  After reaching a certain size of expansion, the object would dissipate, or dematerialize. Then, more of the same object began to occur, and began occurring simultaneously in different areas of the horizon.  Very soon after, another object appeared, but this one was circular and would move in an &quot;S&quot; shape downward toward the earth, leaving an &quot;S&quot; trail, and then dissipating as well.  This also had a cloud like texture to it.  Several of both kinds of objects kept appearing and either expanding as a diamond shape until dissipating, or growing into a circular shape and moving in an &quot;S&quot; pattern, downward toward earth. The sky remained a very strong glow of green, and then in what seemed to be the climax of the entire event, two objects, both about the shape and size of a full moon, seemed to materialize out of nothing, a single object in between them appeared and shot down toward earth, and then shot right back up again.  After this, the entire phenomenon began to slowly go away.  It took another 15 minutes for it all to stop, each of the objects I described, except for the final moon like objects, began to appear less and less, and the sky slowly turned back to normal, and then it was all gone. Let me note, this phenomenon made no sounds.  Also, I ran in the house and called the Sheriff&rsquo;s department to ask if anyone had reported any strange phenomenon in the Northern part of the sky.  They said no, so I did not want to talk any further as they would have thought I was crazy.  I also called my sister who lived about 25 miles north of where I was and she said she saw nothing in the sky either.  So, I just ran back outside to continue watching.  My friends and I were in shock at what we just witnessed.  Then, I decided to go home, but I did notice every here and there, people were pulled over onto the side of the road watching the sky.  I have to think that they saw the same thing I did.  The following day, my friend who was with me, and attended the University of Michigan, asked a science professor if the northern lights were visible from where we were and he said they were not.  Besides, the northern lights don&apos;t do all that!((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As we follow the airplanes into the distance counting how many coming in, there was a red light standing still at the end of the traffic.  It seemed to be like the next airplane to come in but too far to be in the flight plan to land. My father in-law said &quot;Hey, that&apos;s not a plane.&quot; I said &quot;That looks like it&apos;s over the lake or maybe past the lake.&quot; (Lake Mead)  We watched it for about a minute and then saw it start to travel straight up. As it started to move, it seemed to slightly shimmy side to side while moving upwards in altitude.  It was hard to judge distance of travel but it lasted about 20 to 25 second before the light turned to a 45 degree angle and continue to ascend at a slower rate.  At the 45 degree angle, the light gradually faded as if it was ascending and traveling away from us. This lasted about 30 seconds before completely fading away. Unfortunately, I did not have a camera and besides my camera would not have the resolution to pick up the light clearly.  There is no doubt, on my life, that this light was not something an ordinary aircraft could do.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The object flew right over our car.  It was silent and seemed to be landing in the grass to our right. My friend started screaming for me to hit the gas and get out of there. I wanted to see it but because she was so histerical I did hit the gas and scurried on out of there as fast as I could.  My friend had a better view of the object as she looked out her window as it flew over the car and started to get lower and seem to be wanting to land to our right and saw it fly right over us - I could see the reflection of the lights from the object as it flew over head on the ground as it went over the car and to the right.

Four of the sightings were in the same location and around the same general time of between 1;30 and 2;00 am.  The fifth sighting was in a diffrent location and was about 45 minutes earlier .  This sighting was due north of the usual location of the sightings.  The craft was this night traveling south from north and was traveling at the same steady speed and about the same altitude.  The speed I would judge was about 20 to 25 mph and was silent of noise or vibrations.  If it was a painted craft it would be of a black color.  It had white lights that strobed on the outer end edges of the rear part of the triangle with a solid burning white light in the front point of the triangle.  It was a bit brighter I think than a normal landing light on a plane.  I saw no green or red light as one would expect to see on a normal plane indicating port and starboard. The thing that was of intrest to me was that if it had been just another 45 minutes later the thing would have been over the same area that i usually saw it for the previous four times.  As it happened this night I was running a bit early and therefore was in another part of town.  The area of town is with housing additions and very thick wooded areas in between them.

I and my son riding in the front seat saw a fiery object rapidly descending from the sky to the east of our position. My son in the rear seat did not see it. The object was orange (according to my son; I am color blind), it appeared to me to be the color of fire).  At first I thought it might be a shooting star but it lasted a bit too long and appeared to be very close to earth.I then thought it might be a flare or, perhaps, an exploding transformer since the temperature was below zero Fahrenheit.  But it seemed to fall way too rapidly and in too straight a path to be either of those things.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem plausible that it was any known aircraft since it featured just the one fiery light.It looked like it might have landed behind our house, perhaps within hundreds of feet.  Of course if it was a large object, it&rsquo;s possible it fell miles away.  Less than three miles to the east here takes you over the ocean.   Green Valley Road is a sparsely populated neighborhood in a very small town in a very rural state. To give you some perspective, our back yard is 44 mostly wooded acres.  Anyway, we went up the road a few hundred yards to see if anything was smoldering but saw nothing of the sort.

I first contacted the Center for UFO Studies in Chicago in 2006. I am reporting it here because I am still perplexed by what I saw. It was a clear Fall evening in Silver Spring, Maryland and I was reading a book in my den.  The window shades were pulled up and the windows were open because it was a relatively warm night.  Above the treeline, I spotted what appeared to be a star or planet that seemed to be unusually bright.  I glanced at the object from time to time between reading the book and listening to my teenage kids who were home at the time. I grew slightly intrigued by the object because it appeared to be hovering while the other stars seemed fixed in there locations and an occassional plane would fly by in the distance.   I thought it may have been a helicopter but the there were no red lights, blue lights or search beams that I associate with helicopters.  Downtown Silver Spring is an very urban area located 5 minutes from Washington, D.C., so helicopters are not an unusual sight at all.The object disappeared below the tree line and re-appeared about two minutes later. I called my then 17-year old daughter and asked her to look out the window and tell me what she saw.  Her first words were, &quot;what in the world is that?&quot; She stated that the lights were not like anything ahe had seen.  And, she was right.  The lights were white but had a halo effect that seemed to indicate that they were pulsating. There was a slightly bluish tint to them also. The object appeared to be 500 ft above ground level not even a quarter of a mile from the the house.  For 25 minutes I watched it(my daughter did not want to watch it anymore)hover, glide horizontally, rise vertically, but never leave the area. Suddenly, it began to glide towards the house ( I say glide because it was not flying like a helicopter or a plane.)  I called my father who lives six blocks away and asked him to go outside a look in the sky and tell me if he saw anything unusual. He said he wasn&apos;t sure but there were so many stars out that night. While I was talking to him the object glided above the corner lot located two houses from our house.   It then glided over my neighbors house at tree-level, probably not three hundred feet  above ground.  I was amazed at what I saw.  It was a black triangle about 3/4 the size of a football field. It was definitely a solid object. It made absolutely no sound at all. I know this because it passed over my roof while I was outside in my front yard. Again, it was a very clear night. It then disappeared, I guess that is way I can describe it but I don&apos;t know.  Let&apos;s just say that I could not see it anymore. I called my newsroom and local stations. No reports had been received.The next day, I approaced my neighbor and before I could say anything she asked me if I had seen the object.

I wish I knew about it when this actually happened.  I am sorry to report it so late, but I hope this information helps somehow.  We didn&apos;t know where to email/call when it actually happened.  This is what our whole family witnessed:  About 2 years ago, in Manchester, Connecticut (we were coming out of John Harvard&apos;s restaurant at Bucklands Hills Mall), our whole family saw an object in the sky that looked like a bright yellow glowing round disk.  Many people around us were looking at the sky pointing at it, as well.  The object was as bright yellow as the moon (the moon was also visible).  It looked like a giant glowing doughnut in the sky.It stayed in one place completely motionless for a few minutes, then it suddenly disappeared and then we noticed it in a totally different parts of the sky (we thought it was the same object, but who knows), then it disappeared again and then we noticed it in another part of the sky, then it disappeared completely.  We (and all the people around us) were stunned.  We&apos;ve never seen anything like that before.  Would love to find out some day what in the world that was.Strangely enough, and to my great surprise, my son mentioned the following day that his classmate said that her relatives in Mexico called that same night to tell them that they saw the glowing disc-like object behaving &quot;strangely&quot; in the sky (the same night we saw it).  I just thought I was in a twilight zone.Just thought I&apos;d share this information with you, Best regards.E.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was attending the Air Traffic Controller, school at Ft Rucker and it was my birthday so I went for a requested a jump seat ride on a Huey.  As we approached Ft Rucker near dusk (approximately ten miles out), the tower asked us to turn on our landing light so they could verify our position. This was done and the tower reported seeing our landing light and proceeding to give us altimeter and wind direction. Skies clear. Suddenly, cockpit covered in clouds and through the clouds a faint red light (blinking) about the size of an orange was approaching the craft.  The light as it approached became brighter and more distinct.  It broke out of the clouds and came directly at the cockpit. The pilots dove the helicopter down and to the left.  Pilot and copilot called tower to ask if any traffic was in our area and they said no.  All of us, Pilot, Copilot and myself thought we were going to collide with something.  Pilot and Copilot both said they over the helmet mikes that they thought what the had encountered was a UFO.  AS I was further back in the Huey, it appeared to me as if the light went right through the cockpit.

We had left the turnpike to avoid the crowds and to get a glimpse of the sunset over Lake Okeechobee on our way home to SW Broward county. This is a very remote area west of Ft. Pierce lined with thousands of acres of cattle ranches and sugar cane fields. As it was late Sunday afternoon there were very little, if any, other vehicles on the road. Suddenly we came upon a flock of birds behaving very erractically. They were sort of disorientated-swarming like insects. Two birds actually crashed into a billboard and hit the ground. We found this to be very strange and disturbing. About 30 seconds later my husband remarked that he hadn&apos;t seen a car behind us for at least twenty miles.I pulled down my visor with a mirror on it and saw some headlights and said &quot;Well, there&apos;s one now.&quot; A vehicle was on the road behind us about 1 mile back. I looked up in the mirror again and saw that this &quot;vehicle&quot; was quickly approaching in a &quot;hyper-jump&quot; kind of way. I looked again and the thing was practically on our bumper. I yelped and my husband shouted &quot;This guy&apos;s not gonna pass us- he&apos;s gonna ram us!&quot; I pulled my visor down to a different angle to get a better view and that&apos;s when I saw that this &quot;vehicle&quot; had no tires/wheels!! (It was shiny like chrome with a arrangement of lights like I&apos;d never seen.) Of course we were very excited at this point and my husband swerved to the shoulder of the road thinking that this thing would hit us. We turned our heads to the left in unison and it literally disappeared in front of our very eyes. We jumped out of the car and looked up down and all around and there was nothing there.

We were approaching Ireland at 33,000 feet, -81 degrees F and going over 600MPH, when I saw what I took to be the northern lights.  I was thrilled and watched the lights for at least 45 minutes.  They looked like 2 vertical parallel streamers.  Sometimes rippling, waving, coiling, and sometimes looking like a shaken carpet rolling from one end to the other.  The 2 streamers remained distinct; they never merged.  They looked like clean straight sheets, which never quite touched.  They were NOT FUZZY or PUFFY in any way, and were almost colorless.After about 40 minutes or so I noticed the lights got almost firey and looked almost orange.  I looked through the window ahead of mine and saw that the lights ended at perfectly square black object!  This object had a light in each corner; 3 white and one blue.  So much for the northern lights!  The lights faced me-it flew in the same direction as the plane, like a square book propped up on its spine, the title page facing me (with the lights in each corner).  Our speeds were so evenly matched it took almost 10 minutes for the plane to pass the craft.After we landed, I asked a pilot if what I saw were the northern lights.  He said we 2 planes were flying parallel with our plane (who mentioned planes?).  As I turned to go he said it was actually a UFO but he hadn&apos;t wanted to alarm me.

It remained there for approximately 5 seconds, then &quot;floated&quot; slightly downward in a vertical direction, immediately slightly sideways in a western direction and then started turning westward.  As it turned, it tilted downward and the light became less evident and its shape was more visible.  It was a circular aircraft with what appeared to have as one brilliant head light with a circular light pattern of about 6 lights around it.  The lights were mostly white and red, switching to either all white or just all red.  It was silent and did not make a normal jet engine sound or any sound that would indicate to us that it was a helicopter or airplane.

I will relate the incident as told me in the first person, although I helped compose the report.  We have tried to be as accurate as possible.  I visited the location of this sighting with the witness and indeed she was very close to the object.  This sighting location is 6 to 7 miles SW from the runway at Robins Air Force Base.  A bit south of Hwy. 96 and west of Moody Road, the exact location not being specified for this report.  The year was 1997, and I&rsquo;m not absolutely sure, but I think it was in the fall.  It was early evening and my boyfriend and I were sitting on the trunk of his car in the driveway to his house, by the side of the road.  It is a two-lane paved road through a residential area, and on the side opposite us there was a thin stand of trees, maybe 30 ft tall and behind them was an open field. How the object arrived is still a bit fuzzy to me and I can&rsquo;t be sure if it just appeared or came up quickly while we were looking the other way.  I just remember it was &ldquo;there&rdquo; hovering just above the tree tops on the other side of the road.  It was triangular in shape, but the sides were curved outward instead of being straight.  It was a deep black in color, and although it was dark, there was a full or nearly full moon, and we could easily see it.  About half of it was over the trees and the rest was in our view while it was hovering.  It actually protruded out over the road.  It was maybe 30 feet across at the widest point.  Surprisingly I was not scared at all, but rather very fascinated.  I surely didn&rsquo;t know what to think as nothing of this sort had ever happened to me before.  I even waved my arms and tried to talk to &ldquo;it&rdquo;, but there was no indication from the object that it ever noticed us.  The top was dome shaped, there were no lights, it made absolutely no sound of any kind, no humming, no whirring, nothing!  We were within 50-75 feet of the object the entire time. After hovering for several minutes, it moved slowly across the road and over us and then accelerated at an unbelievable rate to the WNW and was out of sight in less that two seconds, maybe even one.

Now there was enough open space ( without clouds) for me to notice them. and them. But by the way they moved and actually they were moving a a slow rate, they seemed to not want to be seen. The thihng that gave them away was how they traveled in groups. If they had traveled together I would have though a plane but the small groups which were a few seconds between each UFO group, it became easier for me to notice them.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

After about 15 minutes, it raised back up into the sky.", "Daylight sighting of a star-shaped objectI was outside looking up to change a birdfeeder hanging near my windowsill. Out of the corner of my eye I saw what I thought was a hawk floating over my house. After a second or two I realized it had too many wings to be a hawk. It was more of a star shape with about six points, dark against the bright blue December sky. My next guesses of a very large leaf or (hah!) a flying squirrel were ruled out by the altitude of the object. I guessed it was flying at over 1000 feet. It cruised silently from almost directly west to east, at roughly 120 to 150 knots at my estimated altitude. As it approached the trees on the eastern horizon, I could no longer make out the points of the star. It now appeared more like a ball. Perhaps unrelated to this, a helicopter (which I took to be military from the sound) followed the same course (and apparent altitude) exactly ten minutes later. Earlier today I was taking pictures of hawks and so had my telephoto camera within 20 feet of me but had no time to take a picture of the object. The object may have been a very large balloon, though I haven&apos;t seen many star-shaped balloons of this sort. It flew in the direction of the wind. It made no sudden turns or other unusual movements, nor did it make any sound.", "Red and green flashing hoovering lights three witnessesWe saw a formation of red  and green lights over the ocean.

The craft turned again and I was looking directly at the engines no more than 1000 feet away. The engine I guess ran the length of that side of the craft and was a bright green in color and had a pattern of reverse triangle cells. The craft lowered itself down into the water and disappeared.

By the time I got near home I could see that it had split into three unicolor lights hovering over the city staggered at varying elevations.  I pulled up to the house and ran in and got my wife to show her. The neighbor was also pulling up and she saw it as well. My young daughter may have seen them as well. At this point they were all amber colored lights with a slow rotating twinkle.  The three lights were hovering and slowing moving.  They were maybe 500 to 1000 feet in elevation, staggered at elevations maybe 200 feet apart.  The two higher lights were rising in elevation.  The top light started to fade and flutter out.  Then the middle light faded out and then the bottom light started to twinkle slightly more brightly and then started to flutter out finally dissapearing.  The air was quite cold at about 18 degrees F. The sky was fairly clear with stars being visible and there was a slight haze in the air.

At around 11:45 on the evening of January 4th, 2007, I was just laying down for bed.  I happened to look out the window and spotted something that wasn&apos;t quite right.  My initial thought was that it was an airplane over McChord AFB.  We have constant overhead flights from the base.  After watching this object move slowly in a southeast direction towards or over McChord AFB I realized that it was not a normal craft.  This is what it looked like.Since it was dark and overcast I was not able to discern an actual outline.  The object was probably 7 or more miles away on the horizon but it was pretty good size.  There were dozens of white lights that were constantly flashing (twinkling) in rapid and non-uniform fashion.  It almost appeared like the lights were moving rapidly in a circular motion but I cannot say for sure.  All of the lights were white.  Every aircraft I have watched fly anywhere in the area would have no more than 7 or 8 lights (multi-colored) on it at any time and if they flashed it was in a constant rhythm.I watched this craft come to a stop and hover for about 30 seconds when every light shut off completely and it appeared to disappear.  I figured then that it was just something that could probably be easily explained and was turning to go back to bed.  After about 15 seconds of darkness the lights came back in the same position and the craft started to slowly move off in a southwesterly direction towards Ft. Lewis.

Approx. 14:00 Hrs. (2 pm), my daughter pointed out a fast moving object in the sky through our skylight window.  We see a lot of high flying (assumed commercial) aircraft over our general area.  We also have a small airport over the mountain (to the east) from our home.  Normally the high flying aircraft travel from east to west, west to east.  The same holds true for the low flying aircraft in transit to and from the small airport nearby (save the occasional low flying personal aircraft either alone or with a glider in tow).  I grew up in the neighbor hood in which I now have a home so I am familiar with the normal flightpaths of the regular air traffic. What I found particularly strange about this object was not only the direction in which it was travelling (from south to north) but the speed in which it was travelling.  You can normally watch a commercial aircraft (at high altitude) flying from east to west, wast to east, horizon to horizon for several minutes as it passes over. We viewed this object for only few seconds through the skylight and as it passed our view and as I exited the house through the back door, was only able to observe it for few more short seconds before it passed from my line of sight. In addition, the vapor trail left behind by the object dissapated very quickly whereas the normal trails left by high flying commercial craft seem to linger long after the aircraft are out of sight (really don&apos;t know if that is significant or not). As I stated previously, I don&apos;t know if this was an actual UFO sighting, but it was a very strange event. My daughter sees planes flying overhead regularly, but she was excited enough about watching this object as it sped over us that she brought it to my attention. If there is any info about any commercial flights on this paticular tragectory, I would be interested in hearing about it as it would set my mind at ease about the whole event.

I could not make out the outline, but appeared to be triangle shaped by the several interior circular static white lights.  I thought about it as I turned and headed east, &quot; What the heck was that?&quot; I asked myself.

My ex-boyfriend was the first to see &quot;something&quot; moving in the distance in the sky. So I took the binoculars and started looking for myself and sure enough there were 3 round objects in the sky.  At this point they were in a triangular formation and their multi-colored craft soon began to change formation. Repeatedly for a long period of time. Their color was multi-colored, but it alternated between the colors.  I would say the most prominent colors were gold/yellow, purple/blue and red.  They almost seemed to pulse when they changed colors.  Their formation seemed as though it was a code or an S.O.S or something. They executed it so perfectly; making moves in all directions. I think I was out there an hour or better before they just completely disappeared as though they were never there. However, within 30 minutes of the crafts disappearing we witnessed many aircrafts ( the human kind) searching the area. You could with out a doubt tell they searching for something. The sky had been clear of crafts all night and then the UFO&apos;s came out of nowhere to do this beautiful light and pattern display. Also, at some points it looked as though the ships became one and split into three again before assuming the next pattern and rotation. I have NO photos of the incedents, however I do have drawings of the formations and colors on the crafts. The thing about three of the drawings is that I drew them maybe 8 years before I had these sightings and they are dead on as to what I saw. They are the exact color shape and texture. I will not send any drawings via email, but mail or fax is acceptable if you would like to view them.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a reddish pinkish color with a reddish haze around the outside.  The light from the object was so bright that the pavement on the road had the red light cast on it.  It fell slowly towards the West and once it was close to the ground suddenly disappeared.  I am extremely skeptical as to what this was.  I know it was not a flair, this was far too big, high and bright but similar in color. I called the local news right when I had seen this and reported it. Then on Thursday a friend who was traveling north about 2 miles from where I was on the 17th, at 11:30, had reported seeing the same mysterious light.  Our stories were identical when we compared notes.  I know more people had seen the object, there were cars traveling on 272 at the time and there&apos;s no way you could miss this thing.

I didn&apos;t want folks to think I was a nut or something.  But, I&apos;ve never forgotten what happened the July 4th weekend in 1983.  I was in junior high.  We were having our annual family reunion that weekend. It was the girls turn to camp out in the backyard.  I&apos;d never slept on the ground before.  So, I couldn&apos;t sleep, but my cousins sure could.  Anyway, after awhile lying awake in the tent, I heard a low droning sound.  Sort of like a low droning hum.  Had I been asleep I probably would not have heard it.  I got up and went outside of the tent and looking up through the young pine tree (I wasn&apos;t coming out from under it) and above dad&apos;s storage barn, I saw an object just above the larger trees.  It was disk shaped and had colored lights on the bottom.  It wasn&apos;t moving very fast.  Going back into the tent I tried to wake my cousins, without sucess.  I went back outside the tent and watched the object move slow and steady in a ENE direction.  I went back into the tent obviously scared and was finally able to waken my cousins. They had no idea what I was trying to tell them.  I know I must have scared them too because I remember us all running toward my grandmother&apos;s mobile home (she lived behind our house then).  But, my mother met us at the back door of our house.  The electricity went out and we ran as fast as we could to get inside. The lights were out only a few minutes.  Needless to say we all slept on the floor inside after that.  It has bothered me that I was the only one to see it.  Since that night when I&apos;ve asked my mother what woke her up, she always say the she just got up and the lights went out and she knew she needed to open the door for us.  I&apos;ve never reported this to any organization or any person outside my family.

We lived 2 houses West of Our Lady Of Mercy church. It was after dark and the family was watching TV in the dining room. I looked east out the side porch window and saw the craft. It was oval from what I could tell, with yellow light comming from what looked to be windows around the center of the craft. The craft was at 50&apos;to 70&apos; altitude judging from the tree height over which it was moving.The craft was at a distance of 150&apos; to 200&apos; from our house. I yelled for my family and they moved to the windows and saw the craft too. We then ran upstairs to get a better view of the craft. It moved slowly taking perhaps 20-30 seconds to move out of sight over the woods that bordered church property. While we were watching the craft a figure was seen inside who looked to be working controls of some sort. The figure was backlighted by the glow and I only was able to make out a dark human type shape. The following morning my brother and I went back in the woods where the craft had dissappered. About 200&apos; inside the woods there was an area of crushed brush and even a couple broken saplings the largest being about 2&amp;1/2 inches in diameter. This area was about 50&apos; around, circular. And about 20&apos;to 25&apos; apart in the center there were 4 holes. These holes were about 3&quot; wide and 6&quot; to 8&quot; deep. For several years following this sighting very little grew in the crushed area, and what plants that did grow there were sickly as was a tree that was on the edge of the area. No sound was ever heard from the craft, and though the outline was rather vague due to the darkness, There was no sign or visible means of propultion, and a absence of any engine sound.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Back in 1976 I had just been out of High School for a couple of years, and was still living at home.  Our home was located several miles outside of Scottsville, Kentucky in a location named Petroleum near the Tennessee border.  We lived on a hilltop,  and could always clearly see anything up in the sky.  I remember the following unusual incident clearly.  One particular night we were all in our living room watching television, and it was around 11:00 PM.  My Dad decided to go out into the back yard to check on our well pump that we were having problems with.  The night was dark and clear, and no stars were visable at all.  Dad went out the back door and all was quiet for a while.  All of a sudden Dad came practically running back into the living room and told us to come outside and see &quot;this&quot;.  He said, &quot;Get out here because you have got to see this&quot;.  My Dad was a U.S. Army veteran, and I thought nothing could scare him - but &quot;this&quot; did.  We could see the scared look on his face, and we wondered what &quot;this&quot; was.  We all hurriedly went out the back door to the yard.  Dad then told us to look up in the sky, and what we saw was truly amazing to say the least.  Directly up in the northern sky was a very large glowing white cross.  Trust me, there was absolutely no mistake about it - it WAS a CROSS, and it was glowing really bright with sort of a halo around it.  The cross was clearly visable.  The whole thing was solid white.  The object remained stationary and never moved at all.  As I recall our neighbors heard us and came outside to see it for themselves.  We were all just staring at this large white cross that we all could clearly see.  We stayed outside for thirty minutes or longer just staring at this beautiful white cross.  Later on we heard on our local regional news about many other people who had also seen this enigmatic cross object.  It was reported as an &quot;unidentified sky object&quot;.  Why didn&apos;t they say it was a c! ross?  W ere they afraid of something?  I always wondered.  My family and I are honest people and don&apos;t make up tales.  This story is one-hundred percent true as I have told it.  I know that we all saw something amazing that we were intended to see in my opinion.  Somehow I felt blessed to have seen this.  People may think that I am crazy or made this story up, but I did neither one.  What we saw that night back in 1976 was something somehow beyond our comprehension to understand.  As I have gotten older I now realize that their are things that are really seen or observed everywhere that people cannot understand - such as UFOs.  This is one such case, and if it was a UFO then it was quite real.  I just felt that now was the right time to share my unusual story with others.

At that time of day, in this small town, I heard no sound associated with these lights, which stretched for over one hundred feet.  I generally ruled out meteors, because they appeared to be too close to earth, and also appeared to be in formation. Obviously, aircraft are on this path toward O&apos;Hare hundreds of times per day, but these lights were WAY to close to the ground to be on approach, and there were no flashing lights.  In fact, I saw no &quot;craft&quot;, but just the tails, which were very bright and consistant lights.  The tails did not spread out, or get weaker as they moved across the the sky, like I would expect a meteor to do, but rather they extended for a distance, then just quit shining. Again, I have been on over 1,000 flights, and enjoy aviation and astronomy, and I&apos;ve never seen anything that created a tail of light like this.

After a couple minutes I asked him again. &quot;What the hell is that?&quot; He said,  &quot;Charlie, I really don&apos;t know&quot; in an awe stricken fashion.So, we just stood there for a few minutes more then the object seemed to turn due south very gradually but it didn&apos;t bend, flex or change its looks when it did.  It was smaller looking after the turn south and seemed to slowly continue until it got too small to see any more.  It left no trail, residue and had no evidence of being a &quot;made&quot; or &quot;built&quot; thing.  No lights or anything that people typically report with ufos.This all took place maybe 1 mile south of the Louisville, KY, international airport.  About 1/2 mile west of I-65 and about 1/2 mile south of I-265.  So close to the air port and never heard anything about it on the news or from others.

She told us to look and proceeded to pull over.  My mother, siblings and I got out of the car and watched this strange phenomenon.  It appeared that these 17 lights were playing, flying toward each other and away at unbelievable speeds. Other people coming out of the shopping center looked up to see what we were looking at. Everyone freaked out. Since I was an 11 year old, I remember telling my mother that I thought they were angels playing tag.  It was unbelievable. The lights appeared the same as stars but were much large.  I would say they measured about 90-100 feet across flying at 7000 feet. My mother was so excited that she telephoned my father and told him to come to where we were to see it but they soon flew abruptly upward after pulling into a tight circular formation.", "We saw 3 diamond shaped crafts, one was hovering then took off, 2 others were behind going slower.So a friend and I were going out to my house to pick up a movie I left there because I was staying at his place that night.

I know Fort Campbell is close but like I said theres never really and light or planes or anything and these weren&apos;t going towards Fort Campbell. So we were driving to his house and saw a bunch of lights that looked like they were under a big awkward looking diamond. At first I thought it was a B-2 but the shape just wasen&apos;t right, it was a lot bigger, and it was wider. It was just hovering there in the sky and then all the lights but 3 turned off and it started picking up speed really fast. We kept driving and saw 2 more about half a mile away from the first. One of them was flying alittle behind the other and they had their lights off. The one in front took off pretty fast but the one behind just kept going slowly until we couldnt see it anymore once it went past some trees. Can&apos;t really estimate size or height.

From the North-West, I noticed a bright white light in the distance. I thought it odd, because the light was much brighter than one would expect for an airplane. I kept watching the light aproaching while slowly moving through traffic. It seemed to be moving slowly and on a level path to go directly over the Interstate. As it aproached I noticed it was more than one light. It apeared to be 5-6 lights in a row and the were pulsing in a left to right pattern. At this time I looked around to see if anyone else was observing and several drivers around me were also looking in that direction and pointing, to show their passengers the lights. By now it was getting fairly close to where I was located and I could make out more definition of the lights. The lights apeared to be circulating around whatever object was. I could not definately make out a shape, due to the highway lights and the orientation of the object to my vehicle. The lights were not only white, but seemed to posess an irridecent color shifting quality, with different hues of red, blue and possibly yellow. As the craft passed over, and behind my car, I rolled down the window to see if I could identify what it was. Unfortunately, the angle of the crafts travel took it at an akward angle that I could not see, due to the fact that I was still trying to drive and watch traffic. I did not notice any sound, though there may have been. With many cars around me traffic possibly would have drown out any noise the craft was making. I am not sure what I saw, but it was unlike anything I had seen in the past. I am interested in finding out if anyone esle present on the interstate that evening will report it here.", "UFO sighting in Lockwood, CaliforniaAt the time of the sighting my husband, two daughters and myself were living outside of Lockwood, California, off Interlake Road, by Bryson Hesperia Road.  My husband had mentioned that, the night before, when he went outside to smoke a cigarette, he noticed an odd lighted craft hovering over what we knew to be Ft. Hunter Liggett Army base.  I had previously been a civilian worker on that base for three years, so I knew exactly where it was.  Anyway, he decided that we should go out the next evening and see if we could see something. He went out first onto our property (two acres) with a pair of binoculars and scanned the sky to the north.  After about twenty minutes he called me outside and handed me the binoculars and showed me a bright light hovering above the horizon maybe 10/15 miles away.  Through the binoculars I could see that it was a silver-looking craft, what they call cigar-shaped (more like two saucers inverted onto one another), and had a row of lights around its center: red, green, yellow are the ones I distinctly remember.  The lights blinked on and off as the craft hovered.  Then it shot off to the west, looked as if it crossed 50 miles in less than a second, and stopped cold and hovered there for a while, then shot back with the same speed to its original position on the northern horizon. It then proceeded to do strange things....turn on its side and hover, then back to upright.  Spin around and return to upright. It then descended slowly back down below the horizon.  I got the distinct impression that it was landing back down on the base from where it came from.  I know from working on Hunter Liggett that it was an experimental testing base, it is exceptionally remote and in the coastal mountains, where there are few roads and fewer inhabitants, and so it seemed entirely likely to me that the origin of the craft very well might have been from this planet.  It did not come up again, and we never saw anything like that again. I moved from that location in 2001.  But I do remember driving down the main highway that bisects the base on certain nights, and there appeared to be a sort of amphitheater in the hills hidden from view, but readily apparent at night because they had lots of lights, and sometimes when I drove by with the window down and those lights lit up, I could hear cheering of what sounded like hundreds of soldiers, but technically there wasn&apos;t supposed to be anything there.  I always wondered if the army was showing off its latest technical advance, something really awe-inspiring, which made the soldiers cheer like they do. BTW, there was no confusion between the lights of this supposed amphitheater (if that&apos;s what it was), and what I saw in the sky that summer night around 1998. I always thought the base was hiding things.  It&apos;s an excellent base for doing so; it&apos;s in the middle of nowhere almost like area 51 is.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I thought maybe the wind, which was kicking-up, had carried something skyward, so I watched until it went out of vision&apos;s range, but it wasn&apos;t an object kicked about by the wind...too regular...watched about a minute until it went out of view.  No solid object could I see, though upclose it might be solid, but just three dots.   Can&apos;t say it glowed...may have reflected...maybe holographic...maybe we have something new up in the sky these days.   Maybe it was how the sun hit, but it seems like the sun would have changed as it glistened across a metallic cover...not a light, but more of a reflection. Whitish-silver.

I used a vhs camera rather than a digital becaues I did not want pixelation to interfere with what I was filming.  Some time later I went and bought a dvd vcr player to transfer the film to dvd so I could view it on High Definition big screen TV. From above the bart station in Pittsburg, the view was over the area where the pittsburg power plant was located.  Behind this some distance away sits the Suisin marsh to the left and to the right the Travis Airforce base.  As before the area observed seemed to be floating above the earth, you could see the thermal windmills beneath it.  It seems to be organic in nature and takes up an immense amount of space.  As sunrise advances you can see the sun rising between the earth and this thing, the sun shining behind the thermal windmills.  This particular morning there appeared to be some sort of accident that kept the thing from cloaking.  Before as the sun came up and started over the horizon, you could only see it while it was just rising, after it got up a bit in the sky, it seemed to cloak itself, I caught this on film in July, as soon as the sun hit a specific point, it dissappeared completely, and looked to be a patch of burn off or smog that never leaves no matter what time of day it is.  just an orangeish smear across the sky until the next sunrise.  At first I thought it might be a hallucination caused by plasma or water in the sky reflecting something that was on the earth somewhere, however I have studied the area, even using satellite images of the entire area and can find nothing that looks similar on the ground in a 50 mile radius.  Anyway on this day, what people tried to convince me was a cloud, had an accident that made impact on this &quot;cloud&quot;.  You could still see the thermal windmills underneath this object, but on top of it was definitely a crash site.  There were two spiraling stacks of smoke coming up from the place where it impacted?  Five of the b! igger cr aft we had seen before were &quot;circled&quot; around the crash site.  It was windy that morning, however nothing in that direction was moving with the wind.  The smoke spirals stayed where they were for quite some time.  The other craft which looked like a measure of &quot;jet stream&quot; except they were luminous, and brightly lit, instead of staying flat horizontal to the earth, were all in the sky above the crash site, bovering in one place sitting dexter and sinister to the earth, tilted diagonally.Smaller craft were seen on the film we took of it after slowing it down  to the slowest point we could without going frame by frame, film taken of these before revealed what we could not see because they moved that fast.  Where I could see sparks showing up in the high sky with the naked eye, slowed down you could see they were some type of flying craft, that would enter and leave the larger craft.  I tried to find any news release about activity that morning for several weeks, and finally found a report where they had reported that a flying craft had crashed into the Suisin marsh.  the area of land where we keep seeing these things, are across the Sacramento River, and there is an area there of swamp and island marsh type land where at one time supposedly toxic waste had been dumped.  Whether or not this is true I dont know, it doesnt look healthy.  However that land is still viewed below where the thermal windmills are located.  And since the sun comes up and can be seen between the thermal windmills and whatever it is that floats out there and cloaks itself at sunrise, I am inclined to believe this is something else entirely, and not only that it appears to be organic in nature.  The film caught in July shows structures built on it, towers with strange large ball shaped things stuck to them, and several craft on platforms that tilt diagonally just before they project themselves into the air at such a velocity, all you can see is an instant of a streak accompanied by what may appear to be a spark when the sunlight shines off their hull.  Recently I finally found someone with a large screen HD TV, (A retired school teacher) and I was able to take the film I had saved to DVD with me to view with them.This definitely is not a cloud. And there definitely are structures there, and I dont know about the craft, but they look like flattened pac-men, and appear to be a bit beat up, however that may be a part of their camoflauge.  To glance at them if you dont really LOOK at them I suppose some might try to say they were cloud formations, however each one are identical to the other, and it shows several of them &quot;grounded&quot; and several more that take off or dissappear.  With the wind blowing at the rate it was, which you can see by the swaying trees also in the picture, this &quot;cloud&quot; did not move in July, nor has it moved since.  Its like a cloaked organic structure that is always there, with craft that come and go.  It is not Travis Airforce base, nor is it swampgas.  Its not morning afterburn or fog, and its not in a place where there would be a large amount of fog.  I am surprised after my posts that I have not heard any feedback.  My friend who lives at the house where we shot the film also has a lot of footage of this phenomenon, including the craft that crashed and the five surrounding craft that hovered overhead at diagonal stances.", "Large group high flying lights - Much higher and faster than commercial jet which passed below the object(s).

I had an experience as a young teenager that was quite amazing. My brother and I was at my grandparents small farm playing in the driveway when we seen a large light to the east in the sky approx the distance that you would spot a small aircraft. It was a large and distinct light that stopped us in our tracks to stare. As we stared at the light it slowly made its way to the north not changing distance or altitude. We watched as it made its way from due east to due north. As we continued to stare it started to appear as though it was coming towards us. The light continued to come closer and yet did not change mass but became remarkably close. When the light stopped approaching it was approx 50 yards from where we were standing. It was directly behind a mature pecan tree and the light was as large as the entire tree. It stayed in that position for at least five minutes and then slowly started to back away. As it was backing away it was gaining altitude. When it got back to the distance it was before approaching us it started to go upwards and we watched it disappear into the distance in aprrox 30 seconds. The light did not make any noise nor did it create any shadows or brighten the area around it or where we were. I would guess the experience lasted at least 20 to 30 minutes. We of course told our grandparents and odd enough it took little to convince them of what we had seen. My grandfather told us that his neighbor that lived about 1/4 of a mile to the south had described the exact experience that happened to him only at an earlier date. I have not heard of anyone else having a similar experience in that area or any area for that matter ever since.

The stars were very visible, so we were looking at them when we noticed a brighter one, very visible, that seemed to be moving in a linear fashion.  It could have been something very normal, but as we watched, a smaller light seemed to emerge from the brighter light, flying straight down from it, then turning at a right angle to continue flying. We thought this was pretty strange, but what happened next still frightens me! My friend yelled at me to turn and look behind us.  We couldn&rsquo;t believe it, but there was some sort of flat-bottomed craft hovering maybe 30 feet or so above a telephone pole that was about 50 feet away from us!  I remember that it was hovering at just about double the height of the pole.  It was so close that we felt that it must be observing us, since we were the only people out in the deserted field at this hour.  We ducked into the low underbrush beside the street for cover and continued to watch.It surprised me that it was not brightly lit, although it seemed that some sort of soft light might have been coming from the top of the craft, because I could make out the outline of the craft in the dark sky.  It seemed to be a little more that 25 to 30 feet in diameter, which was easy to estimate, given its proximity to both of us and also to the telephone pole.  It had a somewhat oval shape, not quite round.  The lights from our subdivision illuminated the bottom of the craft well enough for me to just make out some sort of protruding cube-like structures on the bottom of the craft, and possibly something that looked like ductwork.Later, I realized that the texture of the bottom resembled the flat top of an apartment building, turned upside down. It hovered for quite some time, and it did have a sort of windy, whistling hum to it, but no engine sounds.We really felt threatened, or at least observed, and continued to hide and decide what we should do, feeling quite panicky. We were frantically taking notes together, blurting out the things that we noticed, confirming that it was really happening.  Finally, the craft started slowly moving at the same low altitude to the east, toward the subdivision where we both lived.  We then felt brave enough to stand up, out of the brush, and follow it on foot, since it seemed to be departing.  We followed for a few seconds, then suddenly it zoomed off at incredible speed, disappearing to the east.  All of this with no increased noise.My friend told me to look to our right just as it left, and we both saw a glowing greenish ball of light, electrical looking, float gently to the ground and disappear just a few feet away from us.I understand why people would be skeptical about many of the sightings reported, but obviously, they have never seen this type of craft at such close range.  It did not behave in any fashion according to the technology that we had in 1981, or even still.  And the other craft, further out in the night sky, were also unexplainable. And then there&rsquo;s that glowing ball of light.We were both very intelligent honor roll students in the 10th grade at the time, and very credible people who just happened to be in the right (or wrong) place at the right time.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A friend of my father is owner of a big, big farm far of the city, placed in a region called &quot;vergel de la sierra&quot;, this farm still virgin, only a little house in the middle. This house used to be keeped by an old guy called ((name deleted)) he was very humble. The curious thing its that since my father was a child he used to go there with &quot;Tito&quot; the actual owner of the farm. Several sightings of strange things have happened in the farm. When my father was a child, in the middlenight, a big &quot;cigarrete&quot; shape flying ship, with a powerful light stayed for at least 5 minutes over the little house. Tito and he where very scared, since my father was turning on the water boiler outside of the little house. It appeared from nothing and maked a big continuous noise. &quot;I maked a big jump to the closer window&quot; tells my father.  Another sighting aprox in 1995 was made by Chon (Chon already died, his son seen it and lives, he told us this was one of several other same sightings). Since we saw Chon, with half of body burned, when we were camping in farm, we asked wath happened. Chon said us it was common to see this &quot;bright light&quot; over a little lagoon but because of fear, he never get closer to it. But, one day he got closer by curiosity and the thing emitted a big flash of heat and light and went off. &quot;This thing came to steal water&quot; he said. I believed Chon, since he was a person who even dont know how to write or read, far of comunication and contaminating ideas. I was esceptic to see weird things, until 1998 when my father, a cousin, a friend and me, where on camping on the farm. We where sitting over a very hig cliff, watching the eagles flying over us. We where keeping a camera with us, waiting for an eagle to get closer. Suddenly a black object apperaed with the eagles and in half a second descended tremendously fast &quot;vertically&quot; at our left (i remember it was like 30 meters far of us), its size was like four cars. Nor a small noise was made by the ship. It flyed very close to us, and passed from left to right like for about 6 seconds, until it was lost of sight because some threes. We tryed to follow it, but the fear was too big, so we decide to go as fast as we could to the camping and jeep. We couldnt photo the thing, but 4 people watched it.

Four fire or light hemispheres attached to every end and one at the center.Ive sended a raw image in other mail.

(Mobile, AL)I was driving south down Rangeline Rd. about 20 minutes before sunrise, while the sky was still dark. As I was approaching the intersection at Hamilton Blvd., I had the window rolled down, enjoying the wind and casually gazing out at the landscape (due south, in the direction of Dauphin Island Parkway) as I was still about three blocks before the traffic light. It was as if they were purposely camouflaged as street lights, because I didn&apos;t even notice them at first. But then the last one at the end of the line, down closest to the intersection, appeared to be glowing about three times brighter than the others. As I focused directly on them at that point, I realized there weren&apos;t even any light poles along the road (it&apos;s a rural area), and these lights were actually a quarter to a half mile away. There was traffic both in front of and behind me, so I had to watch the road as I approached the intersection, and unfortunately, the traffic signal was green when I came to it, so I couldn&apos;t stop and stare. But I took one last lengthy gaze at that brightest one as I was rounding the street corner. There was a small clearing through the trees, and I got an excellent, last-second look at it as it had grown so intensely bright that it actually looked like a little sun in the distance. It had short rays of light shining from it it was so bright, with two prominent rays at each side, in the three o&apos;clock and nine o&apos;clock positions (edges of a disc?) Just as the trees were about to block my view, with amazingly synchronized timing, it suddenly faded to black, like a bright yard light going out. Unlike most people who get excited when they only THINK they&apos;ve seen a UFO, my initial reaction to this was denial, and I&apos;m an open-minded person. Yet, it bothered me all day long at work that day, and then when I got off work at 2:30 PM, I looked out there in broad daylight, searching the skyline for any evidence of any kind of structure these lights would have been attached to, and there was nothing but trees. So I decided that, if they were anything that was supposed to be there, then they would be there again on the following morning. They were never there again. Except for that intensely glowing one at the end of the string, they all appeared about the size and color (yellowish) of streetlights, and they were the appropriate height and spaced apart like streetlights would be, so that nobody would have ever noticed unless they were paying as much attention as I was. Another weird anomaly: when I got home that evening, I decided to do a web search and see if there were any UFO reports of craft similar to what I saw. Not even really expecting to find anything, I learned for the first time about Bob Lazar and his alleged back-engineering work at the secret base called S4, near Area 51. The site I found that evening is boblazar.com, and in the tape-transcripts section, I saw where Lazar says they &quot;glow&quot; at night, with the &quot;sodium yellow color&quot; of &quot;streetlights.&quot; He explains that they can actually warp space and disappear, so as you can imagine, I was even more stunned as I read this than I was when I first saw it in the sky for real that morning.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This night I walked into my dark house never turned on any lights and went and stood in the livingroom, I just stood there doing and thinking nothing and suddenly had an urge to go out the front door which we never used. We always used the back door to go in and out of the house. When I opened my door there was a huge ball of white light in the sky across from my home, this thing was massive and as I watched it I went out onto the porch.It glided or floated, it moved slowly and it passed behind a large maple tree, I remember wondering why it didn&apos;t come out the other side right away, it should&apos;ve because of the size, so I went down the street to look around the tree but it was gone. I turned around and started to walk back to my house, I have no memory of getting to my house and it wasn&apos;t till a year later that I remembered this night.I got up the next day after this event and acted like nothing happened. Very weird. My husband also had a sighting involving a large craft with 5 blue lights,I think it was stop sign shape or something like that. He works nights at a factory outside the city and he said that some guys were at a door and called him over they told him there was a ufo but by the time he got there it had passed over so he ran to the back of the plant by himself and saw the craft pass over and a short time later he saw a military jet coming flying through the sky, stop on a dime and turn in the direction of the craft. This was only an hour away from the Toronto airport but fairly high up in the sky he said.This also happened shortly after my first sighting in the early 90&apos;s.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a glowing oval/circular? The glow was a greenish brite white. It was in the sky north of us. It was a little far away to tell what the EXACT shape was, but close enough to know that it did not make any sound.  It was odd, was moving way too fast to be a jet, or fighter aircraft of any sort.  I have never witnessed that type of light on ANY aircraft I have seen. I noticed it and pointed it out to the small crowd.  We talked about it as we saw it.  It was flying at a distance that put it over trees that lined the creek that runs behind the apartment complex.  It tracked from the point I noticed it WEST, to the East where id did not travel to the horizon, it stopped at one point, dead stop, staitionary, it did some erratic movements- sideways, up, down, diagonal.  These movements were darts, not slow movements.  It headed north and started to go behind the trees.  I ran around the side of the building to not loose it, but it had dissappeared. I wish I knew of this site earlier, I have told a few people about it.  It was an awesome experience, I have read on here people seeing multiple UFO&apos;s, I hope I get the chance to see more!!((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

One craft was seen spining disk shape about six to eight thousand miles up and about five mile from our home. Viewed the object from the open bathroom window, blinking red and blue lights some green light, more blinking red with a brighter white light. The object hovered in one place for about 15 minutes and then moved very slowly downward about 1,000 feet and then slowly moved westward about 5 miles. After about another 15 minutes the object lights went on and off. Then the craft turned into a round Mars shape teal light blue object round with a oval shape, resembling a metalic texture. The craft moved at a faster speed moving to the west and then blinked out. As the fog got thicker the craft went farther or the lights just went out completley. Witnesses were ((father))  years old, ((mother)) years, ((son)) years. You could not see any stars or moon because of the very thick fog, just the object, which seemed to be very large in size and the object seem to stay staionary for most of the time.

I was admiring the huge trees along our block, and upon looking up noticed something between branches, it just caught my eye as I looked up.  As I walked further to a point between the trees, a clear unobstructed view, I say what I term as a large phone booth object at about 70 degrees from southern horizon.  I stopped rubbed my eyes, shook my head. and it was still there.  It was a silver to whitish color except for the top 1/8 which was a brilliant yellowish light. I stood for a couple minutes trying to get a good look at it. I estimate the altitude to be about 1500-2000 ft.  It had no wings, no rotors, and stood perfectly still, there was no wind it was dead calm.  I tried to listen and could hear nothing.  After about 3 minutes it finally hit me, this was definitely not normal and defied any aerodynamic craft I have ever scene.  I started to get scared, and proceeded towards the store, hoping it had not seen me, keeping my eyes on it, when the next moment it started to accelerate and then took off East at a speed that was unbelievable, before I knew it it was out of sight.  I would estimate its size being aprox 20-30 ft tall by 15 to 20 ft across.", "Cigar shaped craft - 30 years ago - technology still cannot be explainedI was 16 years old and sleeping over at a friend&apos;s house.  I was lying in bed looking out the window just trying to get to sleep when I spotted a cigar shaped object with lights hovering maybe 1/2 mile away (Southeast Lawrenceburg, TN).  I watched the object for about 5 seconds before it registered what I may be looking at.  I woke my friend yelling, &quot;get up if you want to see a ufo&quot;.  He got up, came to the window, and we watched for another few seconds before running out of the room and yelling for his sister to wake up and come outside.  When the three of us got outside, the object was still hovering, motionless, in the distance.  It was close enough that all the lights were clearly visible and a metallic shine came from the surface of the craft.  We watched as it sat perfectly still for another 20-30 seconds.  Suddenly, the craft took off, flew over our heads and toward the opposite horizon.  About halfway before getting to the other horizon, it immediately took a sharp 90 degree turn right, flew about a mile, and took another 90 degree turn left.  It then flew at an amazing speed before disappearing over the horizon.  From the time that it took off until it was completely gone from sight over the opposite horizon was only about 6-8 seconds.  Although at one point it was directly above us and no more than 300 yards away, we never heard a sound.I am a 45 year old mechanical engineer.  With years of study in physics, engineering, and study of the most up-to-date technology, I have never encountered anything that would explain the capabilities that this craft had.If I live to be 100, I&apos;ll remeber it like it happened just last night.((NUFORC Note;  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

She came home later and was shaking in a state of shock.This happened last friday dec. 15th, but also saturday, my sister was coming back not that late, but earlier, from the same town and saw the objects again but were at a greater distance this time, she still took more pics that will transfer to me later.She estimated the altitude of the objects in 50 meters and the size in 100 meters diameter.

(I was on the upper floor and didn&apos;t look up but sideways through the angled skylight.) At first I thought it was an odd reflection of a car on the street below, and for about 10-15 seconds I tried to get my bearings, figure out how in the world it was reflecting into this upward facing window. I then realized it was a flying craft. I ran to the next skylight which I could stand directly below (inches from the glass) and continued observing the object. As the craft approached my vicinity, I noticed there were more than just the two &quot;headlights&quot; on the front. There was a series of six lights on the bottom of the craft about midship, in a 2x3 rectangle configuration extending from fore to aft. From either side was a light on each of what may have been the tips of a very short wingspan. In total, there were 10 lights on the object, each off-white. (Groups were similarly colored, and each group varied in color temperature only slightly.) There were no blinking lights on the craft, and no red or green beacons, as per federal aviation regulations. The object appeared to be about 50-100 feet above the treeline, due East, almost perfectly so. I could hear the object clearly through the window. It made a loud, low whooshing/rumbling sound unlike any aircraft I had heard before - almost otherworldly, like something you&apos;d hear in the movies. It traveled fairly slowly, perhaps between 20-50 MPH, although this may be a poor estimate. Regardless, it was traveling FAR slower than a plane, and slower than I have seen most helicopters. It flew over me, almost perpendicular. When it had passed over me, I could see what appeared to be two thin poles jutting out of the front of the craft in the vicinity of the &quot;headlights.&quot; As it eclipsed my view, I quickly darted downstairs and out the door to continue my observation. At this point, I had been observing the craft for about a minute and the trip downstairs took approximately 5 seconds. When I got outside and looked at the sky, I could no longer see the craft. I have a clear line of sight in the direction it was heading and estimate it should have taken approximately 1-2 more minutes for it to evade my sight. I also could no longer hear the object. All said and done, I have never seen this lighting configuration before, and the sound it emitted was very odd - neither the sputter of a propeller nor the hum and hiss of a jet. I&apos;ve lived near airports - large and small - all my life, and I&apos;ve seen and heard a lot of aircraft, and this one was unlike any other. Regarding this location, it is a heavily wooded and sparsely populated area and the nearest airports are 10 miles North and 15 miles South/South West respectively. There is, to my knowledge, no place within at least 5 miles to land an aircraft, even a helicopter.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

With the green lights having been seen some weeks back from this same area and also on the same night seen as far to the west as Alaska of these same kind of reported green lights and in some cases also being chased by fighter craft - and a possible crash retival in Columbas Ga - the apperance of a large sighting of green lights in this area seems important and to see again if part of a larger pattern.

I was driving from Clitheroe to Altham to return a van i borrowed from work.I looked South towards Blackburn and noticed a low flying aircraft flying directly towards me, it looked quite bit (737 size) and had flashing lights quite similar to a standard passenger plane. As i planes quite often i just ignored it and assumed it was making a landing approach, it was only when it turned that i noticed the light pattern underneath, again it was similar to an plane but there were subtle differences, the rear 4 lights made up a large diamond shape and there was another light at the front but the gap between these was very large, again this does not sound that much different to a plane until you compared it to other planes in the sky, as they make a diamond shape of lights, one at the front, one at the rear on and one on each wing tip, but this did not explain the extra light at the front and the distance between the lights.So now i decided to keep a close eye on this mysterious plane. It circled the entire ribble valley about 5 time between 1000 and 2000 feet, far too low to be a commercial plane and why would it keep circling over populated area in an area that is not on route to any local airports.I tried as hard as i could to get into a position where i could see the actual body of the aircraft not just the lights, but this proved to be quite difficult.My suspicions were however confirmed when the strange aircraft was intercepted by a Royal air force Tornado jet. The jet assumed a position above and behind the craft and continued to follow it were ever it went, this carried on for about 3 minutes then they both went out of view.  I kept looking for about 10 minutes but so no sign of either of them.", "Young man and girlfriend witness an intensely bright object streak across the night sky, followed by a second identical object.On this particular date, Tuesday, March 08, 1994, I decided to drop by the Last Exit on Brooklyn coffee house, where I was a frequent denizen and patron. When I entered the establishment, a male patron there, whom I knew well by that time, hailed me over to his table, stating that he wanted to tell me something unusual.  He was surprisingly animated, and seemed quite excited by what it was that had just happened to him and his girlfriend. The two of them proceeded to describe how they had been walking north on the east side of University Avenue, and just south of NE 50th, when they witnessed an intensely bright fireball streaking across the night sky, at approximately 7:15 (??) p.m. (Pacific).  They witnessed the object, which was as bright as a welder&apos;s torch, streak across the clear night sky, make several abrupt, almost instantaneous, turns, and then streak to the east, or southeast, disappearing from their view behind a building. A moment later, they witnessed a second, identical, object performe a similar maneuver across the sky, and apparently follow approximately the flight path of the first object. I am certain of the date of the event, but I am uncertain as to the exact time of the sighting. The male witness to this event was interviewed by an ABC news camera team in January 2005, and he appears in the ABC special, entitled &quot;UFO&apos;s:  Seeing is Believing.&quot;  I consider the witness to be highly credible, and the incident was reported to me perhaps within minutes of its occurrence. Neither of the two witnesses was aware of the dramatic sighting that occurred that same night over Lake Michigan, and perhaps at approximately the same time as the sighting over the University District in Seattle.((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by Peter Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting Center, on behalf of the witnesses.

Then I saw a disk come through the trees.  It went up and down about 40 ft from where I was standing and it was hovering and kind of slanted.  Then the disk went back into the woods.

I happened to look up and see a bright orange light in the sky moving north parallel to the coastline and bay. At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on except the color was a bright orange and the light was moving slowly. Eureka is often covered by a cloud deck as it was that day and I estimate it to have been about 800- 1000 (Thousand) feet above the ground. There were also patchier clouds approximately 400-600 feet above the ground though far fewer. The light was below the 800-1000 foot cloud deck, but above the 400-600 foot cloud deck. As the light moved behind the lower clouds it would become obscured momentarily. I spent probably at least five minutes just watching it from the street. By now my curiosity was raised so I went to the back yard to get a better look. It continued this path for another couple minutes. It then made a logical arcing turn westward where it began to increase velocity away from my position. The intensity of the light dissipated and it eventually disappeared. The most similar thing you could compare it to is a helicopter with a spotlight, however their was no noise, and I tried very hard to hear anything. The light remained constant and could be compared to a flare, but it did not descend in elevation. It could have been a mylar balloon caught in different air currents, except it was emanating light (And was under the cloud deck) and was accelerating slowly. All that was visible was a orange light. I have not seen anything like it before or after. And its been a couple years since this sighting but I remember it well and it was witnessed by one other person that I know of, and others must have seen it as well.

It had gotten low enough for me to hear and see the wing span but I could not see the outline of the plane and it was afull moon last night. No trees no nothing was blocking my view. The sound was weird to it sounded like a one propellar plane but not nearly loud enough. It suddenly kindof hovered near me and took off, in the opposite direction it was heading.

I kept watching the lights and noticed that they were slowly moving away from each other.  One stayed in the original spot where I saw the lights and the other two were drifting oppositely away from the original location.  The two lights that were moving separated a lot. I told my wife to keep looking at the lights and she did when she could because she was driving.

Unable to look at the lights for a prolonged period of time while driving and so as not to alarm my son I initially thought the lights must be that of approaching planes landing gear.  As I continued to glance from the road to the sky to my right, I realized the lights were not moving, were very bright, and appeared to be over one another like a bright landing tower pole, only they were in mid air.The lights were very bright golden yellow in the center throughout and tipped on opposite ends in red, and were stationary non flashing lights.  The brightness of the light around the objects appeared to blur at the edges.  These lights appeared to resemble a long thin backwards K.  The lights appeared large in size, each K leg spanning approximately 30 to 50 feet and the lights appeared very low to the ground (less than &frac12; to one mile up in the sky.)  As I reached the Eastgate exit, the top light object began to lift up slightly, then appeared to tip completely sideways and disappeared in a northeast direction very quickly.  The object disappeared from view within 3 seconds.  The 2nd light object remained stationary.

By this time I had exhausted all logical possibilities, such as weather balloons, Boeing testing aircraft, or satellites, and had to admit to my son that I didn&rsquo;t know what they were.My sons view was obstructed by the parking lot trees and so I decided to venture further toward Factoria as the road parallels the freeway all the way there.  As I reached the summit of 36th Street (near the Bellevue Community college over ramp) I pulled over and dialed 911 and gave the description of my observation to the dispatcher and they referred me to the National UFO Hotline. I then dialed the hotline, (bear in mind the light object remained stationary during this entire time.)  Just as I began to relay my story to the hotline, the light object hovered straight up slowly, paused for a moment, then moved upward and left (imagine the pattern of left side of a Y in a broken movement).

It was stationery, maybe 3 miles up. It appeared to be between 5 and 10 miles distance from my location in Pittstown, NJ.  It remained there for approximately 10 minutes.  I stopped viewing for about 2 minutes.  When I returned, I thought it was gone, but it had changed position dramatically.  It was now about 200 to 300 feet above the distant tree line, and was more to the north east.  I continued to observe for perhaps 15 minutes then, the object began a slow descent, and began traveling in a northwesterly direction.  It was still about 200 feet up, was following the tree line, and the brightness of the light had dimmed. I continued to observe until it was no longer visible.  This object, in my opinion, was not an airplane or helicopter because of the size, shape and dazzling brightness, nor was it a celestial body because of it&rsquo;s changing and deliberate course.((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the source of the report intended to indicate a date in 2006.

Standing on my porch, I looked up to notice what initially appeared to be a large hang glider with soft lights on each wing.  The craft was flying gracefully from south to north direction and then tilted its body to show the under side of the craft.  I could then see the chevron shape of the craft. Soft lights were evenly spaced on the bottom of the wings.  It moved off toward the west and gained altitude.  The craft flew into a heavier cloud of fog away from me.  It flew beautifully.The night conditions were pretty bright considering the patches light fog in the area.  There was more than a half-moon out, just above the ufo.  I could see the brightest stars in the sky as well as a dimly-lit  group of stars formed in a irregular shaped diamond pattern just below the moon.During the sighting, I noticed a jet flying south to north approximately 5 miles west of ufo.  It appeared the craft was attempting to intercept the craft.  I&apos;ll bet the people on the jet witnessed the ufo as well.The craft was completely silent.  I live north of Sea-Tac Airport where the planes start their descent to land and the sounds of the planes are easily identifiable.  I could hear the sound of the jet in background yet, this craft being closer, made no sound.The distance of the jet and the ufo were definitely hard to ascertain.   Even the relative distance between them was hard to gauge. Given this, I can only give a pretty rough estimate as the size of the ufo.  Originally, I thought I was witnessing a hang glider with lights.  I soon realized this was incorrect, since it was too large.  Compared to a modern fighter aircraft, I would guess it was similar in size. It could be twice this size. It was flying at relatively low altitude.Once the craft tilted and made the turn west, I could see the thickness of it.  Looking from the rear of the craft, the height and width appeared to be the same.It wasn&apos;t flying at high speed.  I would guess between 65-250 mph.  However, there really is no way to tell with a high degree of certainty because of the distance and size are unknowns as well.  The sighting lasted around 7 seconds.The lights on the ufo were very soft, perhaps with some color.  There was some thin fog in the area so this could have been an illusion.  The jet in the background had much brighter and white lights.  There were 3 lights per &apos;wing&apos; on the ufo.This aircraft is really impressive.  I think it may be a smaller version of the common chevron sighting reports I&apos;ve studied.  It has inspired me to create a 3D animation of the event.It was quite the experience.

I&apos;m really skeptical about martians or people from other planets but this was very strange.  Then I observed what I never imagined I&apos;d ever see.  Too strange and kind of eerie.  The way it moved was unlike anything that humans have made.  A &quot;star&quot; barely visible and twinkling just like a very distant star--moved sideways, stopped for a few seconds...slowly moved in another direction...stopped.  It seemed like a little bug with no particular direction or course.  It happened several times and it seemed to have a life of its own rather than a manned craft.  Then it moved suddenly downward at an incredible speed; kind of like a slow-moving shooting star but without a trail or sudden brightness.  It slowly went up a little and stopped.  It continued on a very slow-moving course.  I&apos;m sure it continued to travel but I began walking and it was impossible to see if it was moving.

The pre-dawn night was clear and cold with no moon.  Gathering my last newspaper bundle, I noticed the roof of the house across the street, was brighter than all other roof-tops...a kind of glow..almost a fluorecsent white-ish blue aura. As I was looking at the roof of this house, (I remember thinking perhaps there was a re- placement of new shingles), when the left-hand edge of the roof began to darken.  I began to walk towards the house, and noticed that the house roof-top to the right began to brighten. I arrived in the front lawn of the first house, and could see that the &quot;glow&quot; was moving from left to right, very slowly.  There was not a strong definition line to the edge of this &quot;glow&quot; as it moved from house #1 to house #2.Now being positioned some few feet away from these houses, I could discern a subtle sort of &quot;beam&quot; of light emanating from the roof-tops, and travelling into the sky at about a 70 degree angle.  The &quot;beam&quot; reminded me of how a light beam appears when shining a flashlight into the night sky, only larger.As I observed this light moving slowly to cover most of the roof of house #2, it began to fade, (not click-off), rather quickly and was gone.  I stared intently at the star-lit sky for several minutes to see where the light was coming from.  I was not able to see any object, aircraft or otherwise.I do not recall if I perceived the light beam reaching the ground between the houses as it travelled.I reported the sighting/phenomenon to my route manager, as well as my parents and some other folks.  I remember being frustrated that no one seemed to be interested, and my story being received with funny looks and jokes.However, years since witnessing this unexplained sighting, and being college educated, I&apos;ve yet to receive any plausible, scientific explanation for what occurred.I&apos;ve travelled past these houses several times over the years, to see...to find...I don&apos;t know what.

It was an extremely long round shape, like a cigar. Wings straight out that looked too little for the long craft. Behind the first wings were some square shaped ones with the corners cut off.  There was a space between the first regular wings and these wings.  Then a regular tail, with center part straight up and the two parts on each side, not swept back or at an angle. As it got almost over me I noticed two smaller lights on both wings, they were not bright at all.  It was so round and long, that I thought if there were pilots in there, they would have to sit behind each other.  I did hear a sound, but don&apos;t know if it was a jet or props. No sonic boom.

The closest to it is the U 2 spy plane.  But, it didn&apos;t have the bright light in the nose of the plane like this one.  Why would they need such a bright nose light.

Also, I am in South Carolina, and people around here aren&apos;t exactly open-minded or welcoming about things like this.I can&apos;t remember the exact date, but I do know it was one afternoon, around 4:00 pm, in early June. The weather was not too sunny, but it was not overcast either. It was mild, pleasant weather that day.  I was home with my now husband, our infant daughter, and our then-roommate. My husband stepped outside onto our front porch to have a cigarette, and I started to follow him out. We were standing on the porch talking when I happened to look up at some birds that were flying over some trees approximately 200 feet away from us.  Right at that moment, a shiny metal object came into my view.  It wasn&apos;t close to the trees; from what I could tell it looked like it was at least as high up as a small airplane.  Like I said earlier, an airport is not far from my house, so I&apos;m very accustomed to seeing (and hearing) planes, big and small, fly over the house all the time.  But this shiny object made no sound whatsoever. My husband saw it as well, and we called our roommate out to look at it. It looked at first liek it was shiny, metallic, and saucer-shaped. It wasn&apos;t moving at all. It was just hoovering where it was.  Then after a few seconds of just hoovering there, it started rotating and spinning, in alternating speeds. It looked like it was spinning in all directions, upside down, sideways, and diagonally. It looked as if the entire shape of the object was changing with every spin. It did this for a few minutes, then it would move over to the right and hoover a few minutes, and then it would move higher up, hoover for a minute. All the while there were birds flying around in these tress by our house, and that&apos;s when I could tell that it must have been pretty high up in the air. (Because in proportion to the birds, it looked very small.) After about ten minutes, it just slowly moved away, towards the west. I have no idea what it was, but I have never in my life witnessed an airplane or balloon of any kind, behave in a manner like that. To my knowledge, no aircraft or balloon, can hoover in one spot, and completely spin! , rotate , and change shape. And if there were such an aircraft, I highly doubt that the general public would be made aware of it, nor, would it be made visible in plain daylight, in suburban areas.  All three of us saw it. There&apos;s no doubt in my mind that it was not something that the airport knew about. I don&apos;t know if we are the only ones who saw it, but I still keep my eyes peeled every single day, in case it ever comes back. If it ever does, I&apos;ll be ready with a video camera next time. I&apos;d love to know if anybody else saw this in this area.

I don&apos;t recall the year, but it had to be 1997, 1998 or 1999, as I was living in the area during that time.  In the eastern sky, directly over Manhattan, I saw a HUGE (like the size of the moon in the night sky), ghostly, smokey white fireball, that looked much like a comet (tail and all), crashing down from above.  It looked as if it was going to crash in the ocean just east of New York City.  It took a few minutes for it to make its way down from the skies above NYC and fall behind it.  I thought I was seeing things, but I noticed drivers and riders in cars around me on the parkway were pointing at it and watching it with the same amazement (and concern) I had.

We were all aware that they would have the video game system we all wanted for xmas so we had to be in line before the store opened or we would not get it.  I showed up at 2:00 am and others arrived after that.  At 6:30 I happened to be looking south toward the city of Guelph.  I saw what I thought at first was someone setting off a firework or flare.  A reddish orange ball shot up from the ground leaving a smoke trail underneath it.  When it reached it&apos;s apex in the air, it moved slowly east and then west and back to the east in a circle.  There was also a smoke trail of a circle where this manoever had occured.  Then the object just blinked out and dissapeared.  I asked if anyone else in line had seen this and they all said yes.  There was many comments on how it was really weird.  There was no clouds in the sky that it could have gone behind or anything and like I said it did not shoot off in any direction it just dissapeared.  Someone mentioned that they wondered if it was some sort of a plane that was having a problem.  Someone else mentioned that they had heard there was solar flares occuring that day.  As all this commotion was going on the object suddenly appeared again exactly at the point where it had dissapeared.  This time though it was no longer red and orange it was a silvery colour.  The object had 2 red lights and a white light visible on it. Then a bright white light shot out of it.  Not towards the ground but out horizontally.  The light was brighter than any lights I have ever seen it was like a huge floodlight of some sort.  The light shone out from a single point but created a wide triangular like arc in the sky.  I then realised that I had my cellphone on me and I could take a picture of this object.  I fumbled getting out my cellphone to take a picture.  The object had now been visible this second time for approximately 30 seconds.  I snapped a picture of it and as soon as I snapped the picture about 1 second later it dissapeared again.  It did not shoot off real fast or anything, again it just dissapeared.  It left no smoke trail or anything showing which direction it went.  But the original smoke trail it left when it raised from the ground originally stayed visible for approximately 10 minutes.

Whenever I take that route I look over at Stonehenge because it is a lovely sight. While looking at the view, a distinct downward puff of smoke developed over stonehenge, almost like it had been forced out of an exhaust pipe. Being an ex military man, I asked myself &apos;what the heck is the army firing anti-aircraft shells over a public area for?&apos;. This thought occured to me as the Salisbury plains are a major military training area. As I continued to watch a very faint outline of an egg-shaped vehicle appeared to hover above Stonehenge, emitting a faint blue-grey haze around it. I am aware that clouds or smoke change shape as the wind or air currents affect it, but this shape remained constant and firm along its outer edges. Very faint signs of round windows or &apos;port-holes&apos; appeared two thirds the way up the vehicle. To be honest, it appeared and then disappeared so quickly that only something that could cloak itself could do what it did. At no point in time did it make any attempt to move away or accelerate.

Well, I was looking out the window while driving back from a store when I saw what I first took to be a search helicopter. Upon closer examination, I saw that it had not just one light, but three large lights, arranged in a triangular pattern.  It was large, about one and a half inches in the sky, but it moved slowly, about the same speed as a plane at full altitude. I stared at it and realized that it was triangular, and it flew, point-forward, across the sky.  It had about 5 lights on it.  Three whites ones situated in a triangular pattern near the front point, and two bright, red lights on each of the other points of the triangle, in this case, which was the back of the craft. The object flew over the bonnet of my car, so I couldn&apos;t see it, and there are quite a few trees so it went out of view, but I got one last look of it flying into the horizon.

The car was facing in the direction of the Pacific Ocean (I live a mile inland) when I noticed a slow moving object with square or rectangular lights low in the sky appearing above the area between Pacific Coast Highway and San Joaquin Hills Drive over Corona del Mar (a suburb of Newport Beach, just south). I could not ascertain how far away the object was but it seemed close.  It was moving slowly and silently southward.We were so shocked that I circled around and parked the car where we could get a better look.  It continued to move slowly and then seemed to go a little higher in the sky as it approached Newport Coast.  I reported this to the Newport Beach Police.", "Sighting over Quezon City Philippines during midnight of December 31, 2006We were preparing for NOCHE BUENA in preparation for New Year 2007.  I noticed this red shaped object (size of a small planet like Mars) about south-east of the full moon.  It was clear although there was some clouds which at times cover the moon.  The sky was well lit with fireworks display since it was countdown to New Year.  Initially I thought it was Mars but noticed that the object was contant and there was no flickering.  I noticed the object moving into a slow speed going North.  It took quite some time but the speed was constant and it was straight until it disappeared into the horizon.  By that time, my wife&apos;s cousing was with me watching the whole thing.  I thought it was a plane of sort but later ((name deleted)) (wife&apos;s cousin) came inside and claimed that the red object had reappeared and heading into the same position at the same slow constant speed.  We watched it until it took the same position as last time and stayed there for quite awhile until it again sped off into the distance at the same slow constant speed.  It reappeared the second time.  This time my aunt and wife were with us.  It performed the same exercise.  The third time, by then it was already 1:00 AM, January 1, 2007, it reappeared and followed the same path and position.  But this time, it was joined by a second smaller red object which flew parrallel its original route.   The bigger object then started speeding into the distance at the same constant speed while the smaller red object reached a point parrallel to the original location of the bigger object.  By this time, the bigger object had already disappeared the smaller object started to follow it, at the same slow constant speed.  I went up to the balcony to follow its route until it finally disappeared.  Time was around 2:00AM. I noticed that at one point the entire street lamps along our house concked out for a full three seconds before it reappeared.  But no brownout occured. Perhaps the UFO was watching the fireworks display and perhaps it was thinking that it could not be seen because it was a red dot in the sky.

I was standing on the balcony just outside the room door at the railing watching the sky.  It was very quiet and the only noise to be heard was from small waves rippling against the beach below.  There was a very light breeze at the time.  There was broken, widely scattered, low level cloud cover-- very thin, wispy clouds, and stars were visible for the most part through them.  (It was difficult to estimate the actual altitude of the clouds, as they reflected the glare of the city on the underneath side and it made them seem as if they wer 500 to 1,000 feet up; however, similar clouds observed during daylight appeared to be 3,000 to 5,000 feet in altitude.) There was no moon, and the sky, particularly directly overhead, was otherwise crystal clear.  Horizontally, visibility out to the gulf was unlimited. This was the second successive evening that I had stood on the balcony watching the sky for any action (I know this area experiences  a high number of UFO reports.) I suddenly noted movement to my left.  I observed a triangular black craft at approximately at the 11:00 o&apos;clock position to my left.  The craft had a single white light at each corner and a slightly larger, brighter light in the center.  The craft&apos;s corner lights were relatively brighter than the other stars.  The craft was approximately 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon and was proceeding in a straight line due west.  I observed it as it crossed my field of view until it was obscured by clouds at approximately the 2:00 o&apos;clock position to my right. The craft traversed this space in approximately one second and was completely silent.  There were no other lights, e.g., red/ green wingtip running lights, otherwise visible.  The craft was flying above the clouds, but appeared to be at a relatively low level of altitude.  Again, it was very difficult to estimate accurately, but if I had to guess, I would say absolutely no higher than 5,000 feet. I immediately raised my arm to estimate the approximate size of the craft by spacing my fore finger and thumb.  I did this repeatedly and concluded an approximate width of one and 1/4 to one and 1/2 inches.  I continued to watch but did not again see the craft, and within 30 minutes the cloud cover continued to build to the point that further observation was pointless. During a three day stay in Navarre, I also observed a variety of Navy military aircraft in the vicinity, including &quot;Huey&quot; med-evac choppers, Marine Sea Stallion choppers, and an executive jet skimming the coast line.  All aircraft flew at relatively low levels, 1,000 to 3,500 feet.  Navarre lies between Pensacola Naval Air Station and Eglin/ Hurlburt Air Force Base, and a wide variety of military aircraft fly in the area daily, both day and night, including the USAF F-117 Stealth Fighter.  The area is also known for conducting a wide variety of research and development activities, tests, evaluations, etc.  I don&apos;t think the craft I observed could have been an F-117, as its shape varied (more triangular) and there were no running lights.  While the Stealth i sconfigured to fly with minumum engine noise, there was absolutely no sound from this craft, and at that altitude in such a quiet setting, I believe I would have heard a jet engine. By way of background, I am 62, a retired Air Force officer (Lt. Col., 25 years service) and have observed a wide variety of aircraft, US and allied, military and civilian, under varying conditions.)", "A cone shaped light hovered for about three minutes then disappeared.A cone of light flew in an eractic pattern stopped and hovered for about three minutes.The light faded and a cigar shapped object was visable for about five seconds.It had one red and one blue light neither of which blinked.It made no sound.The light returned briefly and the object disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.

I know it is fact and I always keep this with me as my life experience:  When I was between the ages of 10 and 13 (1993 - 1996) I attended YMCA Summer camp in Silver falls State Park in Silverton, Oregon. I remember one amazing experience I had involving triangular craft.My friend ((name deleted)) and I left our cabin group and stayed behind in the cabin area of camp, while the other children went to dinner. Alex and I lied down on a mattress pad outside of the cabins and were watching the stars. This area of Oregon has very tall fir-trees and we were watching the sky through a gap in the trees. From our right side a round bright white light crested over a large evergreen tree. It seemed to be no more than 30 -50 feet above the treetop. It moved closer towards us and as it did, two more lights become unblocked by the tree and a clear triangle shape was formed by these bright lights. The craft seemed to be the size of a large sized airplane. It was silent and moved very slowly. I remember expecting to see men repel from it on ropes, but it suddenly moved to our north and disappeared VERY quickly. Then in the horizon something caught my eye to our right side, I looked to the horizon through the trees and saw three bright white objects come together from different areas of the sky. These three objects formed a triangle of the exact proportions of the craft that had been close to us. To my amazement this formation suddenly accelerated vertically and disappeared into outer space. I kept my eyes steady in the sky, my eyes following its trajectory. Then I witnessed what appeared to be three stars break away from the night sky and come together to form yet another triangle with the same proportions as the first craft. This triangular &quot;star formation&quot; then suddenly shot across the sky like a meteorite, leaving a white streak in the heavens. Afterwards I asked ((name deleted)) if he saw the second and third triangle formations and he said &ldquo;no&rdquo;. When I asked him about the first craft, he seemed uninterested in discussing it. We never spoke of it again together and our friendship ended soon after that night. I rarely speak of this event.

Deputy Governor General of Kerman province Abulghassem Nasrollahi told FNA that the crash which was followed by an explosion and a thick spiral of smoke has caused no casualties or damage to properties.He further denied earlier reports that the explosion has been the result of a plane or chopper crash, reminding that all the passing aircrafts have been reported as sound and safe.The official further stated that investigations are underway by police and other relevant authorities in this regard.While other reports spoke of meteors, Nasrollahi said there were no conclusive witnesses in this regard but he did not dismiss the possibility that the crash has been caused by a meteor.Eye-witnesses assure that the explosion has been caused as a result of the crash of a radiant unidentified flying object onto the ground.Meantime, an informed source told FNA that the object has been on fire and there has been thick smoke coming out of it prior to the crash, concluding that the object couldn&apos;t have been a meteor as meteors do not smoke.The source also said that the crash has been witnessed by people in several cities, and mentioned that the rendezvous point is located 100 kilometers from the provincial capital city of Kerman.He said that people in the city of Rafsanjan also reported to have witnessed a similar incident several days ago.Similar crash incidents have been witnessed frequently during the last year all across Iran, and officials believe that the objects could be spy planes or a hi-tech espionage device.(Description of Source: Tehran Fars News Agency (Internet Version-WWW) in English -- Privately-owned news agency.

I saw three distant objects in the sky which moved very slowly, sometimes getting into a triangular pattern and then very slowly fade back to a straight line of 3. I showed my wife&apos;s father and family and he concluded that it was airplanes.  However there was NO NOISE AT ALL from any of the three. They stayed around for at least 30 minutes, slowly making their way out of site behind clouds and mountains, only to appear again about an hour later. I ALMOST called 911 to report this and have wondered ever since if anyone else did. I kept telling the others that it was UFO&apos;s. Could it have been weather balloons? If so why would they go from a triangle pattern back to straight line? They did not change color and appeared to be white/blue lights, but they definitely moved, although slowly, and definitely were not stars.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

All we could really make out was that the bottom of the craft glowed predominately white but also had many colors spinning upward from the bottom of the craft to the edges. In a matter of seconds two F-16s were seen in pursuit of this object.  Their afterburners were approximately twice as long as the planes themselves.  I know that they were F-16s as you could easily see the silhouette of their intake scoop directly underneath the cockpit against the ambient light emitted from Lake Charles and Westlake to the south.  The craft seemed to be leading them on a cat-and-mouse chase in that the planes would begin to catch up to the craft and then the craft would speed away in a different direction each time.  This &quot;chase&quot; occurred over the Calcasieu river which is less than a mile south of where we had gathered that evening.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was preparing my home and property for the storm. As I walked around my pool, I noticed off to the west what I thought was just a bright star and only looked at it for a second as I was quite busy. A few minutes later I thought to look at it again just because it was so bright. This time it appeared much closer so I watched it for a moment. It was a clear evening with just a few puffy white clouds moving to the west and I knew this was an object other than a star because it was moving to the east, towards my location. I called into the house for my wife and friend to step outside and watch the light. It got to within I would say a mile off where I was and it height was below the level of the clouds as I noticed one pass behind what ever it was I was looking at. It slowed to a stop and began to hover and then it went dark. We could tell there was something there but even with binoculars we could not make out the shape of the object. There was no sound that we could connect with the object but it was right in the middle of a large residential/commercial area and within a mile of the executive airport. What really got us a little freaked out about it was when the object began to expell some sort of mist or fumes that took the form of wings or some type of venting and both of the flumes, for lack of a better word, were huge. I estimate they were more than 100 yards one off to each side of the object. After 15 minutes or so, the craft moved off to the north and appeared to be going higher. As it disappeared out of site a cone shaped, I want to say vortex, appeared way up in the sky about where we last saw the craft. THe point of the cone was pointing towards space but angled off to the north a bit. I have no clue what this could have been but it was truly a life changing experience for me as it has truly opened my mind far beyond what I would have previosly considered within the realm of possibilities.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Then we saw another one further away (it was smaller), in the same direction, with the exact same light and shape. The lights looked odd but we dismissed them until we both saw the larger (closer) object/light suddenly fly to the more distant light at what looked like at very hight speed, and the 2 lights merged. After a minute or so, one returned to the same closer location. A minute or so later, the more distant object/light disappeared. Then the closer one faded to pink and faded out.

Emergency dispatchers answered the calls in Iredell, Lincoln, Mooresville and Huntersville Wednesday night. One Lincoln County officer reportedly saw it, and the National Weather Service in Greer, South Carolina got similar calls.

It was an exceptionally dark night; usually there is some minimal light pollution out in all directions from my house, but it seemed much lesser that night in retrospect. I was doing work as I generally do at that time of night with my window blinds up, as I like to see the sky.  It happened to be a very nice, clear night out without any clouds. While working away, I noticed out of the corner of my right eye, to the south, something with lights in the sky.  I glanced at it and realized that it wasn&apos;t either an airplane or helicopter. As it was so dark that night, I was unable to make out any shape of the object.  It was emitting absolutely no sound, which is the first thing that struck me as strange.  The object was very low to the ground, far too low for a fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft; by my best estimation, somewhere between 100-150 feet from the ground. The object had four lights that I could see; two in the front and the other two swept out to the sides and back a bit.  All four of the lights seemed to be emitting a light that looked color-wise to a warm flourescent light, but emitted light as strong and as clear as an industrial bulb would.  I would also like to note that these lights did not seem to shine any light down onto the ground, even from the low altitude. The object was moving at a quite slow, steady pace, estimated at about 20-30 MPH.  It moved from south to north without stopping, changing course or speed as far as I watched. Had I been in my senses, I would have jumped up and ran to the front door; I was, however, stunned at what I had just witnessed, wondering if it could have been something ordinary. I believe it was not, however, due to the facts that a) I saw no landing lights or blinking lights on the craft, and b) There is no landing strip and/or airport north of my house; the nearest one is about three miles south-east.", "Glowing bluish/green large (same size as a jet but much wider) triangular shaped vehilce flying to the west sky in Cocoa Beach FloridaSaw just above the treeliine looking to the west a bluish/green large (same size as a jet but much wider) triangular shaped vehilce.

It was June or July, when my Dad (ret. Navy/Coast Guard) heard a report on the local radio station (WLNH)that there was a strange event occuring over a local cove. I don&apos;t remember which area, but I do recall it not being more than 20 minutes away from the center of town where we lived.  For you see my Dad grabbed his camera, said lets go, and we headed out to the area in question.We were only able to get within a half mile, where we could see a bright orange light over the area through the woods. There was already a crowd, with many vehicles lining the road, which was blocked by police cars, inhibiting furthur encroachment by civilians.  My Dad walked to a group to talk, as we stared at the odd glow that seemed to sink into the surroundings.  The people my Dad spoke to told him we were not allowed to go any closer as the police had made statements concerning possible radiation.  A local doctor my parents knew was there,as he lived in the area, and he told my Dad that he had seen the object in question &quot;floating down from the night sky, before it took up station hovering just over the water, occasionally emitting an odd green glow from the bottom part, that was nearest the water.&quot; We stayed for hours staring at the glow, with the rest, until the police and fire responders told everyone to leave, as the object was not, and there were concerns for our safety.For weeks after my Dad and I went to the highest point in town, a shopping center heading out of town towards Tilton, to watch for more things floating in out of the sky. My Dad always said he had never seen any articles in the local papers at the time of the incident.People talked about it for ages, but no information could ever be gleaned. After reading of the Guilford Police (around 1964) having not told the public to avoid a panic, I tend to think it was some other reason they were not disclosing.I am still not seeing anything fitting the description of what my Dad and I saw. But it was real, a reliable doctor actually saw it come out of the sky, and there appears to be not record of it anywhere.

It was a sight where you instantly know this is something extraordinary and not what our brains are used to processing and seeing.  I never really investigated anything more about it over the years because the craft I saw was triangular and I never heard of anyone seeing such a thing.  Until yesterday.  I watched a cable special about the UFO incident in 2000 near St. Louis with the various officer sightings of a black triangular object.  I then checked the internet to see about sightings in Colorado at roughly the same time of mine.  I have goose bumps again to see so many similar sightings from seemingly credible accounts.  My story is brief but it left a permanent record on my mind. I can&apos;t remember the exact date but it was in the early 1980s and I was a passenger in a car with my brother driving.  We were on a small street road near our house and it was daylight and very clear.  As we were driving, I casually glanced at Pikes Peak which occupies a large part of the mountainous view in Colorado Springs.  Near the top (above treeline) and slightly to the right of Pikes Peak was a triangular black object that appeared to be rotating.  It was close to Pikes Peak and probably 5 miles from me - line of sight.  I could tell it was very large given its relative dimension to Pikes Peak just behind it.  Had this been at night I could have dismissed it as any possible craft but being a clear day I was instantly startled as to what this was.  I had a good familiarity with military aircraft with my father in the Air Force and growing up in Colorado Springs near the Air Force Academy.  As I stated, the fact that it was triangular and didn&apos;t seem to have any other discernable shape or markings, I was amazed at what this might be.  I immediately told my brother to look and even told him &quot;stop the car&quot; and look.  By the time he finished asking &quot;what is it&quot; and stopped the car, I watched it disappear at an incredible speed over and behind Pikes Peak. I never saw it or anything like it again but after reading these accounts I felt I had to add my story to the many accounts listed.  I am shocked to see many accounts even older than mine of similar sightings which indicates it could not have been any kind of experimental military craft.

They continued like a plane rather than a stationary object, but seemed too low for a plane, and with this usual converging light pattern.We were driving approx 100km/hr on the Highway 401. Advertising flood lights cast a larger fuzzy light.  Since they are projected from the ground, you can tell roughly where they are coming from. These were more defined lights and didn&apos;t connect with one location on the ground.  The converging pattern was more precise than you see with advertising lights.

So basically, I was looking a a big green-rimmed triangle with a circular orange light in the center. When I first looked at it it seemed like it was quite far away. Like it was  just passing overhead. But to my mixed horrer/awe/excitement as soon as I looked at the damned thing it slowly but surely started coming right at me. It felt as though I were attached to it by some kind of string, and that by looking at it I was pulling it towards me. Like we were magnetically attracted and we had reached the point of no return, and a collision was inevitable. I also had this odd feeling that everything but me and the object had ceased to exist. I mean, everything was still around me, but it was like everything but me and the ship was on pause or something. As it descended towards me I watched in awe as it just kept coming closer, and closer, and closer. And the closer it came, the bigger I realized it was. Eventually the thing got so low that I thought it would squash me along with 3/4 of my city block. It was truly amazing. It was gigantic, and it came down right over me in the middle of North Minneapolis! I would have expected chaos around me if I had been thinking clearly. I mean, cars should have been pulled over honking, people should have been yelling, etc... But no. Complete calm. And the calm seemed perfectly natural to me. So, when the ship had come so low that i could hit it with a baseball it was like I snapped out of a trance and panic overwhelmed me. I immediately burst towards my front door across the street. Upon my first step was the first time my brother and my friend had entered my awareness since I first spotted the object. I don&apos;t actually remember physically running across the street, but that may have been due to pure panic. Anyway, I got to the door with my brother and friend scrambling right behind me.

It was approximately 4 miles south and about 800-1000 feet off the ground. At first, I thought maybe it might be a blimp coming in my direction so the display would be on its eastern facing side. But as I watched the lights I saw that it was moving faster than a blimp would and it seemed to turn to the west and sit stationary with 6-8 white lights in a circular to square configuration. The lights alternated from all white to red.  Having seen numerous airplanes being situated in the airplane flight path to Sky Harbor Airport, I observe that most aircrafts have 2 flight lights in the center with one red and one green light on the end of the wings.

It was blue with a small glowing white center and a light, I guess, foglike white around the outside of the blue section. After starring at this maybe 10-15 seconds the thing exploded. It was like watching pictures we have of a supernova explosion. It turned completely white and exploded in this blinding shiny white and was probably the size of a kitchen table at its largest as it exploded. And the really weird part is while it was exploding it let off the loudest sound I have ever heard. It wasnt a rumbling like thunder, it was like a pop and a snap that seems to resonate throughout the apartment. I have never heard a sound like this. I felt like I could feel the waves and it shook my floor slightly. I mean my ears were ringing it was so loud. And then it was gone. Not a trace. After sitting there just flabbergasted for about 1 min I went to the window and looked out and saw nothing out of the ordinary. I know I wasnt dreaming or hallucinating because my cats were looking at the orb when I was and both ran across the room and hid when it exploded and the sound came out.

The lights were difficult to see, like very dim stars. If I hadn&rsquo;t been looking for dim stars in the exact spot I was looking, I wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed them. They appeared to be the same brightness, color, and distance of the stars. (I know stars are at all different distances from Earth, but this is the best way to describe their appearance.)  It was a clear night in early summer. There were many visible stars, no moon. Myself and my friend (about 20 years old), were watching the sky from a field in the countryside. I noticed the lights and was able to direct my friend to see them. We both watched them and discussed how they were moving. We agreed there were no aircrafts that could move like that. We saw them for at least 15 minutes, but it could have been longer. They did not move in regular patterns. Each light would move independently. They were not traveling across the sky, they were staying in a proximate area, never moving very far from each other. This was easy to see because of the abundance of visible stars around and behind them. Each light would move in a straight path, at a steady speed, and then change direction immediately. The light would not slow down or change speeds mid-flight. The direction-change was immediate. They did not curve. A light would sometimes become more faint and then brighter again. (I assumed this to be it moving further and closer from us.) Their speeds could vary at each direction change. (I assumed this to be a result of the angle they were moving relative to Earth). I don&rsquo;t remember if they ever stood still. Their speed was not too fast to watch, (Not like a cat chasing a rapidly-moved laser pointer.) though I&rsquo;m sure they were moving at high speeds. Our distance from them made them easy to track. The lights eventually became too faint to see, but not all at once. I assumed this to be a result of the group moving further away from us. We agreed that the movements were intentional (controlled by some intelligence - presumably the pilots of the crafts). But could this have been some naturally occurring phenomenon? If so, I&rsquo;d assume someone would know about it, or it would be common knowledge. After all, there are astronomers who study space for a living. As I said, I believe these moving lights were controlled by an intelligence. Not because they were doing anything logical, but just that they were deliberate and unmistakably calculated. If these were actually government crafts being tested or whatever, I don&rsquo;t see what their tests could have been proving. Furthermore, why would they have 5 of them up there? If they were testing, wouldn&rsquo;t they just have one craft? Or two? I don&rsquo;t kow.If they were alien craft, I still don&rsquo;t see how those &lsquo;acrobatics&rsquo; could have had a useful purpose. Unless they were just joyriding in their crafts, like some of us do after a fresh snow. We saw this 8-12 years ago - don&rsquo;t remember.

There was a cloud cover that night, but the lights were below the clouds. There were five lights and they seemed to be very high up. Immediately we started speculating and ruled out the chance of them being helicopters, as they were very high and unlike any helicopters I have seen in my military service. We then ruled them out as airplanes, as the cluster of five lights seemed to be hazardous for any airplanes to fly in. Also, there were no flashing wingtip lights as seen on normal aircraft. The third incident, which ruled them out as aircraft to us, was when two of the lights started to converge together. Briefly, they became one light as they met up for approximately 10 second, then they broke off and became two separate lights once again. We thought that perhaps they could be comets, as we could definitely tell that there were fiery sparks breaking off from the lights, which happens when an object enters the atmosphere. But the strange activities of the two lights made it seem nearly impossible for them to be comets. The five lights were not moving in any specific formation, just a round cluster of about three lights on top and two on the bottom, with one following behind the other. We watched the lights for a couple of minutes, speculating, when it looked like one of the lights went out. Perhaps it disappeared into the cloud cover? I do not know, but it looked very much as if someone had put a candle out as the light died out. Right after the first one went out, then slowly and in succession the other 4 lights started to go out, until there was only one. It waited for about 20 seconds, and then that one went out. I would say about 30 minutes later one light reappeared in the sky, lower to the horizon and over the city.  This one! light l ooked very much like one of the five lights previously seen. It zoomed around briefly and then disappeared into the clouds. We tried taking pictures and video on our cameras, but we didn&apos;t have good enough zoom to capture the lights, as they were very high altitude.", "Formation of 6-8 glowing orange lights flying across sky then disappearing.We had been driving back from a fireworks display in Watford and going to a nearby shop when we saw a bright glowing orange light moving South overhead. At first I thought it was a plane but my boyfriend told me it was not as there were no other lights on it as there would be on aircraft. My boyfriend told me to pull over so he could get a better look.  As we stopped another one could be seen following the first one, about half a mile behind the first one.  Then came another one behind that one,  more followed and it looked like a staggered line/formation of approximately 6-8 orange glowing balls.  We thought it was very strange and were a bit freaked out. We called my boyfriend&apos;s parents and Uncle who both had seen the lights.  At first I thought it could be a formation of special military jets which don&rsquo;t have lights or sound but my boyfriend said that was not possible. After 5-10 minutes they went behind a cloud and disappeared south of Watford.  I have always believed in life outside Earth but this was extremely strange and I would like to know if anyone has any pictures I could see and whether there is any other logical explanation for this?  Does anyone know if they are special planes or U.F.O&rsquo;s?", "strange objects on new year&apos;s day, 2007 in Miami Lakes, Fl on a perfectly clear and sunny dayIt was a beautiful clear sunny south Florida day.  Perfect weather and clear skies.  My husband said &quot;look up, what is that?&quot;  The first one was round and black with silver lining.  It just floated above our house while we were outside for a new year&apos;s day barbeque.  It floated for about 5-10 minutes, then slowly went up into the clouds and disappeard.. the second one came about 5 minutes later.  At first it was round and silver, suddenly, it changed to a tube shape and turn gold, then it went back to being round and silver and had four round gold things spinning around it.  It kept changing back and forth and just sat there for about ten minutes.  Neither one of the objects ever made a sound.  Suddenly, several military jets started going over the house and the object floated up and disappeared.  I don&apos;t mean it disappeard into the clouds, I mean it actually disappeard, like a cartoon.  When my son and I turned around, we saw a black object coming straight down from the sky into a field across the street.  It came down really fast and kind of looked like a person parachuting, but with no parachute.  It actually looked like a tall black object with two legs, like a human, but the upper body was not clear to us.  No one else saw the third &quot;thing&quot;.  I really can&apos;t describe what it was because it came down so fast.  The military jets continued to fly around for about half an hour and left.

I looked like it was about 5,000 feet up and was the size of a 747 plane and moving in a south east direction. I could only see it though the benoculars and not with the naked eye. It moved very fast and there was no sound at all.", "Cylindrical aircraft with two bright, white lights at either end and a red light strobing between themI was out on my back porch in rural PA when I saw a very bright light in the distance of what seemed to be a small aircraft.  As it approached, I initially thought it was a helicopter because it was making a humming sound.  As it got nearer though, the sound was not as loud as I would have expected as it first seemed to look like one of those Chinook twin-propellor helicopters. It was cylindrical in shape, with a very bright, white light slightly above either end of the aircraft. In between the two lights, a red strobe light moved back and forth between the two.  This was unusual for a helicopter, and it was also much larger and much quieter.  It did not move particularly fast and it was relatively low to the ground, at typical helicopter altitude.It was dark, but as it passed near the moon (it was nearly full) I tried to discern the rotating helicopter blades to reassure me, however I did not see any.  This is also a remote area where we rarely ever see helicopters, particularly large Chinook ones.  It passed by me and over my apartment to the point that I could not see or hear it any longer.  From the time I first noticed the light to the point where it passed by was about 3 minutes in duration.", "Squiggly contrail and object  (triangular shaped with haze) moving away at 90 degrees from eratic contrail.Looking out the window to the southeast I first noticed an interesting very squiggly contrail line.  It was very well formed and concise and looked like it was fresh.  It started about 30 degrees above the horizon and continued down to the horizon squiggling the whole way down.  I couldn&apos;t tell if the line was dropping in altitude or just going to the distant horizon.  This eratic contrail line disipatted after 20 minutes from my first viewing.  It looked like it may have been from some kind of rocket that had no (or little) guidance system - just so erating and many times finely looping on itself.  It also was 90 degrees to the norm of contrails that normally form this time of day as we have much commercial traffic heading west at this time of day. Shortly after first noticing the out of the ordinary contrail I saw what I thought appeared to be a comet moving not really fast to the east at about 90 degrees to the from the contrail.  Again at this time of morning everything is normally moving to the west.  This is the object I observed for about 30 seconds, with my wife seeing it for about the last 15 of those seconds (it took time to get downstairs to notify her).  The whole object was the size of about half my pinky nail held out at arm&apos;s length.  The object had a haze behind the direction of travel (all this contained in the size discription given).  My wife and I watched it eventually fade away as it moved to the distance.

In my dream, I awoke in the middle of the night to the sounds of my parents talking very excitedly about something outside the window on the side of our house.  (Their bedroom was next to my bedroom - both had windows on the side of the house; my parents&apos; bedroom was in the rear; I shared a bedroom with my brothers in the front of the house; both bedrooms were on the second floor.)  I sat up in the bed to listen to what they were saying. My brothers then awoke and asked what was going on.  I said I didn&apos;t know, but that I heard my parents talking about something on the side of the house, so, since my bed was directly under the side window, I pulled back the blinds and looked out.  The night was very bright, like under a full moon on a clear night, and there were no leaves on the trees, so I could see very clearly (as best as one could at night) down to the neighbor&apos;s lawn next door and saw there 3-4 &quot;little men&quot; in silver jump suits with head covering pointing what looked like an old-fashioned stand-up tripod camera up towards my parents&apos; window.  These did not look like the classic &quot;gray aliens&quot;, but were probably only about 4 feet tall, very thin, and had slits for eyes and mouth and two little holes for a nose.  They almost looked child-like, or robotic.  It seemed they noticed me peering out and swung the &quot;camera&quot; over toward me in the window.  I then felt absolutely paralyzed and my vision started to &quot;blue&quot; out, as if I had stared at an old-fashioned camera&apos;s flash bulb and now saw nothing but the flash.  I then came out of this blindness and paralysis a few minutes later due to my father shaking me.  He told me the same thing had just happened to him before I looked out the window and my moth! er had t o snap him out of it.  He then yelled at all of us to stay away from the window, and especially don&apos;t look into any blue light outside, which we dutifully did.  All this time, my mother was trying to call the police but said the phone wasn&apos;t working.  She seemed to be starting to panic.  She then started turning on all the lights and ran downstairs to let our dog out into the backyard.  I guess she thought the dog would scare these things away.  We all then starting yelling at her to close and lock the door, while one of my brothers was insisting on going out and getting the dog back in the house.  Things started getting very panicky - and that&apos;s when I woke up with my heart racing.  After I relayed this to my friends and my brother, I saw him turn white and start talking to his girlfriend privately.  I thought he was concerned that I went off the deep end, but the next day they approached me and told me he had had the same dream - down to every detail.  We both got the chills and decided not to talk about it any more.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At about 22:00 hours, I observed a blue, pulsing light begin to emit from the forest floor about 7 miles to my northeast, northeast of the town of Pe Ell.  The light was low in intensity at first.  However, the light then lifted off the ground to an alititude of about 600 feet off the forest floor.  The light it was emitting became very brilliant and lit up a section of the forest below it in excess of .5-1 square mile.  Using my binoculars, I could not make out what the light was being emitted by.  The light faded from bright to dark, then back again.  Then, the light simply stopped.  Overall, the event lasted about 10-15 seconds.I did not say anything over the radio to the other workers in the area.  Soon, another worker asked if anyone else had seen the blue light.  I answered up and we skeptically compared notes.  We had observed the same event.Fifteen minutes later, or around that amount of time, the light reappered in the sky and again began to flash a high intensity blue light.  The light then moved quickly to the forest floor and through the trees the blue light could be seen, pulsing an amazing blue/white color.  The light again disappeared after about 15 seconds.  The other worker again witnessed the event.Another 5-10 minutes went by and the light returned in the trees, although much dimmer this time.  The light began to gain altitude, to about 1000 feet.  The light flashed, then circled up into the night sky, flashed again, and was gone.  The light circled counter-clockwise as it ascended.  None of the other workers had seen the light and the two of us that did see the light have been taunted since, albeit very friendly, about how we must have been on some type of illicit drug that night.Two days later, while stopping to get gas in the town of Pe Ell, I walked into the local convenience store.  I struck up a conversation with the attendant and she told me the following, regarding some type of search and rescue operation: The night before, a hunter, in the woods south of Pe Ell, observed what he thought was a meteor hit the ground near his location.  The meteor was not moving very fast as it descended.  It hit the ground and began to emit a blue light.  He got closer and the object began to flash a blue color.  He left the area and called 911.  Two deputies arrived, took his story, and proceeded to the area.  They assessed the situation and called for backup after observing the flashing blue light.A friend of mine called the dispatch center and asked what was going on.  They advised a plane had crashed outside of Pe Ell, but they were very vague about it.  Some type of search and rescue operation was underway.

Then I saw a third light come on very close to the other and in a straight line.  I thought of ECM flares. The lights then went off.  I could then see three flashing lights much like the strobes on standard aircraft.  One strobe light went east and one went west at very fast speeds.

I can admit that I was looking everywhere to see if I saw something unusual in the skies since I know Arizona has a high volume of sightings. All of the sudden we see an old airplane maneuvering north of us near Yuma,AZ.  It doesn&apos;t look military; it just looks like someone is playing around.  All of the sudden I look further behind the airplane and I notice something just sitting there in the sky. It was pretty far away and we could not tell what it was.  The objects were in a disk shape and white metallic color.  The object was pretty bright for a clear sunny day.  We pulled over to see if I can take good pictures of it.  My co-worker mentions of rotation on the object, but I could not see it.  The object stayed in the same spot for quite a long time and barely moved.  It looked like it would grow slightly in size and go back to the original size.  We could even see the object entering Yuma.

My first instinct was that this object was not suppose to be there.  It looked like a giant bowie (sp).  As we are flying by it I noticed that on the other side there was this metallic object attached to the object.  I looked around the airplane to see if anyone hesitated, but no one seemed to see it except me.

Hit the gas and the lights started to follow, then a few minutes later the lights shot past the car. 3 HUGE lights, no sound whatsoever. I turned down my street and when i was halfway down, i stopped and watched it hover over the woods nearby. After another few minutes of this it was getting too close. Terrified, i hit the gas and booted it home. A friend happened to be driving by and then i saw her car stop dead on the road. Heh, they saw it too. I was home at this point, expecting my friends to show up shortly after but they kept driving. Her boyfriend says the lights hovered, moved a bit, then dissapeared a few minutes later.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "summer nightsWELL IT WAS A HOT SUMMER NIGHT right after our high school graduation. WE WERE ALL INSIDE A TOYOTA CAMRY parked outside of boxwood townhome, FACING OPPISITE DIRECTION OF CRAFT, WHEN I got out of vehicle I saw a light in sky that was like a magnetic feeling almost as if i knew it was there before I got out of vehicle. I kept on starring at light that apeared to be over randhurst mall or maybe further it was hard to tell distance due to how to compare and contrast,well anyway my friends also exited vehicle shortly and asked what I was starring at? I showed them they said it&apos;s just a light pole from mall.I told them to look closer and use the mall light poles as a way to tell if unidentified light would move, shortly it did. When we first saw it it was on right of mall light pole then on left. At this point this had our complete attention,would not see it move but port,it appeared to be over home depot but probably further but from our view it appeared over it. All four of us were talking asking what is it?who is it? out loud then when we realized it was directly over us,we never saw it move only when it stopped motion or hoverd over something, What we saw changed our lives, it was shaped like frisbee  metallic black and the light&apos;s we saw earlier where light all around ship except they all light up at differnt times but it was not lights it seemed to be synergy produced be craft, also craft was differnt then any material we had ever seen cause it kind  of had a liquid material surface or some sort of feild maybe that made it apear this way. The craft hovered and it did have a outer circuler part of craft that move counter clockwise but slowly almost seemed so slow it might have been really fast, the underneath looked still except the kind electric feild it had going, It made no noise at all. We were unable to move we were looking straight up in complete silence no one talked if was almost like they took control of our senses left us motionless, for what felt like five minutes. When we were! able ma ke motion we all reacted at same time,we all turned around and ran in mark house to his room when we lookoutside window ufo was gone.At this point we all new what we saw we started talking about it and we looked at the time a 1 hour had passed. We could not make sense of time span. One thing we all agreed on was that when we where looking up standing motionless many seens played very fast through our minds. Like when you fast forward something on video similar but faster and many differnt taste smells sounds colors. We were going to report this insident at time but people usually don&apos;t believe it until they see it and we knew it was going to be hard to convince people of what we had encounterd. The irony is we felt settled with what we had experienced that we felt that why bother trying to make people believe us we all knew what we saw and told each other we would always remember and cherish this.Ever since we all have developed ESP and we can do extrodinery thing&apos;s with our brains it almost as if they unlocked a part of our brain we did&apos;t know how to use before this,we all write and produce music.We also read prophecies of edgar casey and got our own &lt;prophecies&gt; and &lt;visions&gt; very frequent and stated we all play music together on occasion so we still keep contact. ((four names deleted))", "..It split into two halves-like a &quot;Pac-Man&quot; mouth.This morning is January 9th, 2007. Tuesday.  Went to work as usual except woke up with a lingering headache. This worked into feeling terrible like a bug had gotten me.  Was going to punch out right away but went to get coffee and waited to start feeling better.  I was parked sideways in the restaurants empty backlot staring into the sky towards our local Truck Assembly Plant.  There were some dim parking lot lights and some evergreens across the area.  The time was 7:35 or so and the Sun was not upvery high yet. Clear sky and stars.There was only one overly bright star that caught my attention.I looked again and stared. 20 degrees up and bright it was moving. As I looked into the SouthWest is was moving West to South straight across slowly for about 20 degrees  and stopped.At this time I was glassy eyed and head pounding and was trying to decide how good it would feel to fly into bed under a foot of covers. Today was freezing and Windy.I squinted and looked again. The light was still there and now bigger. It looked intense like when I saw Venus thru the planetarium telescope. It looked like there was activity in its brilliance. Like a fire or something molen which was changing as I watched it.The was a thin horizontal line of calm thru the middle which the brilliance was around. As I watched the thing it grew bigger in roundness and brilliance. From the size of a large Michigan star to the size of three large stars. The light seemed to form a horizontal halo thru its center. It moved slightly back to the West and remained.These things are all happening slowly. It has been three or four minutes so far. The brilliance stayed the same for about a full minute and I started looking around the sky. About 3 or 4 fingers South of this and the same distance below it was another smaller light and it was motionless for about five or ten seconds after I noticed it. It looked kind of like Mercury when you see it far down on the horizon only a little higher.  My mind thought O.K. that really IS a star. O.K. now its moving- it is a plane. O.K. now it stopped right under the big one-which is going NOWHERE.---- At around this time I was wondering how this is happening and other things about this-like Good Explanations.  Maybe plane search lights-much bigger than normal-must be Police helicopters-no search light trail though.  No directional beam coming off it at all. If it was Police or Plant helicopters in the sky they hovered without motion way too long.  If it was aircraft and I was staring headlong into their searchlight the time was still way too long. The plane would&apos;ve covered a few miles coming straight at me.I began filtering thru many thoughts. Is this something I should notify about? Is it dangerous? Is anybody else seeing this? No-no one really looks up and it is still halfway dark out. Am I really seeing UFO&apos;s? Are they working with authorities or Who Care&apos;s. Could my head hurt anymore than this? The second light was not brilliant. It very definitely stopped right under the brilliant one-or-at least looked like it from my vantage point. This was a steady point of light which was staying-then-it moved slowly three fingers over to where it appeared right under the big one and stopped momentarily. It was ten or twenty seconds then faded off slowly.The brilliant one was still flaring and now it looked like it sprang an arm of light out about half its diameter and a quarter of its diameter in width.Sticking right out at about one o&apos;clock to me. I had to scratch my head and rellok at it. What the-what NOW? It stayed that way for about twenty seconds then in the space of about a second, from the nine o&apos;clock point on it, split into two halves just enough to open like a &quot;Pac-Man&quot; mouth and again I could see a dark line forming thru the center of the diameter and disappear as the two halves closed up. As this was happening the whole light seemed to give a shudder or extra volume and brilliance then back to normal.At that point it was motionless again and drifted slowly to a point behind a sparse evergreen limb where I couldn&apos;t see it.I sat there thinking-should I pursue this? Can my head hurt anymore than this? I moved the van over about ten feet East and about twenty feet South and there was a light. It was holding steady and brilliant but smaller. There was now also an obvious small Cessna type plane in the area. It was far off in the distance. Maybe flying due South and climbing at a steep pitch because I remember thinking-wow-is he doing acrobatics? But right now? This early in the morning? The brilliant one was still there but small-seemed like holding there again. I put the van in gear and took off out of the parking lot towards the highway (I-75). In the right lane the paved shoulder stops there and traffic at the red light got me stuck. I looked and looked there but nothing left. I could barely hold my head up off the steering wheel. The time was 7:58 AM. Waited for traffic to clear and the one guy stopped behind me to pull around then drove into the fast food place right there and got coffee. After driving the mile back to work I paged my boss and punched out on the time clock.As I look back on this event of about six hours ago it is my feeling the lights were less than a mile away which would put them right over the Plant or Hotel next door. Everything written down in this report is my best recollection, albeit my flu bug and sinus headache. I work on an outside crew and look at the stars alot in the early morning but have never experienced this kind of thing before. In the aftermath of this I had that feeling of a Cheshire Cat grin like you just got lucky enough to experience something few people do. That feeling was intense for several days", "It appeared like a cload shape but moving extremely fast from I think west to east direction.", "Triangle shape with 7 window lights past Black Canyon city 1-8-07 at about 7amIt was about 7am going down I-17 in the western sky, past Black Canyon City. Saw a triangle shape object with 7 lights shinning down from windows it looked like, with one red blinking light at the nose of the object. Having worked for a flying school I know all aircraft must have a blinking light ..it wasn&apos;t a satilite..my husband and I watched it for about a half hour going down the freeway.  It wasn&apos;t a blump either......every much triangler shaped.  Three lights on each side and one light toward the upper part of the V with the blinking light there, it was moving very slowly over the mountains.....we weren&apos;t seeing things either !!!!!!!", "ufo seen over  3-day periodi was outside finishing up our fireworks stash when i noticed a pulsing red light in the sky behind the trees. i dont know what it was. we dont live near those bulky radio towers at red mountain (they have red blinker lights). after about 1 or 2 minutes, whatever it was faded out of sight. the next day, i was watching tv when i noticed something moving among the trees about a mile away. i submitted a report on that one separately. it slowly descended behind the tree line. I then saw it rise up, make a 90-degree turn to the west and it was GONE. The next morning, i saw a saucer-type thing higher up that was red and blue. i think they were all the same thing, but i can&apos;t be sure. it might have even landed!((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "blinking white lights and moved out of sight in a half second with no soundmoving from south to north i thought it was an airplane at first, it had blinking white lights, but all of a sudden it turned around and took off and was out of sight in half a second with no sound.", "In clear daylight three white lights in triangular formation very high in sky moving eastwards.I was flying my kite. Weather was a clear blue sky. I saw three white circular lights close together in a &apos;V&apos; formation moving eastwards in unison. It was very high. There were Airliners heading towards Heathrow and Stansted Airports and it was much higher than the planes and moving in the opposite direction. I told my wife about it and she saw it too. It was too distant to see within 3-4 minutes of initial sighting.", "2 UFO &quot;geese&quot; formations over CanadaI went to walk the dog. It was already dark and I looked into the sky.  It was a perfectly clear night without any clouds and I was so glad to see the stars.  After few seconds I noticed sort of two geese formations in the direction of Orion Constellation.  The first strange thing that I noticed was the fact that every &quot;goose&quot; in the formation &quot;kind-off&quot; glowed. There was a small formation of 5 or 6 objects in front and a larger formation behind of 10 to 12 objects. Every object glow very clearly in the dark sky making apparent the object&rsquo;s chevron shape. There was no sound, no air tail, nor any other lights except the glow of each object. The traveling direction was from North-East to South-South-West. At the moment when I saw the objects they were on my left at aprox 45 degrees of my walking direction.In a split of a second my thoughts were: Gooses?  Now in January?  Impossible; and anyway they would have been more like dark pots on the sky rather than glowing. What a heck it this?  During the next 15-20 seconds the 2 formations already passed the Orion Constellation and started to assemble themselves (in a &quot;goose&quot; like fashion) in a single formation.At that point I lowered my sight for no more than 10 seconds to check over my dog. When I looked again in the sky, the &quot;geese&quot; formation was this times on my right at aprox 45 degrees of the same walking direction. After 10-15 more seconds the formation was out of my sight.At that point I realized the incredible speed that these objects should have to be able to travel more than 90 degrees of the sky in less than 1 min.Continuing my walk with the dog, 2 to 3 min later I noticed a linear cloud or air tail following the direction of the &quot;geese&quot; formation. The air tail seamed to move in the wind and after several minutes it was completely dissipated.", "dark spherical shape glowing brilliant lime-green, leaving a glowing green trailI was driving south on Hwy 101 toward Ventura California, less than 45 miles to the city limits.  I was with my boyfriend, but he was asleep in the passenger seat. I saw a brilliant lime-green light that streaked in an absolute vertical path (I am an artist, and very good at drawing, so I am very clear about vertical and horizontal alignment - this was a straight vertical) which was visible from the upper part of the windshield down more than halfway to the horizon.  My line of sight was clear in front of me, mountainous to my left side, and ocean on my right. The road runs right on the coast in this area. I first assumed that it was a comet or shooting star, but I have never seen one like that before, and another quality was that the actual object was glowing that brilliant lime-green color, which I have never heard of in a comet.  It left a long green glowing tail the full length that I could see it and contiued to glow for another second or two. The most unusual aspect was that it seemed as though it was a spherical object that was itself dark in color, but was &apos;glowing&apos; all the way around it, because the object seemed to look like the color &apos;thinned&apos; toward the center, and was extremely vivid at the edges, like it was producing the light as an aura or emission, it appeared like a green corona. I definitely saw darkening in the center and made mental note of it. I can&apos;t estimate the size but it seemed much larger than any shooting star I have seen. I have observed meteor showers, and never seen anything that is similar.", "Tube shaped object, very large, dark grey.

At first I thought it might have been an airplane since aircraft do fly along that route on final approach to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. This however just appeared like a star. I never blinked or changed color. After about 1 minute of viewing it stopped and remained stationary for about 2 minutes before proceeding on a N-NW heading. After about 20 seconds of that heading it changed and started heading SW coming to a stop again after about 15 seconds. It remained in position for about 2 minutes before heading W again. I then saw it stop and hold position for about 3-5 minutes. During this time, the clouds began to move into the area and altough they covered the stars, they only obscured the object. I believe it was either bright enough to be visible through the clouds or may have been in the clouds. I saw it proceed to head W again through the faint bit of light in the clouds and finally lost it after another couple minutes. I did not hear any sounds, witness any other lights or aircraft in the area. The next aircraft to fly in the vicinity did not arrive until about 20 minutes after I last saw the object. I also was unable to get the object on my camera phone because it blended into the stars too well.", "Large, wingless ship hovers over university building.In 1995 I was a freshman at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania.  I had stayed in the computer lab late into the morning on Wednesday, March 29, as this day was University Day and we did not have class.  I exited Franklin Science Center from the inside corner of this L-shaped building around 6:30 in the morning and started walking across the lawn back to my dorm.  I was halfway across the lawn when I looked up and saw a ship hovering above the Dauphin Humanities building, maybe 4 or 5 stories high.  It was not a plane, or a helicopter or any other aircraft that I have ever seen before.  It was large and rather drum shaped with big round lights around it.  This ship just hovered there, and I don&apos;t remember any sound coming from it.  I was terrified and just froze in place and stared at it for probably a minute or two.  The sky was clear and bright and there was just this odd ship hanging in the air!  It did not have wings or propellors or any other visible device to keep it in the air.  I don&apos;t know how long I would have stood there staring at it, but it started to move foward in my direction, again completely silent, and this was when I started back pedalling back to Franklin Science Center.  Once I got inside the building I did not go back outside for 2 hours until other people were around.  When I looked at the same spot over Dauphin Humanities there was nothing there.  I felt like I was looking at a picture and someone had just erased the ship and there was a big blank spot in the sky where it had been.  I never heard any reports about this on the news and I myself never reported it to any officials.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "fast moving high altitude pulsating discI was stargazing with 12x50 binoculars.  The sky was clear with myriads of spring stars.  I had already observed several high altitude aircraft like airliners as well as satelites.  While scanning with the binoculars I spotted a fast moving disc shaped object moving from east to west.  It was pulsating rythmically like a heart beating at a rapid rate.  It was like light was moving from the canter to the rim in waves.  The beats were roughly four per second.  I tracked it until it went out of sight. The whole thing lasted 30 seconds to a minute.  It appeared to be very high moving very fast.  It wasn&apos;t like any aircraft I have seen.  It gave me the creeps.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "The object appeared cigar-shaped and emitted strobe light patterns of various colors.I reported this incident back in 2002, at which time it was posted on your website and also on the Wisconsin website (taken from yours).  It remained there for some time.  When I had not checked on it for a couple of years, I found that it had been erased.  I&apos;m not sure why it was erased unless it was deemed increditable.  However, the recent sighting at O&apos;Hare reinforces the accuracy of my family&apos;s UFO sighting that took place in February 2002.   I am a former teacher and substitute teacher, and my husband is an Air Force veteran and a retired IRS Special Agent, who is now currently employed as an inspector for the Illinois State Police. As to the incident, my husband, along with our 13 year old  daughter, and myself,  witnessed a UFO for approximately one hour while driving east on Highway 43 between Beloit, WI. and Milwaukee, WI. at approximately 5:30 A.M. in February 2002.  The object first came into view as an unusual very bright light in the clear sky south of our position.  At this time in the morning, the sky was completely dark and we continually observed this object as it appeared to move closer to our position. As we traveled eastbound on Highway 43, the object began to take shape.  We had no idea how far away the UFO was, but it eventually began traveling in parallel to our vehicle.  When it first became identifiable, it appeared to be cigar shaped, with a lighted opaque dome.  From time to time, the object emitted various light patterns consisting of various colored lights in a strobe-light format. As the object came closer to us, it seemed very large.  The object would occasionally stop moving and fall behind our vehicle, then suddenly dart very far ahead.   At one point, the object was directly parallel with our vehicle and began to turn about its axis.  The object&apos;s appearance ressembled the classic description of a &quot;Flying Saucer&quot;.  Across the middle of the object were stobe lights running in a pattern of red, green, and blue lights.  At various times, white, red, green, blue, and lavender colored lights were emitted, in strobe form, from various positions on the craft.  As we came into downtown Milwaukee, the object appeared to be over the southern part of the city near the Milwaukee airport.  Daybreak was taking place and the object was quite clear.  At that point, as an aircraft took off from the airport in a southwestern direction, the object rapidly climbed at a steep angle (approximatley 70 degrees)in the clear sky and dissappeared into a high cloud bank.  This occurred at a speed far in excess of any known aircraft and similar to the O&apos;Hare sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It did not move from the time I noticed it until the time I got off the bypass at the Quarry Rd exit.  I believe it was still there when I got the intersection of business Rt 30 and Quarry Rd.  The sky was clear and the sun was to the south east.  It appeared to be over Loinville. Not a helicopter.  Not reflection of light.  Not a balloon.

About 30 minutes north of Ocean City on a beach, my girlfriend and I were sitting on a lifeguard stand looking at the stars.  Far up on our right I saw a star that was moving.  Then it stopped and held its position.  Then it moved again but in a different direction.  Then it stopped.  Then it repeated this pattern several more times.  With an understanding of geometry, I figured the the object must have been more than 10 miles above the earth.   At the rate it was moving, it must have been traveling at many thousand miles per hour to move from one point to the other....How it was able to pause its movement and just hover and then suddenly burst to another position is beyond me.  I am a man of science but when I saw this object, it was a surreal experience.  I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing and it truly frightened me.  It definitely was not a plane.  There is no man made object I know of that could have moved the way this object did.  This was an impossible event that I witnessed but it was very real.

Moved too quickly for helicopter or commercial craft.

Being a pilot, I tried to estimate the size compared to 747&apos;s and estimate is 10 lengths X 2 wide each. They remained stationary over what my estimate is the area of Corpus Christi Naval Station. At first, I ignored them, thinking they were some sort of cloud caused by a refinery or industry. After I slowed in Driscoll, 7 miles later, I was surprised to look up and see that the shape or position of the clouds had not changed. I looked around 360 degrees and the sky was totally clear except for these clouds. I continued to watch them until I turned Northwest at Robstown.

I was driving northbound on Ela road just south if Dundee Ave. tonight when I noticed an aircraft initially traveling southwest and banking leftward toward a south-southeasterly direction.  The radius of these turns was small, and very smooth. As the aircraft approached, I notices green wing-tip lights as opposed to the customary red left wing, green right wing tips.  I wondered what kind of airplane this was. As I continued to drive northbound I could see the shape of the craft via the light configuration.  It had a triangular shape and appeared to be hovering and not moving across my field of vision as a regular airplane would do.  I rolled open my sunroof and heard no airplane prop or jet engine noises. The craft then proceed to slowly move in a continuingly southeastern direction, at what seemed like a slow drifting motion.  I then lost sight of it due to the tree-line. The sky tonight is clear and cold...about 30 degrees.  I&apos;m not sure what it was.  I would estimate that its altitude was approx. 2000-3000 ft. up.  I also noticed a centrally positioned red light in the middle of the undersurface of the craft.  I&apos;m wondering if anyone else saw this object tonight. My sighting lasted about 60 seconds.

Approximately 10:55 pm in Wisconsin, USA. Three people were driving from Milwaukee to West Allis on a routine 20 minute drive to drop off a companion on a cold New Year&apos;s night. While on the apex of a bridge adjacent to an industrial area, the back passenger spotted a golden light, flashing at a rate of about 4 flashes per second, moderately high in the dark southwestern sky [see FIGURE 1]. It was about the size and color of a small, golden street light, fixed in the sky behind and to the left of the vehicle. The back-seat passenger alerted the driver and the front passenger to the peculiarity of the light, and they all thought it might be some sort of &quot;helicopter&quot; or &quot;star&quot;. As there was hardly any traffic, the driver slowed the vehicle down between 10 to 15 mph. The object conspicuously glided down towards the ground and closer to the observers. It ceased flashing and became a solid &quot;gold-light orb&quot; [see FIGURE 2]. Now seeming to be only a few blocks away to their left (west), it began to parallel the movement of the vehicle&mdash;keeping up with its exact speed.. It was fairly low to the ground because it was somewhat being obscured by some thin tree branches (without leaves) along the roadside. The vehicle, now having passed off the bridge, continued to move northbound towards a major intersection. As the driver slowed even more to get into the left-hand turn lane at a stop light, a red light rotated around the left side of the object, and then a blue light rotated around to the right side of the object. Both lights stopped at the visible edges and remained fixed at the object&apos;s respective sides for only a moment&mdash;disappearing within seconds [see FIGURE 3]. At this point the object was moving at its slowest. Because of the sudden appearance of the &ldquo;police&rdquo; lights and its speed, the witnesses concluded that it must be a police helicopter on a mission. As the car sat at a complete stop in the left-hand turn lane, there were a few cars to the right of the vehicle. But people in those cars were not looking toward the object, which was traveling at a laborious pace very low to the ground (perhaps a 100 ft). It could barely be seen unless you were looking for it. As the object began to cross over the avenue they were going to turn onto (west), it now appeared to &ldquo;branch out&rdquo; into a string of five pale-white lights. It moved silently, almost at &ldquo;walking speed&rdquo;. The witnesses rationalized that it might be some sort of plane trying to make an emergency landing - but why land perpendicular to the street?  The lights suddenly stopped and became fixated directly above an estimated seven story factory building just two blocks away. The traffic light changed to green, and the driver finally turned left toward the object; it was just up ahead. No other cars or people were out on this usually busy street. Curiosity and perplexity filled the witnesses as they moved closer to the building. Finally, the car pulled over to the side of the road. The back passenger rolled down his window and stuck his head out of the car to observe what could be resting in the sky above. The other two people strained to get a good view from the front passenger window. What seemed like a string of lights from a few blocks away on approach were actually the lights on the &quot;front&quot; and underneath of a large, black, equilateral triangle object. The five lights shown down like &quot;baseball stadium lights&quot;, and were located at all three corners and in the middle of the two &quot;front&quot; sides [see FIGURE 4]. This large object was &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; in the air, producing absolutely no noise, movement, or flashing. Everything around them seemed so still, almost like they were in a vacuum and &ldquo;weren&rsquo;t supposed to be there.&rdquo; The body of the triangle was colored charcoal-black, with a faint, grayish grove running along the front tip to the back center. There were visible sides: the edges showing a continuous grayish-black indentation with a slight overhang or lip. There also seemed to be very faint &ldquo;circuit board&rdquo; type etches on the body of the object. These apparent etchings were more apparent in the center grove on the &ldquo;belly&rdquo; of the triangle and within the groove or indentation along the sides. One witness later remarked that some of its features reminded him of a &ldquo;Star Destroyer&rdquo; space vehicle from the Star Wars movies. After approximately 30 seconds of viewing the object, the driver became agitated and fearful, saying that they &ldquo;have to get out of here.&rdquo; He drove away and continued westbound on the avenue. When they left, the object left their point of view. But as they increased their distance at a block away, it came into view again in the back window, still fixated in the sky in the exact position last seen. Anyone else viewing the object might have passed and though nothing of it. It was so still and innocuous, that they probably would have thought it was part on the building complex. As the car passed over a hill a few blocks west of the object, it could not be seen any more. No other cars were observed on the road until about a half mile later. The total experience was less than 5 minutes. The three witnesses remained shaken for the rest of the night, with one of them insisting that it must be some sort of police helicopter performing a maneuver, and never wanting to talk about it again. The most disturbing thing to the witness in the back seat was that even though he had been a big &ldquo;UFO buff&rdquo; from the time he was young, the word &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; or &ldquo;alien&rdquo; never entered his mind until after the triangle was completely out of view. He even had other UFO related experiences before this, but still cannot explain why he wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;freaking out&rdquo; at the time. The best explanation was that &ldquo;he was denying it in his mind to keep his body from freaking out.&rdquo;  The strangest element to the whole experience was the apparent personal awareness the object had to the witnesses. It got their attention by flashing, moved in and followed alongside the vehicle at a distance, changed forms, and seemed to wait for them and them only.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

My cousin and uncle also spoke to me about this and they actually saw more detail than anyone else in the group.  They reported that a light actually morphed and gradually changed into beautiful colors.  My uncle said that the object seemed to open up as if it had a mouth.  During another incident at around that same time but on another day, my brother and cousin observed two blue lights for several minutes in the same vicinity that the strange light was observed in.  They quickly left after the lights seemed to be slowly encroaching upon them; my brother said he became frightened after seeing those lights seemingly coming towards them.  It&apos;s interesting to note that everyone became frightened after seeing the lights.  The way the lights moved was not anything vehicular or human.

We were laying on our backs looking at a clear night sky, with approximately 160 degrees of sky visible.  I am the son of an aeronautics engineer, and have been raised around all types of commercial and military aircraft.  I grew up near an Air Force base, and have observed hundreds of various aircraft in flight, both at night and in the daytime.This particular night, while viewing the stars, an object moved toward us from the south.  It was very dark and difficult to determine the shape.  It had one distinguishing feature:  a single pulsing red light on the bottom of the craft.  The size of the pulsing light led me to determine that the craft was only a few hundred feet off the ground, yet the craft was moving at a high rate of speed with absolutely no sound.  My experience tells me that only a jet-propelled craft or very high-powered turboprop could move at this speed, typically with lots of noise associated, particularly at this altitude.  This craft was absolutely silent.  It moved south to north, spanning my field of vision in less than 15 seconds.  My wife and I both saw the craft and corroborated what we had seen and agreed completely that we had witnessed a craft that did not exist in any records or memory that we had.

Object slowly accelerated northeast-bound for a few seconds guesstimating between 50 and 100 mph, still about 200 feet above the ground, afterwards it then shot at a tremendous speed northbound, so fast I could just see it dart outside of my peripherial vision. I didn&apos;t realize what I was looking at until it moved from it&apos;s stationary position above the mountain, at which point I was a bit in shock when I saw the object fly downwards then hover along the ground moving. When it was moving northeast about 50 - 100 mph is when I think I realized what I was looking, and yelled in our car &quot;Hey do you see that?!&quot;. My family members lazily asked me &quot;See what?&quot;. By that time it was gone and to this day irritated that no-one else saw it.

I didn&apos;t pay much attention to it at first and just thought to myself that it was a big star.  When I looked at it a few seconds later I noticed that it was actually two lights signifigantly larger than the other stars and also that it seemed to be moving slowly, horizontally across the sky.   So then I thought it might be a plane.  I kept my eye on it and observed that it seemed to be moving slowly then pausing then moving again.  I thought it was wierd but still maybe a plane.  I was eager to arrive at work and park so I could get a good look at it.  I tried to keep my eye on it while I was driving and arrived at work about 45 seconds later.  When I got out of my car and looked up at the object(s) the two lights seemed to shift into a vertical position like stacked on top of each other and then I noticed a red blinking light between the two lights.  Then it started to move vertically straight down towards the ground.

My first thought was that it was a plane, but that quickly faded the more I looked at it.  It was not moving, just sitting still in the air.  I could see traces of light or smoke (looked kind of like what sparklers do when you light them and swing them around) and it was a bluish color.  I watched the object for the entire period.  It all of a sudden went slowly higher and the light became a small dot in the sky, and then proceeded to fly out of sight. I know that it was indeed not a plane because I have a hot tub outside and have seen many planes fly over at night, and this was totally different.

When this ball of light shot of to the west, it appeared and I firmly believe it was traveling level to the ground as though it was completely parallel to the ground.

It was still snowing heavily and the clouds had to be at an altitude no higher than 2,000 AGL.

It sat there for several minutes. Strange how there were no airplanes going to Weir Cook Airport during the duration of this sighting...usually, we could expect a jet to fly over every 3-10 minutes...they would get low enough to rattle the windows because we were very close to the airport. Many adults and children stood in their yards watching as word spread quickly. This craft was directly over my front yard. It was silver in color. At one point, I distinctly saw what looked like six dots (we didn&apos;t have computers then, but now I know it looked like computer data) emitted from the left side of the vessel. They were in perfect order. After the dots were emitted, the object began a very slow ascent, in the same pattern it had followed downward: straight up, gradually.

Later that evening around 11 p.m. I was alone on the dock and still looking at the light.

Then, as I watched, it started moving westward, towards me, in an erratic fashion.

I went upstairs to my room to get something, and happened to look out the window to see what I thought was a C-141B on approach to McGuire AFB. The approach pattern would have plane fly directly over our house at times. I noticed the plane appeared to be extremely low and barely above the tree line behind our housing area, ( Lake Valley Acres ). This got my attention and I watched the plane get closer and closer, but it was moving too slow and low to be a large aircraft. I turned my light out in the room and closed the door so my eyes could adjust to the night time sky. The whole time I was watching this craft, It had a bright, almost spot light like light on it that I mistook for a landing light, but their was only one. As it got closer, I noticed it was only slightly above the roof line of the two story houses, maybe 20-30 feet higher. I was really getting scared now because it was almost over my friends house directly behind our house. I went to open the window to hear it, but the window was already open. It was completely silent, flying at about 5-8 mph. It had a very bright half circle shaped light on the bottom of it, that was bright enough to prevent me from seeing details of the top of the craft. I could see the outline and it was about a 35-40 foot diameter circle with the light about 15 feet in diameter and about half that in depth. As it flew directly over our house, I could see the outline better as it passed. When I could nolonger see it I ran out of my room and frantically ran into the kitchen to ask where the Polaroid one step was. I think my mom gave it to me, but of course it had no film. I then ran full speed out of the kitchen, disregarding what ever my mom was yelling at me, and cleared the entire flight of steps, hitting the screen door handle at the same time and running into the front yard. I could see it real good now it was just crossing the street. I grabbed a couple o rocks out of my ! mom&apos;s fl ower bed and got ready to throw a few rocks side arm at the craft. Yes, it was that low, and yes, at the time, I was that good!! Just as I got ready to throw my first rock, and it was just over our neighbors house in front of me I thought, &quot;what if I do hit it and it stops?!&quot; Visions of disintergration, ( 10 years old, remember ) flooded my mind and I dropped all of the rocks and watched it fly towards McGuire AFB at roof top level until I could nolonger see it. I ran back in the house to tell my mom I just saw a UFO and she just said, &quot;That&apos;s nice, it&apos;s time for you to get ready to go to bed&quot;. I repeated my self and she repeated her self. I asked her why she didn&apos;t believe me and told me again to go to bed. I went to my dad down stairs and he listened to me but I think that was just a parent humoring  a child. I went to bed but did not go to sleep, occasionly looking out my window for another UFO. I think I finally went to sleep at around 3:00 or 4:00 am. At about 7:00 am my mom runs in my room, shaking me saying, &quot;Look what&apos;s in the morning paper!!&quot;, ( Burlington County Times, or Philadelphia Inquirer ). There was a picture of a man with black hair and a close beard and mustache with glasses smoking a pipe. The caption above read, &quot;Moorestown Man sees UFO&quot; I read the article and his description was just as I described, except it had multi-colored perimeter lights on when he saw it. The paper said McGuire was asked If they had tracked any UFO last night, and a base rep of course said their radar picked up nothing.

I was a student at Arizona State University and was driving home to Omaha after the Spring semester.  It was dusk (almost dark) as I went Eastbound on I-40.  I do not think I had crossed into New Mexico yet; I was not near any town at the time of the sighting.  I was driving a 1987 Pontiac Fiero (with the fuel-injected 6 cyl.) on cruise control at about 70 mph.  There were no other cars nearby.  Out of the corner of my right eye I caught sight of an airborne craft slowly overtaking me just off to the right side of the interstate.  The area where I was driving was quite flat.  I could not immediately identify the craft, but it had a rotating beacon underneath and a few other lights on it.  It was no more than 500 feet off the ground. My first thought was &quot;this must be a cropduster following the highway to go home.&quot;  I kept switching my gaze between the craft and the road, trying to identify the craft.  I am quite good at identifying aircraft in the sky.  With each look, however, I became more intrigued because nothing looked right.  I could not make out position lights at the wing tips, and the rotating beacon (which cast light on the underside of the craft) was multile colors, including blue and white.  I could not make out the edges of the bottom side of the craft, though I got the impression it was bascially circular.  The lit portion of the underbelly appeared grey.  The craft was about the size of a modern-day jet fighter perhaps. Now very intrigued I sped up and caught closed the distance between me and the craft some.  My plan was to stop quickly, shut off my engine, hop out of the car, and listen for engine noise.  A radial engine, for example, sounds much different than a horizontally-opposed engine.  By the time I got out of my car the craft had proceeded away to a distance of less than 1/4 mile.  If it were a conventionally-powered aircraft of that size I could certainly have heard it.  The winds were calm on the ground.  I heard nothing.  Now I was very, very intrigued.  I jumped back in the car and gave chase along I-40.  I got up to about 100 mph and the craft appeared to be pacing me, not allowing me to approach it.  At that point I decided it was stupid to be going so fast and not paying attention to the road, so I began to slow down.  At that point the craft accelerated away and climbed.

The smaller light also reflected the same lights.  I alerted my friends to look outside as well, they also were puzzled by the two strange lights.  It was a completely clear night, and there was not a cloud in the sky.  Evenly the brighter light kept moving slow to the south and just disappeared.

Then white flash explosionAround 11:30pm Thursday night, I went outside to take out the trash and walk my dog (live in an apartment complex with a wooded area next to it).  Usually I look up at the night sky when im on my nightly dog walking trip, just in case something happens to fly by.  Usually I might catch a shooting star, or an airplane but nothing out of the ordinary. But this night, it seems I looked up at exactly the right time.  When I looked up, a falling spherical object caught my eye.  It was a whitish-blue and looked to have yellowish sparks as a kind of &quot;tail.&quot;  It just kinda appeared mid-air (well out of &quot;thin air&quot; I guess you could say), not very high in the sky.I tried to follow it to see if it would make contact with the ground, but when it fell behind the treeline of the wooded area next to my apartments (beyond my line of vision, hindered by the trees) there was just a bright white flash, as if it had exploded.

We decided to keep quiet about this incident back then because of being fired, or people thinking that we were responsible in some way - as will be explained.  They may have thought that we were seeing things or drinking, but we were doing neither.  As far as seeing a UFO or such, we didn&apos;t.  Yet, my co-worker and I did encounter something very strange and unexplainable indeed.  This is a TRUE story, and my previous co-worker can verify my story if he ever decided to come forward.  I still to this day cannot understand what happened to us that day back in 1984 etc.  The day began as I was working for Wal-Mart in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  The day was clear, warm, and beautiful.  It was a busy time of the year, and we were using U-Haul rental trucks to transport merchandise from our warehouse to our main store.  One day my co-worker and I were again sent out to get some more merchandise from our warehouse sometime after noon.  The warehouse was located across town from where our main store was located - about seven miles.  I was driving a large U-Haul truck, and was driving carefully.  Everything was going well until we came to the four-way intersection on the Nashville Road from Campbell Lane.  I stopped at the intersection red light, and then proceeded to turn right onto the Nashville Road.  We pulled up a bit and proceeded to drive the short distance left to our destination when something really powerful and large hit our U-Haul.  Whatever it was hit us so hard it literally made us jerk sideways, and it made a loud metal crashing noise.  After gathering our senses I put on the flashing emergency red lights and we got out to see what had happened.  We both thought that somebody had hit us in the back end of our truck.  Yet, when we looked around there was not any vehicle anywhere that had hit us - nothing.   We would have seen a vehicle pass us while we were inside the truck, but this was not the case either.  Nobody else (traffic) seemed to have seen anyone hit us, or anything unusual, either.  Now confused and puzzled, we decided to look for damage to the U-Haul, and this is where the real strangeness comes to play.  When we went to the right passenger side of the truck there was some severe damage to the truck, but it was near the very &quot;TOP&quot; side of the vehicle.  My co-worker and I were completely stunned and speechless.   A severe dent about eight feet long and two feet deep was plainly visable on the truck near the top.  This was the passenger side that no traffic at all could have been near to because there was no road there - just a school yard.  Whatever had hit the upper part of the U-Haul had to have been airborne!  The damage to the truck was extensive, highly visable, and not there when we had began our trip that afternoon.  The truck was checked before we had left the store.  Whatever hit the truck had to have been airborne, and very big and slanted to make a deep dent like that.  The damaged looked like what a disk would make if it hit metal.  We didn&apos;t know what to do, and feared that we would be held liable for the damage.  We feared for our jobs too.  After all, who would possibly believe such a story as this?  How could we logically explain this?  After a while of talking we both decided to keep quiet about this because we felt we had to.  Nothing was ever mentioned to us about the damaged U-Haul either when we got back to our store, and we felt that was odd, too.  I can tell you absolutely that somthing very large, airborne, and powerful struck our U-Haul truck that day.   Whatever it was had to have been flying at tree-top level and grazed our truck.  Yet, we never saw the craft or whatever it was.  This story is absolutely true and accurate.  I have no idea of how to give you any kind of sensible explaination for this.  We were attacked or hit by something strange though.  Strange stuff!  Thank you for your website and interest.

Approximate time was 9:00 pm.Up in the sky in front of me and to the south, up above what appeared to be an airport were 3 glowing slightly flashing objects white/orange in color they appeared for about ten to twenty seconds. When the 3 large objects became 5 objects and appeared and disappeared back into the 3 objects.  This lasted for an additional ten to twenty second.From where I was I would say they were one thousand to two thousand feet above the airport.  Very large larger than a house. I pulled off the road to see if what ever I saw would reappear. I waited for a few minutes enough time to get a little spooked. I got back on the road to San Diego. I do not know what I saw but I know it was not any thing I had seen before at night.On the way back to San Diego just out side of Gila Bend I saw a lot of aircraft flying towards the direction I just had come from. I got off the highway one more time and notice they were about 4 helicopters and to the west and south and 4 jet aircraft to the north heading in an easterly direction.

I am clarifying some information a little. I was thinking about it again today (this weird event pops into my mind every once in a while still.. it really impacted me) and wanted to just clarify info a little bit.)---  There were three of us in the car on the road going out for the night.  It was early August on a Thurs or Friday night, somewhere between 10-11 pm. We were in the city on a street driving Northeast, and there were buildings on either side of us on the road, restaurants, mini mall, parking lots etc, all lit up with typical lights. Suddenly in a split second, all lights went OUT and the sky lit up in a bright flast of light.  There was not an apparent point that this light radiated from, rather the entire half of the Southeastern sky was lit up like daylight. ie, the sky was sky blue.  For that split second it was like daylight (although the extreme opposite direction, the horizon was still dark). before you could blink, everything was back to normal lights back on and everything.  Literally, it occured in a split second. It was VERY WEIRD and paranormal.. All three of us in the vehicle screamed and the driver STOPPED the car in the middle of the street. Before we were through jumping/hollering/car stopped it was over, though, leaving us to wonder if it really even happened.  There was absolutely NO NOISE associated with the event at all. We all looked at each other in disbelief... in fact we all asked each other &quot; did that just happen&quot; at the same time.  If we were not all there to assure each other, I think if would have been passed off as imagination, etc. I called electric company the next day because we were so freaked out.. no reports of any kind of problem whatsoever.  We had called another friend we were going to meet up with several miles away north of us, who was in her car as well with her fiance, and although she saw no flash of light in the sky, she said the lights in the city did flash off for a second where she was at too. The night was fairly clear...nice weather. There was NO lighting, and no storms in the area. This event may seem trivial just reading about it, but if you were there you would understand why I have reported it here.  The three of us talked often about this event for WEEKS after it occured.

As I came around a bend in the road I saw a gold bright light... I did a double take cause I thought it was the police helicopter that normally is flying around my area.I couldnt make out what the object was. I noticed no other lights and the police helicopter has two lights... red and green and I didnt see those. When I first saw the object I was looking about 200 yards to my right out of my trucks winshield. as I got closer and realized that the object was not a helicopter I then thought it was an airplane but the sky was over cast and it would have been impossible to be an airplane flying that low. I started to feel very nervous cause I couldnt make it out. All this happened so fast that I was unable to figure out what to do. I continued driving and I kept glancing up at the object. It didnt move an inch. When I came right up on it I noticed it was about 3 telephone poles in height in the sky. It wasnt very big, but it was bright like a like was hanging in the sky.I lost sight of it as a drove by it. I slowed down and was trying to look at it out the back of my truck window but the furniture was in the way.

I then noticed the supposed helicopter was making very sharp turns and speeding up and slowing down real swiftly. I knew I wasnt looking at a helipcopter. It was something else. I lost sight of this object and so I got back on Clairemont dr and continued toward my house heading north. I spotted the object again. I watched move around the sky.It was covering a distance of 2-3miles in seconds as it went around in no given pattern. It was flying low to the ground beneath the cloud cover.

He was using a digital camera and the photos were made as fast as the camera would cycle.There is an aircraft con-trail visible in the background that seems to go approximately North to South.

At first I thought it to be a star or planet but then realized it was much too early.  The sun, albeit low on the horizon, was still up.While laying on my back with a small pair of binoculars I watched for some 10 more minutes.  The object still appeared as a point of a bright white/blue light.  I couldn&apos;t hold the binoculars steady enough to make out a shape. At times it appeared slightly circular but I can&apos;t be certain of that point.I briefly pulled the binoculars away to watch with the naked eye.  All this while the object was ever so slowly drifitng toward the northwest.  After perhaps a minute the object winked out.  I quickly resumed the observation with the binoculars and found that the single point of light had seperated into two points of light. These two points were moving away from one another.  Within the next 30 seconds I lost the visuals altogether.I thought this might be a high altitude weather balloon so I started a search on the San Francisco/Monterey National Weather Service.  By chance I checked the the Short Range Composite Radar Loop and noted that there were 4 very strange echoes detected at frames 16:27 (PST), 16:37, 16:46, and 16:56 on the MUX radar.  The echoes were detected to the west and had a generally northern movement.  I couldn&apos;t save the radar images but I did manage a screen print of the 16:27 image.I then checked the winds aloft on the NWS website and found that the winds from the surface up to 42,000 feet were all generally blowing NW to SE.  So if this was a balloon it had to be much, much higher in the atmosphere where the wind was blowing in the opposite direction.  I then sent an email to the Answers@NOAA describing the situation and if they might think it to be a very high altitude balloon. They had no idea.So I&apos;m sending this along to you.  Later that same evening when Orion rose over the horizon I tried using the stars Rigel and Aldeberan to estimate the approximate positions of this light and it&apos;s motion through the sky.  By this rough estimation I concluded that the object was first seen at about +5 degrees declination (above the ecliptic). It then drifted roughly -1 hour of right acension to about +15 degrees declination over the course of 15 minutes.Sorry that&apos;s the best I can do, and moreover I was home alone.", "Bright blue almost LED type light transversing the entire distance of the distant sky in 2-3 seconds.I was driving home from work on Ring Rd. in Elizabethtown Ky.

Off in the horizon at about a 60 degree angle from myself, a bright blue light appeared to come around the curvature of the earth on the left of me and continue on a direct course until it disappeared around the curvature of the earth on the other side of the horizon approximately 2-3 seconds later.  The color of the light was about that of a blue LED light that people use to decorate the hoods of their cars with.  It was deep, bright....almost neon.  It truely looked almost exactly like a LED light.  It could tell it was very far in the distance and high in the sky based on it&apos;s position relative to the horizon.  This thing was booking it.  The speed it must have been travelling to transverse the entire curvature of the horizon from one side to the other in 2-3 seconds is mind boggling.  Even at the distance I was, the light appeared to be about 3-4 times larger than a bright star in the night sky...ofcourse that&apos;s my own comparison, it was already dawn so there were no stars visible behind it to directly compare it&apos;s size to.

I really should have reported it - but in 1976 in London if I mentioned it peoples assumed I was mad. There were about 12 of us - I can&apos;t remember - squatting in St Johns school (disussed), Richmond London, England, in the heatwave of 1976 London. These people had been telling me they had been seeing UFOs in the sky, and I did not believe them - I thought they were seeing shooting stars, satellites, aircraft etc. So I agreed to sit up with them and watch.. At the time I was computer science student at Kingston Polytechnic. We dragged chaisse-longes / sofas into middle of what once was playground. The site meant that the incident lightiung/light pollution was unusually reduced for London area. Also in this heatwave the visibility was exceptional - I could see whole of milky-way clearly. For a couple of hours nothing much happened. We saw a few shooting stars and also some satellites which I think I identified correctlly. ACtually we saw a lot of satellites - the conditions were that good. At this stage I was convinced I could explain everything and they were mistaken. Them suddenly something looking like a dull orange ice hockey puck slid over from one horizon to the opposite. I thought that a bit odd but wasn&apos;t freeked. A bit later there was another similar in different trajectory. Someone claimed it was a pidgeon. I didn&apos;t think so but wasn&apos;t too impressed. Shortly after that the main event happened. We could see the consellation very cleary. It seemed an extra constellation appeared - accompanied by vague red steaks in sky according to some. The new constellation was mostly symetrical but not quite. It suddenly moved off - in formation and pointing &quot;forward&quot; (it was basically diamond-shaped but I would need to draw diagram). There was no accelleration I could see - it went from 0 to something serious instantaeneously as far as I could see. This formation then went clean through an angle - I&apos;d guess about 45% or so Im not sure - with one of the &quot;stars&quot; taking over as leader in the change. At no time did this formation slow down during this impossible manouver. Then the entire formation just stopped dead instantly. Then the &quot;wing&quot; stars of the formation just took off in curved tradjectory leaving red streakes to my eyes, being replaced simultaeneously by similar incoming to make new though similar formation. They held that for 1 or 2 secs - then the whole lot just took off leaving red streaks to my eyes. I had about 10 friends with me witnessed this. I got them to write all details down. Unfortunately this has all been lost now. I quickly found if I mentioned it people thought I was mad. Some of my freinds -in fact most - saw slightly different stuff from me. I was watching one particular part of the sky. If I assume my friends were not crazy, then there was stuff going on all over the sky and I only saw one part of it. The reason I think so was that their reports just differed enough - like when we see real events. After this event I tried to rationalise it. The best I could come up with was lasers or car headlights shining through a temperature inversion. But the truth is it gave us all the serious impression of the cosmic &quot;red arrows&quot; - had intelligence written all over it.

While looking for a good shot of the cormorants I saw two bright reflections coming through the fog (looking west across the water).  At first I thought them to be reflections from windows on a house across the narrows on Point Fosdick.  But as I watched the reflections were moving slowly northward.  I estimate they were moving about 5 mph. I zoomed my lens to 400mm and looked at the reflections through the camera-lens.  Through the lens I saw that the reflections were coming from two rectangular surfaces on a triangular shaped object.  The object appeared to be roughly 30&rsquo;-50&rsquo; above the surface of the water.  I watched it for about two minutes.  It was difficult to judge the distance above the water due to the fog obscuring the far shoreline.  I estimated the object to be a half mile away.  I wondered if I was just seeing the top of a barge or tug but I could see nothing below the triangle which I could see fairly well.  I shot two photographs of the object.  In subsequent review of the images I can discern nothing below the triangular object.I heard no sound that I could attribute to the object although I could hear traffic noise from the Narrows Bridge a mile to the north.  After taking the two photos I looked around to see if there was anyone nearby to ask if they had seen the object.  There was nobody nearby and when I looked back the object was gone.  I continued to look out across the water for the next five minutes or so and did not see the object again.  I specifically looked farther to the north to see if this was a barge or tug and did not see anything even though the fog was thinner in that direction and I could clearly see the Dockwise, the bridge deck carrier ship anchored under the bridge.((ADDENDUM #1 OF 2))Here are the two original images I photographed 24 Jan 2007 of a triangular object moving slowly northward over (estimate 30&rsquo;-50&rsquo;) the Tacoma narrows.  Photos taken westward from the shoreline along Titlow Beach Park, Tacoma Wa toward Point Fosdick.((name deleted))I&rsquo;m really hoping someone can identify this object so that it will no linger be &lsquo;unidentified&rsquo; to me.((END ADDENDUM))((ADDENDUM #2 OF 2))Hello,I really thought I&rsquo;d seen and photographed a UFO yesterday 24 Jan 2007.  I emailed the two original images to this email address yesterday.I spent several hours yesterday enhancing the images using photoshop and consulted with some photographer friends of mine.  We came to the conclusion that I had become disoriented in the fog and my perception of where the far shoreline was in my photos was incorrect.  We have also come to the conclusion that what I photographed was in fact something floating IN the Tacoma narrows rather than something moving ABOVE the narrows.  Our best guess is that it is a partially sunk dock that has broken away from its original mooring.I went back out to the location this morning and using the same camera, lens and focal length re-shot the scene from the exact same vantage point using the same two pilings as reference.I&rsquo;ve enclosed a photoshopped image of my now tentatively identified ufo with a line marking where the far shoreline really was (upper line) and another line (lower) to indicate where I had thought the far shoreline was in the fog.  I superimposed today&rsquo;s image over yesterday&rsquo;s to locate the lines.I&rsquo;m very sorry to have taken your time and even sorrier that I filed a report when in fact what I saw was not a UFO.  Please know that I did not do this as a hoax; at the time I really thought that what I saw was slowly floating 30&rsquo;-50&rsquo; feet above the water.  Also, until I had the chance to enhance the image using photoshop (unfortunately after I&rsquo;d made my call and report) I could not make out the details of the object I&rsquo;d seen with my eyes.Again, I&rsquo;m sorry to have taken your time.  Can you please remove the report I made from your database?Thanks in advance,((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM #2))", "whycocomagh,margaree valley mountainit was in october, the brightest moon(full moon) back in 2001, we encountered a green energy strobe with 2 green lights,smaller bleaker had stronger energy pulse like a deep emerald and the ship itself was lime green,and this wasnt a weather balloon it was in our earths athmosphere,maybe twice as bigger then our normal commercial airliners,no noise,no trail,no clouds it kept goin towards nyanza area.we kept looking at it till we ended up on dead end of road,slowly levitated but kept goin till it went out of site..((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I became exited and intrigued about my coincidential UFOs sighting; thus I started to keep a watchful eye more frequently on the skies.  Also, since my first sighting happened at 3pm during the day, I only watch the sky during the day; not having the need to watch at night, since night observations make easier to confuse ordinary lights with UFOs. ******** SUNDAY NOVEMBER 19, 2006 ********** Still excited about the sighting on the previus day; while my wife and daughter went to church, I stayed home, I went to the backyard around 1pm, at the beginning I didn&apos;t see anything, but after 10 minutes of watching, I could see a white spec to the North at 80&deg;, after a little while it became more visible since it descended more becoming a metallic sphere, the altitude was higher than the flight of a commercial airline plane.  The sphere travelled for 3 minutes Southbound until it dissapeard and it was reflecting the sunligh in flicks giving the impression of being a rotating object... ********* THURSDAY NOVEMBER 23, 2006 ******** We went to Tucson, AZ to spend Thanksgiving with relatives... We arrived to Tucson on Wednesday night, and on Thursday around noon while the Turkey was being prepared I went outside to my relatives&apos; backyard; The house is located in South Tucson close to Irvington Road and Benson Highway... The day was a nice with some light clouds on the skies; and again after watching for a while, I was facing Southwest and I saw this bright metallinc, aluminum like, sphere coming down slowly from the clouds at 60&deg;; I called my cousin&apos;s boyfriend and he put his sunglasses on and we could see the UFO flying high from Southwest to Northeast towards the Catalina mountains until it dissapeared without descending.  We could see this object for around three minutes and again, it appeared to have a rotating motion, since the sunligth w! ould ref lect on its body and flicker once in a while.  ********* SUNDAY DECEMBER 10, 2006 **********  I was in my house, located in West Phoenix, watching TV.  I could hear a helicopter&apos;s noise flying low in the neighborhood; I came outside to the backyard, and noticed that the helicopter was two blocks East of my house; flying in circles; it was giving orders to someone on the ground thru the speakers; then I turn my sight Northeast at 75&deg; and saw this metallic sphere stationary way up there, I went inside to get my wife, but she didn&apos;t want to come out, because she&apos;s tired of me looking for UFOs; when I came outside again, the spehere was not in there anymore, then I turned North-Northwest and I found it at a much lower altitude at 45&deg;, and I definitely could appreciate an oval shape and reflecting sunlight, I ran inside the house to get a videocamera; a cheap Panasonic Mini DV53, when I came outside the UFO wasn&apos;t in there anymore and the helicopter had moved four blocks south of my house and it still was flying in circles.  I look around for a while, and turned my head up 90&deg;, and there it was right above me.  I tried to focuse it with the videocamera but it wasn&apos;t in there anymore; I looked for it and I found it East at 75&deg; and it had ascended; I wasn&apos;t able to get a shot of it, but it definitely was in there; I finally got tired and went back into the house; The event lasted at least 10 minutes....  ********* WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 13, 2006 *********   I went to pick up my 6 years old daughter at school, she gets released at 2:40pm, I always get there 10 to 15 minutes early, and while I wait for her, I scan the skies looking for &quot;my friends&quot;, it was a nice day, sunny with a few light clouds, at 2:39pm, I noticed the metallic sphere appear East-Northeast at 75&deg;; there&apos;s always a bunch of people picking up theird kids, and I watch around to see if anyone notices what I&apos;m watching; noone is watching, I assume noone is into this, noone would care.  The UFO travelled right above us as I picked my daughter, it took ! around t wo minutes since it appeared and dissapeared on its path...  ******** SUNDAY DECEMBER 16, 2006 ********** My brother and his family came to visit, it&apos;s been over a month since I&apos;ve been watching the skies looking and spotting UFOs, and he&apos;s not aware of my activity yet...  He needed some tools because he was going to do some work on his car; I was on the driveway getting tools out of my car; I noticed the UFO East at 80&deg;, my brother came out, then I tell him, about some events over the last month, he scratches his hair, by now the UFO has moved farther East and it&apos;s visible at 45&deg; over my neighbors tree. I didn&apos;t tell him about it, and then he spot it, and he asked &quot;Like that one?&quot;. I just smiled and replied to him, &quot;Yes, just like that one&quot;. ******** I must disclose that since the first sighting I&apos;ve watch similar UFOs in at least 9 different times; however, since the time my brother saw that one, I&apos;m not able to see one more sighting.

My property is surrounded by trees, and has a clear sky view, directly above the back garden.  A very fast object travelled from north to south, covering approx 100 degrees of sky, in about 1-2 seconds.  The object was pure white, with a halo type covering, and resembled a cigar type shape. Inside the &quot;halo&quot; there seemed to be a long cylindrical shape, with a rounded front, and no discernable rear.  I have no frame of reference for a dimension, but an estimate would be, width of 2 fingers at arms length, and a length of one fist at arms length.  The altitude was low, and i estimate under 500 feet. There was no noise, or any unusual phenomena.  I would not have written in about this, except for the fact that i have seen this twice now.  The second time was a month later, in mid december 2006, when i was in Tweed Heads, Australia.  I was outside a house, at approx 22:00, with my wife, and we both saw this &quot;object&quot;. This was almost identical to the one i saw in galveston, and the direction of travel was south east, to north east. The details for this second sighting were effectively identical, with very high velocity, white &quot;cigar&quot; and halo, no noise, no associated phenomena. My wife asked me not to repeat what i saw in galveston, as there was only one observer, and no proof of any kind, and i concurred this was correct. However, after the sighting in australia, and its extremely similar description, in 2 very different localities, but with 2 observers, i feel it is reasonable to state that this was not an abberation, atmospheric phenomena, or an isolated incident.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "it was shape shifting or  sevral hundred objects where moving in complete sycronized rythm but it was large who could have missed this.I was outside and my uncle told me to look up in the sky and when i did i noticed what seemed to be a formation of objects or one object shape shifting i dont know but it seemed to be atleast 30 thousand feet or more. I live in between four major airports and always see planes it was not a formation of planes becaused there seemed to be atleast onehundred objects or more it was dark outside and they seemed to have a faint glow but not too luminious.The light was a dimmed white ,grey and black and seemed to pulsate. The way it was moving i could not tell if it was one object or fleets of objects but it was syncronious in movement .It was going from northwst to southest.  It flew not to far from a plane in the sky and the plane was high up. Another guy came up the street and observed it too i asked him what he thought it was he said the object appeared to be one object but large and kinda cloaking in and out like rippling water effect . I still think it might have been several objects  because they shifted place simontaneiously. my uncle agreed it was so hard to say what it was but i know what it wasnt and it did not look like anything i have seen before.There was no sound it could have been a mile in legnth because it took up atleast a quater of the sky i could see from my view.It also had a dark shaded cloud that seemed to ride with this event the cloud was much larger in size . it moved fast but not faster than the planes up there where it was at . It dissappeared out of my sight others had to see this there is no way on earth that alot of people did not see this. Im not soo surprised of what i saw but how could no one else see this it was huge event ether way u look at it.It was very similar to the ones i saw on a mexican news report. These where traveling in somewhat of a v shape could have been almost seen as a large flock of geese but these where no geese. im sure others on my block saw it but not every one feels comfortable talking about stuff like this i understand. i am a little ! worried about something of that size and nature was not on the evening news for real.", "Green glowing UFOs and some that look like stars in the shape of circles with many encounters.The first encounter was with two friends I no longer have contact with.  It was probably about 5-6 years ago around 10:00p.m.  We we&apos;re skateboarding behind the gym of an elementary school and decided to take a rest.  We lodged our skateboards into these vents against the gym wall and layed back on them.  We had a clear view of the sky that night and I noticed a green star in the sky.  It was bright and very distinguishable amongst all the other stars in the sky.  I pointed it out to my two friends and they noticed it right away.  We layed back and watched it for about 10 seconds when all of a sudden it came down right in front of our faces, all the way from high up in the sky right down in front of us in a split second.  The object was emitting a green glow that was very bright, but I didn&apos;t notice anything else light up around us.  It was completely silent making no sound at all, and this object was big.  My friends and I made no sound and just stared at it.  I just couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing.  It probably hovered in front of us for around 10 seconds, as if it were staring back at us.  Afterwards it shot off back into space as fast as it had come down in front of us and we lost sight of it a second after it shot directly back up into the atmosphere.  Afterwards my friends stood up screaming their heads off and running.  I didn&apos;t know what to do or think so I just followed them.  Years and years later my friends and I were just discussing UFO encounters.  This wasn&apos;t my first either, but it is the most significant as it leads to a chain of sightings.  So anyways, I told them about this one and they realized that we could try and head to the school gym to try and see if we could spot them again.  I thought it was a great idea and got excited, so we left.  At the gym we waited for a while, and sure enough my friend spotted one out of the corner of his eye.  It looked like a star, but it was movinhg, and then a few more started popping up and moving around in the sky.  They looked ! like sta rs, however some would fly low and close to the mountain next to us and these were green leaving green trails behind them.  These would move fast and then slowly, and then all of a sudden they would jet accross the sky leaving trails behind them.  We could spot up to even 6 at a time easily.  Some were straight above us, some were off in the distance.  We watched these from around 12:00 midnight until 5:00-6:00a.m.  after the sun comes up we could no longer see them.  I gathered more friends over time and we would make routine visits to the gym to spot more UFOs.  Sometimes we would see a lot, sometimes none at all.  One time one flew close to us, we could just tell it was close, especially by lining it up with the mountain next to us.  This one flew slow and was about the size of a quarter if you were to hold one at an arm&apos;s length in front of your face.  It flew from above our heads, all the way to the other side of the field and eventually passed the mountains and dissapeared behind some clouds.  There is no way these objects could be aircraft, it&apos;s impossible.  Nothing can move that slowly and then speed up that fast and maneuver they way they did.  Sometimes they would fly directly at each other as if they were going to collide and move away right before they would touch, and move at extreme speeds.  These were still flying around, the last time I checked about a year ago.  Sometimes I could see them from my apartment balcony, like one would just jet down really fast and dissapear.  I mainly only saw them at the school gym though.  I would love to have people investigate this.  I want this to go places and I was watching the National Geographic channel and heard about this place on a UFO show that they had on.  Please, check this out!  Oh yeah I forgot to mention that we brought video cameras afterwards to try and videotape some of these UFOs.  We were unable to capture any of them with our camera because the sky was just black and the video camera was horrible at picking anything up in that type of! setting Another thing is that the video cameras shut off at the same time while we were trying to record.  The batteries weren&apos;t drained or anything, but for some reason the cameras just shut off completely.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When taking out the trash, I noticed three shiny silver spheres in the sky in a perfect triangle formation.  They were not moving in any direction, just hovering, and slightly wobbling.  I&apos;m not good at distances, but I believe they were much lower than most commercial airplanes fly, maybe only a couple thousand feet in the air.

I was coming out the small yard which was on the Manor Ave side of the school and I was Running into the big yard  which allowed you to look from Manor ave to Ward Ave.  I was facing Ward Ave which was west and saw the fire ball coming from that direction.  It appeared to fly right above us.  It seemed to be flying really low.  You could hear this fire ball.  It sounded.... well like what you would expect a fireball to sound like... i guess..... I&apos;ve never heard anything like that before.  And you could almost feel this thing as it passed over us.  It flew right over us east bound,  but once it pass over it disappeared from our sights because of a 6 story building on the corner of 172nd St. and Manor ave. We all started running around tripping out and asking each other if we saw the same thing. Oddly enough we really didnt make a big deal about it.... we all thought it was a meteor or comet.... and every couple of years it would be talked about as a weird unexplainable occurance.It wasnt until I got older that i started thinking UFO. This fire ball was or appeared to be flying really low... so low that a building only 6 stories block our view immediatly after it passed over us. Also, this thing should have crashed.... exploded or somthing. there is no way somthing that was close enough to hear and feel.... like you feel when a plane is flying low..... didnt impact. and if it was a comet or somthing.... wouldnt the news report such a thing?

My first impression was that it was a satellite, but it was moving much too rapidly.  I have observed the International Space Station and it moved very slowly, in comparison. The magnitude and color (white like that of a satellite) of the light of the object was constant, and there was no tail behind the object, nor trail left in the sky following the object.  The object, at first, appeared to travelling roughly parallel to the ground, but as it moved away from me, it looked as though it had changed trajectory toward the ground and that it might impact somewhere on the Redstone Arsenal.  No impact was observed.  No sound was heard. A small aircraft was flying from north to south at the time of the sighting and the object would have been visible to the pilot through the right-hand window.  My vantage  point is high above the city (approximately 600 feet) and visibility was unlimited.  The sky was perfectly clear with good astronomical seeing conditions.

But the red/green lights didn&apos;t advance, so  I noted the position in the sky, lining it up between a white flashing marine beacon and other lights on Blake Island.  It seemed stationary.  With binoculars I could see that the body of the light was chartreuse green, surrounded by red lights.  It may have been round.  It seemed to emit green flashes of light, reminding me of a 4th of July firework, where separate streams of light shoot out geyser-like, all at once, arcing in different directions. The red lights didn&apos;t seem to flash like the center chartreuse green light.   The object seemed located much above and beyond Blake Island, at a position of about one o&apos;clock from the center of the island.  I noticed another similar stationary red/green light at a position of about three o&apos;clock in the sky, that wasn&apos;t irridescent or flashing.

I was 17 years old. This occurred on a late October early evening in 1967.  I was driving in a convertible car with a fellow on our way to a party.  It was just past dusk, I&apos;d say around six thirty or so. We were driving on a town road past a park where the railroad tracks run parallel to the street but up a hill.  As we approached a steep hill running alongside the tracks we saw a huge disk hovering over  the tracks and the electric wire towers.  It is difficult to determine size because we couldn&apos;t determine how close it was to us or the wires.  It seemed to be 20-30 ft long.  It was blueish in color and seemed translucent.  Small, evenly placed square or rectangular windows lining the front edge were visible to us.  There was absolutely no noise or flashing lights.  The front edge appeared to be about 50 ft from us and about 30 ft up from the street level. As the two of us started to point and shout about what we were seeing, in a flash it took a quick jolt westward and then took off that direction so quickly that it could not be tracked.  We sped up the hill in front of us to try to follow but saw nothing.  Over the years I have been tempted to undergo hypnosis to ascertain if there had been any further contact between myself and the UFO that evening, but I was afraid to learn anything new.  I was already affected by the sighting and didn&apos;t want to become obsessed with it. About 15 years later I happened to see the fellow I was with that evening and the first thing we both said upon our chance meeting was &quot;Did that really happen?&quot;  So I know that he was similarly affected. Years later, in the late 1980&apos;s my then husband and I had a sighting in the evening skies, but that was simply lights seemingly flying in formation, again soundless, and then suddenly disappearing.  This occurred over Norwalk, CT in the late &apos;80&apos;s, not sure of exact dates.  We did not report anything. I realize that this report is long after the fact, but it is important to me to have some record made of this sighting.

Further east ,where the contrails originated,were erratic as it moved west. at this point we noticed a very bright light,like a burning magnesium ball, moving west and the up and then as if it burned itself out but only to reappear again as a white ball and then again burn itself out.

The light was also heading north bound. My husband made a u-turn to park in an empty parking lot across the street to get a good look. When we parked, we were surprised to see the the light had also changed direction and was in the sky in front of us. The light became very bright and blurry. No matter how much we stared at it, neither of us could focus on it. It danced in the sky from side to side in an unsual pattern. I noticed three men across the street outside a coffee shop. They were also looking up at this strange object. It was a big ball of fire. The way it moved in the sky was unlike anything I have ever seen. Afer five minutes tiny balls of fire dropped from the huge ball of fire. When this happened, I got scared. I didn&apos;t know what was falling. I even told my husband to get back in the car. Several of these smaller balls of fire fell from the large one. As the objects fell, the original fire ball shrank in size until it was gone. Once it was gone, I looked back over to the men that were across the street looking up at it. I told my husband that we should drive up to them and ask them if they could make sense of what we had just seen. Unfortunately, they got in there car and left before we could get to them.

I turned my head and saw a green &quot;ball of light&quot; for a split second, then it moved away rapidly.  It proceeded to move NE out of view.  The whole &quot;event&quot; was no more than 3 seconds.There were reports of this sighting on an Asheville, NC, newschannel (ABC 13) this morning (1/26/07) - Asheville is an hour away, (ENE) so there are others who may have viewed the object along this direction.My sightline of this object was between a two trees.  It was not close as there was no glow on &quot;local&quot; vegetation.  I would guess the object&apos;s size to be that of a tennis ball, based loosely in comparison to the trees.  I do not know how close or how far away the object was from me, so my size estimate is only in reference to the trees and therefore not absolute!  The object HAD to be in a state of no motion when I first viewed it, for as it moved away (rapidly), the &quot;shape&quot; was indiscernable.   As the object moved away, it had properties of a &quot;comet&quot; - longer with a green tail.It was an incredible experience and I&apos;d like others to &quot;share&quot; their story as well.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The light was spread across the ground about 20 feet in length and was moving towards the garage. At first I looked to the street assuming it was car lights, but when I did not see anything in sight I quickly looked up at the sky.  As soon as I did this the blue light sort of swooped from the ground and shot of into the distance until it dissappeared from sight. This all happened very quickly, and after the event the two others I was with saw the EXACT same thing. There was no lightening in the sky, no storms, and no cars passing.

We were at cruising altitude (30,000 ft?) between Dallas and Denver. I was gazing out the airplane window towards the west when a light from behind the plane caught my eye. I looked back and saw a saucer/disk flying parallel to the plane a couple of hundred yards from the plane and slightly lower. I watched while the disk caught up to the plane, passed it, and continued on ahead of the plane until I lost sight of it due to the angle of my line of sight out the plane window. The disk was fully visible and relatively close so that I had an unimpeded view of the side and top of the disk. The disk itself was a silvery, metallic color and was shaped very much like an upside down saucer. Around the circumference of the disk, there were rotating bright orange lights and stationary orange lights, looking very much like the wooden spokes of a vintage car when it travels at a certain speed and it looks like the spokes are stationary. There were no markings or external features of any kind on the surface of the disk and no signs of a vapour trail or obvious propulsion system. My feeling at the time was that the disk was about 40 feet across and 15 feet high. During the sighting I glanced around the cabin of the plane to see if anyone else had seen it, but there were very few passengers aboard and of those, no one seemed to be looking out my side of the plane. I would be thrilled if the captain and airline crew on this flight contacted you and made a report of their sighting because they could not have helped seeing this disk.I&apos;m only sorry I didn&apos;t talk to them after the flight or remembered the flight number but at the time I was quite satisfied with the fact that I had seen this disk. I thought at the time that this could be some kind of experimental aircraft but I have to this day not seen anything like it. I submitted a report to one of the UFO agencies back in 1983 or 84 and it was published in their journal, Alan Hynek wrote a little comment on it.

I was driving for about 10 minutes and still couldn&apos;t tell exactly where the lights were hovering over, by the time I reached my destination. I&apos;m guessing they were over St. Charles or South Elgin. But what I found so bizarre was that they didn&apos;t move at all. At first I thought they might be helicopters doing a search, but there was no searchlight scanning the ground or operating lights on the craft or perhaps light standards like you&apos;d see at a high school football stadium, except there were no supports, and were way too high in the sky. Not only that, but they were just a solid amber colored light, with very little glow around them.

At 5:45 p.m. (dusk) the sun had just set and the full moon was rising just over the north east horizon.  It was crystal clear sky.  The direction of the freeway is due east.  I was watching the lights in the sky of many planes/helicopters, some reporting on traffic conditions and others in a typical landing approach for near by airports, when a bright light (distant, but bright) caught my attention to the north, or out my driver&apos;s side window.  I know the difference between aircraft landing and strobe lights and a star.  This was more like a star in the sense that its light was consistent and its intensity. To the left of me it traveled from as high as I could see (top of my window), to what seemed to be straight down towards the earth, but more like it was traveling beyond the horizon moving away from me and disappearing as it followed the curvature of the earth.  No trail was following it.  I immediately question myself as to what I had just seen and tried to apply earthly logic to explain it away, but I came to the same conclusion.  It was not a plane, meteor, or star.  I did consider that perhaps it was a falling star.  I have seen falling stars on many occasions and the light seems to fizzle out as it is traveling and they appear (obviously) very high in the atmosphere.  It was not dark enough at that time to see stars.  Also, this seemed to propel itself across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed as opposed to &quot;falling&quot;.  It was way to far away to see a shape, as I mentioned it was star-like, but there is something deep inside of me that knows it was either not of this world or a vehicle that is not known to the general public (if it is of this world).

They were like two pie plates placed open side to open side.  We saw them edge on.  Each one had a distinct pale yellow light on their bottom side or face.  The full moon was shining in a sky with scatttered clouds.  It was reflecting off the objects.  Also, the light on the bottom side was reflecting of that surface.   They appeared to be made of a very polished or shiny metal.  I tracked them through the picture window until they went overhead.  I then ran to the other end of the house and reacquired them.  One-the one originally on the left and now on the right continued on its original course.  The one originally on the right, but now on the left due to my change of position and viewing perspective had curved off and was heading straight north.  There was no apparent sound, and they moved at a steady pace.  The lights were steady.  They were probably two to three hundred feet up.

There were four, rectangular craft flying pretty close to the ground. They were changing colors every few seconds all over their surface, except for a central, dark spot. We pulled over into a parking lot and got out of the car. They would zoom ahead and then slow down, often retracing where they had just flown. The traffic was really light, and we couldn&apos;t hear them making any noise, and we were pretty close to them.

However I am very sure it was during a Halloween Carnival which makes it even more weird.  So it was probably late October. I saw two round and very bright objects.   They were both white in color.  They were traveling in parallel on the same path and trajectory.   They were flying from south to north at about 45 degrees above the western horizon.  They made no sound. It&rsquo;s hard to describe their size.  They were definitely a lot bigger than the brightest star or planet.  They were definitely a lot bigger than any aircraft lights at any altitude.  They were definitely smaller than the moon. My first impression was that they were flying at low altitude because of their large size.  However I later decided that they could be at any altitude.  It&rsquo;s hard to get some frame of reference when there is nothing else nearby to compare to.  So I really don&rsquo;t know what their altitude was. It took me years to figure out what I saw.  At one time I thought they were car headlights reflecting off of power lines.  Power lines are strung in parallel.  However there were no power lines. Finally about 25 years after the event I came to the conclusion that it was a meteorite that had broken into two pieces.  Both pieces were still flying on the same course and trajectory as the original meteorite would have been had it not broken up. It seems very reasonable that this is in fact what I saw.

This object was VERY bright, and a light orange color. Even thought I thought it looked awful large for a planet, I still assumed it must be since it was not twinkling like stars do.I pointed the light out to my son, and proceeded to bore him with trivia like how to tell if a star is a star or if its a planet. The object was in my view the entire time I was driving-(except short periods when trees obscured it.) A little over 2 miles up the road I had to make a left turn to head due east. I had started thinking there was something weird looking about the light so once I turned, and saw no other cars were coming, I stopped in the road to have a safer look.This was when I noticed the light was not a single light, but THREE lights. I thought to myself that it was weird for an airplane to have three large lights underneath it like that because for it to have been an airplane the two front lights would have had to have been on the end of each wing, and the third rear one on the tail, but all would have had to have been UNDERNEATH the object.These lights all looked to be the same distance apart and were very big looking lights, all large, all the same light orange color, no pulsing, or color changing, and they were set in a triangle pattern--(note I stated the shape of the craft was triangular, but I am unsure of the actual shape of the craft itself--only what formation the three lights were in.)  They didn&apos;t appear to be landing lights, especially since the plane was not coming from, or going towards the direction of the closest airport, so I&apos;m sure it wasn&apos;t landing or taking off.The object was closer to me by the time I stopped to look and was heading towards me in a diagonal path. I made no unusual note of speed, or movement--(it appeared to move slowly, but I wouldn&apos;t say notably slow, nor did I see any unusual movements that defy conventional aircraft performance.) I heard no sounds as if an airplane was passing overhead, but I never actually cut my van off, so I suppose it&apos;s possible there were some sounds.This object appeared to be flying pretty low, yet was too high for me to make out any of the aircraft itself--I could only see the three lights.  It&apos;s possible this may have been a normal, everyday aircraft, but I have to say that I&apos;ve been driving for many years, and have been out lots of times at night, and I have seen many, MANY, airplanes, helicopters, and such in the night sky at varying distances. I&apos;ve seen all kinds of colored lights on planes at night time,at different altitudes, sometimes steady, sometimes blinking and blipping around.More than a few of them have given me pause, but I always realize very quickly that it is in fact just an airplane, or some other form of &apos;normal&apos; aircraft. You just--KNOW when what you are seeing is normal, and when it is not, and this didn&apos;t look normal to me. I can&apos;t say as I&apos;ve ever seen three big orange colored lights in that formation on the very bottom of an airplane like that before. Ever.Thought I should mention that I submitted a report to the NUFORC a while back....I think it was a year or two ago and it concerned a possible UFO sighting I had when I was younger back in the early 80&apos;s in nearby Suffolk, Va. (I believe that was the last time I have seen anything &apos;unidentified&apos; in the skies until last night, btw...lol)  The one I saw in the 80&apos;s was a single big, bright light, but was orange like the lights I saw last night. Might be nothing, but thought worth bringing up.I made and am sending you two drawings I made via a computer paint program.

They were classic saucers, but only about 2 feet in diameter, and with what looked like &quot;antennae&quot; sprouting from the top center.  They came within about 30-40 feet from my cousin and me, and were also observed by several other family members within about 100 feet.  One was my aunt, about 30 years old at the time and standing about 30 feet behind me - perhaps 60 feet from the craft.  She also saw them clearly as did two other, older cousins.  This occurred on my uncle&apos;s farm in northern California roughly 1965-66.  There were a number of animals nearby that reacted violently to the objects - especially one calf that was tethered and unable to run away. There was also a 3rd UFO nearby - but that one was roughly 30 feet in diameter and was seen only as the smaller ones flew directly away from us and the large craft joined in front of the smaller two.  It came from the side, from several hundred yards away when first noticed, and was seen only in silhouette against the afternoon sky.  The small ones, however, were so close we could see them _very_ well. They were gray and black, spinning about 30 RPM, exhibited the characteristic &quot;falling leaf&quot; motion when descending, and one discharged &quot;angel hair&quot; at it&apos;s lowest point (about 15-20 feet altitude).  No residue was seen later, and the material seemed to &quot;dissolve&quot; in the air while falling.  The objects made no sound. The small objects hovered in and around some eucalyptus trees about 30 feet from us and perhaps 20 feet in altitude - so we saw them both behind and in front of the trees giving a good visual &quot;fix&quot; of their size and position.  They never remained completely still, but made small movements in a jerky way constantly.  After about 3-4 minutes of watching them, they rose vertically to about 100 ft altitude and flew slowly directly away from us slowly ascending.  The larger craft flew in front of the smaller two, then all 3 flew rather slowly out of sight in a straight line, continuously ascending until they flew out of sight.  The total sighting lasted about 5 minutes - which seemed like a _very_ long time under the circumstances.  Unfortunately, no camera was available, for there was plenty of time to take photos. Other family members remembered a report being made to the Air Force and, perhaps, a small article in the local newspaper, but I do not remember the latter.  No one involved has had another sighting before or since, to the best of my knowledge.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Me, My sister and our friend wanted to go inside to get some marshmallows and hot dogs but we did not bring out a flashlight and I like to have a flashlight in the dark so we were going to the shed to get a flashlight the shed is only about 10 feet or so from the fire pit.  So we walked in got the flash light and walked out with me in front then our friend then my sister as i stepped out I saw two bright lights directly over us we could have reached up and touched it the shed is not that tall and it was probably at the same height as the top of the shed or a little below the top. I thought I was the only one who saw it but I found out different.  We were astounded at it.  It could not have been a plane or anything of that sort it made no sound it was completely silent and no plane is that small and no plane makes no sound and no plane could get that close. more mysterious is the lights were there for so short yet there was no sight of anything coming or leaving. just the lights. We wondered if my dad had seen this or anything he might have been able to tell us so we knew what it was.  He had seen nothing.  We all saw it. my dad didn&apos;t, yet he was only 10 feet or so away from us.

I took a second look and I saw two objects. One was two bright off white lights and the other was a object with many colors. When the lights would go dim I could see two orange lights. I stood on top of my car to see over the fence and just watched it for about 5 minutes and then decided I needed to go for the camera. I went in the house and got my camera and then saw it was moving farther away from me. It was right over Arizona City which is right next to Eloy. I know many people had to see it. I hopped in my SUV and chased it through the desert to get more close to it. I finally got on Batagglia road and chased it for about another 8 miles and caught up to it. I was going 80 MPH and so was the craft. It was located just up and to the left of me in the sky about 200 yards off the ground. I ran out of road and was forced onto a dirt road. I came across a group of horses that seemed to be rather alarmed becuase they were running really fast and sketchy. I drove for about a mile on the dirt road and stopped and opened up my sunroof. I proceeded to film the object in the sky. You can clearly see the orange lights and the spinning lights in the middle of the craft.

It was toward the of the end of summer as the days were beginning to get shorter. I remember playing in the front yard.  I lived in the Oaks. Its mostly mid-class families.  The sky was gray and somewhat cool as it gets in Texas towards the evening time.  I was on the corner of where our yard where we lived at Briar Oaks and well the cross street was Carter Creek, well it turns into Carter Creek at the Curb by the Royal Oaks Racket Club use to be.  I saw a Bright light hovering above our yard. It as I could tell somewhat oval shaped as the light resemble a floucent light color but much brighter.  I describe it as oval shape as that was how the light extended.  I watched it for- it felt like a long time probably between 10 to 15 min.  It didn&apos;t appear to be very high maybe 1 to 2 football fields high. I wanted to get a ladder and get a closer look.  After several minutes of watching it, I remember my neck hurting from staring into the sky for so long.  There was no sound and the craft was just hovering with No moment.  I remember running inside a telling my mom.  I ask if we had some binoculars to get a closer look.  She said &quot;No&quot; we didn&apos;t. I told her she had to come outside to see it.   Once back outside it was gone.  Later that night I remember telling my mom that we had to watch KBTX Channel 3 to see if anyone else saw it.  The weather man did say something.  I thought that was awesome.  He stated that several other people called in that night about a bright light in the sky.   He laughed, joking and said we all hope it was just a weather balloon with no real explanation.  I hope someone in that neighorhood who saw what I did will also post there experience that day.  I am very surpised with the number of calls the news recieved no one else has placed anything on this website.  I am currently 34 years old and been serving in the US Army for over 15 years.

When it turned to its side it had green and almost white lights, but they weren&apos;t flashing, or blinking, like some people describe it. The best way that I can describe it is that the lights were almost dancing in the air, they just flowed.

I started to panic, because it was just myself and my three year old daughter in the middle of the night, and sped up to get to the nearest public place.

At all the time we were looking at it bottom. We shouted to relatives inside the house to come and see it, but no one answered.

The jet was traveling from North to South. I noticed at the jet&apos;s 2 o&apos;clock position a small cirrus cloud. As I glanced at the cloud a small egg shape was travelling in front of the cloud. The shape was dark and the cloud sillouetted it well. The object was traveling North to South at about 10,000 ft. parallel to I-75. The object moved at a fast rate of speed. I was able to watch the object for about minute. It adjusted it trajectory slightly to the Southwest and I lost sight. One good comparison event happened as I watched the object: a bird flew in line of sight of the object for a second and I was able to compare and the object and bird was definately different. A minute or so after the object disappeared a small plane(single prop cessna-type) flew from the Southeast to North/Northwest at about 2500 ft. Very different shape also. At approximately 6:40, at near the same point in the sky.(At this time I was trying to compare what I saw to other planes) a flash of light caught my eye. The flash was the setting sun reflecting off a mettalic object. I caught sight of an object very similiar to the first. Approximately 10,000 ft, traveling to the North; parallel to I-75. Moving at a high rate of speed. The object slowed for a moment then sped up and I lost sight of it. I did not see anything else. Just to the Northeast is Robins Airforce Base and we see alot of jet traffic. I have seen f-15&apos;s and 16&apos;s and this was totally different from those aircraft.

It was insignificant but didn&apos;t seem to be a plane. I thought it might be a satellite. I asked my wife if it was a plane but we thought not since it was not a blinking light but just a slowly moving star. As we both studied it, the star made a perfect right angle turn toward the north and continued at the same slow speed for another 15 seconds and then made another 90 degree turn back towards the east. It moved at the same slow speed for a couple of seconds and then shot off in the same direction at incredible speed and disappeared over the horizon.

It is not attracted to nor does it repel a magnet 7. When accidentally dropped onto a hard wood floor from waist height it did not fracture 8. There is a concavity in the object which makes it resemble a miniature ash tray Clearly though it is not that.9. Conccavity has a shape that somewhat resembles a leaf of sorts, or possibly a ping pong paddle with a very short handle.10.Around the periphery of the leaf and bordering it is a beading that appears as a thin line 11.The object appears to have endured great heat and pressure. It is blackned and charred on its under surface and the blackness does not rub off.The object appears also to be distorted. Appears that extreme heat and pressure resulted in object beginning to melt and then to re-solidify into a distorted shape and losing some of its symmetry.12.There appears to be symbols inscribed on the periphery of the object. A coup couple - two or three- seem somewhat discernible, while others appear either        obliterated or severely marred by the heat and stress.13.I tried to photograph a drawing that I had made of the symbols and transfer them onto my computer.

At the &quot;tip&quot; of the concavity is a small hole about 2mm deep and 1 to 1.5 mm in diameter. It is horizontal and just below the lip of the concavity and in the midline. The hole is too perfectly round and too perfectly positioned to be an accident. Perhaps it is the female part of a attachment that would lock something into the concavity.

I had stepped out to get some fresh air by the &quot;smoke pit&quot; and looked towards the airfield (Approximately 1 mile) to see an amber sphere stationary between the airfield and myself.  As I work on aircraft it caught my attention. I initially thought it was the moon but with a haze. However, the moon hadn&apos;t been rising till much later and was not in that area of the sky. I then considered a blimp, but it made little sense due to the proximity to the airfield and the types of aircraft that fly over that portion of the base. I had about a minute to speculate when it appeared to fold in on itself (like 3 evenly spaced dark petals. It was night after all) and silently disapeared. At no point did I hear any sound. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t have another witness with me. It was a hand span above the horizon. It was as large as a full moon when on the horizon (when its size appears largest). The object was bright (but not glaring) and featureless. If it hadn&apos;t been for the way it disappeared I&apos;d have passed it off for my being unobservant of my surroundings. The following morning I looked to that region to see if I had missed some sot of tower or structure in that area but there was nothing to break the horizon. As for the way it folded; the &quot;petals&quot; were evenly spaced at 10,2, and 6 o&apos;clock. Also note the petals were unseen until it actually occured. It seemed very odd for me to see it as a perfect sphere and the fold to be so even for it to be a local military related event that I just happened to witness. These observations made me want to share this. Also, (since I marked aircraft were nearby) there are/ were aircraft taking off or landing on a 24 hour basis. I did not observe anything making inspection passes. This would prove difficult considering its proximity to the field and the period of time that I saw it.

I noticed a formation of lights suspended at what I estimated to be a couple hundred yards to a half mile off the ground, about 50~100 yards north of the highway. I no longer am positive about the exact pattern or number of lights, but what I do remember is either a cluster of three white lights forming a close triangular at what I took to be the tip of the triangle at the east, or else a single white light at the east--either way I took that to be the front of the craft. At what I took to be the rear--the west end--were a row of about five lights, lined north-to-south. They were not uniform in size or shape, that is, three or four were red, with one of these beings smaller than the others, and one other of these lights was white--I don&apos;t remember its relative size. Between these two &quot;ends&quot; of the object were other lights, reddish or even a little orange; two or three of them, a little smaller than most of the lights at the rear. As an electrician, I noticed that the quality or type of light emitted from all of these lights did not seem the least bit unearthly; they were certainly not flourescent, a little brighter than what one might expect from normal incandescent bulbs, more like the intensity and quality of shine that one sees with halogen lights. I was navigating the east-to-northeast curve in the highway while looking at this thing, trying to both stay in my lane and make out an outline of the object. I was not able to see a solid shape--just the pattern of the lights. I told my friend, sleeping in the passenger&apos;s seat, to look but he was groggy and not awake enough to understand until we were well past the spot. He did not see anything, and went back to sleep. I have seen airplanes fly parallel to I-40 on their way west to land at Will Rogers Airport. But (a) they fly much higher than the thing which I saw, (b) their lights flash, this&apos;s did not, (c) they speed past even at their higher altitudes fast enough to recognize their movement from my truck, this thing was clearly stationary, (d) the pattern and number of lights did not match what I am familiar with from conventional aircraft--for example, the two or three lights I saw in the middle were spread too far apart north-to-south for this craft to have had a standard airplane shape. (e) from the intensity of the light, it was clear that this thing was far lower than any airplanes. (Again, the lights were neither flashing nor moving, and I noticed dust particles floating through the lightbeams immediately below the sources of light.)  While I don&apos;t doubt that advanced civilizations may exist which could travel here from their own worlds, I also don&apos;t necessarily ascribe what I saw to otherworldly technology.

The dot moved too far south and I had to get out of the shade of the house, then the sun was too bright to see.At the time I didn&apos;t know who to tell.  I wasn&apos;t too good on the web at the time.", "Two red lights in formation buzz across tree tops then shoot straight up into the sky - It was increadible!I was walking outside from my sisters garage late dusk (getting dark) when I seen two (2) red lights to my left in formation, one in front of the other heading north accross the tree tops in a heavely wooded area which was only about 1 mile from where I was standing.  I first thought it was a military aircraft but knew it couldn&apos;t because I was in the USAF and seen them all!!!   I noticed there was no sound at all and realized something was strange - I felt paralyzed!  As both light&apos;s raced across the tree tops at about 200 mph, my sister asked &quot;what are you looking at&quot; then a second later, the red light in front shot straight up into the sky while the second light followed - A manuver I&apos;ll never forget.  It was incredible!", "Blimp shape with red marking or door on the side?A friend of mine and I were on an incredible bike ride through a somewhat busy street in the middle of the Presidio Park on our way to the Golden Gate Bridge.  At that moment I was riding by myself, no one around me and my friend ahead of me about 75 yards. The trees block your view of the bridge and water every now and then, but when the tree line opened up I took full advantage of my chance to get a nice view of the bridge and the bay while still riding.  At that moment I looked to my left to view the bridge and the surrounding hills across the bay, I then saw an object that is hard to explain.  At first I thought it was a coast guard helicopter but this object was round and floating still.  It was a blimp shape with a slight edge on each side forming kind of a saucer, but it was more blimp like in shape, definitely shiny metal.  The thing that stood out the most was a red marking of some type, looked like a red door on the side of it or something.  I was going really fast on the bike at that moment and the tree line blocked my view of it, yelling for my friend to stop, I explained to him that I had just saw something odd, we headed to a side road to get a view of where I saw it, he thinking I&apos;ve lost my mind at that moment, and me too, it was gone, of course! I&apos;m hoping someone has seen what I saw that day and reports something similar because it was floating about the same height as the top of the bridge, and was near the bridge on the east side.", "I saw a light in the sky that dissaperd then reapperd sevaral times emitng smaller blue particles.I was watching TV in the living room at about 12:30 AM.

The other one however was a what seemed to be a sort of cone shaped thing with one white light on the bottom and a strip of lights on the top part of it that would change colors from red, blue, green, and yellow.The plane flew near it and then the object changed direction and flew over me (west to east) until it was out of sight.The plane then flew in the opposite direction and then away from me (north).The strange object seemed to be much bigger than the plane.", "flashing lights saucer flying awayLast night me and my friend were walking home down merriman road and i look up and over to the left and i see flashes of light that looked like lightning flashes but there was no bolt or sound of thunder just flashes.

I am now 54 and I have never seen anything like that again.  I only wish someone else had observed it too.  I have told some people and received mixed reactions.  But this is the way it is, I know what I saw, and in my opinion,it was some type of alien aircraft.  I know we are not alone.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "While helping on paper rout, early morning, right orange globe went down off to my right.The first time I saw the large orange sphere I was with my son doing the Sunday morning paper route, which was very large.  The reason I remember the approximate date so well was when we got home I sat down to read the Sunday paper and there was a report of a John David Gosch that had disappeared while doing his paper route.  All that was left was his red wagon on the corner where he was last seen.  My son held two paper routes, both weekly and Sunday and since the weekly route was a small paper, he usually ran his weekly paper route with just the dog along.  When I read about the Gosch boy, my son never went on any paper route alone again. My son stopped and bent down to tie a shoe lace and as I turned to my right, this huge orange ball came from behind us, straight through the sky and gracefully went down somewhere behind one of the houses that Frank Lloyd Wright built.  I say gracefully because there was no sound, no tree tops blowing in the wind - it just floated straight and fast.  Naturally, by the time I grabbed my son by the back of his shirt and said &quot;did you see that&quot;.  He had missed the whole thing. The second time I didn&apos;t see the orange ball, but I know it was there. I was sitting out on my deck, actually I sleep outside all summer when it&apos;s not raining and is warm enough.  It was probably about 11:30 pm and I was still sitting up watching the stars, etc., when a light came over my deck.  Like a strobe light actually.  The back end of my deck, looking north is about four foot off of the ground and there is a railing around the deck.  This light hit the top of the back railing and moved down across my deck, up to and over me.  I was facing the light and was sitting back almost to the wall if my house so I could see the big dipper.  All of a sudden it was like I was in broad daylight.  I leaned forward and looked to both sides trying to see where the light was coming from.  I thought someone had put up some kind of new yard light or something.  As I looked around I saw that no else&rsquo;s back yard was lit up and the light was just around me.  It didn&rsquo;t even cover my whole deck.  After about 4-5 minutes the light crawled back across my deck and disappeared so I just forgot about it. The next night, Saturday at about the same time the light came back.  This time I got up out of my chair and went over to the back railing so I could look up over the house.  There was the big orange globe.  I was standing in daylight, literally, the light was so bright, but you couldn&rsquo;t see a stream of light coming from the globe.  There were no blinking lights or anything.  It was absolutely motionless.  I stood their staring at it for about 4 minutes, at least it seemed that long.  I did notice Mars behind and to the left of the globe.  It was much farther up and not nearly as large so I do know it wasn&rsquo;t Mars. It didn&rsquo;t seem to be perfectly smooth because I could see brownish (like indents) marks all over it.  There were no windows or anything and you couldn&rsquo;t see where the light was coming from.  I really had the feeling that I was being watched.  I live in a regular ranch style house and that thing was bigger than my house.  It&rsquo;s hard to judge distances but it looked like it was right on the other side of my house.  I remember getting a little aggravated because it didn&rsquo;t do any thing and I said &ldquo;for heaven&rsquo;s sake say something or come down here and say something&rdquo;.  Don&rsquo;t just sit there!  I went over to my chair to grab a cigarette and when I returned to watch it again, it was gone.  There was no sign of it.  Not shooting off through the sky &ndash; nothing.  Once again, no sound, no trees blowing in the breeze &ndash; just gone. When talking to my sister who still lives in Iowa, she said she had seen the orange globe almost two years earlier.  Now, I do have a huge imagination but my sister does not.  She said she was sitting outside on her back porch after dark and this bright globe looked like it came up out of the ground and rose just above the tree tops, then just sat there.  She went to get her husband to see and by the time she turned around it was gone. Note Characteristics:  I checked emitted beams because I was bathed in a circle of light, and The object landed because I know the first time I saw it - it went down but it&apos;s more like it went into the earth.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "I did not realize there was anything out there until I printed the photo.When I saw a new moon (merely a sliver) behind the bare branches of the tree, I decided to try and photograph it. I took three photos each slightly to the right of the first. When I printed the photos (digital camera) I was amazed to find what looked like a full moon. On closer inspection, I discovered two other less bright  circular objects. I still don&apos;t know what I captured on film. When I took the photo, I was so concentrating on the composition, and trying to capture the new moon behind the branches that I did not see anything else. It was not until I printed the photo that I discovered that there was something else.", "Triangle aircraft/UFO witnessed by pilot (ground observer) in Tallmadge OhioI was on the north side of the Tallmadge circle. The object was south of the circle, a few degrees above the horizon. I did lose sight of it a few times due to vacinity to trees (on the circle itself). I know it is difficult, even for proffesionals, to judge shape, distance, altitude, and speed of moving objects from the ground, but I will make my best guess. The craft itself appeared to be the size of a commercial airline transport. It appeared to be low and slow, I would guess 2000&apos;MSL and under 100KTS. The craft originated from the south west travelling north east. When it was due south of the circle, it vectored to its right, now heading south east. It travelled in this direction until obscured from sight by buildings and other ground clutter.During its turn to the south east, the craft appeared to bank much the way a conventional aircraft would. Initially, I saw the craft from almost head on. It appeared to be a large aircraft with several landing lihghts (very bright, white lights, facing forward). During its turn and bank, I could see its underside. The ventral surface seemed to have a large white light at its tip, and two more aft of the nose. The second two were very far apart laterally, and appeared to be at the tail end of the craft, implying a delta or flying-wing shape. In the middle was another white light. There also appeared to be standard aviation anti-collision (strobe) lights about half way between the nose and tail, but no position (colored) lights, nor a red beacon. I was standing outside, and the craft did not make any noise that I could hear over the sound of traffic. I would have suspected a jet powered aircraft in that proximity, but with exhaust facing away from me, to at least make the tell tale turbine &quot;whine&quot; A reciprocating engine aircraft of that size in that proximity would have made the ground shake.", "Object moved fast back and forth but aslo stayed still at times sometimes changingt colors.Object moving across moon.

Had a blue tint changing to orange to white.", "Beams of light with an extremely slow pulse to it, seen over vast desert and only seemingly visible through NVGs, with a bright glowDates and Times are approximate  Myself and another Marine were on post on the North side of our base.  The base is on a plateau overlooking several small towns and a few other small Forward Operating Bases.  Looking out to the northeast, (where we have seen many other sightings as another I described earlier), I noticed several small beams of light barely noticeable by the naked eye.  We are aware of what military/insurgent operations in the area and what types of signs might be present.  Looking the night vision and heat sensitive optics, we could see them.  With the heat-sensitive optics, not as much. Myself and the fellow Marine tried to shrug it off as just lights placed by locals or even coalition forces that perhaps we were not aware of.  But through night vision, the beams appeared to go up to an extremely high altitude, and near the base had a glow, as noted vaguely through heat-sensitive optics.  There were two-four beams at any given time over the early hours of the morning.  As we had to stay aware of base security, we couldn&apos;t focus completely on these but they were intriguing.  I&apos;m not placing the fact there could be a largely logical reason for these, but it felt weird, and the beams of light had weird characteristics.  This was months ago and I have just found this site, and it&apos;s hard to recall all the details, but I do know that they faded sometimes, and would come back brightly at times.  This was only really visible through night vision equipment.  And the areas that the beam on the ground was focused gave off heat and a bright glow, and was in areas not completely populated. The area is not like Baghdad, it is mainly vast desert and spotted farmlands and towns.  This was very bizarre to me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I never saw the shape of the object, but I did see the shape of the light coming from it.  It had a brightly lit front nose that was followed by a conical white light body.  It disappeared and reappeared x 3, but the jet stream remained behind it. At one point it burst into bright fireball light and disappeared, but reappeared again.  I woke my husband and son to see it.  By the time my son woke up there was only the wide spiraling jet stream. Mu husband saw the light object.  It reminded me of a comet, but appeared to be traveling parallel to the earth&apos;s surface and not toward it. It did not appear to be getting closer to the ground when it disappeared.  It also reminded me of the space shuttle and one was launched Dec. 9. .  I also read that the military launched a new stealth jet yesterday.

We left the BP Gas station near the intersection of US HWY 10 and Jamaica Ave S in Cottage Grove, MN At approx 1830 hrs. We were headed NW direction on US HWY 10 from Cottage Grove, MN towards St. Paul, MN. As we were driving past the exit for 80th St and US Hwy 10 the sky above the refinery became visible. The sky was overcast, dark and a fine mist was in the air, the temperature was above freezing, perhaps in the low 40s. My daughter Kourtney (14) and I (34-M) were in the front seat while my son Chris (12) was in the back of our Durango SUV. My daughter and I could see a distinct Green Light that appeared to be sourced within the clouds or a bit below, shining down, and flashing as if taking pictures. The light was a dull Green color that repeatedly flashed sometimes from slightly different positions over the Marathon refinery. This green beam was a dull color that did not reveal its source. We could see only the hint of a shadow with no definete outline. The mist helped to show the definete beam shape ( like  a spotlight) as it aimed for the ground. As each flash of the light occured, the vapor that was in the &quot;beam&quot; during the flash became charged and glowed like an Ionized gas. These towers or columns of light (possibly ionized gas or mist)remained much brighter than the source that appeared to be creating them. In the three to four minutes that it takes to drive towards the refinery we saw perhaps ten to fifteen formed. As we got closer to the refinery the columns of light/ gas floated away from the refinery in an eastern direction at the wind speed. I would estimate this to be about fifteen to twenty miles an hour with a lower elevation of approximately 1500 feet and a terminal elevation of 2000 feet. they were that tall... Also the lights seemed to be overpowered by the refineries bright tower lights. as our eyes adjusted to the brightness, it became harder to see. I doubt anyone at the refinery would have noticed these at all.  There were no spotlights at the refinery either, which  I looked for as some kind of explanation. As we passed the refinery, they seemed to disappear. I continued to my destination (near downtown St. Paul) and spotted the lights forming again on my return. This time the green light seemed to be a pale white or yellow light (like a sodium lamp color) but still the columns of gas/mist would form and glow and float away from the refinery, for miles!

I was alone so I returned home and picked up my wife (36) my step daughter (16) and my friend Mike (38) and we returned to as parking lot in Newport, MN (across the highway from the refinery) and watched these lights form repeatedly.

This peak of activity occured around 2010-2030 hours with all of us witnessing these columnsof light. A few columns appeared over the inver grove heights river valley, and some of these &quot;stragglers&quot; flew directly over our head at this time. They looked like florescent lightbulbs- sort of. We listened with the windows open and did not hear a sound coming from the sky. by 2040 hours, the lights were gone and most of the columns had blown away with the wind.

The plane was a Boeing 757 and I was sitting in Row 15 seat F. I noticed a bright orange glow on a cloud which must have been at least 10 miles away. The sky was clear above the scattered cumulous which reached up to about 1000ft below our altitude. I do not remember seeing  the moon. At first I thought it was just inner cloud lightning but thought this was odd because of the bright orange color. As I continued to watch I saw an intense bright orange sphere of light which was smaller than the size of a pea from that distance. The sphere hung in the air and did not climb or decend and remained at about 10 miles. The object lit up the cloud behind it with a bright orange glow similer to athe glow achieved by a fireplace. It was orange. The object remained very bright. Almost laser bright. I spoke to the lady sitting next to me in seat 15D and asked her if she could see the same thing. She agreed. She could not guess what it could be. We both watched as the object remained and we moved Eastward. We watched for at least 5 to 7 minutes.

I was walking my dogs back home and when I got to the front porch, I happened to look at the sky and saw a bright light just streak across the sky and then go out. The light looked light blue, but probably looked that color against the black sky.  It was very bright but did not light up the sky, more like a skylight would look or one of those white light flashlights. It lasted only seconds and streaked across the sky, so I knew it wasn&apos;t an airplane or helicopter. I can&apos;t say what it looked like, since there was no real shape I could see in that short time frame.  It was just weird.

On Wed. Dec 13 2006 at exactly 19:35 Eastern, I was driving South on I-65 at mile-marker 71 near Columbus, IN. to the West/South-West at approximate 30 degree angle from ground and at what I estimate to be 5 to 7 miles out, I witnessed an object in the night sky. The sky was dark with a slight backlit auburn haze and distant low cloud blanket and even further out clear sky. The Object was diamond shaped with 8 light formations on what I beleive to be the belly of Craft.The Craft was a vague silloette to my eyes. The Ligh Formations on the Craft were a yellowish-white color and 8 in numbr. each of the eight light formations were composed of two rectangular segments of equal size forming a 45 degree angle pointing towards apparent front of craft. (examp. &gt;). The 8 formations of lights were arranged in perfect geometry to the shape of the Craft. example:      ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ The individual light formations seemed to intensify while object was stationary and as light intensified, The Object began to move upwards at a 45 degree angle to the Left of It&apos;s position. The Object suddenly faded from sight as it accelerated.The Object appeared to be the size of, or larger than; a Lockheed C-5A transport plane.In my estimation, the lights did not appear to be flaming or fuel burning outlets or exhaust ports however, My gut feeling was that they had some sort of propulsion function. The Object never reappeared to my view. Now, the other part of this event was; at the moment I assumed the object had &quot;disappeared&quot;:I witnessed directly South and Approx. 30 to 35 thousand feet up at a distance from Me of est. 5-8 miles out, Two Fighter Planes rapidly pursuing a path towards the tradjectory of the craft&apos;s distant path. My reasoning that the 2 aircraft &quot;in pursuit&quot; were Fighter Jets was 1.) their speed and altitude 2.) the marker beacons on each aircraft.(one strobing white and blue marker light on each jet.) Looking at a Road Atlas later on, I noted an Airport exactly West of my position at 20 miles.(Bloomington, IN). I also know of Louisville,KY&apos;s airport/A.N.G. base to South.  I have lived near Air Force Bases and am certain that no aircraft built in U.S. have been made public knowledge, of this nature.I can accept that this craft could be Man-made or of Extraterrestrial nature. I also theorize that It could be visable by some while not visable to other Humans.P.S.

My girlfriend and I were traveling on US Rt. 50 heading east from Parkersburg to Clarksburg.  We were passing through (around) Salem when I noticed a large triangular-shaped object in the sky just above the horizon.  At first I thought it was an oil-rig on top of the ridge (a common sighting in WV), or a cell phone tower, but I had made that particular drive hundreds of times and felt as if something was unusual, so I dismissed both of those notions.  I woke my girlfriend and asked her if she recognized the object in front of us; she didn&apos;t.  The object was vertical, at first, with bright red lights in each corner.  Immediately after waking my girlfriend an extremely bright white light came on in the middle of the object, seemed to make a sweeping motion, and eventually &quot;highlighted&quot; us for a brief period of time.  This made both of us nervous, but not particularly scared.  I had to look down at the road and when I looked back up it was floating horizontally above us.  When I looked down at the road again and back up it had disappeared.  The object never seemed to move while I was looking at it, nor did it make any sounds.  I originally thought it was a helicopter but dimissed the notion when I realized it had to have been within 100ft. of us and not making any sound whatsoever. Both my girlfriend and I were fascinated with the unusual sighting and had thought about calling the regional airport in Clarksburg to see if there were any aircraft in the area at the time.  We never did and never really talked about it the remainder of the time we dated. I probably wouldn&apos;t have really thought about it much more until I watched a UFO special on TV sometime in 2001.  They were discussing a case and had an artist&apos;s rendering and animation of the exact same object that I had seen.  Since then I&apos;ve told the story to some people, always siting what I saw on the television special.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Almost felt like something was coming into our dimension via this burst of lights.  Just my thoughts at the time I remember.  I then looked back to were I started to see these blinking lights, and was startled to see higher up in the sky, and coming what looked like straight down, a V shape, only because  the lights were placed in this V formation--It then went from a downward flight pattern towards the tree tops to then bank and take a path of again North to South over the trees--Again I watched in amazement as it moved with not a single sound that I could hear.

And it didn&apos;t leave a residue trail like something that large would leave. It fell from (roughly) south to north at a steep angle maybe a couple of thousand feet, nowhere near tens of thousands, or from orbit. All this happened very fast and I would have discounted it as a meteor except that right before it disappeared from my sight into the trees or whatever it landed in, a really bright tinier flash of green emanated from it and it looked like it actually slowed down. I observed no impact sound, vibration, or light.After that I kept looking at the sky around my car. I noticed a few minuted later that heading from my north and east was a craft that could have been an airplane--it looked like it was up there a few thousand feet and it wasn&apos;t flying erratically or extremely fast. What caused me to pay attention to this craft, though, was that its &quot;headlight&quot; (white) was blinking in a signal pattern I&apos;ve not seen airplanes use. As it flew above me I observed that the placement of the port and starboard lights as compared to airplanes I&apos;ve seen was... well that thing either had really short wings or it was triangular in shape.

PD))", "Unidentified objects witnessed by hundreds over Fort Smith ArkansasIt was just after dusk on an August evening in 1967.  The A.M. station that my sister and I listened to began to report lights in the skies over Fort Smith.  Of course I immediately ran out into the yard to see for myself.  Huge oak trees largely blocked the view and after a few minutes of surveying the patches of sky overhead I gave up.  The reports continued to pour in and the disc jockey was at a fever pitch. I summoned my dad who listened for while, then I remember him laughing and saying that the station was playing a joke.  At some point he began to take the reports somewhat seriously and we climbed into his &rsquo;46 Plymouth and drove to a remote area known as Wild Cat Mountain Lake. It was wide open and afforded as much of a horizon-to-horizon view as anywhere in the Fort Smith area.  We sat on the hood for a long time until I bored and climbed back in the car.  Almost immediately I heard my dad shout something and scampering back out found him pointing at two white lights moving slowly across the sky from east to west.  They weren&rsquo;t very bright and if they had not have been moving, would have easily blended in with the stars.  They were traveling side by side, about two fingers apart at arm&rsquo;s length.   When they were almost directly overhead they suddenly made opposite 90-degree turns and quickly accelerated out of sight.  Shortly after, a solitary light, much brighter, tracked across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed.  It took probably less than 15 seconds to traverse the sky from the east to the west horizon.  We sped back home to find several of our neighbors in lawn chairs &ndash; in the street!  The next three to four hours we watched an amazing display.  As time went on the lights came in at lower altitudes and glowed the spectrum from white to orange, with the intensity (brightness) increasing as they became more orange. As I recall, they would glow brightest when hovering. At their closest and brightest, they were perhaps one-third the size of a full moon.  I can&rsquo;t estimate the! altitud e, but at one point I did contemplate fetching my BB gun and taking a pot shot.  So, bad idea aside they did come in very low. They would fly in formations of two or three, stop suddenly, hover, make impossible turns, and accelerate out of sight in seconds.  It was almost as though it were choreographed for the benefit of the crowd below. At one point when a single object hovered directly overhead, I was able to observe it at length through a powerful pair of binoculars offered by a neighbor.  It was more or less triangular shaped, not sharply, but more like a guitar pick.  I&rsquo;ve heard descriptions of spheres and chevrons being seen that night, but that was not what I was looking at.  If those other accounts are accurate then there was either more than one type of object or the shape was not static. This thing appeared to glow from within, like an old Christmas tree light bulb and there was some sort of structure resembling a grid or a checkerboard on the underside.  At least one television station and a radio station were broadcasting live from the parking lot of the Coca-Cola bottling plant, less than a mile west of the Fort Smith airport which shares a common runway with the 188th Fighter Wing, known at the time as the 188th Tactical Reconnaissance Group.  Both the airport and the air guard are in virtual line of sight of the parking lot and it was thought curious that no jets were scrambled during that evening, more so as antidotal evidence surfaced in the following days that the objects had been painted on radar.  Someone had a transistor radio out on the street that night and we could hear the crowd reacting on the live broadcast as the objects &ldquo;performed&rdquo; so we could be certain that we were seeing the same objects as those at the bottling plant parking lot, which was approximately 2 miles from our location.  The next morning the Southwest Times Record ran a front-page story on the sightings, complete with a low-resolution jerky black and white time exposure that to this day still ranks as the worst! UFO pho to I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  Needless to say, the town and the media were abuzz. A couple of days later the Air Force out of Little Rock released a statement, to the amusement of those who had not seen the objects, explaining away the entire incident as swamp gas.  There are two things I can say with certainty about the objects I witnessed:  1) They were solid objects, not gaseous and 2) They were controlled (flying in formation, etc).   The speed and maneuverability that these objects soundlessly displayed, is still exponentially greater than any technology even today, almost 40 years later.  I would love to hear from others that were witness to the phenomenon that night in 1967.  My dad, the neighbor with the binoculars and I&rsquo;m sure many others are no longer with us.  Let&rsquo;s not let this story die as well.  I&apos;m guessing at the date based upon other reports, so if you are certain of the exact date please post.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was saucer shape with the center of it like a dome on top of the aircraft. The disk area did not appear to be very thick yet much, much bigger than the dome area. It was big, about 2/3  the length of a 747 but round. It was pretty low, about the height of a five story building. I would not necessarily use the word &apos;metallic&apos; to describe the material of its exterior, neither was it plastic: it was something else, like maybe a combination of materials. It did not make any noise nor was it showing any lights. Neither was it blowing any air out very strongly as it was near some very tall trees and the branches were not moving.  It seemed powerful, it hovered there with precision. We could all see it from the balcony; we were a block away from it. Then, as if they/it realized that we could see it, the grayish black color of its exterior which made it visible in the darkness in a matter of seconds began to turn black and well it was as if it was emitting black light around itself to camouflage itself at the same time it started to move up slowly. Then it completely disappeared. We went outside where it had been and we tried to see if we could still see it in spite of its camouflage by perhaps seeing that it was covering a part of the sky. But, no, it had completely disappeared from sight. That was some impressive technology. Why Moca? There is absolutely nothing of interest happening there. Perhaps worth mentioning, however, is that the previous year for the first time in the history of the region an international airport was inaugurated at the town&apos;s border with Santiago. The craft sited however does not appear to need an airport to take off and land. It could just go up and down. The other possible thing that could be of interest is that a 6.7 earthquake had just occurred - a couple of weeks prior to the sighting. I saw what I saw. I did see an unidentified flying object. I hope this information helps someone, someday.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

But my sister made me do it (write this).  This is a second time this object has been seen.  I would describe it as a 2 x 4 (board) shape about 3-4 feet tall and yellow. Coming home late (on the first siting) one night, pulling into the drive way, I see this thing in my back yard.  I just drove into the yard (I live in the country on large acreage).  It darted back and forth, with no legs or arms just floating off the ground. I couldn&apos;t keep up with it in my pick up, it was to fast. I called my sister hoping she wouldn&apos;t think I was crazy but, I just needed to tell someone.  All I know is I was a pretty freaked out man.  Then having almost forgotten about it 4 months later...my fiance calls me and tells me of what she encountered on her way to work yesterday.  Seeing something a ways down the road in front of her was this same type of thing.   As she was crying telling me about it, that it was yellow and in the shape of a 2x4 board about the height of her small SUV.  She thought she was going to hit it as it floated (kinda hovered) into the middle of the road.  She said it like vaporized as her car passed threw it. My fiance is an ((deleted--professional)) and to her everything is either black or white (there is no gray area)   Please tell me someone else has really seen this type of thing!", "Midway airport area, sphere or disc hovering and then accelerating rapidlyAt approx 9:30 a.m., I was driving northbound (inbound to Chicago) on Hwy 55, The Stevenson Expressway, approaching the Harlem Ave exit ramp.  In the sky, perhaps at a 45 degree angle or so from me and apparently at least 1000 feet up or so, I noticed an object.  I would estimate it&apos;s location as being directly above the area of 54th Street and Oak Park Avenue, possibly somewhat farther east-southeast.  I noted that it was black and round, not much larger than a BB at arm&rsquo;s length.  My first thought was that I was looking at a bird or an airplane end-on, but it quickly became obvious that it was neither.  There was a solid gray cloud cover, the shape of the object was starkly visible, and wings if they existed would be clearly seen.  No plane would be ascending towards or descending away from nearby Midway Airport (about two miles east-southesast of there)so steeply at that altitude.By now I had viewed the object hovering in the sky for about five seconds.  Suddenly it bolted, at a bit of an angle right-to-left, headed roughly eastbound and upward, toward the clouds.  The black circle rapidly shrank into a pinpoint dot and disappeared into the clouds, clearly moving upward and away very fast.  It took less than two seconds for it to accelerate out of sight.  I did not see a hole in the clouds where it entered the solid cloud ceiling.  My impression was that it was disc-shaped because of the flat appearance of the black (no shading at the edges like you&apos;d see with a sphere).The only reason I saw this object is that I had a shocking daylight sighting of a large craft back on November 9, and since then I&rsquo;ve been scanning the skies every chance I get, hoping to see another UFO, which amazingly enough I did.  These two sightings were very different, however.Truthfully, I&rsquo;ve been reluctant to post this sighting, as I&rsquo;ve been discouraged since my previous experience.  Since I was alone at the time, and I&apos;m not a pilot or a police officer, it seems that I might not be qualified enough to report that a gigantic, very clearly defined black rectangle which I observed at length, slowly flying in high-visibility conditions before it camouflaged itself, is not a &ldquo;weather phenomenon&rdquo; or some other nonsense like that.  Even though I&rsquo;m in my 40s, a stable family man with a science degree, that&rsquo;s lived in the Chicago area with it&apos;s teeming air traffic basically my whole life, to boot.  Worse still, you feel you can&rsquo;t discuss it with anybody, because even your closest friends or family members will think you&rsquo;re a nut case or want to come up with some ridiculous debunking.  If I had gotten photographs, those either wouldn&rsquo;t have been good enough, or they would have been too good, i.e. fake.  So the whole process of seeing and reporting a sighting is really very frustrating, even though I&rsquo;m joined by tens of thousands of other witnesses.", "Military or Extraterrestrial?The object was coming from the south going north in at a slow rate.  At first I thought it was a helicopter before it was so bright.  As it went directly over head I noticed that it did not make any sound.  The object was triangular in shape and was the whole object was intensly bright white with a red light underneath.  The red light did not blink.  The red light was located closer to the front of the triangle but not at the tip.  It was incredible.  I didn&apos;t tell anyone because I figured no one would believe me anyway.  I know what I saw, I just don&apos;t know if it was military or extraterrestrial.  I have encountered a couple of sightings in the past. For example a white ball of light hovering in the distance and then disappearing, but I never thought much of it.

It got very hot at night and we used to sleep every night in tents in the back yard to stay cool. We were sitting beside our tent and I looked up at the stars as I always loved to look at them. There was a red star that caught my eye and all of a sudden, a red light about the same size of the star came from it and moved at least 5 time faster across the sky than any plane I ever saw to this day. I ran in the house to tell my grandmother about it. She came out within seconds and it had already reached the other side of the house. We were all in awe over this and then all of a sudden there were many of these lights all looking like they were coming from every star in the sky. It was really weird because they all looked like they were the same color of the twinkling star they came from. This was definately not a meteor shower. I watch them every chance I can. All the lights moved from one end of the sky to the other crossing each others path as if they were just missing each other. They never left a trail and just looked like stars moving across the sky. The lights never went out and it lasted at least a half hour. They never blinked like the stars they seemed to have came from. It kind of freak my other family members and after a small amount of time they would not even admit it happened. There was a write-up in the paper shortly after that, that many people had saw the same thing. I can&apos;t remember exactly what the article said but I know they didn&apos;t have and explaination of what they were. After awhile they started to get dimmer until they all disappeared.

I saw about 15 bright purple lights moving very fast from the east to west. I guess maybe 600 mph. They were very high, just below the clouds and were in &quot;c&quot; formation for about 5 seconds. Then they made u turn and flew right over me. I expected hear a noise like a sonic boom or some thing but there was no sound. And when they turned around, they seemed to change formation at the same time and they seemed to merge together into one large bright light. This light seemed to change colors very rapidly. But as soon as they merged, they broke off into about 20 lights. They all turned to back to the original color purple when they lined up side by side. All that happened in about 5 seconds before they were suddenly engulfed by a bright blue light that came out of no where and the light slowly faded. It was completly gone after about a minute and the lights had gone with it. But the area in the clouds where they had been looked like it was glowing a purple-green color and looked like it was radiating some kind of plasma. But it only lasted a few seconds. I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it but I was the only one who had seen it. I drew a sequnce of pictures that depicted what I saw. I was to nervous to tell anyone about till now.

I went out on our back deck facing west.  It was dark outside and I observed a stationary 4 window bright luminous light barely above the tree line over the woods behind our house.  It was fairly close to our house and silent.  I&apos;m not sure how far away it was because I&apos;m not sure how big it was in perspective.I immediately ran up stairs where my wife was to have her see it out of the upstairs window but the lights were gone.  While looking out of our upstairs window, we were shocked at what we were seeing.  We cranked open our casement window and observed 15 or more luminous craft moving in every direction a distance away.  Some even flew high over our house then disappeared.  The sky was very clear out back of our house.  The craft were silent until one would completely stop high in the air and then it would start to glow with what looked like fire and it growed in size and roared like the sound of a very loud jet engine. It would take about 3 seconds for the sound to reach us.  While the craft was stationary and glowing with fire, a luminous &quot;pod&quot; dropped off out the left side toward the ground.  We witnessed this exact thing 4 times during the 20 minutes or so that we watched them.  I estimated them to be about 2 miles away.  I called our local police department twice to report this event but I think they thought I was nuts.  I am a business person in our city and afterwards I wished I hadn&apos;t called them. They said they would send a cruiser out that way.  To summerize what I said in the beginning of this report is I believe the very loud stationary jet roar above my house was one of those craft that became stationary with stabilizing rocket engines and dropped the luminous 4 window &quot;pod&quot; out back of my house that started the whole incident of us witnessing all of this.  After 20 minutes or so, the dark sky became empty of craft and all was quiet.  We are both still nervous over what we saw.", "Scary and very trueThis happend awile back . Me and my family were having a fire outside and were injoying the night sky when we heard a loud sound in the distance . It shook the ground it was a not a loud sound but a low roar like thunder. We stood there a looking up to the sky for any sighn of lightning but it wasnt even cloudy . A few moments later the sound came again this time louder and with bright grey lights . The sound shook the ground so hard that you could feel it in your head . We realized that the sound could not be thunder of any kind . We could not see through the trees where the gray light was coming from.  On the oppisite side of the tree line was a large cattle field.  We all figured thats where the light were coming from . We have one old woman that lives down the road and she does not make any noise  so it couldnt have been a neighbor it was to loud and to powerful for a machine or anything of that nature . We all kind of started to worry so we went in the house after the second time we saw it . As soon as we got in we felt the low roar and felt the floors in the house shake . I was standing by the window and it shook the house so hard a picture fell off the wall .  Again the lights were very bright and could be seen over the tree line and throught the windows of my home . The tree line was a ways off from my house so it was unbeleavible that something that far away could make enough energy to shake the walls and be as bright as it was . You could hear the cattle running behind the house to apparently get away from whatever was out there . We considered calling the local police but did not because we thought it would be made fun of . This contiuned for another 30 mins or so then stopped . It would light the woods up like the middle of the day and shake the house and suddenly stop then do it again . This went on for about an hour . I went out to see if i could find anything the next day but i found nothing . For nothing to be there was suprising because something was in the field that nigh! t . After that night i have contiued to see strange lights in the woods but no sounds . It always happens in the colder months for some reason . I havent asked my close neighbor about that night or if she ever see&apos;s lights or sounds coming from the woods but she never asked me so i suppose she was asleep that night Plus i dont want to worry her she lives alone and im sure it would scare her .

Investigation by air traffic controller .At the time of the sighting I was 26 and my friend was 30 years old . I was a plumbing contractor and my friend was a tile contractor . I was a native of Tulare county and my friend is a former British citizen , living in Tulare county . We were experienced backpackers and were camping and fishing at Eagle Lake above Mineral King Valley . From morning until that evening we could hear an electric pulsating noise coming from a gorge on the south side of Eagle Mountain.  We could tell that  the sound was moving through the area , but we could not see anything .  At 5:30pm that evening , as we were cooking dinner, we heard a much louder pulsating noise coming from Eagle Pass.  We both looked at the Eagle Pass and to our amasement saw a saucer shaped craft with a diameter the size of the opening of the pass,  probably 75-100 ft.  It was the color and skin texture of a grey whale and had 6 - 30&quot; or larger diameter differing colored lights, all spaced evenly across the side of the craft.  The circular, flush mounted lights were all flashing sequencially with all of the color specrtum . We aimed our Magnalite torch and flashed the light on and off with the craft flashing it&apos;s colored lights . We were both frozen with fear that this did not look or behave like anything that we have ever seen . The craft hovered for what seemed like 7 seconds and then reversed it&apos;s travel and disapeared behind the Eagle Pass , eminating it&apos;s pulsating sound for about 45 more minutes . We did not hear or see it again during our duration of our backpacking trip . I have been on this 8,000ft.+ elevation pass many times and it is very dangerous for any flying craft to move across . I had a friend at that time who was a senior air traffic controller at Lemoore Naval Air Base . I told him about the sighting event and gave him a map of Eagle Pass with date and time . He was able to access not only the Lemoore Air Base computer , but also Edwards Air Base computer as well , which is on the east side of Mineral King Nation! al Park He said that there was no activity involving civilian , military or experimental aircraft in that area at that time or for that matter that week . He added that the area is off limits for military aircraft becuase of numerous wrecks at that same location . There are too many strong downdrafts with San Joaquin Valley air moving to the east , over Owens Valley . He said that if a military pilot was known to fly there , he would be  suspended from flying . He also said that there is no known earthly aircraft with 36&quot; diameter flashing colored lights and that the craft was not of this world .  He also added that he has alerted the air force numerous times after seeing on radar large ufo crafts . He mentioned that after seeing f-18 air squadrans chase the large craft on the radar at full speed without catching up and then the craft disappears off the radar screen . He is a believer in ufos now . He said that he would speak to the pilots afterwards about the chase and would hear that the ufo was sighted in front of the chase , but they could not keep up , at that rate of speed , and it would finally disappear in front of their eyes .

The large round lighted mist is gone and now, A starburst!My friend and I had split up and were settling in for the moring deer hunt. He was probably a half mile from me and saw the entire happenings.As I had walked to my position where I was going to sit and wait for Whitetail deer (about 50 yards from a large wood line in a picked soybean field) I looked over at a beautiful red horizon where the sun was going to be rising soon, As I looked I saw what appeared to be jet contrails coming from almost directly from where the sun was about to rise. For a split second I didn&apos;t think a thing about it but just as quick I thought it was strangely low in the horizon to be contrails. Now the contrail seems to moving very fast and right at my frined and myself. Suddeny the contrails stopped and now I could see one very bright light. This light, now no longer producing contrails seemed to be at a very high rate of speed and was still heading right at us.the next thing that happend really shocked me. I continued to watch and suddenly the light stops. Not right over top of me but still out in front  of me and was now lower than at any other point. My guess would be 500 to 700 feet. Just as it stopped the single light seemed to begin growing. The light grew and it wasn&apos;t just light but a mist or fog seemd to growing within this ever expanding light. It still was not moving. In much less than 1 second, the misty light or large circle of light disappeared and once again it was just this single light hovering. Then in another split second the single light turned into a larger starburst light! Now the object is moving slowly to my left (North) But it may not have been moving directly left as it didn&apos;t get smaller in size or seem farther away as you would expect an oject to do as it moved along to my left. I thought it may have actually been moving to my left and slightly forward.I conituned to watch it and just then my phone, which is set on vibrate, begins to do so. I answered it and it was my buddy asking me if I was watching this too. I said of course. As we were talking about the events we just saw the light seemed to be fading away. But not really fading as if it was moving away and becoming faint.This was not the case at all. It was simply disappearing. It looked as if was slipping behind a curtain. It started to disappera on the Sunburst right side and continue to move towards that side until the whole thing was gone.Someone may think it was cloud it slipped behing. Nope....There wasn&apos;t a cloud in the sky on this beautiful Saturday morning. It was crystal clear with thousands of stars out. This thing just slipped away into thin air!

This couldn&apos;t have been the movement of any aircraft I have ever seen. I think We certainly would&apos;ve heard some prop or jet sounds.

It caught my attention as I drove up a small hill, it was far too low in the sky and travelling very slowly, almost hovering above an urban space.  I feared it would crash.  The craft is a stream-lined oval shape from the side viewed it from. The front was pointed, not a sharp point, but slightly rounded.(I assume it was the front from the direction it was traveling). I don&apos;t esactly recall what the back looked like, although I think it was similar to the front - there was no tail.  The wings were not the usual shape of a plane, they were a sort of semi-circular shape, they were short and wide and close to the craft. There was no other colour or letters on the craft, no windows, no lights and no noise. I tried to keep it in my vision, but couldn&apos;t contstantly watch the sky as I was driving, the craft was moving (though very slowly) and my view quickly became obstructed by trees.  I feared when I reached the corner at the top of the hill (about 1/2 a block)it would have crashed, as no plane could fly so low or slowly and stay in the sky.  However when I got to the corner it was gone and there was no crash.  This all happened within seconds and it took a few seconds to realize that this was not a usual aircraft.  I was quite shaken by the experience and kept watching the sky, wanting to see it again - to know what it was.

It might have been about 100 feet under the jet.  It was very shiny, and did not have any wings.  It was simply a sphere.  It looked like it kept a constant distance from the jet.

Out of the bottom (which I could not see) came out 2 different color ( I thought) plasmas one gold or copper and one green around the edges of the plasmas (big blob shape) were looked like roots of trees on both blobs I could see thru each of them they pulsated in opposite resonances for approx 1 minute then stopped the disk shot away at remarkable speed at the 45 degree angle (in the blink of an eye)  Since I was 12 yrs old grew up on a farm I had no idea what that thing was nor did I know what a space ship was, but that has stuck in my mind for years  I have since discovered that the green plasma ( I thought) was in fact the same as happens at the north pole with the lights   a photon or free eletron is traveling and come in contact with a strong magnetic fields flux line and is speeded up and becomes a fast photon or electron and hits an oxygen atom and gives up a green color which is visiable   the copper color I have not figured out yet but must be a secondary electron transfer  since I suppose the ship was charging itself someway.

It&rsquo;s 1997 now, but in 1994, an incident occurred. This has been occurring to me lately, I saw a, lets say, UFO. Im from Dayton, OH, but I was in Fairborn, OH, this particular day It was around 12:00 noon, full daylight, little clouds in the sky..  I walked out outside of a apartment complex, mind you id been up since about 9:00 am, as soon as I get outside, I noticed a round, rather large object sitting in the high air, hovering.  A friend was with me but I was so attached to the object in the sky, I wasn&rsquo;t able to say anything to him till it was all over.  I continued walking and starring, after about 8-10 seconds the object ascended, or rather departed farther into the sky.  Estimating another 5-7 seconds to depart. Now this is the reason why I believed what I saw.  Not only a full beautiful day of sunlight, hardly a cloud in the sky, but... As the object departed, whatever part of the sky this is actually visible, (I&rsquo;m not sure if our own space shuttle does this, I could be wrong, but I don&rsquo;t think so) I noticed I could see a distortion around the object.  Simply I could see black around the departing object, rather the distortion allowed me to see, without the blue sky, right into space, or rather the point of leaving the atmosphere allowed the, or didn&rsquo;t allow light as normal.  I cant really explain, but my brain, or rather I would have never have thought of that occurring. The process that took place I&rsquo;ve never considered.  I believe what I saw only because of the sunny day, perfect vision, not really, the distortion around the object as it departed, like I say, I could not have conceived the Idea of what I saw. I, in general do not think of this memory, vary rarely, but an idea popped into my head to write and send to , somewhere.  I don&rsquo;t expect belief, anyone can say anything, I would like an explanation of a similar distortion that occurs as an object departs, or it only happens under certain conditions, as I explained.

Furthermore, I have never seen anything so bright through our dark red curtains. Finally, I did not hear any kind of noise coming from the lights as when it finally disappeared on the horizon I immediately went to the window, pulled back the curtain, and listened for any aircraft noise (i.e., thinking it might have been an airplane landing at the airport).

As the lights came above the trees, i saw a faint out line and for a moment thought it was a huge airplane, but when i got close i saw it was a huge triangular ship hovering slowly above the trees about 100 feet. The ship was black and as big as a football stadium. My Heart leaped in my throat when i saw it and i edged over to the side of the highway to watch it. There were no other vehicles around so i turned off my truck to see if i could hear anything and it was deathly quiet. Absolutely no noise.

It traveled very slow in a southward direction and finally slowly disappeared over the horizon. I started my truck back up and proceeded to head on towards Enterprise.

It was early evening, we were looking east ward, and I noticed what appeared to be a bright star. As my brother and I watched, the &apos;star&apos; increased in brightness, then we suddenly realized it was not a &apos;star&apos;, but an object of some kind that appeared to be coming downward...toward us. There was no noise of any kind, and no other lights, such as an airplane usually has. When it got near enough to the ground for us to see, it was clearly egg-shaped and shiny. My brother got scared and ran for the house, calling out to Mom (I was about 14 at the time and he was 7 or 8). I just watched as it settled closer to the ground. The object looked, to me, as if it were the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. It hovered a bit, and I had the distinct feeling that it was aware of my presence and was observing me. Then, without warning, it zoomed upward and away. I watched it disappear out of sight. Just after it left, my brother and mother showed up. Of course, she didn&apos;t see anything.

The best way for us to describe this is that it first appears to be a very bright star and it does not move or change direction or shape at first.  On closer inspection with binoculars it is seen to have 3 lights, (a red, blue and white) which blink on and off, but not like airplane lights. It makes no sound and acts as if it knows it is being observed, which is one of the creepiest aspects of this. Then it begins to move ever so slightly as if it is hovering and has no noise. It remains stationary and then begins to change shape, getting less bright but the colors remain. It will stay like this for about 30 minutes longer before disappearing quickly. I have never seen anything like it before. We have a good view of this from our kitchen window. Every night for a week in the summer of 2006 we saw it and it would come out in the same location but at a later time, around 11:30 p.m. and stay until around 1:00 a.m. I almost called the authorities about it but I assumed they would think we were nuts.

After returned (20 seconds away) from getting my camera, the contrails (which had been straight) were wavy due to wind (no doubt), but the odd thing is that the UFO was still shining bright - probably reflection of the sun - sun was rising, but hadn&apos;t yet risen, but was apparently stationary.  It faded over the next minute.  I have a couple of photos of this.((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.

It was located directly below Orions belt half way to the horizon and was the brightest object in the sky. I got a pair of binoculars out (7x35) to take a closer look and became intrigued. Through the binoculars the color changes were more prominent and I was convinced it wasn&apos;t a star. We had just gotten a new telescope over Christmas (Celestron) so I called my husband up (who is a total skeptic) and showed him thru the binoculars and had him bring the telescope out on the patio and focus on the object. What we saw left us both speechless. It was a spherical shaped object with a 2 rows of spinning color lights and an open center (like a donut). There were at least 5 different colors and they were spinning very rapidly. We don&apos;t have a video recorder, but did attempt to video it on our camera. I was so excited!! I called fox 11 news, and reported it on a different ufo sighting website. I ran and got my 7 yr old daughter and let her watch thru the telescope. I also called a friend that I was hoping had a telescope - but turned out not to have one. I then called the Griffith Observatory. The man who answered listened to my description and put me on hold. When he came back, he said it was just a star (the brightest one in the sky with an orange tint - and said it was called something like Orions dog?).I am certainly not an astronomer... but, since when do stars have holes in the middle and spinning rows of light? The object did not change its behavior other than drifting upward very gradually until I went to sleep at 930pm. It&apos;s too cloudy tonite for me to check for it again.My husband and I are both Management level professionals in the healthcare field, and neither of us have ever seen anything looking like a UFO before.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the star, Sirius.

I asked my son what he thought and he replied those are not stars mom they are moving. I pulled over so we could get a better look and as it came closer we could see 5 red objects in a V shape formation. We all got out to see better. It was up very high..higher than a jet normally flies but it appeared even from that high up to be the span of half a football field in width. We could not tell if the objects were connected or flying solo but they did stay in a perfect V shape and did not appear to be moving seperatly from one another. There was no sound that we could hear either. The only object to change was the one in the lead and after a couple minutes started going from red to white. The other ones stayed red the entire time. It was going in a north eastern direction at a very sloe rate of speed.

My daughter and I were watching the night sky and both observed the object, I had told her when we fist observed it that it was probably a satalite but I had never seen one moving across the sky from that direction.  When the object was approximately at the 1:00 position it made a hard left and appeared to climb and then dissapeared.

I was gazing at the stars and suddenly a perfectly square shaped object appeared as if it was resting on the earth&apos;s atmosphere. It was milky white in color. As I pointed to it, it suddenly zoomed across the sky leaving a faint white trail behind it. The trail could be seen for at least a minute if you knew where to look.  My companion could not see the trail.  The object appeared and disappeared so quickly, my companion did not have a chance to see it.  I just happened to be looking at the right place at the right time.

My thought then was that it would streak across the sky to the north and that would  be it. But, instead as I was driving I didn&apos;t see it streak and instead looked back to the left and saw that this object seemed to slow down to a really slow speed, and as it was night time I couldn&apos;t get a good feel for what altitude that it was at. As I&apos;ve said I was driving and on my way home which is outside of the town limits towards the Taos Pueblo. I slowed down considerably due to me trying to keep this object in my eyesight. At this time I was able to get a good look at it and could see that it was what appeared to be a segmented string of objects which was the center mass and around and leading this, were what appeared to be smaller disk shaped lights which were space evenly around in a &quot;v&quot; shaped formation. These where what I thought at first to be sparks or flares, but as mentioned, since it had &quot;slowed&quot; down and I also had been able to travel the half mile down the road at a 15mph speed or so, and had left the town area where the overhead lights diminished the clarity of the night sky, the details stood out quite a bit. I by now had pulled over on the side of the road and could see that this object was moving by now with faster speed and seemed to be &quot;banking&quot; directly towards an opening between the Taos Mountain/Wheeler peak area and the El Salto peaks area. The object moved in a smooth, almost liquid motion with all of it&apos;s &quot;satellites&quot; moving in unision, and when it approached the opening between these two landmasses, it sort of &quot;flowed&quot; through the opening, with again, a smooth banking motion. At that point, I could see that on the top of this object were what looked to be a series of flashing lights running from front to back, twinkling in series and at the &quot;end&quot; of it were three flashing li! ghts, in a triangle shape.

One day, while speaking with my father about the event, he had said he saw the same phenomena.  We talked about it, and past &quot;green flash&quot; events, and traced it back to an air-fuel making plant located in Rosemount, MN, which emits such flashes at times.  Rosemount is about 5 miles North East of my location, and where me and a friend witnessed the same event as well.  Once also, there was a powerfull explosion that came from the plant around five years ago, which illuminated the entire night sky to the point that it was seen from Eagan, MN, which is an estimated seven miles from the plant.  Now I cannot fully include that this is the cause of the flash, but that is what I am now assuming the cause is.

As reports continued to be filed, the magnitude of this occurrence began to be more fully understood.  People within a several hundred mile radius (myself included) witnessed a high velocity blue light, moving across the sky in a southern direction, leaving a trail behind it.  This &quot;light&quot; changed in color from blue, to White, to green.  From my vantage point, the light (at this point was green in color) seemed to take a sharp dive toward the ground and was lost behind the tree line.  Shortly before it reached the tree line, a smokey or hazy effect surounding the light became visible. The sky was partly cloudy that evening, and the light seemed to pass between myself and the clouds upon its descent.  [Note:  This haze may have been the light passing through a low cloud, giving it a smokey look...it happened very fast, and the refraction of light in cloud vapor may very well be the source of the haze.]  The national weather service has begun investigating, but so far has not yielded any results.  There are various reports of Government entities in the area including FBI and NSA, but no comments or official statements have been released thus far.  The Greenville/Spartanburg Airport has not released any information as to a possible radar tagging of this object, and anyone official that could possibly verify the presence of something in the South Carolina skies that night has remained annoyingly mum.  Those of us that witnessed the event all agree that this object was far to bright and concentrated to be weather related, and the nature of its movements, and the brilliance of the light that was emitted, lead all of us to believe that it was not an airplane, or known  aerial craft.

I work on the Tempe/ Phoenix line at the corner of Priest and Washington Streets. This location is approximatley 3-4 miles East Northeast of Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix. My office and viewing location are directly under the landing flight path of westbound landing flights at Skyharbor.This particular occurance is a repeat and has been repeated for a total of at least 10-12 occurances at this location.On this day at approximatley 2:15 pm I was in my car in my parking lot at work. I was skywatching as I have been seeing various orbs ( black and white ), strobing cylinders , and one saucer like object for the previous 2 months. When I say 2 months that is only when I started looking at this location.The first object was a definite saucer shape..white on top and black on the bottom. The object drifted and wobbled Northeast for about 10-12 minutes at a fairly slow clip before it faded away in the sky.No sooner had the first object faded away when it was followed by a larger, white orb which was traveling slightly faster going more due east, vs northeast as the first object was going. Due to the clear sky and no reference objects in the sky..ie other planes or clouds..I could not judge the distance of the objects. They are either quite large and quite high up, or relatively small at low altitudes. They produce no noise. The are very similiar to the objects seen in CNUFOS.COM..which is done by local Phoenix resident.I have had at least 10 days observing these objects over a course of a few months. This is only given that I go out and watch one hour and day at the same time of day and even then I don&apos;t go watch every day. On any given day I will see one to three objects within a few minutes of each other. I have not seen any travel together or tandem.Since these events occur so very close to the flight paths..either takeoff or landing at one of the nations busiest airports, I am surprised there is not more investigation from local FAA authorities simply for the sake of passenger safety alone.I make no claim that these objects are extraterristial, however they do not appear to resemble any manmade objects that I am familiar seeing.

Temperature was around 70 degrees F. There was little to no wind. The sky was clear. Humidity was low.I live in a small town in northern North Carolina. There are lights from a shopping mall about a mile away and street lamps here and there in our neighborhood BUT on a clear night one can still see many familiar constellations, etc.I just happened to look up at the sky when I observed the sighting.

As best as I can remember there were 5 or 6 lights in the shape of a rectangle.Its hard to say whether this was a single object with several lights or several distinct objects. The lights all moved in tandem and at the same rate of speed. What struck me as much as anything was the RATE of speed and the absolute silence before, during, and after the sighting.I am 58 years old and this was my first sighting. I am a veteran and my son is a pilot. I have been around aircraft all my life and I have NEVER seen any aircraft move at that rate of speed. To cover half of the night sky in 2-3 seconds is MOVING.Now a big problem here is to try and judge the SIZE of the object or objects. I am not able to do that  as it happened so fast.Of course the larger the object(s) was....how far away it was....is all very important in determing its speed. I was not able to do that !  As I stood there contemplating what I just saw ( 5-10 min) I could see a couple of aircraft lights coming into view coming from the ENE heading on a WSW trajectory as we live on a corridor for traffic into the Greensboro PTI airport which is about 35 miles away to our WSW so at night there are aircraft almost constantly in the sky on this line of flight. The sightings were on the opposite side of the sky. I immediately thought that &quot;some of these pilots in these commercial aircraft MUST have seen what I saw. There was just no way they could have missed it.&quot; There was no mention of anything related to this on the local 11  0&rsquo;Clock TV news !", "Rectangular, translucent object at a low altitude flies across the sky at high speedA square or rectangle object was seen traveling across the sky in Murphysboro, IL at a very high rate of speed at around 10:20 PM CST. It looked as though it appeared out of nowhere and then traveled behind a building, where it could no longer be seen, even though observer made an attempt to follow the object. The object was at an elevation of roughly 10,000 feet, much lower than a commercial jet.The object was rectangular and divided into three sections, with the center being a larger section. It had a gray translucent first section, a transparent middle section and a gray translucent end section.It was only visible because it was darker than its surroundings and the gray sections were visible. No lights were visible. Gray sections were visible against the starry sky.Observer is a 23 year old male college graduate working for local government, including firefighting, emergency management and IT.", "I saw one big bright light in the sky.

I was in my kitchen but had not turned on any lights yet. I was looking out the window and admiring a dark but clear morning with many stars and Jupiter plainly visible. My view was of the southern sky over San Francisco and the penninsula. I noticed a couple of jet airlines passing overhead and heard them faintly.  Still looking I noticed five or six smaller lights moving quickly from east to west in the same area of sky.  They moved in somewhat of a formation, that is they all seemed to be moving at the same speed but some of them changed position as they went and at such a speed that it almost looked like &quot;dancing lights&quot;.  I know of no aircraft that could so easily change position at such a high rate of speed.  I heard no noise from them and after they passed my positon I ran to the front of my house to see if I could continue to watch them but the bright street lights blotted out anything I might have been able to see.  The whole episode took approx 10 seconds.", "Chicago suburbs, strange lights and figures; close contact with figures.This event occurred when I was approximately 5 years old; as such it is an old memory that may be partially &quot;contaminated&quot; by the intervening years, but it remains, nevertheless, a very vivid memory for me. My parents were driving home after visiting relatives. It was late (after midnight) and I was trying to sleep in the back seat of the car. The weather was getting cold that time of year, so all the car windows were rolled-up. We were traveling through an area that was only partially developed at the time--a heavily forested road, or forest preserve land, near Riverside IL--when my father abruptly stopped the car. I sat up, thinking that we had almost crashed, and looked out the front window. Indistinct shapes moved around a bright light at what seemed like some sort of accident, but I could not see any other crashed cars. My mother kept saying something like, &quot;What is that? What are they doing there?&quot; The light extended completely across the narrow road and was a brilliant amber-yellow color with other spectral shades in it . . . like the rainbow hues glimpsed along the edge of a beveled mirror. My mother was talking very fast and nervously and I could tell she was becomming upset. She kept insisting that my father back-up the car and get &quot;hell out of here.&quot; My dad shouted back, &quot;I&apos;m trying!&quot; but the car wouldn&apos;t move. My mom became hysterical when some of the figures turned toward us and started approaching the car. As I watched I became aware of a presence alongside the car near me on the passenger side. The glare from the light, which now seemed all around us like an enveloping  fog, partially obscured him. This figure seemed to indicate to me that he wanted me to open the car door. When I reached up and raised the door &quot;button&quot;, my mother began to scream uncontrollably: &quot;Don&apos;t let them in, DON&apos;T LET THEM IN!&quot; I was unable to see any distinct features of the figures because of the glare around the car but, nevertheless, I could not understand her fear. One figure in particular seemed to want to play with me. He seemed older than me, but behaved just like a funny, playful older sibling. He projected this tremendous sense of warmth and affection toward me that I grasped immediately on a gut emotional level. No fear at all. The last thing I remember was a monotonous buzzing sound as if the entire rear car window had been covered with insects. (I actually have what may be a screen memory of a thick blanket of buzzing flies entirely obscuring the view from the car&apos;s back window.) The car door opened and someone lifted me out. At first I thought this was my father, but it was not; the figure who lifted me was featureless, like a living shadow, without any discernable face. My body went limp, like someone who was asleep, only I was still conscious . . .  but it was as if I were outside of my own body, watching all this happening from a safe distance.I woke up the next morning at home in my bed surprised and confused about how I got there. When I asked my mother about the incident she simply said nothing had happened. To this day she either flatly refuses to discuss the incident or claims she has absolutely no recollection of it.I am a university lecturer. My father is deceased. My elderly mother lives with a 24-hour caregiver.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Impossible for me to determine its size since it blocked out any reference points I could have used. If forced to guess, i would say it was at least 60 feet long by 20 feet or so high shaped like a submarine. This means there was a distinct center high point but then again the black of the object left me with that impression.The object just appeared with no sound of any kind and or movement of leaves tree branches etc.The event takes palce on or about early June 1988. My grilfriend at the time and I were just returning from a restaurant at between 7: and 8. We were on the back prch of the house about to enter when we heard the rough missing sound of an air plane engine. As if the plane had no noise abatement of any kind and flying as the sound provoked low to the ground. We stepped back from the roof line to see what it may be, discovering it was an old rotary engine plane flying approx 200 feet. The palne was very close to us approx half a block to our true north as we were facing true east. The plane was flying directly west into the sunset.Our eyes followed the plane thinking the noise may represent engine trouble.As the plane passed us heading west and we are now looking more at the rear of the plane we noticed we couldn&apos;t see or next door neighbors house to the south.We couldn&apos;t see the street lights to ur south or the hospital to the south.In our way was a large long and high black something blocking out that area.We kept our eyes on the object leaving the back porch to approach it from our back yard. As we aproached my girlfriend and I didn&apos;t speak not a word. We both waled toward the object geting within 15 feet.Once my eyes and mind hooked up -- I realized this was anything but normal and I became uneasy.I looked off to my right or west to see the old plane beginning to bank south accross the then sunset. I looked back at te object noticing there was a lght fore, aft and mid not blinding by any means but present. I don&apos;t know if it was steady or blinking too difficult to know under the stress and confusion.Now here is the good part that can not be comprehended, I don&apos;t care who you are. The object moved directly west at a speed undefined, faster than the fasted movement I can imagine. so fast It is undescribable. All I could see was a trail the lghts made going for miles to the west in an instant. Just as suddenly, i could see the street lghts, hospital, neighbors house ... The other most amazing aspect of the event is there was no sound or air movement.How could a large object move an incredible speed without creating a vacuum or noise only 15 feet away from me? As best I could see and it was only the trailing lights as if a picture was taken with time photography leaving the lens open. The object flew under the old plane as it continued to bank to the south and east.Immediatly after my senses returned I asked my girlfriend what was that all about and she remained stunned ans silent.After we both came to or thought we had our facilties back we went into the house to write down what we thought happened without sharing a single word other than lets write down what we saw and compare notes.We both saw the same thing and the essence of our vision is the speed at which the object moved. the blackness of theobject so we couldn&apos;t truly see its shape or size and we felt we were being looked at closely.Now the end of the story: We thought about calling our local airport sure the old plane was returning to it flying by site with what light was left. We talked ourselves out of it not wanting to draw any attention to us.The following day was a Saturday. We were washing our cars in the back yard listening to a local station on the radio. There was a break in by the announcer saying a sheriff or policeman was chasing a ufo near blue earth minnesota. the anouncer had the sheriff or policeman on line saying he would spped towrds the object getting within a block or two when the object would speed off at 90 degress at phonominal speed for a few miles and stop again.After about ten minutes the activity of the law man stopped and the station went back to normal broadcasting and not another word was said of the incident. You coulod verify the incident by calling Blue earth police it was very near to that farming comunity.Finally-- one night in the early fall and it was pitch dark out. A group of us were returning from a another night at a restaurant -- no drinking-- at or about 8;00 when we noticed a huge explosion like lobe orange in color from the ground to about 100 feet by 100 feet and a true half circle. We had met at the restaurant so we were in idividual cars all returning home as neighbors. The area is in the country between two small towns some 15 miles apart. One is Cleveland MN and the direction of the orange lobes was toward Madison Lake MN. Every 3 to 4 minutes there would be another huge orange lobe coming from the ground and moving awa from us.We tried to follow the orage lobes like bomb blasts for the next 15 miles but couldn&apos;t keep up. As we traveled the 15 miles we could see the orange blasts from the road going into the horizon. I believe i was travelling south but not sure.It was single orange blast with no sound nothin like lightning more like a half sphere shape associtaed with a bomb blast. all of the neighbors saw it and wondered again what in the hades did we just see.", "U.F.O. spotted in a major U.S. movie ?I have spotted a u.f.o. in a frame of The &quot;Crank&quot; movie dvd .The frame can be found at :  Scene 13 of 25 (13/25) at 2 minutes and 16 seconds past scene 13 . 1-Press the &quot;display&quot; button on the remote .2-Press next until 13/25 is displayed on top of the screen and then wait untill the number next to it shows : 2:16 and the press &quot;pause&quot; .

It was, and looked liked like, a window or rectangle floating above the north end of Seattle, WA.  I was on the east side of Lake Washington driving west across an over ramp from I-405.  It seemed visible enough that this would have been reported on the news.  I heard nothing about it.  Therefore, I chalked it up as something unusual but since no one else saw it, it would be like talking to a brick wall if I tried to explain to anyone what I saw.However, later I talked to someone that saw the same thing quite a few years prior.  It isn&rsquo;t really anything fantastic enough to report so we both just left it alone.I lost sight of the one I was looking at because of traffic behind me and no place to pull over for a longer look.  But it was there, just sitting in the sky and not moving. It had definite rectangular shaped perimeter to it and from I saw there was clear sky looking through the inside of the rectangle.Has this type of event ever been reported before?

He reported this while on active duty in the army.((name deleted))", "Strange white lights seen on object in sky.I saw something unusual on my drive home from work tonight.  I work near O&apos;Hare in Chicago, and live underneath one of the flight paths, so I&apos;m accustomed to seeing aircraft in the sky.  In addition, I&apos;ve been a life long aviation enthusiast, so I often watch the sky&apos;s. This evening I saw a light pattern that I&apos;ve NEVER seen on a commercial or military aircraft. I was heading westbound on Lake St. in Bloomingdale IL, and had just past Bloomingdale Ave.  I noticed what at first I thought to be a plane in the sky, on final approach to O&apos;Hare, heading in a north easterly direction.  However, the object caught my eye, because of the flashing lights that it was producing.  I saw what initially appeared to be wingtip landing lights, except that they were flashing in an alternating pattern.  I found this unusual, because I&apos;ve never seen a commercial airliner &quot;flash&quot; it&apos;s landing lights like this. I also observed a smaller, flashing red light on top of the object.  Then, as I&apos;m pondering this, all of the sudden, four to five more white lights illuminate sequentially from right to left along the same horizontal plane between what I considered the &quot;wing tip&quot; lights and they began to flash intermittently as well!  That is something that I have NEVER seen a commercial  airplane do!   At this point, I was paying so much attention to the object that I decided to pull off and turn around before I hit another vehicle on the road.  However, by the time I did so, I had lost sight of it, and could only see &quot;normal&quot; air traffic in the pattern.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be unusually eloquent and credible.

I was perfectly sober though a little tired from the show, so I was sitting on the curb behind the HOB waiting for autographs in a crowd of about 30 people and was facing due E. At the risk of sounding like a fool to these strangers and losing sight of it in the sky by trying to share it, I chose not to draw attention to what I saw. I wish I would have thought to take the camera in my pocket out and snap a few shots, but I was in a state of shock. It was just a hazy light ball and it was definitely airborne because along the back of the HOB is a fence that is at least a little bit taller than I am, but it is also 20-30 ft. away from the curb I was sitting on. Perspective-wise it was a good couple of feet above the fence. Behind the fence and off to the right, (the direction it was traveling), was a light pole some distance away with a light gleaming away in my face, and hotels in the distance along with shrubbery and branches along the back of the fence. It was a windy night, pretty clear and it was sometime between 11:30 and 12:00 AM. I was sitting on the curb smoking a cigarette and chillin&apos; facing about E, away from the HOB towards the ocean and checking out the stars. I saw the typical air traffic and seagulls enjoying the windy night. It was a small, faint and hazy white light and at first I thought, &quot;That jet is hauling a$$!!  I&rsquo;ve never seen a jet moving that fast&quot;, then it struck me how much like a star it resembled. Because it was just a ball of light it was hard to judge it&apos;s size and distance, however if the planes that appeared after I saw it presumably went to the general area it was at, and my own judgement of perspective wasn&rsquo;t too far off, it was definitely waaay out over the ocean. I checked it out on Google Earth; from the direction I was facing the shore was roughly .7 of a mile away, these planes and my own judgement of perspective put it AT LEAST a mile or more away. It&apos;s path, from when I first noticed it started out parallel to the earth and traveled like this for maybe 5 seconds. Then almost a 90 degree turn at what seemed to be straight up, then another sharp degree of turn up and away at an angle, then another turn at a downward angle, and yet another at a down and backwards angle, then once it reached about where it&apos;s original path was, it resumed. Half of these turns were in a span of maybe 1-2 seconds, but no more than 3 at the absolute most and the other two were really short. Once it resumed it&apos;s &quot;original&quot; path it faded out after about 3 seconds. Like a lightbulb slowly going out, then instantly it began glowing again, so quickly I never lost track of it. From my perspective it was headed into the gleaming light, but it faded out for about a second, if only for a second and then came back to full glow before it &quot;passed&quot; behind the light pole and remained glowing, so I never lost it through the light. Now, on the other side of the light pole and after about another 2-4 seconds it faded out again for the second time and that&apos;s when I never saw it again. I kept watching for it, but it never reappeared. It&apos;s path was straight, and looked very deliberate, not like it was a trashbag blowing in the wind or another seagull or something. The three things that have me pretty much convinced what I saw is some sort of a UFO is the blazing speed, the ease of the change of direction without even slowing down and that it was traveling in straight lines, not circling or twirling as if something caught in the wind. It was like someone was holding one of those laser pointers in the sky only it was faint and white. I was glued to the sky, but saw no more. About 5-7 minutes later I saw two planes coming from the N along the coastline or there abouts and heading that direction, about the time they got where it was, I noticed another plane that must&apos;ve come from the SW or that general direction. The two planes from the N went further S and I almost lost them behind the hotels and stuff on the horizon and then returned, while the other plane continued N for a few minutes and returned. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I was seeing, so I just stared in disbelief. I thought about telling some of my friends, but decided not to get picked on that night. I documented this the next morning and waited to see if someone else reported this, but I&rsquo;ve not seen anything yet.  I am a believer and was before this incident, but still remain skeptical as to what I saw.  If you also saw this, I urge you to report it.

He took me to Bassett to introduce me to a cousin of his for a possible date with her.  After some chatting with her and her father we decided to drive back to Ainsworth which is about 17 miles.  By the time we left her house it was dark with no moon visible. It was also a very clear, crisp December night with no wind, ( unusual for NE!!).On the way home I noticed an unusually bright star in the North West, more West than North.  The closer we came to town, the closer this light seemed to be.  It did not appear to move, and the closer to town we came, the higher up it appeared.  As if it were stationary and we were approaching it. At the time we were about &frac34;&rsquo;s of the way home I pointed this out to my friend and it sparked his curiosity.  We continued to watch it until we were 1 mile outside of Ainsworth.  At that time I asked him if he would turn off onto a country road leading north.  He did, and we drove 1 mile north, turned back West and drove about &frac14; mile then stopped.We sat with the pickup running and observed this bright light in the sky for about 30 seconds.  We were the only vehicle on the road since this is a very rural area.  At our vantage point, the only other lights in our immediate area were distant yard lights and the other stars in the sky, not to mention the soft glow from town.  He mentioned that it looked like a light from a helicopter searchlight and I agreed, it looked like it was about 500 feet up and about &frac12; mile to the Northwest of us.  It was at this moment that he shut off the pickup and the lights.  About 1 second after he killed the lights, the light in the sky literally turned off!  We sat there stunned for about 1 minute looking at where it had been, we started to see a light again, but it was faint.  It grew brighter and brighter until it was as bright as it was before.  I rolled down my window to see if I could hear an engine or something, but it was dead silent.My friend got very nervous and said, &quot;We&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; the hell out of here!&quot;  He started up the pickup turned on the lights and high-tailed it to town.  We both lived in town at the time, so he dropped me off, didn&rsquo;t say a word about it and he went home.  He still lives here and hasn&rsquo;t said anything about that night since then.  I was honestly still a little freaked out about it so I called the sheriff&rsquo;s office to see if there were any reports about strange lights.  The dispatcher said there had been no reports.  I managed to lie down and get a little sleep that night, but when I woke at 6:30 the next morning the light was still in the sky, except it was more in the West. It remained in the Westerly sky until I went to bed the next night and I have not seen it since then.  Some days, months, and years after I have asked certain close friends of mine if they saw anything unusual around that time, but none have admitted to seeing anything.  I don&rsquo;t claim that this was an alien spacecraft, but it was the strangest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and I think I speak for my friend too.

Will make the report here. Here goes.Date: May or June 1964 or &apos;65. Time: Just past dark. Sky: Moonless, no clouds, excellent star gazing evening. My father had recently bought a boat and a pair of binoculars to use on the boat. It was a clear evening. I decided to take the binoculars and stargaze. Happened to meet a neighbor of mine out in front of my house. Every star was out, viewing was great! I happened to see large meteor. I quickly pointed it out to my neighbor. I first saw it appear in the SW sky heading NW and going down at about a 10 to 15 degree angle. Its heading would be about 315 degrees. It was huge and visible for much longer than any meteor I had ever seen. It disappeared on the dead west horizon. At the tender age of 14 or 15 I got the idea that it must have been a fairly good size hunk of rock  hit earth dead west of where we were. We lived 25 miles north of Detroit at the time. I also figured that it hit well beyond Lake Michigan. I believe the next day in the local papers was the story of a meteorite that hit somewhere in Iowa. Had a map in the article and I was right! Do some research, you might find it and then know when it happened. It hit dead west of us hundreds of miles away in Iowa I believe. Less than a minute later I saw something out of the corner of my eys in the SE skymaybe 30 degrees off the horizon. I quickly locked with both eyes and at first thought I was looking at a flock of ducks or geese. The flock  was making an arcing turn to the north and west. As they got directly east they flattened out in a smooth motion and started to pass overhead and go directly west. Didn&apos;t seem like birds flapping wings to me, this was smooth and no wing flap sound. I quickly locked on with the binoculars. They were well focused. About 60 degrees off the horizon, east I saw 4 disk shaped objects flying in fighter plane formation. There was structure to them, not just disks with a dome. I could see wind screens. They, the craft, were luminiscent.Didn&apos;t really have time to see who the pilots were. And traveling fast . I h! ollered Look to my riend. Adrenalin was pumping I was excited to say the least. I quickly gave the binocs to my friend. He got a quick look before they disapeared from sight, going dead west. Stll no sound what so ever. I kind of thought they may head to where the meteor hit. I believe the ufos were 500 to 1,000 agl ( above ground leve). From the time they were directly overhead to the time they were gone from sight was only a few secnds. Fighter jets would take longer and make a hell of a noise. Single engine private planes probably would be visible for a couple minutes Seemed like maybe going about 20 or 22 times faster than say, a Piper or a Cescna.This would put the speed about 2,100 mph. This also seems to be a good guess on my part. Next day I told my sisters husband about it. He was in the army in a radar control room at a Nike missle base tat was on a nearby air force base.I told him the time, speed direction. He says they saw them, didn&apos;t know what they were and weren&apos;t supposed to talk about it. Next day while on my paper route I stopped at a local ice cream stand and told a friend of mine the worked there what we  saw. He told me not to tell him, but tell the guy behind me. Turns out to be a guy from another Nike base. He happened to be at in the radar control room at that base at the time and reconfimed what my sisters husband said, including they weren&apos;t suppose to talk about it. In the mean time I read everything I can on the subject of ufos. Lot of garbage out thereWhat is real, what is&apos;t? I learned to talk to very few people on the subject of ufos. Now the whole reason for this report.

We stopped in open countryside on the Fosse Way about half a mile south of the M40 to watch the final stage. The sky was clear, we could see commercial aircraft about, there was no immediate light pollution and the moon was sharply defined. At 22.50 I got out of the car to took a photo with my 5 megapixels digital camera.  It was shakey (I was cold and tired but didn&rsquo;t want to miss the eclipse) but there was a clear red point below the moon and a little to the right.  I thought it must be a glitch, so I took several more photos (all shakey but with same red point) then I was too cold and got back in the car. We watched the rest of the eclipse thru&rsquo; the (murky!) windscreen.  Because I was sure it was a camera glitch, I didn&rsquo;t scan the sky for the dot - all my attention was on the eclipse.  When I looked at the photos on the PC, I found I couldn&rsquo;t put the red point down to a problem with the camera, however I played about with the photos (using very basic Kodak software).  Other blips were obviously just blips, but this one appears spherical and holds up as that under zoom.  When I saw the Puget Sound photo, it looked to me just the same.  If it is a glitch with the camera, I apologise now - I have taken more photos of the night sky and have been unable to reproduce the red point and it wasn&rsquo;t on an earlier photo taken of the moonrise.

The tower is approx. 200 feet high and by comparison, that&apos;s how I was able to estimate the altitude of these lights.  I did not see the shape or outline of any spacecraft, only the porthole lights. I did not think it was one craft but many in formation. However, after seeing video of the Phoenix Lights, I now know it was one craft.  The video of the Phoenix Lights captured EXACTLY what I saw. When this event occurred, I pulled my car over to the side of the highway. I got out of my car and just observed it for about 10 minutes. I got into my car and kept glancing at it as I was driving into the city.  I lost sight of it as the city lights flooded out my view of the sky.  I checked the local paper the next day to see if this event had been witnessed and reported by anyone else. To my great disappointment, nothing! No mention of it in the newspaper or on the local radio stations. Thank you for accepting my report.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Through binoculars, object appeared to be triangle shape and white in color.  Object took about one minute to fade from view.Object did not have wings, lights, vapor trail, or sound.  Temperature was about 15 degrees.

I looked at it through binoculars and it seemed to change brightness levels going from very bright and colorful to very dim and white.  Every once in a while it would move back and forth up and down very quicly but not very far.  I would say it moved about 2-4 inches in the sky each time it moved.

Nevertheless, as a police officer in Alaska I responded to a local neighborhood call reporting a UFO in the sky.  The town we worked in was only 800 people, Yakutat, Alaska, so I went out there with the Chief of Police.  We saw a white diamond object seemlessly traverse a bright blue sky without a single cloud.  We got a video camera, and as I tried to focus in closer, it would dart away out of lense view, as if it knew i was attempting to take video!  I still have 20 minute or so of video of this thing that would move in curvy directions, nonlinear, and vibrate into different shapes which appeared to be circular, then back to diamond.  High-tech secret, or otherworldly, who knows.  I can&apos;t deny what i saw and have on tape.  Neighbors came out and saw this thing with us.  Finally it passed out of view; we thought maybe it can read out minds?  Who knows?  I asked it to come to me, and even today, 4 years later, i still think when i am alone, that i wish it would be brave enough to contact me at some point in the future.  To date, nothing.

Dazed deer present.I&rsquo;ve had 6 sightings in my life, but none as good as this one.I had recently sold my car, where I kept a nice set of binoculars for the sole purpose of looking at a UFO closer if and when I saw another one, and was now driving the family van with my two kids on our way to get gasoline, and then to the store.  This particular evening was fairly clear, and, as I was driving down a slightly winding street to get onto a major street, I saw an orange object just above the tree line that, during the brief moment I had to see it, first made me think of the moon when it&apos;s low on the horizon and has an orange glow, the way it looks during an lunar eclipse.  However, I felt that the moon should be a bigger, and also that it wasn&apos;t in the direction of the sky where the moon usually is, so I looped around the other neighborhood streets and came back up the same street, slower, to get a second look.Sure enough, when I saw it again, there was no mistaking it, it was definitely a hovering UFO similar to one whose picture was taken on December 21, 1994, by Carlos Diaz, so I turned off my headlights, came to a stop where I had the best view, lowered the windows, and turned off the van.Believe me when I tell you that based on the terrain of this area, even though it&apos;s surrounded by houses, businesses, a high school, and a very busy major street, where this UFO was hovering was not observable except for about 50 yards on this one street where I was parked.I told my kids to look at the object, and told them it was a spaceship.  They were 3 and 5 years old at the time, and though innocent, they were very interested in hearing about a real spaceship, especially because they were fans of the movie Toy Story.The object was not a thin disk or cigar shaped.  Honestly, it looked a lot more like a slightly squashed lemon, except with two &quot;nipples&quot; on either side instead of a stem on one side and a nipple on the other.  It glowed a uniform orange, and it had white beacon lights, one on top, and one on the bottom, across its perpendicular axis.  It had a row of very small white lights across its horizontal axis, dividing the craft equally above and below.  The beacon lights were blinking about 3 times per second but not in sync with each other.  The object was about 3 stories off the ground, and less than a mile away from us, but I really can&apos;t estimate the exact distance.  I would say somewhere between half a mile and a mile.  I could not make out any more detail, and believe me; I REALLY missed not having my binoculars that day.I had a red laser pointer on me that I use at work, and my son asked me to point it at the object, but I ignored him.  He happened to have a flashlight that he&apos;d gotten recently in his pocket, so before I knew it, he had taken it out and turned it on to point it at &quot;them&quot;.  I moved his arm down, gently, but he could see I was being cautious.  He asked why I didn&apos;t want to signal them, and I said that I wasn&apos;t sure it was a good idea.  In my mind, I was thinking, &quot;I don&apos;t know if they are good or bad, and I don&apos;t want to inadvertently volunteer my kids to become regular abductees.&quot;  I was also thinking, &quot;Man, if only my kids weren&apos;t here, I&apos;d get out of this van and run to get a closer look, but I&apos;m trapped under these circumstances.&quot;  Anyway, to make a long story short, we watched this object for at least 3 minutes, and it was just hovering there, so in my impatience to get a closer look, I remembered a business parking lot that was adjacent (left of the object from our point of view) to the forest that this object was hovering over, and I thought, &quot;If I time the signal light properly, I can quickly race the van to make the left turn, go down a block or two into the business parking lot, and then drive to the edge of the parking lot closest to the object. Perhaps from there I can see it closer through the trees&quot;, so without hesitating much, that&apos;s what I did.  As I raced the van and the trees blocked my view, the last glimpse I caught of the object was that it was still hovering in the same place, so I was very hopeful of being able to get a better look.However, when I got into the business parking lot, I found a big surprise - there were no less than 50, and probably more like 100 deer in the parking lot, and they were in a dazed, almost frozen state.  They moved very little, to the point that I had to steer around a few of them to avoid hitting them.  That in itself was remarkable, and only reinforced my belief that this object was not human-made, that the occupants had somehow put these deer in a trance.  After finally getting to where I thought I could see the object, I was disappointed to find out that I could not see it anywhere, so as fast as I could, again avoiding the deer in my way, I worked my way back to where I was before, and unfortunately the object was now gone.  After this event, my son drew a picture of what he saw, and it was essentially what I saw.  Both my children still remember the event, even though my daughter was so young, perhaps because we&apos;ve retold it several times, but I certainly don&apos;t want them to forget it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Mr. Davenport,I have the drawing somewhere in a box in the attic or inside a book, but I can&apos;t remember where exactly, and it&apos;s been over 7 years now since the incident.  If I ever run into it, I&apos;ll scan it and send it to you.  My apologies for not having kept better records.  I considered contacting an investigator from MUFON way back then to check woods below where the object was hovering, but I never did.  I was no willing to put my children in any type of danger.I still keep my eye out in the sky, so if I ever catch anything again, I&apos;ll also send it your way.((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM))", "On Christmas Eve we saw a large dark craft glide from one cornfield across a road and into another field.This was on Christmas Eve. We were traveling by car through a rural area - we were surrounded by fields with no streetlights. We were just approaching a hill when a car came down the hill, facing us. As they came down the hill, that car braked and its taillights illuminated the hill behind them in a reddish glow. In that glow both my father and I saw a craft gliding across the top of the hill from one cornfield into another. It was dark gray with no lights and massive - it took up the entire road, we could not see the beginning or end of it. It moved more smoothly than anything I have ever seen; cars, planes and ships can move smoothly but this glided almost as if automated. It was like it was on a conveyor belt. Then the car approaching us stopped braking and its taillights went off and the hill fell into darkness again. Both my father and I were shocked. We are from that area and are well acquainted with tractors, cars, trucks and anything other vehicle in local use and we could not think of anything it could be. It was just too huge. Furthermore there were cornfields on each side of that hill - there was no reason for any kind of craft to pass at that location. As we drove up and over the hill, I looked into the fields but could see nothing... everything was pitch black. This probably isn&apos;t related but something odd happened the following morning on Christmas. My parents&apos; house is very remote and too set back from the road for anyone to approach on foot. Yet we discovered HUGE footprints leading from the driveway through the snow around the house... and they just stopped in the middle of the yard. They didn&apos;t turn around and they didn&apos;t go anywhere else. The tracks just ended as if whoever made them vanished. It was Christmas and we were obviously busy with other things, but the sight of that craft gliding from one field into another has haunted me ever since. I know it&apos;s not a &quot;flying&quot; object as it was on the ground but it was not of this world either. I&apos;m sure of it.", "Round with red,Green and white flashing lights moving in circular direction. Is stationary.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.

It was a large triangle/boomerang shape very low, with blinking white lights, and moving very strangely towards the southeast.  I watched until it passed over my house, then I ran outside and saw it continue slowly towards the southeast.  There was no sound at all.  Suddenly it dropped even lower and changed direction toward the north, and slowed down.  It seemed to hover or move very slowly, moving north until it was blocked from my sight by buildings and trees.  I called the police but no one had reported anything.  I can&rsquo;t believe no one else saw it, since it was in town, flying right over streets.  I&apos;m not good at determining altitude, but it was definitely flying too low, too slow, and too quietly for any type of plane or aircraft I know of.", "White light streaking across the sky.500 Lights On Object: YesThe object traveled out of the North West on a level South Eastern trajectory.

She was facing east with her back to the front door when she saw lights moving above and to the left of her in the sky. The lights were to the north of our house approximately 200 yards and appeared to her to be about 200 feet in the sky. She noticed them as they cleared the roofline of our house. The moon on this evening rose around 9:15 PM so this was the darkest part of the night. We live in a very rural part of the county so there are very few lights and almost no noise except for the occasional coyotes and dogs barking. There were no vehicles on the nearest road during the sighting. The air was clear. My wife called to me through the front door. As I stepped out on the porch I immediately saw the lights tracking due east. My immediate impression was that the object was very large due to the spacing of the lights and the way the lights slowly, consistently tracked without any variation in speed or direction. At no time during our observation were we able to discern any physical form. The night was absolutely still. I thought I could hear a faint sound like a commercial jet way out in the distance. It was like a slight wavering rumble, just barely discernable. I wasn&rsquo;t sure the sound was emanating from the lights so I quickly scanned the sky for aircraft marker lights but none were seen. During this event no dogs barked which is remarkable in it&rsquo;s self. As you consider the line of travel, there were two lights in the rear oriented much like taillights. These lights where about 3 feet wide by 4 feet tall and 20 feet apart. They had square corners and were flat. They shown like frosted glass with yellow incandescent light coming from within. They were at a medium glow and no light reflected from anything structural around them. About 4 feet above the right taillight, and about 10 feet to the right, there were 3 more lights. These were about 1 foot square with tight radius corners much like a passenger jet window. These were spaced about 7 feet apart horizontally. The line they formed to the right, and forward of the taillights, gave me the impression they were mounted on a curved surface. They were facing the 4 o&rsquo;clock position and were the same color and intensity as the taillights. I grabbed some binoculars I keep by the front door and we proceeded to watch the object as it continued its track low and slow. I had to move around to keep a line of sight through the trees. I noted at its most distant observation the 3 window lights were situated so that the center light was above the right taillight. I didn&rsquo;t see them move, I just noticed they were in a different position. This event covered a span of 2 to 3 minutes. We estimated the speed of the object to be 35 to 45 MPH.", "Faint Black Trail extending out in front of high altitude aircraftObserved two high altitude aircraft with the usual contrails.  One aircraft was behind and to the left of the other aircraft; however both were flying in the same westerly direction (290 degree heading, I estimate). Since they were both in the same general area, they caught our eye on this bright clear day. They were not directly overhead, but maybe at 70 degrees above horizon, if you consider 90 degrees is directly over head. We were looking at them in a southwesterly direction. Both I, my wife, and 12 year old daughter observed a faint black trail extending a great distance from the front of the lead aircraft. It was in perfect trajectory with the heading of this aircraft. Observed this strange trail for only about five seconds and then the trail was gone.I cannot tell you if they were military type of aircraft or not, since they were so high up.", "Triangle craft with rotating becaon seen twice in 10 minsI saw a triangular craft with extreme maneuverability flying a few hundred feet over the trees.  It was early dawn and I saw a rotating red beacon underneath the craft (military?).  It flew around and showed up twice in areas I could see it while I was driving.  Most definitely the same craft. It maintained a forward constant speed at all times but had a lot more &quot;grace&quot; when it was flying left and right; banking and faster turns than any standard airplane I can think of that exists.  White lights on front and more than two white lights on the back.", "Object captured by camera over Abu DhabiI am a member of the United States Air Force stationed in southwest Asia for the past 2 months. While sight seeing downtown in Abu Dhabi, I took a photograph of a local building with interesting architecture. Upon review of the photo (to make sure it was all in focus) I noticed an odd saucer shaped object  hovering to the buildings immediate left, and when I looked up to see it in person, it was no where in sight.There were no airplanes flying within the immediate area that I could see, and the total time between taking and reviewing the photo to looking back at the skyline was no more than 15 to 30 seconds. Because the craft is in such poor focus (compared to the buildings in the photograph) I believe it was much larger than it appears and in motion at the time the photo was taken. This assumption is also based on the fact that I do not recall it being in the frame as the picture was being taken.I know there are a myriad of plausible and reasonable explanations for this photograph, but also believe that it stands to attest to the slight possibility that it was a genuine UFO sighting.", "As I entered my bedroom, I looked out the back main window which faces west-southwestrly towards the geographically NW/SE angling Rocky Mountains.  The sun had set almost west-northwest of my line of sight; it was dusk condition (still light enough, but not dark - about 30 min to 1 hour before darkness was to set in), and that is when I saw the bright circular object on the SW horizon, just above and slightly beyond the mountain peaks. It was setting slowly behind the mountains; again, it was bright enough that no stars or other planet(s) were visible.  At first I thought that it might have been Venus, but it seemed too low on the horizon to be Venus, and it was sinking faster than any planet&apos;s movement rate across the sky and/or horizon. It&apos;s size seemed quite large (3-4 times larger in diameter than any planet which would be visible via the naked eye - possible visual refraction error due to the object being located pretty much right on the horizon (objects look larger on the horizon, i.e. - the sun looks bigger as does the moon when setting or rising), and the distance had to be at least one hundred miles away, over the mountains to the southwest (beyond downtown Calgary), which are about 50 miles away from Calgary due west, as the crow flies. The object was circular, had a very bright white colored light, moved through a roughly 5 to 10 degrees vertical arc within 5 minutes. I watched it until it totally disappeared out of my sight. The only other option that I come up with what it could possibly have been is the space station?  Regards.((NUFORC Note:  Venus is visible in the western sky at the time indicated.  The ISS does not set on the western horizon.  Probably Venus.  PD))", "Mysterious illuminated cloud appears over the National Forrest.One September night in 1968, at around 9:00PM we were watching our B&amp;W television when a sudden static interference and noise came onto the television that sounded as if a large engine was trying to start.  The interference caused vertical lines on the television as opposed to the normal horizontal lines caused by a passing aircraft in those days when using a VHF antenna.My father hurried and went outside and saw a small cloud hovering near the tree tops over the Ozark National Forrest which was located about a mile to the West of our house.  This small cloud had a straight lightening bolt from its center going to the ground.  When the lightening bolt ended, the television static and the starting noise ended.  This bolt of lightening reappeared 3 times and lasted for about 5 to 10 seconds each time with a 15 seconds delay between them.  The cloud was slightly illuminated with a white-bluish light and remained stationary during this whole time.  I ran outside just in time to see the last bolt of lightening and after it ended, the cloud disappeared.One of our neighbors that lived at the South side of the National Forrest called my Dad and asked him if he had seen the lightening and heard this motor trying to start up in the forest?  The sky was clear that night with no other clouds in the sky but this very low strangely illuminated cloud.  It was very eerie! A couple of months later in November, during our Thanksgiving holiday school break, my brother and I decided to venture into the National Forrest and look for some kind of clue to what this could have done to the ground or the trees in the forest.We found an approximate three foot diameter by twenty foot deep hole in the ground.  The edges were straight as if a plug had been removed from the earth.  There was no loose dirt or rocks in or around the hole.  No sign of the dirt that was removed.  There were three triangle shaped pad prints, approximately one foot in size embedded into the ground around the hole at equal spaces.  This hole in the ground was among the trees where a vehicle could not get into and at that time there was no road access into that part of the forest.My Dad informed the local Forest Ranger, who was another neighbor, to find out if this hole in the ground was some project the Forest Service had going.  He went to investigate because he had no knowledge of any kind of operation going on in the forest.  When he went to investigate, he put a fence up around the hole to keep game animals from falling into the hole becoming trapped as he found had already happened.  He was amazed of this and called the Sheriff.  No one ever came up with an explanation or figured out what had taken place there.I was only 10 years old at the time and I can still remember this as if it happened yesterday.  My Dad, the neighbor, and the Forest Ranger have all since passed away.  I am sure this hole still remains in the forest with no explanation of how it got there.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Blinking, solid, and then strobing.We were walking around at a resort in the Phoenix area.  It was night time.  I was looking up in the sky as I was walking, and noticed a red light blinking in the same fashion as an airplane.  A minute or so later, I realized that it wasn&apos;t really moving, so I stopped walking to see if maybe it was an illusion because I was walking or if was truly not moving.  When I stopped, I noticed that it was moving at a very slow rate of speed, much too slow to be an airplane.  I then thought that it was perhaps a blimp.  It  started moving in an a zig-zag fashion at that same slow rate of speed.  I told my wife that that is rather odd... we kept watching it for a minute or so and the light then came on solid, and started to pick up speed in a straight line fashion.  It hit what appeared to be airplane speed in a straight direction.  Then, it proceeded to start blinking in a strobe fashion and appeared to plummet towards the Earth.  We watched as it streaked down towards the horizon at a shooting star type of speed, all the while it was strobing in a very rapid fashion.", "MY TWO SONS AND THREE FRIENDS SAW A LARGE RED/ORANGE LIGHT IN SKY THAT CIRCLED OVER THEM.

I looked at the horizon and saw a ship or saucer level with the ocean and thought it was a new cruise ship or even possibly a military vehicle because of how big it was, this craft was very big.  The object proceeded to move upward and at that point I knew it wasn&apos;t a cruise ship because I could see the ocean and the sky seperated underneath the ship.  The craft then proceeded to move upward  and move slowly in a triangular shape in the same area.  It was more diamond shaped and had an off white or cream color with 2 rows of green lights. At that point I turned to my mothers room which I could see into from the balcony and told my mom to wake up and come look at this thing floating above the water.  By the time my mom got up and looked it was gone. If I had to make a comparison as far as size I&apos;d say as big as a cruiseship.

The camera is aimed at the eastern sky and the photos are sent to my website at http://aboutfacts.net .  The black object slowly moved from west to east at an upward angle until it was too far east for the camera to see since a wall blocked the view. I don&rsquo;t know the exact time the photos were taken,  since they are not time stamped, but by their placement I can assume it was somewhere between 12:00 pm and 3:00 pm. The object looked almost like a completely black cloud, but it was the deepest black you would ever see, an unnatural black. As it moved across the field of vision it changed its shape. I am including photos of it from my webcam and a gif animation I made from the 46 clear frames. My Background: I am retired and the webmaster of http://aboutfacts.net.

After seeing this object I noticed a jet taking off from Ontario, as some jets travel over my City on there way to the Burbank Airport or elsewhere.

I&rsquo;m hoping someone else in the area has witnessed the same, for it was so very conspicuous. It was late at night when he was on his balcony (facing south) and off to the west, in the distance, approached what looked like a helicopter with a searchlight.  As it drew closer, he realized this was nothing man-made.  It drifted in a straight line ever so casually over the trees across the parking lot in front of him heading toward Oshawa. It was somewhat larger than a bus. He described it as triangular with a small white light on each point.  In the middle was a massive white light but with no beam coming off it.  The ship was darker than the sky behind it and the lights on it reflected faintly on the underside of the ship.  It made absolutely no sound.

I was searching the Internet for maps to locate McNaught comet (C/2006 P1) in my place (Latitude: 7&deg; 06&apos;, South. Longitude: 34&deg; 53&apos;, West), Joao Pessoa, Brazil.  I was upset because I realized it wouldn&apos;t be easy to see the comet from here.I went to bed thinking about the comet and stayed observing the nice spot of clear sky I have trough my large bedroom&apos;s window (6th floor) which is always kept open during the warm summer season. I have a nice view from here since there are no buildings around and we are only 100 m from the beach - in fact, from my window, I am facing the sea and &quot;Ponta do Seixas&quot; - the eastern most point of the Americas.There were no clouds neither the moon and I was observing the sky and the constellations (The Southern Cross, The Great Dog, Orion...) when I suddenly spotted what, at a first sight, looked like a tiny cloud blown by the wind - I felt strange because it was moving quite fast.  When I observed it properly, I have noticed its triangular shape without a clear contour made up of some faint points of white light (I could not count how many points - may be six or seven...).  The delta shaped &quot;thing&quot; was traveling soundless from southeast to northwest in a peculiar way with its wider angle pointing sideway (even a delta shaped airplane would not fly with one of the wings heading!).  I then realized that could be a formation of orbs.It was difficult to guess the altitude but it could be compared to a commercial plane flying at 3000 m or more. It soon went of my visual field (passing over my roof) - I run to another room, facing north, and in a second I could spot the triangular shape again. I observed it until it faded into the light sky of the city (away from the sea)  I doubt a person who was not intentionally watching the night sky would ever have noticed that &quot;thing&quot; - I had the impression it was traveling camouflaged... I must add to this report that I have an engineering background and a considerable experience in observing the sky (I was an amateurs junior astronomer while at the university).Since then I have made a lot of suppositions and calculations:  I have taken a time average of many repetitions of my movements again and I found time of observation=20 seconds.Altitude (h): I had to guess - my first impression is (h &gt; 3000 m) = 3 km . Reason: I am used to observe things closer than 3 km by just looking out from my window, boats, people at the beach, cars, planes - at smaller distances I see more details even at night.Length (L): since the thing&apos;s longer side comprised approximately a 2&ordm; angle (2 full moon size), which equals 0.255 rd and then, L = 3000 x 0.255 = 76.5 m   By estimating angles I could also calculate the speed (s) of the &quot;thing&quot;:  1. Supposing h = 3 km, then v = 954 km/h !  2. Supposing h = 6 km, then v = 1908 km/h !!!  (In this case the length would be L = 6000 x 0.524 = 153 m !) 3. I don&apos;t want to suppose any higher because that would mean faster and bigger!   In fact, they looked like faint stars (+6 magnitude) (as I can see Pleyads M45 with the naked eye) - I was not able to count them but they were more than 5 and less then 8 points of light spread over the triangular area.At that time my street and the region around is always completely silent - just the sea at a distance, no restaurants are open and everyone else at home (2 more people) were asleep.  I would have heard the sound of a plane or anything like if closer.Clear glass windows measuring 1.50 x 1.20 (half of them open), no wind blowing (it is terrible warm by this time of the year) - 6th floor without any other apartment building around (only houses). Good visibility!  There are only 4 commercial flights per day arriving at Joao Pessoa since the main airports in the region are in neighbor cities (Recife and Natal) and even though, the local airport is 30 km to the west away from here.  I don&apos;t think this direction (Southeast to Northwest) is a flight corridor - I see some planes from South to North (over the sea) and the ones arriving here, I see at a distance East to West.  I will observe more carefully from now on!  As I have estimated, the &quot;thing&quot; was really faster then a plane at cruise altitude.The additional impression I can tell is that at first I thought it was a tiny cloud... when I realized it was to fast and had points of light I was really frightened because I found strange, what appeared to me like a &quot;flying blade&quot;. I have even said to me - &quot;Oh my God, what is that?  I just calmed down when I thought it could be transparent, or, less frightening, a formation of smaller points of light.I have made a simple drawn of what it looked like.The blue shade is just an ilustration as it was in the same colour as the dark sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Craft was a ball of creamy yellow light fifteen in diameter two thousand feet in altitude.  No sound. Slow movement with pauses in speed yet kept moving steadily with slight side movements.  Odd: a fixed-wing plane coming from the South East intersected its flight path.  One quarter mile before they met, the light on the craft dimmed slowly.  The craft then flew steadily under the airplain as it disappeared into the night sky.", "Ground lights up and brings to our attention a huge glowing orange sphere over city.At approx. 21:45 I was greeting my wife outside as she pulled up in the driveway to our house. She turned of the car and shut off the headlights. 10 seconds passed, I was staring at the car when I saw the entire ground light up as if a bolt of lightning had struck within a 500 yard radius. My first thought was that someone was playing with a camera flash nearby because there were no clouds the sky was clear. I looked up and over towards Cassiopeia and spotted a huge glowing orange object. My wife ran over to where I was standing and we watched it flare up and settle into a consistent magnitude. Comparing it to a couple of stars, the object did not appear to move for the first 4 minutes or so. I ran and grabbed my binoculars and upon closer review, the object seemed to be spherical and above a 30,000 foot ceiling. I am assuming this because I could see a slight hint of atmosphere distorting the light. The event lasted approx. 6 minutes. At the end, the light flickered and faded rapidly. It did not look as though it was moving away, but rather that it lost its illumination much like T.V. set turning off in slow motion. From edge out, the light faded inward until only a small dot could be seen. The tiny dot then just disappeared.", "Air Force fired projectiles of some sort at alien craft and hit them directly, causing all of the craft fired upon to hit the ground.I witnessed for the first time the most unbelievable thing that proves something I didn&apos;t believe in before I witnessed it occur. The United States Government scrambled jets to intercept groups of alien craft all day long as I sat and watched it from my living room window. I am in such disbelief, because like I said I was not a firm believer in life outside of our own planetary system. It is the truth, the craft I saw moved so quick, made no noise, but our craft being F-15 fighters I believe or something similar in nature, we able to use their weapons systems, perhaps modified systems, and shot them down...catching flame and landing in the mountain range of the Rocky Mountains. The craft, all 9 of them, fell from the sky when our weapons hit them, which indicated to me that in fact they were destroyed. Right now I am certain that because it did not make the news, that there is a top secret cover up, naturally the government wanting to keep this under wraps and I can understand the reasoning. The craft kept appearing, making me believe that we were not being successful in hitting them with our weapons systems. I saw trails, indicating something was fired from our craft towards theirs. Then I saw two craft together, indicating to me that in fact we were destroying their craft afterall, since they struck both craft together and they fell to the ground at a fast pace. The total number of planes of our aircraft varied throughout the day as they scrambled to attack them, but they arrived quickly and to my surprise given that our craft appear to be such lower in technology than theirs...but to my surprise again, simple systems of weaponry brought down what must have been intruders in our airspace and caught or detected by Space Command or Norad, or some other top secret detection facility...I&apos;m convinced that we must have such things now that I am convinced that we&apos;ve had bad visitors from outerspace. Their craft were triangular in shape, could move in any direction in an instant, but for some ! reason t hey weren&apos;t able to duck and weave whatever weapon it was that the United States Air Force was firing upon them, which was something unconventional you could tell by their streams that they left in the air...very different looking, almost as if to trace the location of the missiles from start to finish. I believe, knowing weapons systems very well from the Reagan era that are in use today, despite treaties, that satellites lit up the craft from the sky up high, and the missiles were guided directly to their targets without fail. I did see one alien craft seem to disappear in an instant, or it traveled from its location in an instant. All 9 craft that I saw were hit and fell to the ground behind some mountains. All scrambling jets ceased to fly once they were shot down, but it&apos;s not reported in the media and I haven&apos;t heard of anyone else seeing what I saw. So I do know it&apos;s being covered up in large scale. This is not the first sighting I&apos;ve had with triangular craft. A group of about 7 or so flew directly over my condo one night, had zero noise in propulsion, flew very slow, and were lit up from beneath for all to witness, didn&apos;t seem to be afraid of showing themselves off. This event was in Lakewood, CO at the time probably 2 years ago.", "Unsual aircraft with bright light and almost no engine noise.I was just reading about the black triangle sightings that happened around 2-19-07 to 2-22-07.  I thought I would add one more to the mix.  I don&apos;t remember the exact date, but it was in that time frame.I was sitting in my living room watching TV.  From my position I can see through the dining room window.  The sun had already went down and it had just gotten completely dark.  I estimate it was around 7:00 to 8:00 PM.  I see a bright light through the trees tops across the street.  My husband is sitting across the room with his back to the wall.  He has no view of the window.  He sees that I see something and ask what it is.  I said I see a bright light and it must be a helicopter searching for something.  My house faces east and the light was comeing from the east going west.  I go outside to get a better look and a few seconds later I am followed by my husband.  I told my husband that it is not a helicopter cause there is no noise.  Soon we could see the lights where the wings are suppose to be.  There was one on each side.  One was blue and the other is red.  I don&apos;t remeber which side one or the other was on.  The white light, which was in the middle and out front, outshone them by about 5X.  I assumed the white light was landing lights.  We started to hear a low roar from the engine.  It passed right over the top of our heads and just a little to the north.  I should of been able to see the landing gear and the noise from the engine should of deafen us.  This was not the case.  It was too quite and I couldn&apos;t see the plane.  I couldn&apos;t even make out the outline.  My husband made the comment that this is strange.  Viewing it from the rear the two lights on the side changed to one white and the other red.  I ran into the house to get the binoculars and out the back door, but it had already cleared the trees in the back. My husband and myself are both ex military.  We know what planes and helicopters sound like.  We can tell the difference in the helicopters by their sound.  We don&apos;t have to see them.  I am also retired from the FAA. We live east of an Airforce base.  There is a flight path behind our house going south to north.  This is the training path of the Airforce.  There is also a National Guard helicopter base to the south of us.  Their path is east to west south of our house.  The also sometimes go west to east on their return trip, but not all the time. I looked on the internet for information on the stealth plane.  Even though there is quite a bit of information about them it doesn&apos;t say that they are quite.

The other witness is my girlfriend, a paralegal, age 23. We were driving to our 7:30 dinner reservation, which we were late for, and as I was going along my street I saw a bright star off to my left. I&apos;m always looking out for ufos so I made some comment about this star to my girlfriend, and she replied to stop looking at it and look where I was driving. At the next intersection I turned left, and now the object was in the sky in front of us (and slightly left of the road). The light had grown and now it was no longer a star, but many blinking lights. Its altitude in the sky was much lower than a plane, maybe between 500 and 1000 feet up. My first thought was &quot;Damn that thing has lots of lights&quot; but I actually wrote it off as a plane because my eyesight is poor and I couldn&apos;t see any detail. Then a few seconds later my girlfriend (whose eyesight is better than mine) said &quot;What IS that thing?&quot; I looked over at it again and I asked her to tell me what she was seeing. She could actually see the solid object and said it was grey and egg shaped, and covered with blinking lights. It was flying about as fast as a plane or a helicopter, but erratically. I could see the blinking lights, which were multicolored (there were at least a dozen lights to my reckoning), but my eyesight was not good enough to discern the shape. By this time it had flown further to our left. I said &quot;screw the reservation!&quot; and I took the next left to follow it. The trees obscured our view temporarily but I drove in the direction that it was in the sky. As soon as we got to a clearer view, the object was nowhere to be seen. We were both very baffled, because it should&apos;ve been visible in the sky.", "solid red light aircraftI just spotted a aircraft flying over Austin TX traveling NW which is a normal route for air traffic.The lights on the air craft were not strobes, and according to the FAA every air craft must have a strobe.The light configuration was red light (very bright) in the rear. and a very dim greenish white light in the front.I tracked the craft with a 90mm telescope and could not see an outline of the craft or reflections of the lights on the crafts body.There was an air distortion with an elongated oval shape with sharp points where the lights are from the profile view of the craft.The craft transited the sky at what appeared to be average aircraft speed. It maintained speed and heading through out the entire time.

It was evening and dark but not too late &ndash; I would venture to guess it was bet. 6:30 and 7:30pm.  We saw something that astonished us in the night sky.  Looking NW we saw a huge vessel that was not very high in the sky, over the field in the back of our house.  We lived on a court and there was a 3 or 4 acre field behind our house.  The UFO was about 500 feet up, moving very slowly toward the SE, noiselessly.  I have a very good picture in my mind of it &ndash; it largely resembled the typical UFO spacecraft, just like the &ldquo;Jupiter Two&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Lost in Space&rdquo; series.  On the bottom of the craft were large, lit panels. We all remarked upon this &ndash; how amazing it was to see.  We knew instantly that what we were seeing was otherworldly.  It was so close, so large, and moving without sound.  After it departed, at a constant but slow speed, I don&rsquo;t know why we didn&rsquo;t just all go back inside and call the police.  I do remember that we went inside to tell my father what we had seen (he was home babysitting my little brother), but we then just proceeded to go on to church.  We all compared notes in the car ride to church, &ldquo;Yep, it looked just like the Jupiter Two&rdquo; we agreed.  At church we asked folks if they had seen it &ndash; only one or two people said they had heard there was some kind of large weather balloon in the area that was being tested.  This was no weather balloon.  It was directly over the field in our backyard. I know what I saw.  I&rsquo;d love to see it again sometime.  Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have the presence of mind to videotape next time!  (I do not know the exact date of this event.  I thought the year had to be &rsquo;73 or &rsquo;74.

I first spotted a very faint amber object about 150 feet in the night sky above Waller Creek running alongside San Jacinto St in front of the UT Art Building.  At first I thought it was a balloon or parachute floating, but as I observed it more intently, it was more of a dim, amber/golden glow, roughly trapezoidal, but it was more amorphous and had no hard edges.  I had dark shades running through it, as if something were inside it, or possibly surrounding the glow--it was hard to tell.  I tracked it visually as it flew silently, north over Waller Creek at a steady, slow pace maintaining the same altitude. I then noticed that below the amber object were two very dim points of light similar to stars that were moving with it.  The points of light were at odd angles from the amber glow and their distance from each other formed an uneven triangle.  All three lights moved together and stayed in the same triangular formation. My eyes were transfixed as I tried to determine what it could have been.  Being an artist with excellent observational skills, I flipped through every possible explanation in my head: It didn&rsquo;t even remotely resemble a plane.The moon and stars don&rsquo;t fly along.The objects were not solid like a balloon, parachute, weather balloon, or any other aircraft. Also, the amorphous quality of the amber glow and the dimness of the two moving star-like objects just didn&rsquo;t make sense to me, compared with regular airplanes I&rsquo;ve seen hundreds of times before.  Something was just not right about this thing. I thought about running to keep up with it, but I was exhausted from having just run 4 miles at the track, and I think it was traveling too fast to follow on foot, though a car could have kept up with it easily. As the objects moved farther away, my bus showed up and I had to leave.  When I got on the bus and looked around at people, I had a heightened sense of awareness of my surroundings, particularly my visual and olfactory senses--lights were much more intense than usual and I was acutely aware of everyone&rsquo;s movements and of the faintest smells around me. For the rest of the night I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about the UAP.  I kept thinking about what normal object would match what I had seen earlier, but there were none.  I know what I saw and it was anything but normal. I&rsquo;m very reluctant to mention this to anyone, but I thought it important to at least report what I witnessed.", "Observed white, green and red lights hovering with very fast rotation in the form of diamond shape moving very slow  upward!Green, white and red mix of lights started out just above tree line about 22:15 and we observed it as it moved upward without moving east or west up to around 23:00 before we went to bed. After about 45 min. it had elavated to the point of having to look almost straight up.The lights looked like they where spinning so fast it made the form of a diamond shape. We observed many planes during that time and compared them,no chance of a plane or helicopter or any kind of aircraft like I had ever seen before. We used Nikon spotting scope and High powered Nikon Bino. I read a post on this sight from 1/31/07 a couple from Bushey, England recently very much decribing the same kind of object.

The orb itself was incredibly bright but it cast no light around it.  It seamed very low because it so large, it filled my entire view coming over the house and flew past the window.  It gave off the sound of a very deep sounding yell.  The sound was pretty quite but still unmistakable that the orb was making it.It was way to large for a plane and it was almost like a perfect circle.  The bottom drooped down.

At first I thought it was a shooting star but shooting stars have a long tail as it enters the atmosphere.  The object that I was looking at was bright and all of the sudden this object split into two bright lights and dimmed at exactly the same time and seemed to have vanished but that wasnt it, there was another object that appeared as soon as the lights split.  It came from between the burst of light and traveled straight.  I doubt that it was a plane because I have never seen a plane travel that fast and I am for sure that this event did not occur in the earths atmosphere.

Neighbors also saw it. I reported it to the police, but nothing cam of that.  After all these years I decided I want to let the sighting be known for whatever good it might do in the search for the truth. I was living on Normandy Drive, Pisactaay, N.J., at the time.  It was 8pm and at that time of year the sun is low in the western sky, but the sky is still bright and clear.  I usually went out back at this time to watch the sunset.  My yard ended at railroad tracks and power lines that went east to west.  Across a field on the opposite side I had a clear view of the distant Watchung Mountains in the northwest direction from my yard.  It was a cloudless clear sky.  I was facing due west.  The sun had just gone behind the mountains so it did not obstruct my vision.  After a while I noticed a small oblect in the sky coming from the west to east, not far from and paralleling the power lines.  It was coming directly towards me.  I thought nothing of it at first.  As it got closer I noticed it had an odd shape.  At first I thought it was a hot air baloon.  But, as it came closer and grew larger, I could see that it was in the classic shape of a flying saucer.  It came almost directly  overhead and it had to be at least 100 ft. in diameter or larger.  When it was nearly overhead, aboout 350 yards at its closest point to me, it made a 90 degree turn and went north gaining in altitude as it went.  I ran to get my neighbors.  Four of them came out and saw the saucer, but only after it had gained some altitude and distance so they did not see it nearly as close up as I did.  They were none the less amazed at what they saw because even when they saw it, it was plain to see that it was no known conventional aircraft.  There was a small local airport not too far away and my house was under major flyways for the N.Y. and Newark City area airports.  Usually at any given time you can go out and look up and see various normal aircraft or j! et trail s in the sky.  On this occasion, the sky was oddly empty except for one small private plane coming from from the direction (west) of the local small airport.  The small plane came to a distance of about half way between me and the departing UFO.  Even at these distances the UFO could be seen to be well over twice the size of the plane.  The plane looked like it was a two or four seater.  The plane suddenly made a 180 degree curved turn about and flew back in the direction of the airport.  I thought that was a strange maneuver.  We watched the UFO until it faded from sight into the distance.  At no time did we hear any noticable sounds at all coming from the UFO.  I told other neighbors later on, naturally, they thought I was crazy.  My neighbors who saw the flying saucer with me would not talk to any one but me about it.  To this day I regret that I didn&apos;t get any photos of the UFO, for that would have made it easier for meto tell this story, if I had photos to show as back up.  But that doesn&apos;t mean others in the general area didn&apos;t see the UFO as well.  So, someone may have photos of the incident after all.  I owuld like to know if anyone else has reported this sighting in May 1982.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

And it was on TV 13 news But thay did not show it.", "Solid, silent Black Triangle UFO over Franklin, MassachusettsIn the early evening on March 30th, 2006 my girlfriend and I watched a perfectly equilateral triangular-shaped craft travel across the sky while seated outside on the back porch of our home in Franklin, Massachusetts.  The craft was totally silent and we could clearly see that is was a solid object. The craft had about 8 dim pin point white lights across the back edge of the craft, no other lights were apparent on the craft. It was traveling from the southwest to the northeast.  We were able to watch it for approximately 8 seconds before it disappeared behind trees. The speed was comparable to a normal commercial jet flying over our home on an approach to Boston Logan Airport.  We have commercial aircraft fly over frequently, and if this was a commercial or similar sized jet we would have easily heard the engines, as we always do - yet at the time this was the only craft in the sky and it was completely silent.  If I had held my hand out at arms length, and trying to estimate the size, it would have been close to, or a little larger than, the size of an American quarter.  There was a definite thickness to the triangle shape, the thickness being roughly about 5% of it&apos;s length.  The sky was not completely dark yet at this time, and it was easy to see that the craft&apos;s color was a very dark gray, not quite as dark as the clear sky behind it.  It was being slightly lit by the ambient light left over from sunset and the lights of the town, and it was not shiny but more &quot;semi-gloss&quot; in texture - there is no doubt that it was a completely solid perfect equilateral shaped triangle, and very large. The weather conditions were completely clear, not a cloud in the sky.  Immediately after the sighting I came in the house and contacted Brian Vike of HBCCUFO Research by telephone and made a verbal report, which can also be seen on his website at www.hbccufo.org.  This is not my first UFO sighting, but it was my first triangle sighting.  My first UFO sighting was as an Airman in the USAF in August of 1978 in Phelan, California, it was a multiple sighting with 3 glowing oval-shaped craft.", "This is true!  My husband and I were driving home from a meeting I had had in Phoenix,we were past the town of Gila Bend,Az I know this much when suddenly on our left side we saw lights that were in a V shape blinking like crazy we were not so much scared but more in awe, then I got panicky because I had only heard of the Phoenix lights but never actually seen them or knew what shape they were in I still don&apos;t know. This went on for quite a while the lights blinking in a manner that spacecraft from earth would, the speed was too incredibly fast. I think that maybe it was 2 objects that I saw I cannot be sure, never will be. I asked mu husband to pull over to an approaching rest stop but he wouldn&apos;t he said he just wanted to get home, I&apos;m not from Arizona originally so I don&apos;t know exactly what town follows Gila Bend. These lights went on for a while they seemed really close but I felt as if other cars were either not seeing or just plain ignoring these lights, my husband and I quickly decided we were just not going to look in that direction (of the lights)and started making excuses to one another about what they were, who they were.

I was watching TV but the blinds were open and a bright light appeared from behind the edge of the rooftop of the house opposite mine.  The object was in view for approximately 30 minutes and then it disappeared behind the outline of the chimney on the same house opposite.I am 22 years old and a recent Psychology graduate.  I am currently studying in preparation to begin a medical degree in September 2007.  I have perfect eyesight and at the time of viewing this object, I was completely sober and alert.  I&rsquo;m now writing this description immediately after viewing the object.As the object appeared from behind the edge of the rooftop it caught the corner of my eye as I was watching TV.  It was hard to determine the shape because it was obviously very far away, but it seemed round.  I thought it might be a star but because I live in London it is unusual to see such a bright star and with the naked eye I could not see any other stars in the sky from my living room.  This was partly because there is a sodium street lamp right outside my house which generates quite a lot of orange light.I noticed almost immediately that this round bright object was pulsating.  I would say it was pulsating every 3-5 seconds.  Also I originally thought it was white but soon realised it was actually very colourful. It was predominantly a bright white but parts of it were blue and red.  With the naked eye it was about the size of a typical large star in the night sky.I went to get some binoculars and then the colours and pulsating were very obvious - it was quite mesmerizing.  Through the binoculars I could see some very faint stars in the night sky around the object and I would say the object was 5 times as large as the stars and 10 times as bright.  It was very bright to look at through the binoculars which actually caused me to become dazed after a few minutes of constantly watching it to the point that I needed a short break.It definitely wasn&apos;t an aircraft because it was too far away and because the pulsating colours were very different from the blinking lights of an aircraft i.e., the pulses were non-uniform and the colours de-localised.  I live under the flight path to Heathrow Airport, so I&apos;m very familiar with aircraft and what they look like from all altitudes.  I wouldn&apos;t say it was a star because it was moving too fast across the sky and conversely it was too slow to be an aircraft.I thought, that maybe it was a satellite.  Anyway, the object was moving South at about 1 degree every 3 minutes.  I&apos;d be interested to see if anyone else reports it.((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the source of the report, inquiring whether he might have been viewing the star, Sirius.

The night was remarkably clear and I could see all the stars pretty clearly.  There were a number of airplanes flying on the normal approach paths.  Sirius and Orion were prominent in the Southern sky.  The planes approaching SFO and other Bay Area airports routinely stack up in both a southeast and easterly approach corridor. My eye caught a very bright orange colored light that was roughly aligned to the southeast approach, but definitely the wrong color for airplane landing lights (of which I see many).  The light of this object was very bright, a bright rust red/orange, at least 2 to 3 time the brightness of Sirius but the color of Mars through a telescope (I am a life-long amateur astronomer).  I&rsquo;d watched it for 10 seconds or so and was wondering why it didn&rsquo;t have any navigation lights because up this point, I was assuming it was a commercial aircraft.  I&rsquo;m quite familiar with aviation.  I finally mentioned it to my youngest daughter, that I think that object is a UFO, but really half jokingly, expecting any second to see the red/green navigation lights, a strobe or some indication of normal aircraft appearance.  It was certainly Unidentified and Flying (or Orbiting) and it was definitely an Object of some kind.  The speed across the sky suggested an aircraft or satellite and it moved silently as far as I could surmise above the noise of the other people.  I&rsquo;m not sure any else noticed and I admit I was too shy to point, and say, &quot;Hey, look a UFO!&quot;  My youngest daughter had dashed off in a different direction to seek my other daughter (about 15 seconds into the observation) because there was still nothing unusual other than the bright steady color.  I continued to watch for another 20-30 seconds or so. About this time I looked down to unbuckle my digital camera to try for a picture, although with the glare of the parking lot and lack of any tripod, I didn&rsquo;t really hope for much, even at full zoom.  However, by this time it faded suddenly as it crossed Orion&rsquo;s belt over the span of 3-5 seconds.  Strangely, satellites usually brighten as they head out of the shadow of the Earth and go into sunlight.  This object had the opposite behavior, approaching from deep shadow brightly becoming dim as it moved toward the west.My daughter rejoined me and I told her that our object just vanished before my eyes.  I came home and wrote up and drew what I had just seen.  The most remarkable part of the event was that Sirius, the brightest stellar object in the sky, was clearly much more point-like and dimmer than the object, which passed within a few degrees of the star on its way toward Orion, and therefore provided an excellent comparison object.  The object seemed initially to have almost a planetary disk appearance, which was not twinkling or point like but more like a circular smudge.  As it faded, it became much more point like and finally vanished.  I&rsquo;ve seen satellites &quot;flares,&quot; and the color tends to be very white.  This object was clearly a different color than any satellites I&rsquo;ve seen.  If I was to speculate it could have been a spacecraft or very slow moving orbital object skipping off the atmosphere.  At no time did it move in a way that suggested intelligent control so I can&rsquo;t say for certain it was anything but &quot;a highly unusual sighting.&quot;", "video footage of  USO/UFO ignored  (brilliant).

IT HAD 3 WHITE LIGHTS, FORMING WHAT LOOKED LIKE A TRIANGLE, AND ONE RED LIGHT IN THE REAR.  NONE OF THESE LIGHTS WERE FLASHING.  I OBSERVED THE OBJECT THROUGH MY BINOCULARS, WHICH WERE IN ARMS REACH, JUST INSIDE THE DOOR, AND COULD CLEARLY SEE THE MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT, WHICH SEEMED TO BE HOVERING, MOVING IN SPORADIC, SMOOTH MOVEMENTS CENTERING IN ONE LOCATION. I YELLED FOR MY DAUGHTER AND BOYFRIEND TO COME SEE.  BOTH WITNESSED THIS AS WELL AS A NEIGHBOR, ONE RIDGE BEHIND ME.  I REACHED INSIDE AGAIN, ABOUT 7 OR 8 MINUTES LATER FOR A SECOND PAIR OF BINOCULARS, AND TURNED BACK AROUND TO FIND THE OBJECT GONE, WITHOUT A TRACE.", "Mysterious light observed near Vandenberg AFBMy co-worker and I were southbound on the 101 and we both noticed a shimmer of light approximately 30 degrees off of the southern horizon.  Neither of us responded, believing it to be a reflection of a distant aircraft.  Until it grew in intensity and it changed its shape; now an elongated diamond-shape. This &apos;flare&apos; lasted about 15 seconds and gradually faded, the entire time holding its position. After 3 minutes the light abruptly dropped about 10 degrees downward and slowly fade out. The interesting thing was that we knew our heading and we knew that due south, precisely where this mysterious light shone, is Vandenberg Air Force Base.", "Orange and white light spheres in the woodsThis event occured during the summer at my parents house in Stonington CT.  I was outside one night smoking a cigarette and I noticed two orangeish / dark yellow lights, maybe 100-150 yards away, traveling together from left to right through the neighboring woods.  One was slightly higher than the other, but both were relatively close to the ground around 8-10 feet or so, and the shapes were spheres.  From where I was the lights looked like the size to that of a cd.  They had a constant steady rate of speed which I would say was about 5 mph but did not illuminate the trees / wooded area where the lights were.  They were just there and nothing else was lit up in the woods.  I spotted the lights in the woods a couple other nights that week, except they were across the yard in a different locations, or were spread out- it was like the lights were there, and then they were gone.  Each time I saw the lights it lasted about 5-10 seconds and then they were gone.  I did not see any other shapes than that of light spheres.  I thought it was strange, and told my parents.  They did not believe me, but the whole thing was spooky. A few weeks later it was late at night, around midnight, and I was watching tv.  A very very bright white light the shape of a sphere and about the size of a tennis ball passed by in front of the window and was gone.  This was different from the other lights I saw as they were orangeish, and this was a very bright light and scared the hell out of me.  The room where the tv is on the backside of the house that faces the woods.  I had the feeling that it was watching me as it went by. Curious if anyone else has seen orange &amp; white moving lights like this in the area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Last night, a sonic boom woke all four of us. The boom repeated about 8 times. We ran to the edge of the forest to see what was happening, and from somewhere in the middle, a large round disk, about 300 yards away rose up and sped off in the opposite direction (south). The bottom of it was mezmerizing, like a light show. A large blue light in the center of it moved around in a spiral toward the outer edges; and the object was outlined in a flashing changing color light. The next day, we followed one of our trails to where the object had been. What we founfd was unbelivable. A 40ft by 40ft area of the forest, in the shape of a circle, had no leaves at all. None were on the ground, and there were no plants. And all around the area lush greens leaves were everywhere. The trees were untouched, no branch was out of place. The end. P.S.

It was like a star appeared, then grew very bright..brighter then any other star in the sky and then dimmed to roughly the same luminousity as the rest...THEN it began to move in an arc very similiar to other sattelites that we have seen. Constant speed and direct slow path across the sky at a very high altitude. The thing that stumped me was to see it clearly appear and grow brighter while remaining absolutely stationary relative to the other stars visible and then a grow dimmer and THEN start to move in the drifting like unchanging arc across the sky like you see with Sattelites. It was clearly stationary first. Almost as if something entering orbit?

Normally I wouldn&rsquo;t have paid any attention, except there were no flashing lights and they were very low to the ground I&rsquo;d say close to three hundred feet off the ground.   They were very still and seemed to be motionless.I decided to pull into the parking lot of the grocery store so I could get a better view.  I pulled to the side where the field was and sat facing the field so I could observe this.  The whole time I was speaking on the phone to my boyfriend.  When I finally parked the car I could see that these were not just two big lights rather they were a multitude of lights arranged in a triangular shape. I rolled down my window and the only sound was that from the hwy behind me, no noise as that of a plane could be heard. The first craft began to move south at a slow pace. I&rsquo;d say at a maximum speed of 10mph. Then a moment later the second craft followed. The first craft had a row of four white lights, then a row of three, the middle light on this row was red. Then a row of two lights and one light to complete a triangle. The red light in the center of the craft was blinking, but all other white lights remained solid and consistent. The second craft was exactly the same as the first one, however it lacked the red light, only white lights in the shape of a triangle. As the crafts moved over head you could make out a faint shape around the triangle, the only way you could even notice was that it would block out stars as it moved even though the triangle part wasn&rsquo;t over the star yet. Both craft continued at this slow pace until I could not see them from the front anymore and then they became invisible in the night sky.I didn&rsquo;t have anyone else in the car, nor did I have a camera. Believe me I wish I had both! Where I live is close to Red Stone Arsenal (military base) and Huntsville used to be headquarters for NASA.

During its flight path it dropped a small object that was also bright in color.  I would say that it was a meteor or something to that affect but the dropped object did not stay in an angle path with the first.  It completely stopped when ejected and then drifted toward the ground.  The big light was moving at an incredible speed and was at best 4 miles from me.  The sighting ended when both objects vanished (they did not dim out they were there and then they weren&rsquo;t).

The lights were arranged in a horizontal line in a set of three.  They weren&apos;t very bright.  The lights were an equadistance apart.  They did seem to be at verying distance from us as some of the crafts (sets of light) seemed to be farther away or at least the lights were closer together like they would appear if the crafts were farther away. The lights were all the same color - white and it was quite dark and there was a high cloud cover so there were no stars. The lights (crafts) were spread out all across the sky at varying distances. I thought it could have been some kind of reflection or a peculiar bending of light but I couldn&apos;t see how it could be so widespread and appear to be at varying depths.

Friday, Feb.2At 4:30 p.m., Friday February 2nd I was traveling south from Schaumburg when I spotted two brightly lit, elliptical shapes in the sky. I have trouble gauging distances but I would say they were at least five to ten miles away.  They &quot;floated,&quot; or &quot;hovered,&quot; with no apparent propulsion system, moving south-southwest. Between the shapes was a light that flashed every fifteen seconds. What intrigued me most was the fact that the shapes did not change in distance between each other as they moved. I was too far away to view any details, if there were any. My initial thought was that they were cloud formations, but after seeing them move for twenty minutes I did not see any change to them, and they remained equidistant from each other. Then I thought that they could have been a pair of airplanes pulling advertisement banners. I have seen these planes over the last few months, but they stayed fairly close to the Schaumburg region. These shapes were quite a distance away from Schaumburg. They were not jets, blimps or other aircraft that I&rsquo;ve seen before. Anybody else see these things?  (digital illustration attached)"]
