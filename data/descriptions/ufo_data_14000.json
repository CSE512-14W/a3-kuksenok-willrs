["Sightiings of 5 stationary objects, about 30 degrees obove horizon at Hollywood Beach, Florida, on a warm sunny afternoon.We were on the  beach and had watched a plane take off over the water and it crossed in front of the moon. Then my wife saw a light which looked like a bright star about 9oclock(using moon as center) 10 degrees from the  moon.  This was a clear day with bright sun. then at 5 oclock, using first object as center, about 5 degrees from the first object,another appeared. After about 10 minutes 3 less visible (about 1/4 as bright) objects appeared, in a straight line (using second object as center), at 6,5,4 oclock at about 2 degrees below the lower objet and lined upward at about a 45 degree angle to the horizon.  Because these were less visible the two witnesses could not see them.All three of us saw the first 2 objects . All objects seem to be stationary. With the bright sun and clear skys I feel that what we saw was indeed 5 objects that were stationary and the sun was hitting them at an angle to reflect light  towards earth.", "Array of lights at the Oregon, Nevada, California border.The following report was submitted by Oregon UFO Research team member and long time UFO investigator Jean Bilodeaux in Northern California. This sighting has multiple witnesses, three total and took place near the Oregon, Nevada, California border. Many thanks to Jean for passing on this sighting and we will post any further information that comes forth in the future.Eric Byler - OUFOR.Jeans report...The first two witnesses live in Lake City, Calif. The town is not on all maps and is located approx. 10 miles north of Cedarville and 16 miles south of Ft. Bidwell. The first few sightings were estimated to occur over Fee Reservoir, which is barely in California and maybe partly in Nevada (The state line tends to vary from year to year). The third witness lives in Ft. Bidwell and saw the light over Bidwell Mountain which straddles the state line between California and Oregon (this mountain is NNW of Ft. Bidwell). The lights were spreading out to the north and south from the initial sighting.The sightings reported to me last night, 02-12-02 were large, bright orange lights in the sky. A man was soaking in his hot tub around 7:30 p.m. He had a view to the north and northeast, with almost no lights except for a small town (about 30 lights) 16 miles to the north. His attention was drawn to a bright light suddenly appearing in the northeast, (SE Oregon, NW Nevada or NE California)around 7:45 p.m. It was bright orange, and appeared suddenly about 10 degrees above the horizon over an unpopulated area. It was visible for about 1-2 seconds. It was just on and off...&quot;A light being switched slowly on and then off.&quot; This was followed in turn by two lights, one light, three lights, one light, two lights, etc. Perhaps a total of about a dozen lights. They were miles apart and not associated with any populated area or roads. There is no commercial air traffic in the locations where the lights were seen. There were no &apos;tails&apos; or anything to indicate these lights were meteors or satellites. The man viewing these lights has seen both meteors and satellites while soaking in his hot tub. They were not planets. He called to his wife and she saw three lights appear at once. She also felt they were not naturally occurring phenomena. The last light seen that night occurred when the man was reporting his sightings to me via telephone, at 8:00 p.m. The couple also called a friend that lived in the town to the north and asked them to look outside. The man went outside and saw the 8:00 p.m. light. None of the people that reported seeing the unidentified objects that night drink alcoholic beverages or indulge in illicit drug use. They are credible people and the first couple invited me to their home that evening in hopes of all of us seeing more lights. Unfortunately that was not the case.This is just another in a long series of lights being seen in this area. One such sighting, several years ago, was filmed with a video camera for 2 seconds before the couple tried to zoom in on the objects. The camera lost focus, but the existing footage was sent to Jeff Sainio to be analyzed. Jeff estimated the lights to be from a UFO approximately 750 feet in diameter. Another couple substantiated the sighting, which at times consisted of up to eight unidentified flying objects. UFOs are seen several times a year in this area. Some encounters have been very close-within 12 feet; some with interaction among the objects-shooting lasers at each other; missing time, a crop circle, and other anomalous events have occurred in this vicinity. The first and possibly only photo documentation of UFOs and abductions occurring together was in this area. Many of these events have had multiple witnesses, some with photo documentation. I believe this sighting to be another in a long series of sightings to occur here.((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Jean Bilodeaux, ultimate source of this report.

We had been invited to have chicken gumbo at their home. After finishing supper my Dad had fallen asleep while watching T.V. It was around 2:00 a.m. before we finally left for home. We were traveling east on Pineville Rd. when all of a sudden the entire inside of our vehicle lit up a bright blueish/white. We had no idea what was going on and were scared half to death. The light seemed to extend to either side of us. There were fenced fields to our left and right near the road and the light touched just beyond the fences to the best of my recolection. There was no sound and no other vehicles in the area. I remember my Dad stopping the car. My Mom said...&quot;What&apos;s that...where is it coming from&quot;? I was sitting in the middle of the back seat and couldn&apos;t figure out what was happening. My first instinct was to look up because I thought the overhead car light had turned on, but then quickly remembered it was busted out. I believe Dad had stepped out of the car, crossed the ditch to the right of us, looked out in the field, came back and said...&quot;It&apos;s not coming from out there&quot;. The next thing I remember is riding the rest of the way home and entering the house, looking at the digital clock on the dining table (can&apos;t remember what time it read) and going to bed.The next morning while Mom and I sat at the table sipping on a cup of tea she remarked...&quot;I wonder what that was...it seemed to come from above and behind us. I was too scared to turn around&quot;. Well we were all terrified...of what I don&apos;t know. It seemed almost &apos;taboo&apos; to discuss the subject. We all felt violated for some reason. Nothing made sense to any of us. We felt like silence was an &apos;instruction&apos; and we wern&apos;t suppose to talk about this occurance. It still haunts me today because I can&apos;t remember just what this was that invaded our lives. Both my parents are deceased now and I can only hope one day I&apos;ll find the a! nswers.((NUFORC Note:  We can only guess at the date.  We have assigned an arbitrary date, so that the case sorts to the 1970&apos;s.

It was traveling from northeast to southwest it seamed to suddenly drop from the sky and followed a path that started high and decreased lower in the sky even though when the object did disappear it was still very high but lower from where it started.We lisitened for an explosion like fireworks, but we heard or saw nothing. We figured it could not have been a meteor because the object would have been white, red, or yellow and it would have not followed a curved arc shaped path. The object from our car window was very large and it was travling at an extremly fast pace, like a falling star. The object had a faint blue center surounded in green. There was no tail. You could defiently see a blue dot in the center of the object and you could also notice where the objects edges were. When the object disappered it was going very fast and was still very high above the horizon. It disappered instantly with no explosion, sound, or change of shape or color.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from the east coast for this date.

The kids walked off but me and my husband stayed and watched it as we thought it may be a weather ballon or a hot air balllon.We then thought it couldnt be a air ballon as it was static in the sky and it was dark and it couldnt be a weather ballon because of what happeneed next. The object then moved very quickly maybe 200-300 miles per hour in a straight line and as we watched it seemed to change shape in to a squashed diamond. We lost sight of it but new what we had seen was a UFO.I beleive to this date it was some sort of surveillance object either government or Extra Teresteral.", "This is not an untrue personal statement as I witnessed what I believe to be an intelligent subset of life.While walking down the street something appeared in my peripheral vision.  Something was glowing to my right and this illumination was about 30 feet in the air.  As soon as my vision settled on the clump of mass, and my vision is ultra clear and good at distance viewing, the glowing orange yellow fire transformed into a ball object about basketball sized.  This ultra fast change appeared to be through a small explosion.  There was no shockwave or noise.  All of this happened in approximately 1.5 seconds.  100% quick rings then traveled across the front of the house.  This is what that ball changed in to.  It seemed the rings emerged simultaneously as the ball emerged and exploded from the growing clump of mass.  The rings were 3 or more feet in size and they kept their shape as they flashed and strobed.  They went from the street to the roof area of the house in what appeared to be a tiny sliver of time.  I was still able to track these parts through time.  These ring forms then combined into a single perfectly circular disk about 4 feet across.  This object was reveled to me in its unobstructed entirety.  I had a full frontal view of this disk.  It was stationary at the roof area of the house and perfectly circular.  It&apos;s coloration was off-white.  The object was not empty.  I saw shadows within.  They were about 2 feet long and narrow.  The sides of these shadowy objects were wavy.  There was not a flicker of movement as this disk levitated in front of me.  I gazed at it for approximately 2 seconds.  It then left my field of vision on a vanish.  It did not fade away or streak into the sky under some discernable propulsive power.  This single series of unique events occurred in the sequence I report.  The specific moments and incidents occurred at that time and place.  The events that happened will be remembered.  For the remainder of my life I will have a blast of total remote recall.  It will be remembered vividly.  On that morning something alien fully entered my consciousness.  Something unc! anny and mysterious inserted itself into my consciousness.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he seemed quite sincere.  We received a large-scale map from the witness, which indicates where the object was sighted at a corner on 35th Avenue.  PD))", "Large triangular craft observed over Great Falls Montana.At approximately 03:00 hrs on Dec 29th,01 a triangular craft was spotted on the east edge of town adjacent to the Malmstrom AFB (GFA). The craft was about 50 yards in total length and almost as wide. The craft appeared to be at an altitude of 50 feet, made no sound at all and was traveling at a slow rate of speed (approx 25mph)heading south east toward the &quot;Little Belt&quot; mountains. As the&quot;Black&quot; craft flew over the point of observation, it was observed that it had a low glow of perimiter lights of pulsing greenish blue. As the craft exited over a small portion of the city it was opserved to dissapear or blend into the street lights rendering it unobservable with the exception that one could still make out the movement of the craft as it was blanking out the street lights when the craft got between the street lights and the point of observation. Once the craft exited the east notrheast portion of the city and proceeded over wheat fields the craft was no longer observable. It is interesting to note that in the local Great Falls news, we have had reports of cattle mutalations in the area.", "Unknown Cloud Around Object and changed color then vanishedmyself wife girlfriend at time and two step children were living in a small town called Crystal nevada 25 miles from the nevada test site it was about 11:00pm possibly 10pm we were walking down the towns main road when we saw a large white cloud in the clear night sky as we watched we saw what looked like a helicoptor with it&apos;s spotlight on flashing around in the cloud like it was looking for something after about 20 minets the light was gone the cloud started to get a brighter blue and then just faded away and was gone there was no sound at all it was there then it was gond i almost for got the cloud was i&apos;de say 100 feet directly in front of us and about 100 feet in the air it was a white cloud before it turned blue and vanished there were other sightings but this is the first i reported even though it has been a while a computer was not avilible at the time  there was another where myself and some friends lost 2 hours after we went around a turn in the mountains we ended up at the end of the highway we were on wondering what happend i have not reporthd any of these sightings because i know how UFO sightings are treated when reported", "Low flying UFO sighted in the Kendall Florida AreaWhile driving down a street next to a dimly lit park, we noticed a bright red &quot;flair-like&quot; light in the sky.  At first, it had a sort of tail like a comet, but it faded away.  The light continued to &quot;glide&quot;forward through the sky till it slowed down (almost to a hault) and split into 3 red lights, but a less intense red.  The first object continued on the same path, but the other two stayed behind to form a triangle and became a white halogen light.  The two lights that were left behind aligned parellel to each other.  Those two lights began going up and down (like the cylenders of an engine) and dissapeared into space as the first light (which was still red)continued on the same path and dissapeared into the sky as well.  Shortly after the sighting, when the car was parked and the key was out of the ignition, one of the windows was left down.  Out of coincedense, the passenger pushed the button for the window to go up (without the key in the ignition)and the window rolled up.  To our surprise, all of the windows were operating with the car completely off.  After a minute or so, the windows stopped (almost like the battery died).  After we had dinner and came home we were observing the sky around the area where we previously sighted the UFO.  There was a military search plane (we know this because one of us had served in the army) circling the same area we had seen the object an hour earlier.  It circled around a few times, almost like it was trying to find the UFO.  We assumed they must have picked it up on radar because it seemed to be flighing low.  It was very strange.", "My brother and I saw what we thought was a car approaching on the rise of a hill.  The lights were so bright we turned our eyes away from them and shielded our eyes with our hands. We were riding a snow machine so we stopped and waited for  what we thought was a car. There was no sound and then the lights began to back up, and then dissapeared as if the driver had changed their mind and was going back down the hill instead of coming toward us. We got back on the snow machine and started up toward the road, but when we got to where the lights had been there were no tracks of any kind, not even snow machine tracks.  We continued on and then my brother told me to turn off the flashlight so the batteries would not wear down. I told him I didn&apos;t have the flashlight on and he said &quot;oh sh_t !  I looked down to where he had been looking and saw what looked like a number of light patterns that were running along beside us on the snow.  Each light pattern had like three separate lights.All of a sudden the light patterns took off and went through the woods, but not like normal lights. It was as if they were going somewhere and they did not float in the air they skimmed over the snow around trees and dissappeared over a hill.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

On this particular morning I was sitting on the couch looking out the picture window when I saw it...a round silvery white craft flying very slow and very low, maybe 20 yards in front of the house. It scared me so bad, I flew back to bed.I saw the very same type craft 21 years later. I was 30, married, with one child and another on the way. I don&apos;t know why that seems significant. The time was around 12 noon on a Friday and I was sitting in the turn-off lane to go to McDonald&apos;s to get some lunch. I had my 3 year-old daughter with me. She saw nothing though. The craft flew over some trees on the side of the highway, seemed to stop directly over where I was, hovered a few seconds and then zoomed away at lightening speed, faster than a jet. I know that it was faster than a jet because I thought, I&apos;ll be able to see it when I get closer to my house. I never saw it anymore. It was gone. Funny thing, I asked around to see if anyone else saw anything strange in the town of Burnsville that Friday at 12 noon. Evidently I was the only one who saw it. Or anyone else would feel stupid admitting to seeing something like that.But I know what I saw, both times.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was looking out the window at the sky towards the west when I saw a silver disk hovering stationary in the sky and reflecting the morning sun.  It didn&apos;t move or wobble at any time but just hovered in one spot.  It was very high up, I would guess above 10,000 feet or more because there were passenger jets above it to the left and right (southwest &amp; northwest).  It looked like it was part of the sky.  It was hovering without any movement in the same spot.  After watching it for about 15 seconds as it hovered, and without looking away, it disappeared.  Just like that.  It was no where to be seen.  It looked about the size of an air rifle pellet held at arms length.  The reflection on its surface from the morning sun made it stand out against the white clouds behind it.  (I&apos;ve seen jets at night approaching and facing me that look like one big light head on, until they turn into their landing pattern and you see the landing lights).  Again this sighting was at 8:40 a.m. in the morning with the back drop of the sky full of white clouds and other air traffic in the vicinity.  It resembled the Mexico city OVNI&apos;s and looked sort of hat shaped.", "UFO over Kansas City...What is it??I was walking my dog, a very clear night(you could see the stars(everywhere in the sky)).  My dog was sniffing at the sky, so I looked up.  I saw a silver egg-like (UFO) that was about 100 feet in the air and was silent.  It was flying in a south-west direction.  There were no lights, but it reflected light, signs, and even a light from a radio tower it went bye.  It looked almost exactly like the Bedhampton UFO that was video taped.  It looked like the UFO from Flight of the Navagator, but without the lines.", "Gaseous masses in the skyUpon leaving for my commute, i glanced up towards the rising sun. After a few sexonds the sun seemed to turn into a gray haze. It moved like a mass higher in the sky, then veered to the side and appeared to be coming towards me. At this point it split into two separate masses. These masses moved in opposite directions, 1 east 1 west, until they were enarly out of view. At this point, the reversed directions, headed straight toward eachother, and impacted with a flash of light.

I looked down Commercial st towards Albert Park to see an object floating in the air level with the top of the nearest biulding to us in the st.    It was very close to us, approx 20 metres up and 20 metres away and looked very big!! We saw a disc shaped craft (classic looking UFO) with a lot of glass looking windows on the top of the craft with lots of white light inside.   The bottom of the object was tilted towards us and I could see the flat disc shaped bottom of the object.    There were several half spheres prodruding from the base with lights shining from the edges of the spheres.It was at that point I thought &apos;Its a UFO!!&apos;    It reminded me very much of many pictures I have seen on TV and magazines.The object was quickly lost from our sight when a biulding obscured it as the taxi driver had not seen the object and had continued driving.   I made the driver go round the block and then drive around the area for 20 minutes.   We never saw anything further.The next day I scoured the papers, news on the tv and internet for other reportings, I never saw any other mention of this object.   This did seem strange to both me and my girlfriend as the object was very big and in the middle of Melbourne??? We went back the following night and nothing looked similar to what we saw.   I also walked down the street one day and there is a helicopter landing pad further down the st for a hospital.   I called them up and asked if they had spotted anything with there radar, etc.   They had had nothing reported.To this day we do not know what we saw, though it certainly was not a helicopter, reflected lights, etc.", "Grouping of rectangular or triangular objects, hovering, dancing around each other, absolutely silent, then rapid accleration.About 1 am I was outside with my dog, sitting watching the stars and I noted an airplane take off from the Sioux Falls airport.I was scanning the sky looking for falling stars etc., when my attention was drawn to a group of objects directly overhead. I can&apos;t say how high up they were, can&apos;t estimate size, but they were triangular to rectangular, a dull oranginsh brown color, and seemed to be reflecting the city lights or had a dull glow of their own. My initial thought was a small flock of geese, but as I watched I noted they seemed to be dancing around each other, changing positions but maintaining a close formation. As I watched, one of the objects swung out, moved to the front of the grouping, then began to accelerate to the northwest, with the others falling in behind; then the grouping accelerated out of view. What was so striking was these objects were absolutely silent, even as they accelerated. There&apos;s a fairly large air-guard base at the airport which is a couple miles north of my residence. I&apos;ve kept silent on this mainly because there have been no other reports of similar sightings in this area, and nothing about unusual phenomena reported from the air guard or airport radars.", "It was a warm July evening.  I was down by Southport Beach, on the shorelines of Lake Michigan.  It&apos;s a city beach in Kenosha, so i was there after curfew (10:00pm).  I liked going down there to gaze at the stars on clear warm nights in the Summer.  I was looking up at the Summer constellations toward the Eastern horizon over Lake Michigan.  The sky was absolutley clear, and hardly any humidity and no clouds that night.  I was staring at a section of sky just about 20 degrees downward from Polaris toward the Eastern horizon.....maybe where Casseopia&apos;s located.....when all of the sudden......DIRECTLY whithin my line of vision......this object appeared into my view...and quietly sailed across a section of the dark sky about 30 degrees in distance from my vantage point....how many miles in distance...I don&apos;t really know.....how high up in the air.....good question, since I really couldn&apos;t make out the size of the object.  This this appeared, then dis-appeared as fast as it was into view!  It made no sound....TOTALLY silent.  It was no meteorite, or shooting star.  I know what those look like in all of their many visits and forms.  This thing was definitely something from an &quot;intelligent&quot; source.  It was like it appeared in our three-dimensional realm then exited it just as fast. It was not in my peripheral vision, but I was lucky enough to view it directly, as fast as it happened.  I do not do drugs, nor have I ever. i don not consume alcohol, nor was I under the influence of any prescription medication.  I was as stone cold sober as a judge that evening. There were NO stores or restaurants having any &quot;Grand Openings&quot; in the surrounding area beaming huge floodlights into the sky, or anything like that.  Nor were there any clouds for light to relfect off of.....no aircraft of any sort in the area either.  It ABSOLUTELY defied any logic that I know of.  No &quot;aurora borealis&quot; phenomena scheduled that far south that time.  It was bizarre.  It was amber to orange colored....solid, yet defined and fuzzy edges ou! tlining the form/s. It was three oblong shaped forms, like three hot dogs right next to each other....or ONE object separated by two black lines, I don&apos;t know....they all travelled together, in unison with each other in the short time it appeared, then disappeared.  After I saw it....I was dumbfounded for a few moments....Like, &quot;What in the HELL was that??&quot;  Then I got into my car, and drove home and told my mother she, was like. &quot;Huh?&quot;.........then I just wrote the whole thing off after awhile....but it will always stay with my, because it NEVER seemed like one of those situations when you  &quot;see&quot; something out of the corner of your eye, but you&apos;re not really sure a few moments afterward if you really even SEEN something, but perhaps just some figment of the imagination, or some typical fleeting natural neurological phenomena....like seeing quick flashes out of the corner of your eye, when you move your head too quickly.  It NEVER seemed like anything like that.  It was TOO direct and straight within my line of vision, and it lasted AT LEAST two seconds long.  I don&apos;t know....you tell me.  There were no other people or cars anywhere near me either.  Now it&apos;s just a weird memory in the back of my mind.  I also have no history of neurological disorders, either.  Just thought I&apos;d clear any doubts up.  Anyway.........that&apos;s my story. I&apos;m 37 yrs. old now (Jan. 2002)........it was the first and last time I ever seen anything like that in my whole entire life.  I&apos;ve told some freinds of mine a few years afterward, but they all looked at me like I was a crackpot.  So I tell no one anymore.  We all see what we want, or would like to see in life, but lewt me tell you......I was NEVER looking for something like that, EVER.  I&apos;m not some UFO buff to begin with, yet now I&apos;ve joined the ranks of those who have seen one.   Take care.....and thanks for reading about my story (situation?).    ...........((name and e-address deleted))", "My coworker saw the blueish light too!!!I posted the previous description of the light seen on Midlothian Tnpk last night and found out today that my coworker (Alice W.)was telling the following story: She had left work and was at the light at Hull st and Hicks Rd and saw a fast moving blueish light higher than the treetops but lower than an airplane and much faster moving. She also saw what may have been a second stationary blueish light off to the right. Her description matched mine and I felt SO MUCH BETTER that someone else had seen the same thing. I called my husband immediately since he had been ribbing me about little green men. I don&apos;t know what it was but I know what I saw and now someone else saw it too!!!((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from the east coast for this date.  PD))", "It was a cloud of light, hovering over the cow field next door.Jesus, I swear, in my whole life I have never seen any like it. It was just there, as if it just appeared from no where. At first, I thought I was dreaming, but I felt sick to my stomach. I realized it was really happening. I had just stepped outside to scare off some fighting cats that were waking the dead. I looked up to star gaze for a moment when I saw it. It seemed to have no real shape, almost gas like, only it glowed. It was like lights being shined through dried ice or fog. Only the fog was hovering higher than the night clouds. I wasn&apos;t scare, just in awe. It lingered for about a minute, then it stretched out very thin and long. It stretched longer and thinner until it was no longer visible.", "The year &amp; month is estimated above, but the exact date will coincide with sightings of lights all over the midwest.Radio reports the next day were calling the unknown lights in the sky everything from snow geese to northern lights. It should be easy to nail down this date from old records somwhere. The lights in the sky were reported from South Dakota to Kansas, and from Colorado to Iowa. It seemed to me the next day from the radio reports that we were in the center of things, and that what ever direction you went from our point of view most descriptions varied, but none were what we had seen or experienced.My story: I and a friend had been riding our motorcycles that evening and had returned to my home, a double wide along the Platte River between Columbus and Duncan Ne., shortly before midnight.I had been a long day ang we went inside for a short nightcap before my friend was going to head back home to Columbus.We had just had a different odd experience minutes before we reached my home.as we turned off hiway 30 onto the blacktop road that led to my place the road suddenly was alive literally thousands of glittering jhewl like things, actually covering the road. It was not long before we realized what we were onto. thousands upon thousands of small toads on the road. I was all we could do to keep from crashing as we mashed though them. We had to ride slowly with our legs extended to stay upright. Not to mention the sound and the splattering all over our bikes and ourselves. Nausiating to say the very least.I all my years living there, and all the other odd things I have seen and experienced in that area, I had never ever seen that many toads, &amp; green frogs, at one time on the road like that. There could not have been a square foot of open space anywhere on that whole two mile run! Back to the main story: It was after we hosed off the bikes and ourselves that we went into the house for a nightcap. I had borrowed a clean pair of pants to my friend who was prolonging his trek home , in the hopes the mass of creatures would be dissipated by the time he left.We were seated in my dining area by the east window, which was open as were the rest of the windows in the house on that warm midsummer night. It had started to cool slightly but not to a chill as of yet.I had poured a Crown Royal on the rocks for each of us and had no more than taken the first sip,(This I want to make perfectly clear, we had not even had one drink when this happened!),when all went suddenly completly quiet. Till then all the usual night noises were going on as usual. Cows baying in the distance, frogs and crickets, chirping down in the slew. Night hawks, owls ,neibors dogs barking ect... .It was so sudden and so completely quiet that we locked eyes and and froze for a second or two. When we looked to the window there was a dull red light on the widow sill, and a dull red glow everywhere outside. I leaned over to the window and tryed to look up to see what was causing this but could not see anything.We got up and went to the bay windows to the south, facing the meadow betwen us and the the tree line along the river bank, about a half mile away. There in the sky, almost directly above us was a ring. It looked like a smoke ring actually. A fat smoke ring , bright white with a red fringe on the edges.We grabbed a matched pair of my 22 caliber rifles and headed out the  door  down the steps , across the yard , through the slew and about 75 to 100 yards out into the meadow. The hat had not yet been cut and we were knee to hip deep in grass.The ring was slowly getting larger and thinner directly above our heads. We were trying to figure out what this might possibly be, anthing from a exploded rocket,bomb, metorite,we just did not have a clue.We watched the ring slowly expand for several minutes. The brightness never dimmed as it got bigger and thinner. As it did this we became aware that although we could see the stars on the outside of the rings all round we could not see any in the black center area of the ring. It was a t this point that we were beginning to get a real creepy feeling about the whole thing.The moon was in plain sight to our southwest, at about a 45 deg. angle to the horizon. Half the horizon away from the ring above our heads.This whole time not a sound could be heard and it seemed that our words were falling on dead air as well, as if we could not have heard each other had we been only a few more yards apart. Hard to explain! About the time that the ring covered 1/4 or slightly less of the sky area red spears of light started arcing down from the rings outer edge. When these were mabey 1/4 of the way to the ground then white ones did the same spaced evenly between the red. At first we thought that the beams were very high and following the arc of the horizon but when the first ones came down far enough to the ground we could see that the beams were between us and the home place,(My fathers farm about 3/4 mile north of us.), and on the south side seemed to be within the 1/3 mile of tree line along the north river bank.We were in side what I have can only call a cereal bowl effect. Like beeing in a bird cage.We could see stars between the beams. then a sweet sickening smell was in the air.it was hard to breeth withthis putred sweet smell. First a pricking static like electricity in the air, then nothing.We both began regaining our senses some time later several tens of yards apart. wet laying in the wet grass,( sitting up actually.) disorientated, at least 2hrs had passed since we first walked outside. All was gone but a hint of the sickening sweet smell.We made our way back into the house and sat back down on at the table. The ice in our glasses had long melted. The clock read 2:20-somthing. After about an hour my friend left for home.The next morning on the way to work was the first I heard the radio talk of all the sightings for 500 miles around us in each direction. There were so many different versions, and experts versions all I could do was shake my head. My friend and I worked together, and discussed this only with a shrt list of friends after that.NOTE: I want absolutly no publicity over this!!! I am relaying this to you hoping mabey that you may have some other info relating to this for me, or some other similar event somwhere else. This is the only reason for any contact I will accept.The only contact with me is though my e-mail, thank you.p.s. I and my father had a sighting when I was about 10 yrs old at the farm.Since I have had three others, each different, one was simply spotting a oval shped object passing from a cloud though open blue sky and into or behind another cloud, only this this was reflecting the color of the sky behind it. It did not change from the white color to match the blue sky right away and that is how I caught sight of it.this was about two years ago heading east on hiway 33 west of Crete ne.The other was summer 2000,.I had taken my 12 year old daughter out with me to star gaze on the hill behind the lake community where we live. I have beendoing this periodically for years, yet had never seen anything. This was the first time I had let her stay up this late to go with me.We had been there for about 15-20 minutes, and she was already whining about going back when we saw two objects comming our direction from the northwest.There is a gravel road about 1/3 mile west of us. You can here the gravel crunching under a cars tires from where we were.The objects each had a bank of 5 lights in front of them. One was following the other just behind and to the west. They crossed the road west of us and the lights lit up the road like search lights. I thought they were helicopters untill they got that close and made no sound at all. All we could see was the lights because they were so bright. They passed us less than 1/4 mile away to the north and dipped down out of sight in the valley northof us. A few minutes later they popped up several miles north headed west this tim and then dipped down out of sight again. Even looking with binoculars at them as they were headed away we could not make out any shape of a craft. Just after they dipped out of sight the first time a car passed on the gravel road with the radio blairing and we could hear that well.This happened about 5 miles north of Crete ne. at about 10:30 pm on a wednsday night.That is all I have to report. Pardon any tyo&apos;s I am doing this fast as I am @ work.", "My personal UFO sightingI lived at ((number deleted)) London Street at the time.  I was about 13 at the time.  I was coming home from a store and had just turned right from Persia Avenue onto London Street.  I had gone about 50 feet when something made me turn around.  Above London Street, and I would guess at an altitude of about 1000 fee, was this round bright white light.  It wasn&apos;t bright enough to cause me to cover my eyes, but kept me watching.  There were no blinking lights, no sound and being one block from Mission Street, a very busy street, it was strange that there were no street noises.  I watched this light for about 15 minutes.  When it dipped slightly on the south western side of the object and headed out.  It disappeared in a matter of seconds.  I went home, told my mother about it and I went to our kitchen window which faced toward Mount Davidson and to the West.

I saw an &quot;old&quot; single engine dropping something out its window.I thought - litterbugs in the sky!-and stepped out from under the tree to get a better view. The greyish bundle I saw while looking through the limbs was not falling, it had become an elongated diamond object that was behind and slightly below the tail of the plane and following it.  I looked and thought; better remember exactly this thing.  It was the size of the wing of the plane, about 20 feet.  The shape was an elongated diamond with the top and bottom &quot;points&quot; clipped off, the front and back were very pointed. the color was graphite with darker and ligher shades mingled -think of a somone using a pencil with heavy and light pressure.

Other people from the shops there saw us outside looking up in the sky so they came out also and looked above and saw the samething. Wish I had a camera! These flying saucers where flying in and out of the clouds, staying for like a few seconds and fly out like they were taking turns. They must have been doing this for maybe a good 5 or 10 mins. They were silver and not quite cigar shape, but pretty close to it, but with a dome ontop. That day was a clear day, blue, but white clouds scattered. We don&apos;t get many clear days like that here, so it must have been either after it rained, (cause that&apos;s the way our days will look after it&apos;s rained) or a day after we&apos;ve had our Santa Ana winds kick up.

We just stood and looked up at it didn&apos;t move and we didn&apos;t either we ask each other what it was, we were not able to even make a guess. Then we all got afraid of it, and ran into a orange grove and hid under orange trees, but the light just moved with us,it was brighter then daylight under the orange tree that I was under. We were yelling at each other and really scared by this time. We didn&apos;t know what to do, and then just like it came on the light went off. We stayed under the trees and talk back and forth to each other untill we got up enought nerve to get up and run.

I would awake in room with subdued light, with four or five of the the little people with the big head and eyes, they always looked light blue or green or grey to me. They would be moving all around and touching me. I was never to afraid of them ,I can&apos;t ever recall being hurt in any way, and in this dream that I used to have, once in a while a door would open with a bright light, and in the doorway would be this tall man, I could never tell what he look like, all I could see was his shadow, he would say something to the little people and soon after I would awake in my bed.This was doing the great depression and we lived in a old tractor barn with very few people near us.Like I said about what I thought were dreams I&apos;m not to sure if they were or not anymore.

The light was actually flame as one would think a pair of rocket boosters would produce.  I watched it move for maybe fifteen more seconds and then the &apos;boosters&apos; went out and as they did an orangish glow remained for an instant (there was a shape momentarily visible in the afterglow that reminded me of a branding iron pointing directly at me shaped like a square with a cross through the center) and then the entire object disappeared into the night.

In fact, we received one other report from Fairbanks. From your description, I wonder whether the event might have been caused by a rocket launch of some kind.  Are you able to make a telephone call, or two, to establish whether that might have been the cause?  I suspect a call to the FAA would resolve the issue fairly quickly, since any facility launching a missile would have to apprise the FAA of the event. If you find out what the cause was, I would be most grateful if you could drop us a note.  We will add it to your report. ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM SAME WITNESS))Mr. Davenport,I did phone the FAA (ATC at FAI) this evening and was told that the research facility out at Poker Flats (an atmospheric research center about 30 miles north of my home) was potentially active at that time (the NOTAM filed by Poker Flats is open-ended) though none of the same staff was on tonight so we we&apos;re unable to verify.  Poker Flats does apparently occasionally launch small rockets into the atmosphere for research.  The FAA employee also stated that the research does &quot;effect the Northern Lights&quot; which may have something to do with the good lights show last night (actually now I&apos;m more interested by that...  ;)    The specs would certainly seem to line up with where and what I saw.

The object had orange, green and blue lights that seemed to rotate as if the object was spinning. I called my son into the room so that he could see it and we watched as this object went from left to right as it ascended upwards into the sky. I ran into another room to get my digital camera so that I could get a photo, but my security alarm sounded and so I was distracted by trying to turn it off. The security company called to verify my password. By the time everything had calmed back down, I ran outside with my camera, but could not focus in on the object. By this time it was high up so I tryed focusing with the camera but it just disappeared.

There is no machine that I know of that could fly as spastic as this thing!!! The weird thing is that when my alarm sounded it was not even set!!! I must tell you that my alarm has done this in the past and without reason.

At first i didnt think anything of it but i realized there was no one behind me. As we rode at about 15 miles an hour the light hovered above us. Im not sure how long it stayed above us but if i guessed id have to say  15 - 30 seconds. Then the light accelerated extremely fast ahead of us. When it got ahead of us it rocketed to the left then back to the center of the skyline dissapearing in front of us.Its hard to describe the intensity of the light but it was extremely bright. Also im not sure how high the light was above us.( if i was going to make an accurate guess id saw about250 yards when it was hovering and i couldnt estimate how high it was when it accelerated away). The light accelerated faster than any airplane could as it crossed the skyline in a matter of seconds it was like the speed of a shooting star or a meteorite. It also cornered very quickly  when it changed directions( first to the left then back to the center)I dont think any aircraft is capable of that type of cornering. After the light dissapeared my friend ahead of me (about 20 yards) stopped to let me catch up. Before i could ask if he saw it he said &quot;what the hell was that&quot;. I was glad he saw it too. My friend that was on the back of the atv with me witnessed it also. All 3 of us had the same description of the sighting. I have no idea what the light was but i am positive it was not an aircraft of any type or a meteorite or shooting star. The way the light accelerated and turned was not possible by man or nature. I would also like to add that there was no other visible light of any kind except my headlight and the one on the vehicle in front, a big difference from the intense blue light. This was a remote and wooded area not easily accessable.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "It appeared to be cascading down the tree outside, a huge fir with a slanting shape.

Noticed a darkening in the daylight like a cloud was crossing the bright sun. Looked up at the sky and to the east, over the buildings and open space came a very huge dark shape, moving about 25 to 30 miles per hour.  It was wider than a football field. There was not a sound, in fact I could still here a bird out in the open space in front of me just as it started to come into my line of sight.  The triangle was a little higher than tree-top level.  As it passed over my position, it appeared that the larger mass of it was actually over the open space in front of me. I looked steadily at it as it went over my position and thought that it was made of some type of metal of platic with the appearance of very dark gray to black and had the distinct texture of not being painted.  It was not shiny, i.e. the sun did not reflect or light up to top of it which I noted. I got the strong impression thatit was not painted and there were no markings on the bottom of the craft or along the training edge.  There were no apparant appetures  for engines along the back end of it. As it proceeded to the west, I noticed that it seemed to be very thin at the trailing edge of the craft.  I had the impression that it was a little thicker in the middle, like towards the pointy edge. As it continued to the west, and as it was passing direcly over me, I felt like there was some type of disturbance in the air.  I could feel it on the skin of my arms, almost like an electrical/magnetic charge was in the air.  It continued moving slowly and silently over the crest of the hill and disappeared. I waited a long time before I finally told my husband and said that since this had occurred on the day of the Dayton Air Force Show that I had probably seen a stealth fighter from Wright Pat.  Some months later I saw a picture of the Stealth and that WAS NOT WHAT I HAD SEEN. ! Besides , since then I understand that the Stealth does make noise and also can&apos;t fly at such a slow speed.  I know what I saw and felt.  There is no doubt in my mind. I cannot ever forget the impression of the skin of that craft - the color and whether it was metal or plastic, but metal seems closer to what I saw. It appeared to be crossing directly over the area where a building was to be built and passed along and over the hill directly in back of a hospital.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Upon reaching cruising altitude (33,000 feet), I opened my window flap (I usually keep it closed during takeoffs and landings).At that point, our plane is flying above the clouds with about 1/3 of the horizon and sky visible.  I cannot see land beneath the plane.  I noticed a solid white round object several thousand feet lower than my plane and located up to the North and East of my window (and the plane).  At first, trying to rationalize, I think it is a bird.  Realizing birds do not fly at 30,000 feet, I continue to watch the object.  It seems to hover or float.  Eventually, it is directly in line with my window (but at the same distance away.  I surmise that at 500 mph, we have caught up with it, and it has not moved.  Didn&apos;t see it move at that point.  Still it appears to hover.Then, rationalizing further, I think it might be a weather balloon.  I have never seen a weather balloon, though, so I am not sure.

I was looking across our small valley at the hills to the north.  My wife was inside, in the back bedroom.  Off in the distance, from the south, I first heard what sounded like faint rolling thunder.  This noise became increasing louder, gradually subsided and ceased altogether when the object came into view directly over my head.  My house abuts the hills directly behind.  I estimate the hills to be approx 200-250ft. high...This SAND colored triangle, flying in a NW direction was emitting a faint high-pitched &quot;hissing&quot; noise and moving slowly, (approx. 75-100mph.).  Because of it&apos;s low altitude and my physical position in relation to the craft, I was only able to observe the under-carriage.  I observed only two blinking lights, (non strobe), - round white light on left side and round red light on right side.  From my perspective they appeared to be the size of a basketball.  I estimate the width of the craft, (at it&apos;s widest point), to be around 100ft.  My guess as to it&apos;s length would be the same.  There was nothing, other than the lights, distinguishable on the under-side; no indication of landing gear, portals or even seams.  I viewed the craft for about 30 secs., until it passed from view over the next ridge, to the north.  The ground shook, as well as the house&apos;s foundation, which alerted my wife who came out only in time to see the craft starting to disappear over the horizon.  Once I regrouped, my first reaction was that if must have been a &quot;stealth fighter&quot; - we live about 60mi. NW of White Sands Missle range and are in the vicinity of two other major military installations.  I&apos;ve only seen a few pictures of stealths and quite frankly don&apos;t remember too many details of same.  I&apos;m not what you would call a military &quot;high-tech groupie&quot;.

I always look at the stars when I am outside.  As I was looking, I saw a very dark objectmoving from East to west.  If I did not have better than 20/20 vision, I would have missed it, as it almost blended in with the black sky.  I estimate it to be moving at around 200mph and at an altitude of about 2000 feet.  It made no sound, and being a star and airplane buff, it was not an airplane.  It had no marker lights, strobes or any lights at all.  It was very quiet, dark.  The shape was like a boomerang as it passed overhead.  As it continued away from me, I could just make out a shape from behind.  The first thing I thought of when I saw the shape, was squashed pearls. If you picture a string of 4 black pearls on a table in a straight line, then you bend the string in the middle so that 2 pearls are on one side of the wing, and 2 pearls down the other side. Then you squish the pearls down until they are oval shaped.Basically, it looked similar to the stealth bomber, but didn&apos;t have jagged wings.  It looked like a black boomerang with 4 bumps on it.Immediately after seeing this, I ran upstairs told my wife, and called the media and asked if there were any other reportings.  They told me there weren&apos;t any reportings, but took my name and number down and said they will contact me if anyone else reports anything.Why so long do I finally report this?  I always wanted to tell someone who is interested, but didn&apos;t think to look on the net until tonight after going out again and seeing the same kind of night reminding me of that night.

As it moved closer, it was evident to be quite large, no sound whatsoever and hovered for a time and then moved very, very slowly to the Southeast, then, did a very slow, graceful &quot;U&quot; turn and heading was North after that.

Seemed very long, narrow, and large, yet no sound. Continued slowly beyond the trees until out of sight. Thought this was interesting in light of the earlier sighting we had earlier this same night of 3 bright oval objects at 20:00 not too far from our home. We were riding home and in a nearby town.

I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ve ever seen that in nature.  My second concern was the speed appearing to be about half of what you expect a meteor to be - especially those that wander in from between Mars and Jupiter.  I have not calculated the estimated speed yet.  I need to sit down and do this, my calculation can only be a guess at best, using &apos;apparent&apos; altitude.  If it was sunlight I was looking at, reflected from the objects, and it was 21:03 local, that makes the sun about 4 hours over the horizon, leaving about 1/8th of the earth curvature between myself and the sun, a rough guess puts the altitude at about 2000 miles for the objects to reflect the sun as they first appeared in the east.  I don&apos;t think they were 2000 miles away, unless they were really big!  For some reason I want to say they were above the tropopause, somewhere around 25 to 50 miles altitude.  If they were meteors, then the beginning of atmosphere would be in this region (but they would leave a trail, albiet even a short one - and no tail was observed).  Roughly, and with no figures to back this up, the objects covered over a 1000 miles with an estimated altitude of 30 miles.  This makes their speed to be slightly over 6000 miles an hour - very slow for a meteor, but not necessarily for the US government.  Another thing that bothers me is that their luminosity remained the same, and did not change.This was an interesting sighting.  I will continue to figure on this one.  If I reach any conclusions, I will forward them to you, in the meantime please keep me posted.Thanks very much,((name deleted))", "UFO SIGHTING THATWAS GONE IN A FLASHTHE UFO WAS HUVERING IN ONE SPOT(WAS STILL).

He ran inside to grab his binoculars; our coworker came out to see what we were making a big fuss about, and when she saw the object she also said that it looked like multiple lights.  I grabbed the binoculars from my roommate and ran downstairs into the darkest area I could find in order to avoid any ground light.  When I zoomed in I could see that it definitely looked like one bright light surrounded by smaller lights.  However, the &quot;shape&quot; was not constant; at one point it appeared to be a single light, then a bright light surrounded by four lights, then two lights, then as much as a dozen lights.  In addition to the changing shapes, the object&apos;s colors were cycling, from blue to white to yellow to red, although I wasn&apos;t so observant that I was catching a pattern.  Anyway, our neighbors started coming out, and we showed them where to look, passed the binoculars around; we wanted as many people to witness this as possible.  We live not too far from the Daytona Beach airport, and as pl! anes, an d even a helicopter, passed overhead, we could tell just from the object&apos;s altitude that it wasn&apos;t a plane, at least not one that was coming to or leaving from the Daytona Airport.  Also, its pattern of movement was unlike anything any of us had ever seen.  Though it seemed like it was climbing in altitude, it was moving north, then south, in a snake-like pattern, and at several times it seemed to have dropped in altitude.  We asked around for a camera, but it seemed like nobody had a camera, or they weren&apos;t willing to take pictures, although I saw one of my downstairs neighbors taking snapshots.We phoned the local authorities, but they ignored the report.  We called the local newspaper, who told us to call the local authorities; no help there either.  I even tried to find a local number for MUFON, to no avail.After about 2 hours, however, the object moved out of our field of vision, and we left it at that, with no explanation and nobody taking us seriously.((NUFORC Note:  If, in fact, the object did move abruptly, it could not have been a celestial body.  However, we believe that the first possibility to be eliminated is the star, Sirius, in the southern sky.  It can be very bright, and it gives off a very brilliant chromatic display, as described in this report.

No matter how fast I went I couldn&apos;t get close.

I was lying there listening to the radio when the disc jocky made a comment about a phone call of someone reporting a ufo around one of the parks that we lived close to. This stured my interest so I got out of bed and went into the front yard which faced the park in reference. At first look i only saw a light that appeared to be a bright star but of a bluewhite color. After several minutes of watching this one light which was constant, I noticed that it was moving in my direction, slowly. I would est. at this point it was about 300 to 500 ft. off the gound. Distance from the object to myself as a bullet would travel, I would say 1000 yards. It was northwest of my positon moving very slowly to the east. When it reached about 500 yards away it stoped, alt. was still the same. At this point I could make out a &quot;disc&quot; shape. Being in awh, I ran inside to wake my wife. At first she thought i had been drinking, but i was able to convince her to come and look. When we returned to the front yard I noticd that the object had begun to move in a southerly direction at a low rate of speed, estimated to be 5-10 mph. It continued to travel to the south until it&apos;s position was about 200 yards south of my front door which faced due west. It stopped again for several minutes then began to move north at the same rate of speed,  It traveled about 400 yards to the north and stopped again. It made the same trip again but stoping due west of my front yard, &quot;about half way of the trip it just made&quot;. This put it directly it front of me. My wife was shouting to get back in the house because the shape of the object was deffinetly clear at this point &quot;disc&quot;. It had one light on it which was on the bottom midship. It stayed at this position for quiet sometime. I had gone inside to get my deer rifle to use the scope for better vision, didnt work to good so i got my binoculars, this gave me much better vision of the ! object.I would say it was approx. 25&apos;-30&apos; in dia. disc shaped and appeared to have a port hole or window on the upper side of the object. What I didnt notice that it now was about 200 ft. of the ground moving straight toward me, its speed had slowed to only several mph. Its skin appeared to be metalic with a very low luster, it appeared to absorbe light rather than reflect it. There was absolutely no noise, no visual signs of proplusion,prop,engines, exhaust etc. No rotor blades, no vertical or horizonal stabelizers. To put it bluntly it was a flying saucer perfectly still 200 ft. over my house at 3:00am in the morning. At this point my wife totally lost it running back into the house. I was able to get her back out in the front yard to help me with the id so we wouldnt forget anything. After 10 min or so it began to move to the east again straight over my house, when it passed over us looking straight up at the object we felt a little sick to our stomachs and we felt like we were in a vaccuum. As it passed over our house we ran through the house into the back yard to continue watching. It continued for about 400 yards at this slow rate of speed when all of a sudden its speed went from a few mph to an unadentified speed which I can only relate to that of a meteror, tail and all. It traveled straight for a sec then started in an upward motion at about 45 deg. heading straight up then disappearing into the clouds. No noise, no light other than the one i have explained did we observe. The next day or two someone called the local newspaper and reported seeing the object at the park close to the ground.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We lived on a fairly flat, rural, open, ranch area.  I was walking home from our friend&apos;s house across the street when the objects caught my eye.  They were two bright lights high up in the sky.  One was amber and the other was green.  They were moving very fast from the east to the west, from one horizon to the other.  From my vantage point they looked as though they were spheres many miles up and to the north.  They were taking turns passing each other in &quot;leap-frog&quot; formations.  The green light would stop and the amber light would zip past it.  Then the amber light would stop and the green light would zip past it.  They went from the East horizon to the West horizon in approximately 3-4 seconds.  I ran the remainder of the way home scared.  Out of breath, I immediately told my parents about my experience.   Due to my insistence they eventually believed me, called information and were given a phone number to call to report UFO sightings.  My Dad called the number (I don&apos;t remember the name of the organization that they called) and reported my sighting.

However, when it got closer I noticed that there were only red and white lights (typically the planes that fly over here also have green lights and thats why this caught my attention).  The lights were very bright and as the object got closer I saw that it was not a plane at all but an object that was shaped very much like an octagon with bright red and white lights.  I watched as the object headed east. The lights were so bright that I could see the object for several minutes a long way off.  I called my sister in Springfield (which is approximately 20 miles from here) and told her to go outside to see if she could see a UFO.  I could still see the bright lights with my naked eyes when she told me that she saw the object but she thought that it was a plane.  When I asked her if she saw any wings on the plane she said that from the angle that she saw it she couldn&apos;t see any wings.  Then she said she saw another aircraft heading her way.  What seemed very strange was that both of the aircraft seemed to turn and they flew back this way (West). I watched until the object finally disappeared heading South.

In addition, I could see &apos;spots&apos; or areas of red that came and went.  The object had no clear &apos;definition&apos; or &apos;silouhette&apos;, just roundish and glowing/burning.  I would guess the size of it to be about the same as a hot air balloon.  It slowly drifted north, then suddenly became much smaller.

In fact, we received one other report from Fairbanks. From your description, I wonder whether the event might have been caused by a rocket launch of some kind.  Are you able to make a telephone call, or two, to establish whether that might have been the cause?  I suspect a call to the FAA would resolve the issue fairly quickly, since any facility launching a missile would have to apprise the FAA of the event. If you find out what the cause was, I would be most grateful if you could drop us a note.  We will add it to your report. ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM OTHER WITNESS))Mr. Davenport,I did phone the FAA (ATC at FAI) this evening and was told that the research facility out at Poker Flats (an atmospheric research center about 30 miles north of my home) was potentially active at that time (the NOTAM filed by Poker Flats is open-ended) though none of the same staff was on tonight so we we&apos;re unable to verify.  Poker Flats does apparently occasionally launch small rockets into the atmosphere for research.  The FAA employee also stated that the research does &quot;effect the Northern Lights&quot; which may have something to do with the good lights show last night (actually now I&apos;m more interested by that...  ;)    The specs would certainly seem to line up with where and what I saw.

By the time I said, &apos;What&apos;s that up there?&apos; and my girl friend glanced up, the dot disappeared out of view.

The beams moved very fast and independantly of each other (some angled as low as 45 degrees to the horizon), however it only lasted for about 5 seconds.

I then noticed a very large bright red stationary light and quickly discounted Mars, a satellite, plane but not yet a helicopter. I assumed it was a helicopter at first by its apparent static movement but it slowly moved in circular pattern and then the light flickered and got dimmer/brighter. It appeared 10 times larger then any planet and many, many times brighter then Sirius in the winter. As I watched I noted the background stars (2 faint ones) and I moved away from the neighbors porch light and positioned myself with a better view. I moved around to see it pass behind the power lines and to get a different angle of view. I noticed when I stopped moving that it was making a slow circular motion in a small area. I continued watching and heard nothing and it started moving in a linear manner to the south. I then alerted my neighbor. He came out and observed it. I asked that he turn his porch light off and he stated it would take forever to turn back on but he turned it off anyway. We both continued observing it and then I stated, &quot;Stay here while I grab my binoculars.&quot; I quickly retrieved them and came out and started viewing it in a wide angle and saw that it seemed to have no shape other then seeming very broad. I zoomed in and still no shape, I zoomed out again and focused to see it better and followed it as it moved. I noted no other lights or surface. It seemed to have a sphere shape but more like a very large bright red orb or sphere shape. I handed the binoculars to my neighbor and he looked for 10-20 seconds. I regained the binoculars and spotted it quickly and as I did it dropped a light from the bottom (not as bright, and much smaller and slightly orange/red) which moved very quickly at a right angle to the bright red light. I stated loudly &quot;What was that?&apos; and continu! ed follo wing it by eye and binoculars, it then dropped 4-5 more small bright reddish/orange lights that dropped quickly at a regular interval and they seemed to drop just over the hills or tree line. We both witnessed this. They seemed to be like flares shooting down with some sort of trail but they moved quickly, much faster than I would expect from a free fall. They were each slightly different in intensity/size and color. At this point the larger red light continued moving away and dimmed giving the impression of moving quickly away and out or dimming and moving away. I was watching with the naked eye at this point and could no longer locate the large red light nor the multiple smaller lights. I heard no sirens after and no other witnesses. My neighbor returned to his apartment and I sat at my computer recollecting any and all details.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally lucid and credible.

I then realized this was something I had never encountered before, all my life I have had paranormal experiences that I couldn&apos;t explain, but thius was the first sighting of a craft like this one. I lost sight of it above the cab of my truck as I passed it. I thought of pulling off the side of the road to take a closer look, but fear took over as the thought came to me that if Icould see them,then they could see me. as I drove toward town, going down hill now, I glanced at my rearview mirrow and saw it still sitting in the same place. If any of the cars going uphill noticed the craft, I saw no brakelights come on, if they had stopped then I would have too. or if someone else had been with me I might have pulled over, but being alone I wasn&apos;t taking any chances.

My brother and I as well as two friends (back when we were teenagers) &quot;borrowed&quot; a neighbors row boat for a near midnite cruise around the lake (Maynard&apos;s Lake in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia). It was a beautiful clear summers nite, the water was as smooth as glass and everywhere you looked it was pitch black. You could see silouhetted houses along the shoreline with the streetlights illuminating them from behind. The only lights to be seen were at the far east end of the lake where the plaza was (approxx. 1&frac12; miles). In any event, we decided to head in as we were out for nearly an hour. While heading in maybe 100 feet from the shore, I heard someone say (in what appeared to be a weak and crackly voice) &quot;what the hell are they&quot;. We turned to the east in the direction of the plaza and maybe 500-600 feet away were two huge Orange glowing spheres, perfectly round, one overlapping the other by probably 15-20%. The very bottom of each sphere just barely touched the water&apos;s surface (they were in the middle of the lake)giving the illusion that there were four. In fact, they were two only. (I&apos;m actually getting chills writing this as I remember) Anyway, we were terrified, one guy crying, so we paddled our butts off for shore. Here&apos;s the bizzare part, the balls were glowing brite orange but they didn&apos;t cast off any light, they seemed to glow from within and the spectrum of light never left the globes. After about a minute of paddling, I looked over and they were still there, not moving and completely silent. Then as quickly as it began, it was over, they were gone, not a trace in the sky, no sound, odor, breeze....nothing. The lake returned to the black mirror state it began in. Not much more to it than that but I&apos;d like to finish with this: The afore mentioned story is the gospel truth. I swear on the life of my children it&apos;s true. I&apos;ve since heard of similar sightings in Mexi! co and S outh America (Orange Glowing Balls) And only wish I had continued to look as they dissappeared. None of us saw them leave as we were too busy getting the hell out of there.((NUFORC Note:  Report is similar to the celebrated Allagash Sighting case, which occurred in the State of Maine in late August 1975.

I wrote down this information but cannot find it, so the time is approximate, but everything else is quite accurate.  I was watching the skies as I always do, and it was a mostly sunny day (having driven beyond the mostly cloudy skies nearer Albuquerque), and noticed a black shape in the sky which I first guessed was a bird gliding over the beautiful desert landscape.  But it was quite high and it did appear to be approaching relatively quickly from the East/Southeast, flying to the North/Northwest.  As I watched, I saw that it was appeared to be a small, black disk, flying VERY rapidly, and as it passed just to the east of me I examined it as closely as possible, determining there were no wings or other appendages.  So it could have been a cigar-shaped object, except that as it crossed the highway behind the car (perhaps 2 miles north of the car, which was travelling south, continuing to the North/Northwest, I saw that it did not change shape, therefore it appeared to be a solid disk-shaped (or round) vehicle.  I judged it as travelling several hundred miles per hour, and while it is very hard to judge the size, it must have been between about 20 to 50 feet in diameter.  I did manage to grab my binoculars but due to being in the car and it moving so quickly, could not bring it entirely into perfect focus, but can confirm it was a solid, black, apparently round object (seen from the side).", "I saw a shooting star that stopped: lights of red, blue, green began flickering and it lowered down below treeline, then darkness.I was unloading groceries from rear trunk of the car to take in the house and I saw what appeared to be a shooting star.

You could see it was at treeline. I estimate the distance I was away from what I saw to be three miles.

She pointed upwards, and pointed out five, possibly six bright yellowish lights flying in a tight formation.  I thought they might be military craft, but as they flew, one of the lights turned a dark red, almost crimson color, and darted off at a ninety degree angle, flanking it&apos;s fellow craft and passing to the rear.  The other craft split up and circled in violent turns to rally on the first ships rear.  One of my friends reported hearing a sound, but that is unconfirmed, as neither my other friend or myself heard this sound.  Suddenly, they broke fast and vanished.  I know for a fact that no craft currently in use by any military force on this planet can manevuer like that.  After the event, we ran inside to get a camera, and waited outside for quite some time, but nothing happened after that.

This initial light seemed to &apos;grow&apos; a tail which streamed downward along a 45 degree angle with a bright golden glow, stretching to approx. one finger length (at arm&apos;s length). The cone of the light itself did not move. The cone or head seemed to have points like a 5-pt star which extended slightly beyond the circular light center. After about 20-25 seconds, the &apos;tail&apos; shrunk back until only the original light was visible. Then, from the center, two lights emerged and created a triangular pattern, half a finger-length across at its widest span. These 3 lights were differently colored: red, blue,gold.

Only, the other stars I saw before would stop after only a short movement.  This star didn&apos;t stop.  It moved north for seven to nine of my quick paces as I followed it, and then it arced up!  The arc was wide as the star continued north.  Then I had to stop.  The star was moving up, first in a curved line, then a diagonal line, then it rose straight up.  The only star that was moving, remained very bright until it quickly picked up increasing speed and disappeared into the cosmos, leaving an envy in me for wherever it was going and a dread, knowing that if I told any one about what I&apos;d seen, the taunting and ridicule I&apos;d get would probably mess with my already weak confidence.

After watching a program about a man with something in his body, they extracted it and did not know what it was, I immediately recognized the object and even now, I am getting tingly just writing about it.I was about 10 years old and sitting on the toilet.  I guess I was rubbing my calfs with my hands as I felt something.  I looked closer to find there was something imbedded in my right side of my leg below the knee.  I tried to get a hold of it with my fingers, but it was too smooth and pointy to get a grip.  My mother had a pair of tweezers close by.  I finished what I was doing and propped my leg up on the bath tub.  I pinched it with the tweezers and began to pull.  I was shocked to see this thing in my leg being so long and pointy, yet I felt no pain.  After I pulled it out, there was no blood, but only a hole.  I looked at it closely and I can remember it being very similar to a thin yet long and pointy piece of rice.  It had a gold/brown colour to it, and was very hard.  I didn&apos;t think much of it at the time as I was only 10.  the best is yet to come.Frequently,over a couple of years, I marvelled at the hole.  I looked at it, felt it, and didn&apos;t go away.  Another couple of years, I forgot about it, then once again, I was sitting on the toilet and remembered it again.  I looked at it and saw another object in the very same hole.  I got up and looked for some tweasers.  After finally finding some, I pulled it out again.  It was identical to the one I pulled out the first time. Again, I was stupid and did not think to save the piece.It has been about 20 years since I pulled the last one out, and still think of it.  I still look at it, but it hasn&apos;t returned.  The only thing I have left, is a grown in hole, that you still can see.  I joke about it to the people I tell and even show them the hole.  I tell them the people planting this &quot;bug&quot; on me, finally got sick and tired of me removing it and sending them to the sewage plant.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The object was approximately, based on diatnce with respect to the mountains (object in front of the mountains), looked about on the order of 1 mile across, perhaps, even bigger in size. It was enormous. After watching the object for some minutes, I decided to move down the hill to try and get a better look. The object may have, initially, been sighted near the Indian Casino off the 10 freeway...Morongo Casino is the name of the place it appeared to be closest...in morongo. Now in the time I took to drive a few hundred feet or so down the hill (which took me only approximately 10-15 seconds)...we saw that it had moved...very fast from where it was first sighted. It now appeared to be very close if not over the Palm Springs International Airport (they had to see whatever the hell this thing was...absolutely no mistake about it).

I didn&apos;t see the lights that night, but did last summer.  The same sort of things were approaching from north, headed south.  The 1/11 report mentioned a hum.  I live on the edge of Rockford, and had the benefit of a quieter viewing location.  The hum the large group of lights was emitting, only a &quot;tinkle&quot;, appeared to be that of many turboprop powered aircraft, probably &quot;Hercules&quot; national guard aircraft, flying in formation at high altitude.  They may have been traveling back from Camp Douglas or Fort McCoy Wisconsin.  The lights, once they passed overhead, dimmed, as if the landing lights had been viewed, and only the navigation lights could then be seen.  I hope this may help explain some sightings.((NUFORC Note:  The other reports submitted to us do not seem consistent with Hercules C-130, or any other type of aircraft that we are aware of.

We were travelling north on Macadam Boulevard right near the industrial area on the west bank of the willamette river when I looked up and noticed two rainbows that broke off mid way up in the sky as above them loomed a thick cloud formation that covered most of the eastern sky. While examining the rainbows my girlfriend (who was driving at the moment) noticed little lights which were floating either in front of or within the cloud formation. The lights, looked EXACTLY like stars but it was 4:10pm in the afternoon and they appeared to be in front of the clouds. There were 6-10 lights all hovering and moving both in formation and separately (I definitely counted 6 I could see at one given time while my girlfriend claimed to see as many as 10 at one given time). These were not like any planes I have ever seen as they remained stationary and were able to move back and forth in relation to one another with surprising speed and no need for turning radii. One moved in the northern direction, then stopped on a dime, hovered for a while and then returned in the direction it originally came from. They moved quite quickly and seemed quite agile.  The group of lights occupied no more than 35 degrees of the sky  horizontally and all appeared around the same altitude (guesstimate of 200-300 feet high) Neither one of us could tell the size or distance of the lights as they appeared as little more than pin pricks of light but we both agreed that they appeared to be somewhat close and the way they moved only heightened that sensation. If I had to guess I would say they were no more than 2-3 football fields away. This is my first UFO experience and I hope other people were looking in the direction of the rainbows and can back up our story. Did anybody else see this? I have no idea what they were but it was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.", "Driving south on the 101 in between Ray and Chandler Blvd. A defining GREEN cylinder shaped object started at about 12:00 from looking through my car window and skimmed diagonally through the sky at a high rate of speed much like a shooting star.

It was flying high, at an altitude I&apos;d expect to see planes, and it moved directly across as much of the sky as I could see in about a minute, heading south at first. When it was in front of me it started to veer off to the south west. At first, all I saw was the totally red oval light. After awhile it seemed to change position, and then what looked like 4 red, glowing &quot;legs&quot; became visible.  It brought to mind some kind of bug, maybe even a crab, except that it had fewer legs. The way it flew reminded me of a helicopter.

After turning left(west) onto Harrison Ave., I watched it for about another minute, until losing sight of it.  It never made any sound that I could hear.The total illumination of the body and legs, along with the fact that there were no white or green lights on the craft, made me wonder where it was from.

Over to my left (in the west) and a good distance away, I saw a very large &quot;fireball&quot; shoot up from the ground (or from behind some trees...hard to tell)and straight up into the air, heading slightly to the north.  It was green....as you would imagine green light would look in front of a black back drop, somewhat varied in brightness.  When I first saw it at its largest state (just after leaving the ground)  the color was very intense and bright.....then the further it went, it became dimmer and less saturated. It appeared and disappeared within the span of 3-5 seconds.  I turned to my friend and asked him if he had seen it too.  He said he had.  I think that was a relief to both of us...to know we weren&apos;t hallucinating!", "I was in my two story bedroom, attempting to close the blinds.  I glanced outside to the west to the Mesa-Phoenix city lights.  I looked and looked and saw what I thought was part of the moon with a red light underneath.

I took a double take...then I ran downstairs and went to the front of my home and looked to see if I saw the same thing I did in the window.  It was there!  I went back in to get my daughter and when I came back to show her, it was totally gone! I went immediately to the tv to see if their were any reportings of what I saw..nothing.  Then waited to get the paper and again went to the tv for the news on this siting...nothing.I can&apos;t believe that no one saw this.

At first I thought it was a boat as it started to move across the water.  The two lights moves together very smoothly, that I then thought it was a plane flying very close to the water.  As it moved steadily across the Bay I ran into my room to get my binoculars.  I then watched the two lights move from right to left.  With the binoculars I still could not see anything but two round lights.  There was not any craft or any kind of mass around the lights.  If it had been a plane, the object would have had to be coming in our direction.  As the objects reached towards the shore on the left of the Bay they rose like a plane, then disappeared.  At this point they were going away from our direction and they were still two rounds lights.  If it had been a plane there would not have been two round lights because of the direction they were going.  Besides I would have seen the outline of the plane while I looked through the binoculars.  All of this took only approx. 2 minutes.  Even a speed boat would take longer to cross the Bay.  It was a beautiful clear morning.  There had to be someone else who must have seen it as there are many tourists out whale watching around the Bay in Maui at this time of the season.  We left that same day for home, so I don&apos;t know if anything was reported.  I asked one of the employees at the hotel but she didn&apos;t know what it might have been.  I don&apos;t know what this was, if anything.  It puzzled me and I could not could not come up with a reasonably explanation for these lights.

After submitting my report on 2/02, additional sightings of a more intensly lit object occured later in the evening.  These objects appeared over the western edge of the city of Spokane.  My vantage point is on a hill, aproximately 17 miles to the SE of Spokane.Last night, 02/04/02 the objects again appeared intermittently from about 7:30PM until about 11:00 PM.  Usually, only one object was present at a time, but once three objects were visible - two over western Spokane, and one to the north.  All were very bright, with the lights becoming very bright, then dimming etc., and each sighting lasting between 5 to 10 minutes.  The predominate color of the lights was a yellowish /orange,  but through my binoculars I could see flashing blue, red, and green.  The objects would generally just appear, and after several minutes of being stationary, begin drifting to the North.  At one point. a larger aircraft coming from the SE flew under one of the objects in sort of a zig-zag pattern, but then flew in a direction away from the civilian and military airfields.  At the time the three objects were visible, the two objects which were close together moved in sort of a semi-circle pattern and exchanged general locations.  At times the objects would move behind trees in my field of view, and then out again, so I know they are not stars or planets.  They must be an aircraft of some type, and I hope to hect they are ours.I telephoned a friend who lives in Spokane.  This person traveled a few blocks out to a point which has a clear view to the South, over downtown Spokane, and also to the West.

My friend drove out to the airport area, but it was too foggy to see anything.  I asked if it could be a helicoptor, but my friend said that a local medical holicopter was operating in the downtown area, and that could be heard clearly, but there was no sound in the direction of the large flourescent light.I have been an aircraft enthusiast all my life, and I have never observed anything like these lights.

It dropped for about 15 seconds from what must have been a great height. It caught our attention because at first it was so small (a pin prick of light) yet amazingly bright, as it dropped/ moved downwards it got bigger and very much brighter, it hurt your eyes to look at it. We were almost under the approach path to Toronto Intl. planes were stacked up in a line approaching the airport, this was much higher than the planes. Ultimately it became a bit bigger than the size of a dime at arms length. It dropped from a height of about 80 degrees to approx 30 degrees in a spastic jerking manner, this took from 12 to 18 seconds. This was not a firework or a flare, the colour was truly very odd, just before it disappeared it moved/jeked sideways and flashed a blindingly bright orange colour, then nothing. We discussed it amongst ourselves afterwards and feel it must have been something burning up as it entered the atmosphere, but as to why it should jerk around and twitch as it fell, we can only speculate", "I was at a friend&apos;s house sitting on the back patio.  The time of day was sunset, although it was still bright out.  I was sitting down on the wood deck and crossed legged and leaned back into a position flat on my back looking up at the clouds.

I was confused as they appeared white but were not dropping but were traveling at the same altitude in a forward direction.  I caled my friend over and stood up to get a better look at the objects.  As they moved across the skyline the color changed from white to the burnt orange color of the sunset. It was then I realized they were reflecting light not producing light.

Then as I looked at it right before my eyes a light of the same size and shape dropped out of the bottom of it, went straight down, and we started on a patch of road that led us by some leafless trees, but we 3 all seen it.

I had my telescope setup (8&rdquo; reflector) and I was observing Mars at the time, with my high power eyepiece.

I don&rsquo;t dare estimate its altitude or distance from us. There were no reference points to compare to.Its heading was northwest and speed was faster then a small plane and slower then a jet. It didn&rsquo;t change heading or speed for the entire time that we observed it. As it reached its closest point to us, I could observe the following:  It was a sphere, it strobed at 6 cycles per sec.

It was early afternoon, and I was driving with my girl-friend (now wife) northeast on Fitzwatertown Road in Willow Grove.  A fairly large, gray, metallic object, cone-shaped with a flat, circular bottom was moving at a slow pace (approx 30 mph) in a north-westerly direction, towards Willow Grove Naval Air Station.  I can only assume the object was solid, as the flat, circular bottom was dark, possibly cast in shadow.  There were no discernable markings at all. The sky was somewhat overcast and cloudy gray.  I saw it out of the driver&apos;s side front windshield for approximately 5 seconds, as it passed from right to left across my path.  It was flying rather low over the trees (possibly 200 ft high). Its altitude never varied, nor did its speed. It made no sudden movement, did not display any lights, nor did it make any discernable sound.  It seemed to be moving with purpose and direction.  My wife did not see it as she was reading something in the car at the time.  I didn&apos;t point it out to her either, as I wasn&apos;t sure what I was seeing, and had to keep an eye on the road as well, since I was still driving.

I can say with certainty, that this was not a fixed-wing, nor rotor aircraft.  It did not look like a balloon or blimp of any sort I&apos;ve seen in my lifetime.

These craft came into view only at a near direct overhead angle and seemed to vanish into the darkness at the same angle at which they appeared.  We were awestruck.  The person we were waiting on arrived and had seen them also.  An old man who lived on this corner was going to work at this time.

Two months later the Air Force sent a uniformed colonel to our house to inform us that we had seen &quot;space trash that landed later in Kansas.&quot;  He even brought an &quot;official report&quot; with him.  We laughed him off the premises.  We anticipated that the Air Force would be interested in hearing what we saw, not telling us.

It was about 500meters away. At first it seemed as if it was 1 object such as a large piece of plasic caught up in the wind. I could see that it was slowly moving in my direction. As it came closer it was obscured by a large tree in a neighbours garden. But a minute or 2 later it appeared from behind the tree and I could see that it was in fact 3 seperate objects moving together, but never touching each other. As they got nearer I could see that they were 3 silver triangular objects. They were flying/floating in a triangalur formation, and each was slowly turning. As they turned individually, they also turned together as a group at the same speed. They were a dull silver colour, and every so often lights would appear from the corners of the objects. The lights would come on quickly and then fade away. The light colours would change, sometimes blue, sometimes red, sometimes yellow. The 3 objects passed more or less directly over my house. At this point I was leaning out of the window looking up as they passed over the roof. As they vanished from view, I ran into the opposite room and looked out of the window. A second or 2 later I saw them re-appear over the brim of the roof. I watched them for another 10 or 15 minutes before they vanished from view. They always moved in a perfectly strait line and although they were close to each other they never touched. There was no sound, and all the time I was trying to think about getting a camera (but I had no film). My girlfriend hadn&apos;t arrived home from work (she thought I was quite mad when she returned). I never felt in danger, and just wanted someone to witness it with me.

They were walking and facing north, and a very bright meteor crossed the clear night sky, originating behind them and to their right, and traveling generally to the northwest.  It was very bright, one of them reported. The interesting part of the event is that both witnesses were able to hear the event at the same instant they were watching it, even though the object that caused the event, if it was a meteor, was many tens of miles above their heads.  Technically speaking, because sound travels at approximately 1,000-1,100 feet per second, the witnesses should not have been able to &quot;hear&quot; the event until many minutes later.  For technical reasons, we know that one of the witnesses was not able to see the event; he only heard it.

I checked several sources and the date was DEFINATELY the 18th of January!  I know you said dates were very important, so I checked with several people as to the date of the storm over the long Martin Luther King weekend. It occured approximately 10:30 the previous night- the sky was clear and it hadn&apos;t snowed yet, so that would definately would have been the 18th.

It was late at night  while we were on our way &gt; to a gig, driving along the New York State thruway, near Herkimer, NY. I &gt; was riding in the passenger seat and happened to look out across the &gt; valley. It was a perfectly clear night with an almost full moon and some &gt; high, very thin clouds, and the details of everything are still sharp in &gt; my mind. As I looked up above the distant ridge, I saw a green, &gt; spherical light moving along parallel to our direction of travel. It &gt; moved along steadily, and I assumed it was a beacon light on a plane. I &gt; joked to the person driving, &quot;Hey a UFO!&quot;, and as I watched the green &gt; light moved in front of one of the wispy clouds, at which point I could &gt; see that it was ONLY a spherical green light. I began watching intently, &gt; getting a chill, and shortly it stopped abruptly and shot up straight &gt; through the wispy clouds at an incredible speed. Gone! At this point, &gt; our keyboard player who was a sound sleeper jumped up out of a dead &gt; sleep in the back seat and yelled &quot;What&apos;s wrong!&quot; Very strange, and it &gt; gets stranger. &gt;     Within the next couple of years, I was still in the band, and was &gt; home here in Warner for a visit with my mother. I was in this very room, &gt; at the time a bedroom, now my office. I am a very sound sleeper, and was &gt; sound asleep (it was the middle of the night, another clear moonlit &gt; night). I woke up, wide awake, suddenly, and looked out the window over &gt; our yard, which is clear lawn about 100 yards to a treeline at the end &gt; of the yard. The green spherical object was sitting there out over the &gt; tops of the trees at the end of the yard, and it began to move, &gt; noislessy, toward the house (at least it appeared to, because it was &gt; getting larger). It reached about halfway across the yard, at treetop &gt; level, stopped abruptly, and shot straight up, again at an incredible &gt; speed.&gt;     That was it for about the next twenty odd years. Not a thing. I&apos;ve &gt; told ((name deleted)) (my wife) about it, and she wondered about it, but this next one is &gt; great. About three or four months ago, I was lying in bed, next to &gt; Deborah, when I woke up like a shot. Right up next to our front window &gt; at the top of the sash, but outside the window, was the green sphere. It &gt; was blinking on and off at a relatively slow rate. Deb woke up like a &gt; shot, and got a look at it as well. We both decided it was the size of a &gt; basketball, and it quickly shot out of sight, upwards, after about five &gt; or six seconds of flashing.", "for every government agency would finally put the rumors to rest and tell the truthI was traveling eastbound on I-10 when I suddenly seen lights more than 10 from my view the lights where on the rear of the object because it also was traveling the same direction as I was.  I noticed it when I was approaching vineyard avenue in the city of ontario, California on I-10.The object at first in my eyes was a plane preparing to land on Ontario airport which is just south of I-10 approximately 1-3miles when I seen it but then to my surprise it when back in the same northern direction where it came from the for approx. 1 minute then it does a 325 degree turn for what I dont know when it could of just veared right instead of almost making a 360 turn for no reason. Like it was lost. After the 325 degree turn it was traveling East and continues for the next 2 minutes the it slowly turns a little bit and heads North East. My eyes where focused so much on this object that I missed my exit not one offramp but two. After realizing I was about 5 miles from my missed exit I immediately got off because at this point the object was to faint to see anymore. When I first saw the lights on this object it approximately was about 2-3 miles, I could see the objects shape or form, But the amount of lights that where horizontal on the object from my distance seemed like a wingspan of a jumbo 747 jet. I also noticed alot of other flying objects around the sky which looked like planes and helicopters all aroung the Inland Empire as if they where sent to observe the object.  I also looked at the person driving in his beige trcuck to see if he was also observing what I looked at.  But to my dissapointment he wasn&apos;t.  All I could say is that im not the only individual that night go wisualize the incident.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates incident occurred on January 12, 2001.  However, we suspect he meant 2002.

WHEN THE SOUND DIDN&apos;T RECEDE I WENT TO MY KITCHEN THINKING THAT MY DISHWASHER WAS GETTING READY TO EXPLODE (THE SOUND WAS SO LOUD AND SO CLOSE). IN THE KITCHEN I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND ACROSS THE STREET OVER A HOUSE I SAW A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT WITH A BEAM THAT WAS SHINING DOWN BEHIND THE HOUSE. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A POLICE HELICOPTER SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE. BUT IT WAS SO LOUD (SO LOUD THAT YOU COULD ALMOST FEEL IT) AND THE CRAFT (WHICH I COULD NOT SEE BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK AND THE LIGHT COMING FROM THE BOTTOM OF IT WAS SO BRIGHT)WAS NOT MOVING. IT WAS STATIONARY. SO I RAN OUTSIDE TO GET A BETTER LOOK AND THE NOISE WAS UNBELEIVABLY LOUD. I&apos;VE NEVER HEARD A POLICE HELICOPTER SOUND LIKE THIS.

WE WERE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND IT WAS MOVING (NOT FAST) FLYING OVER OUR HOUSE.

At the time of the sighting, I did not know whom I could report it to, and figured that if it was truely something, the news would have reported it.  I am going to write word for word from my journal entry of that day: 4:37am, Stateline Road.  That&apos;s the time and place I was when I seen it.  I was heading north, so it was in the western sky that  I spotted &quot;it&quot;.  I don&apos;t know exactly what &quot;it&quot; was, but I can describe the scene.I was heading from Milton-Freewater to Walla Walla, going to work.  Usually, when I drive, I like to glance around, especially early mornings, because of all the different hues of color in the sky from the moon.  Well, anyway, shen I was about to cross the Oregon-Washington Stateline Road, I glanced to the left of me.  I seen a bright, green flash, followed by an object that appeared to be on fire, decending at an approximently 35 degree angle, parallel to the course I was traveling.  The whole scene occured in a short timespan of maybe a few seconds.  After watching too much television, I remembered to document the time by my car&apos;s clock-radio.Now, I couldn&apos;t tell you exactly what the object was, or if it was even an object or maybe a fireworks display. But, given the angle of decent, my best guess it that it was a solid object.  I could anything from a meterorite to space garbage or even something extravagant like a UFO.  I just hope that I&apos;m not the only one who has seen it.((NUFORC Note:  Even though the witness submitted his report more than three years after it had occurred, his facts are correct.  Please see other reports for this time and date.  The event was very strange, and it was seen over a large area of Oregon and Washington.

Military jets flying over-head a short while later.I stepped outside my work to have a cigarette with a co-worker. We watched what we thought were some kind of strange aircraft then as we studied more we noticed that the aircraft was not anything of this earth. They moved in ways that i have never seen. Then they just stopped and hovered for a long period of time. My co-worker and I were pretty spooked about the whole thing so we went back inside. We went to leave work just a little while later and there were several military jets flying over Jamestown. We thought this whole thing was pretty weird!!! I got home and told my husband about this. He then called and reported this to WGHP Fox 8 television in High Point, NC. They said they didn&apos;t get any reports on this but that they would follow up on it. They said they usually don&apos;t get much cooperation on these type of things. He then called and reported this to WFMY CBS ch. 2 in Greensboro, NC and got the same response. He then called Piedmont Triad Int. Airport and spoke with the airport authority.

My mother was in the passenger seat of the car and I was in the back waiting for my father.  The sun had just went down and it was dusk.  My mother suddenly asked me &quot;What are those? Are those birds?&quot;, and i glanced at the two objects flying in our direction and I just said &quot;No, those aren&apos;t birds, they look like planes&quot;.  Both the crafts moved like planes would and they were parallel to each other and dark in color with no lights.  Then, as I continued to watch them pass overhead, I noticed the odd shape of the crafts.  They were shaped like spiders, with a solid body in the middle and extensions from that in all directions.  There were maybe 4 or 5 extensions.  At that I became fearful of terrorism by another country, and my mother ran into the store to get my dad.  By the time they came out it was too far away to see.  I&apos;ll repeat that they moved like airplanes, in a straight line, but no sound was heard, and although it was becoming dark, there were no lights on the crafts and they were very dark in color.  The unusual shape of the crafts scared us both.", "Inverted Cylinder flying the night sky near Milton WA2/11/02     11:50 pm My girlfriend and I seen an object hanging in the sky over Fife or N.E. Puyallup. She called to me because she seen it first. She asked what is that? Upon looking I tried to reason that it might be a balloon or fire works. My brain raced with reasonable answers but none fit the M.O. I quickly ran and grabbed my camera. Four or five shots where taken but I am not sure if they will turn out, the F stop was off and I could not hold the camera still. On the last one I braced myself against a pole to hold steady. Maybe that one will turn out. The sky was black, except for the orange glow of this object bouncing and moving erratically around the sky. It would move slow and stead in one direction, then suddenly move quickly about the night sky. It seemed to have no apparent direction in mind. As it moved south we jumped into the truck to follow and see it. We parked on 10th Ave in Milton and watched it moving to the south and east. It seemed to me to be over the Puyallup area at this time. The orange glow coming from below the object was bright, but would at times glow brighter then fade some. It seemed to get pretty far away from our position, maybe eight to ten miles, then it started moving back toward and to the west of where we were. At or about it&apos;s closes point to us at this time the orange glow faltered then grew stronger. As it grew stronger it instantaneously  released a shower of sparks, almost resembling a fire work being shot from the sky toward the ground. This happened twice very quickly. Both pulses of fire could be seen hailing down toward the earth at the same time. There also was a slight audible release when these showers erupted from the object. It sounded like a very soft pop, kind of like popping a finger out of the corner of one&apos;s mouth very quietly.We decided to drive toward the Fife Valley for a better look and to be in a position that we could travel in the direction of the object&apos;s flight path. We turned the corner and parked when the object started to move about very rapidly. It made a quick move to the west, so fast that it was almost as if you blinked and it had moved a quarter mile already. Then we rushed to get to the valley where we could see the whole sky. It was less then two city blocks to the valley. I told her as she started to drive, &quot;It&apos;s gone.&quot; She said, &quot;No way.&quot;  I then told her I had seen it disappear into the southern sky in an instant. We drove down the hill to the valley and seen nothing. We were back at the apartment at 12:11 am. The object looked like an inverted cylinder with an orange glow coming from the bottom of the it.

I immediately drove over to my best friend&apos;s house and we watched the sky light up with brilliant flashes of light.  I don&apos;t know how to describe them except to say they definitely weren&apos;t lightning.  Later that night the government let out a release saying that it was transistors blowing up (all at the same time, during a 50 mile radius; mind you I could drive in this weather).

It would stay still again for about 45-60 seconds, and move in a radical direction, and then stay still again.  We also saw what looked like red and blue flashing lights on the bottom of it.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but it was much too high, and the movement didn&apos;t seem typical for a helicopter. From our house in Clearview (southern Snohomish)we were facing southeast (in the direction of Maltby.)It was fairly easy to see the way it moved relative to where the tree boughs were.

I had gotten off of work at a local restaurant.  I walked home a block and a half away to change from my work clothes and into my running clothes.  I proceeded to run to a local Villiage Pantry for a late night snack.  I was running on West Main St on the north side of the road.  I at the time was having a conversation with &quot;God.&quot;  I had asked him and her if they could show me an &quot;Angel of the Lord&quot; or what I refer to as whats described in the Christian Bible.  Almost insantaniously behind my destination spot on the North East corner of Main and Hospital Rd I noticed what appeared to be an airplane.  I was a little confused as to why this plane or object was flying so low and right over a main street in town.  I stopped running and proceeded to walk the rest of the way.  All the while watching the object come closer.  It at first appeared to be a taller vehicle in the road behind a regular size car which was stopped at a red light at the intersection of West Main and Hosptial Rd.  I thought maybe it was a &quot;Monster Truck.&quot;  Living in the midwest that wouldn&apos;t have surprised me.  But then it was noticeably higher in the horizon.  And the lights in front did look very much like bright yellow headlights of a truck.  It then appeared like lights from maybe a medium sized aircraft.  I stood on the north east corner of Main and Freemont St to observe the object come closer.  I had seen a car in front of the object in question turn left off of West Main St then proceed North onto Hospital Rd.  I often wondered if the occupants in that vehicle had seen what I had seen.  Just south of me on the South East corner of Main and Freemont is a church.  And on the South West corner of the intersection there is a wood and brick home.  A home also stood on the North West corner.  On the corner that I was standing there stands a mansion.  I checked the wind around me and listened for any noise.  There was neither wind or noise.  Only the so! und of m y breathe and the sound of my shoes when I occasionally moved a foot or two.  There also was no moon visible and it was a starry night.  The object proceeded to move east over West Main St.  When the object became closer to me the &quot;headlights&quot; disappeared behind the trees and when the object was totally within view it hovered over the trees and the home on the South West corner of West Main and Freemont St.  I was in &quot;awe&quot; of what I was seeing.  We were caddy corner from each other.  I couldn&apos;t make out a body to what I was seeing only approximately ten soft circular white lights in a perfect circle.  The distance of the object or lights seemed to be within 50 feet from the ground or 30 from the top of the home it was hovering over.  It was very surreal to say the least.  I wasn&apos;t scared.  I was enthrawled if anything.  I wanted to know and experience more of what I was seeing.  I started thanking &quot;God&quot; for giving me a response to what I was only moments ago talking with him and her about.  Then I thought to myself, &quot;Why me?&quot;  Some twenty-something year old from Peru, Indiana.  I was no one important at least in the eyes of anyone on Earth besides maybe my mother.  I decided to go in for a closer look by jaywalking across the street where I would be right under it or them.  In the same instance that I proceeded to walk over to the South West corner of the intersection the lights and maybe object started to move in a &quot;counter clock wise&quot; motion heading South East.  I stopped in the middle of the intersection saying in a whisper, &quot;Don&apos;t go.&quot;  And, &quot;I want to see more.&quot;  I was not afraid.  I watched as it or they dissappeared behind the houses and trees in town.  I ran to the river which is three blocks south of where I stood.  Which took approximately a minute.  I stood on the railroad tracks that are located on the north side of the Wabash River.  In the South Eastern part of town maybe a half a mile away all I saw was the same &quot;beams&quot; of light that I had initially seen shining toward the south.  I still ! could se e no shape to what was giving off the strange lights.  I at that moment assumed it was a plane and came to the conclusion that the object or lights that I saw had vanished.  Only now do I know that the beams of lights where of the same.  The following day I phoned Grissom Air Force Base which is located South West of town to see if there had been any night flights the night I witnessed my UFO.  I was told that there were no night flights in the area.  Which didn&apos;t surprise me because the base was due to close in a matter of a few years.  It was only until today that I decided to find out if others have witnessed similar occurrances and experiences by logging onto NUFRC.  You would think that I would have written the exact month and date of this.  But after being laughed at over and over again after telling my eye witness account the month and date didn&apos;t seem so important.  Until now.  Many people have labeled me &quot;crazy&quot; because of what I tell them.  &quot;I could care less.&quot;  Now I have validation of what I had seen.

My teenaged daughter and I were in our car, just about a block away from my house, when from the top part of my windshield I saw a very rapid West to East (right to left) flyover of something I could not identify.  I ducked but they had passed over some trees and I yelled to my daughter to look to the left, as the &quot;object&quot; came through a clearing.  Whatever it was, it had seemingly transformed from two closely-spaced but possibly separate black Vs (almost like birds flying closely together) into one slightly tilted black line with 4 distinct, shallow Vs connected to a straight black line making up what appeared to be a wing configuration (no fuselage seen, i.e. it appeared to be a horizontal line while flying away from us).  It was flying at tremendous speed -- much faster than any small aircraft would.  During the lapse of 1 or 2 seconds between my first seeing it out the windshield to seeing in a different shape (different perspective?) from my driver&apos;s side window, it was by then probably about a half mile away and flying at no more than a mile in altitude, yet still about a full inch from side to side at arm&apos;s length.  Therefore, it was good-sized, yet did not appear to be any kind of typical aircraft -- and not two very fast-flying birds which was what my split-second initial view of it had reminded me of.   My daughter was also amazed and said, &quot;Mom, follow it!  Turn up here and let&apos;s chase it!&quot;  By the time we got to the end of the block, I turned, but with buildings and trees obscuring our view, we never caught sight of it again.  I rolled down my window, expecting to hear some kind of sound, but didn&apos;t hear anything.

There were 7 lights that I witnessed, two more according to others nearby.  The lights were amber colored, and would occasionally flash bright white for a moment before going back to amber.  They moved steadily, not zigzagging or stopping and starting.  They were travelling northwest, coming from the southeast.  They each took 4-6 minutes to cross the sky from horizon to horizon.  There were first a pair, moving at the same rate, far enough apart to be distinctly two separate objects.  Before they disappeared over the horizon, a solitary object moved in the same direction.  This solitary one was seen to flash.  About 5 minutes after that one disappeared over the horizon, 4 more came from the same starting point, moving in a line at first.  About 1/4 of the way across the sky, the front one diverged a bit, but they still travelled together.  At about this point, the rear one began to flash white for 30 seconds or so, then went back to amber.  Along the way across, perhaps one or two others did a similar flash behavior.  No sound was heard to come from them.  The objects were very bright and large; moreso than planets, stars or any airplanes.  I am a 26 year old college student in LAS.

I saw that!&quot;  My companion didn&apos;t know what to think of me and was quite incredulous.September, 1971 I was two months from my twentieth birthday.  I was in the habit of taking rather long walks, especially on mild and pretty autumn days as this one was.  I found myself walking along Main Street in Buffalo, in front of the State University of New York at Buffalo.  In those days, there was not yet a northern campus.  I was walking north on Main Street, nearing the front of Hayes Hall.  The sight of it is remeniscent of days when a stately appearance inspired respect in the viewer.  I was busy thinking to myself that there was no one anywhere to be seen.  A thing came flying west over Hayes Hall at a very low altitude, from the direction of Bailey Avenue on the opposite side of the campus.  What was it doing there?  This was not the airspace I would normally see aircraft use.  Was this an experiment of the University?  Was this a military experiment?  This was Sunday.  Niagara Falls was the direction the craft was flying, but why was it so low and who could be flying it?  There were no windows.  As I watched this thing in wonder, I was greatly surprised that there was NO SOUND!  This thing was just above the trees and there was absolutely no sound.  I saw a heat signature at the back of the craft, that somehow gave me a kind of reassurance that I might be watching something I could relate to ; something within my experience.  But there was no Sound.  None.  There was no audible competion on the street.  No traffic. No people.  Just me watching that thing fly fly low over the University, the trees, me, the street and the houses.  It flew directly over me.  It was shaped like an arrowhead without a stem.  It&apos;s color was green, like an Army jeep; a new, clean one.  This was why I thought it might have been a military experiment.  But it had no markings on it.  Not on its side, not on its bottom.  Just the green of a new jeep.  And no sound.  I got so freaked out I still don&apos;t remember how I got home that day.

It was a crystal clear night sky in Denver at the time.  As I was talking to him, I looked to the North of Saturn, just East of the constellation Cassiopea and saw two bright lights fixed (not moving)approximately 10 degrees apart at an elevation about 45 degrees above the Eastern horizon.  They were very bright, both with the same magnitude, nearly that of Jupiter.  They looked beautiful, like a wide double start system.  As I continued talking I saw one light begin to fade, then about 4 seconds later, the other faded also.  They both became dark.  They appeared to have angular dimention, as opposed to being like point star light sources.  They also appeared to be very high.  When they both faded away, none of the other stars in their vicinity faded.  I then, about a minute later, saw two aircraft with navigation lights flying in the vicinity (about 20,000 feet)in differnt directions. I can only surmise that I was looking at two satelites in a fixed geosychros orbit.  It was about two hours after local sunset.

They looked like a set of double stars separated by 8-10 degrees.  They were fixed, not moving.  Both brightness magnitudes were as bright as Jupiter. They appeared to have angular width, not points of light.  It&apos;s difficult to say, but I&apos;d estimate altitude at 20,000 feet.  As I was still talking, one of the lights started to dim.  After 2-3 seconds, the other light also dimmed.  Both dimmed to darkness.  No other surrounding stars &quot;dimmed&quot;.

I was camping in a very rural, secluded area with my girlfriend and her little boy, who was five, and two cats. We were camping in an &quot;authentic&quot; canvas tipi, which was 18&apos; in diameter.  The tipi has a smoke hole in the top, which allows one to build a fire inside. The area where we were made camp was heavily wooded and situated on the flat top of a hill.Since it was cool in the evenings that time of year, we had built a good fire before bedding down for the night. My girlfriend and I were on one side of the fire in a double sleeping bag and her son was on the other side of the fire in his sleeping bag. One of the cats had curled up next to me in the crook of my arm. My girlfriend, lying to my left, was closest to the fire and I was near the outer wall of the tipi. As we settled down to sleep, the sounds of innumerable crickets nad a multitude of other night insects filled the air. The gurgle of a creek located about ten yards from the campsite contributed to the cacophony.Around midnight(the time is approximate), I woke up suddenly. I was lying on my back and when I opened my eyes I was looking up at the smoke hole. The fire was out and the opening was unobscured. A bright, white, light was shining straight down into my eyes. Simultaneously, I realized several things...I could not move a muscle, there was a feeling of electricity in the air, and there was absolute silence. I could feel the bulk and warmth of my girlfriend next to me on one side and the small, furry presence of the cat on the other side. I could smell the lingering wood smoke and feel the coolness of the night air on my face. I could feel the hardness of the ground under my back. All my senses were intact.As I looked up into the light it grew brighter and larger, until the top third of the tipi glowed and then suddenly, abruptly, winked out. At the same time I heard a rushing sound and the sudden, loud hoot of an owl that seemed to come from just outside the tipi wall on my right side. Instantly I was able to move and raised up. I looked around and saw nothing amiss. I quietly spoke my girlfriend&apos;s name to wake her. She mumbled something at me, but didn&apos;t stir. The cat next to me stretched and lay back down. I lay back down, as well, and went to sleep almost immediately.I probably wouldn&apos;t have given this episode a second thought, except for something that occurred about a week and a half later.On the morning after this episode, I was washing up in the stream nearby. As I washed behind my left ear, about 1 1/2&quot; straight back from my earlobe, there was a raised place. It itched a little, and thought it was probably just a bug bite, as there were lots of noseeums in the woods.This &quot;bite&quot; didn&apos;t go away, however, and continued to itch. Over the course of a week, it changed in character from a slightly red, raised area to a black, molelike thing with well defined edges. I thought maybe I had been bitten by a spider. But, there was no surrounding redness or swelling and no pus or other evidence of infection. There was no pain at the site. It never stopped itching, though.A few days later, I reached up and touched the spot, as I had done many times since it appeared. As i felt it with my thumb and forefinger, it just came off. I looked at it in my hand. It was like a small, round, black disk approximately 1mm diameter. I felt my neck where it had been and there was a small opening in my skin. There was no bleeding or discharge. The edges of the &quot;hole&quot; were smooth and did not appear to be healing, but, intact, as if the skin had had no damage. Except of course, for the fact that there was now a tiny hole there.I tried to look at the little, black &quot;disk&quot;, but it was so small that I had a hard time keeping hold of it and eventually dropped it and was unable to find it.This event occurred over 21 years ago, but I still have the small hole in my skin, right behind my left ear. Even though I can&apos;t remember the exact date, every detail of that night is still as clear to me as when it happened.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "I was in the middle of doing pilates with my wife when we saw something through our window that looked like a trianglular shape. At first I thought it was a plane because it was dark outside and the craft was far away so it really didn&apos;t grab my attention. As the craft got closer, there was still no sound. That is what really surprised me because I don&apos;t know of any plane or helicopter that doesn&apos;t make any noise. The craft then started going backwards, and I know planes can&apos;t do that. When I saw the craft do that I knew that I just had to see it. So my wife and I went outside to see it and that is when I realized that it wasn&apos;t a plane. The craft started glowing and it was definitely a trianglular shape. When the craft stopped glowing it was gone and there was no trace of it. I&apos;m not sure what it was.

When I was 8, my older brother and I nightly analyzed the sky for 2.5 weeks as a result of frequently-reported UFO sightings. I saw an inverted-V formation of 8 lights - 4 down on each side, indistinguishable from stars, quickly invert to a V-shape and then, in about 1 second, traverse from the directly-South sky to the directly-West sky. A perfect 45-degree hemisphere shift in 1 second. I was able to point this V-shaped configuration out to others for two nights following my sighting. The Lt. Genl.&apos;s report, which inspired mine, are similar except that the star-like formation he reported was in an inverted-V in the west, shifted to a V-shape, then traversed 45 degrees south, in about 1 second, &quot;indistinguishable from the stars&quot;.

This sighting occurred in Dearborn, Michigan. I was 16 not 17 at the time, and was with the metioned gentleman. Recently our paths crossed for the first time in twenty-eight years. What I saw was oval not boomerang shaped. It had an upper section of super white fluorescent lighting separated by partitions. It was approximately 200&apos; away and 100&apos; above the ground when we first spotted the craft on Monroe Blvd., between Outer Drive and Carlysle, what is known as West Dearborn. It appeared to be about 100&apos; ft. wide. Below the craft was a red glowing dome that pulsated with bright to dimmer intensity. There were no sounds emitting from the craft. My above mentioned friend was the first to notice the craft as I was the driver. The craft was hovering over a residental area near a elementary school. I pulled into the first driveway after spotting the craft and all three of us were in a mild state of shock. This craft seemed to be aware of our presence too. The craft immeadiately headed in a northwest direction with us following in amazement.It&apos;s direction took us down Oxford Blvd., which dead-ended at Crowley Park in Dearborn, MI also. Just before the road ended, all the lights on the craft dissapeared. I then pulled into te last driveway on Oxford St. to turn around and head back to Telegraph Rd., (U.S. 24) when suddenly the craft was right over the car. At this point, I could have thrown a stone and hit it. This is where we got a good look at the red pulsating dome on the bottom.  There was now static interference on the 1963 Ford Falcon AM radio we had on at the time. Now... the craft began chasing us. My above mentioned friend was sitting in the middle and put his left leg on my accelerator pedal. My other friend sitting shotgun was throwing punches into my right arm and shoulder. I had no choice but to break all the residental speed laws by about 40 miles per hour. Now we were in survival mode. With the craft over us all the way, we made it to Telegraph Rd. south where the craft stayed at our right over the line of houses and business, rather than the middle of a major highway. We then pulled in to the only restaurant open that night which was near the intersection of Van Born Rd. We managed to get the male cook and female waitress to come out and witness the event. At this point, the craft headed west. Th restaurant employees did see the craft as it was leaving the area but it was too far off for them to describe it as we did.

My wife and I were sunbathing close to the Las Vegas strip at about mid day.  I was observing a plane in the sky, holding up my hand to obliterate the glare of the sun, and I noticed a glare in the sky near the sun at high altitude to the south.  I observed it for a minute with the naked eye and said to my wife I think I might actually be seeing a UFO.  My Wife said run and get the Binoculars.  I ran and returned a minute later with 2 pair of high power binoculars.  I was now apparant that the object had moved north closer to us still at a very high altitude, however.  Through the binoculars we could make out the colors and shape of the object.  It was a brilliant, shiny, bright red hemisphere on the bottom surrounded by a bright silver band.  The band was like the outer edge of a traditional flying saucer like you might see in the movies.  We do not know if the sphere continued to the top of the object or not.  We never got a view of it&apos;s top side since it never rotated.  It was far above cloud level, so it must have been pretty big for us to see it.  However, I would not be surprised if no one else observed the object as it was very small in the sky at that high altitude and there were many contrails in the sky from planes. The object was slowly traking due north and was soon directly overhead.  It continued north at a slow steady pace and went eventually out of sight.  The Las Vegas strip runs south to north, so coincidently or not the object was tracking directly over the Strip.  My sceptical, scientific mind tried to reason that maybe it was a wierd high tech weather balloon.  But the wind was blowing east and the object&apos;s path was perfectly linear from south to north.  I can only conclude that the object was a craft of top secret government or Alien origen.  I wish I had a high power telescope with a camera mounted, but fate did not provide me that option.  I&apos;ve never observed a UFO before and have been very sceptical about these t! hings, b ut now I really consider it likely that contact has been made  and they would rather play peek-a-boo than come right out with it.", "Stationary, bright white light blinking smaller, colored lights in eastern sky.Very bright light in eastern sky, not in line with the planets, which were very visible that night, but to the north of them.

At about 8:20 PM PDT I observed a bright light to the NW over Spokane.  This is not too unusual as this is the general direction of the local airport and military air base.  I am accustomed to seeing landing lights, and have observed them appear to hang in the air when the plane is taking off and traveling towards my location.  Usually however, I can detect the motion of the plane after several minutes.  What drew my attention to this light, was the fact that about 10 minutes after initially seeing it, it was still in the same location.  I then thought it must be a helicopter, and grabbed my 7X35 binoculars.What I saw through my binoculars was three white lights in a line, with red and blue lights on top.  The brightness would increase to quite bright, and then fade to dim, and back to bright etc. about every 2 to 3 minutes.  The light then began moving slowly toward the NE.  I then saw another light approaching from the SW.  I thought it must be an airplane coming to check out the original light.  But when the second light got to within what I estimate to be about 3 miles from the first light, it too then stopped and began to get brighter and dimmer, just like the first.  I called 911 and reported what I was seeing, and was told no one else had reported anything.Now what is still giving me goose bumps is that while I was on the phone with 911, I was still observing the lights in my binoculars.  All of a sudden the second light began &quot;dancing&quot; - it left the impression of what one sees on the 4th of July when you move a sparkler around rapidly at night.  What is most unusual is that the original light stayed stationary, so I know it just wasn&apos;t me getting jittery with the binoculars. This dancing lasted only about 20 seconds. The second &quot;dancing&quot; light then dimmed out and I didn&apos;t see it again.The original light then continued moving slowly to the NE, but as it got NNE of my location, the white lights went out, and the &quot;object&quot; began moving rapidly to the SSW, and it appeared to be climbing.  I would estimate its speed as that of a fast military jet.  I observed what appeared to be the normal red and green navigation lights on the outside edges, but there were two larger, brighter red lights which glowed steadily on top.  I was outside at this point, but I heard no noise, which is probably not so unusual, because the object was probably 20-30 miles from me at this time.  Its hard to estimate.  At about this time, I again saw what appeared to be an object much like the original, over Spokane, again in the general direction of the civilian and military airports.  This object again flucuated in intensity, but after about 5 minutes it dimmed out.  Again, what bothers me about this is the wildly dancing of the one light, while the other stayed stationary.", "Three strange crafts seen over Flagstaff,  Arizona later attaching themselves to each other", "Red-orange lights over seen motionless over Lockborne AFB-one vanished and one sped out of sight.Myself  and two other musicians were on our way to the entrance of Lockborne Air Force base.

They were completly motionless and silent. I had been fixed on these lights several seconds,but the instant I consciously knew what I was looking at, the right light vanished and the other shot off to the north and out of sight in an instant, in complete silence.

The driver didn&apos;t see it, and when we spoke of it, the driver joked about our seeing &quot;flying saucers.&quot;  A peculiar thought I had latter was that it took a month or more for me to admit to myself that I had seen what could be called a UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was visiting a friends house, and for some reason stepped onto his front porch, and overhead was a very large saucer-shaped craft flying silently in a direct line overhead.

I have rarely talked about this to anyone.  I think I&apos;ve told maybe 4 other individuals.I am not a partaker of drugs and have no history of mental illness.  No history of any type of episode out of the ordinary.  I am a healthy adult male.This was a very real event.  This was a event that absolutely terrified me.  I have never, ever been in such a bad situation.  I have the chills just writing about it.I was in a remote area of the desert east of San Diego on the border with Mexico.  Jecumba was west of me by maybe 10-15 miles and Interstate 8 was north of me by maybe 5-7 miles.  I was alone in the Valley of the Moon in April/May of 1998.Before I proceed further, it is necessary to explain my usual awareness and habit when camping alone.  I always maintain a fire and sleep in about 1 hr cycles.  I wake up and stoke my fire.  It has taken me years to do this.  Force of habit and discipline.  I have a healthy respect for the wilderness and my vulerabilty despite my physical size.  I would also like to add that I consider myself &quot;intune&quot; with my surroundings.  Sight and sound.  I pay attention to the physical terrain, plants and animals that are around me.  I consider myself highy spatially aware.  You have to be.  I do some pretty hard hiking and I have to rely on my sound judgement.  I don&apos;t take risks, though I camp alone.  I&apos;m sure of myself.I awoke to a very serious situation.  My fire was out and I had dim coals.  I was absolutely stunned.  I&apos;ve never done that!  Ever! I must have been asleep for hours.  I could not see a damn thing.  Maybe a few moments later, as I busy trying to figure out what was wrong with me, the next serious situation occured to me.  There was no sound.  Nothing.  It was as if the all the sound got sucked up into nothing.  No wind and no animals.  If you have ever been alone and are used to hearing all sorts of things...hearing nothing is always a sign that something happened or is about to happen.This next part maybe a little wierd, but I get feelings.  The hairs on the back of my neck were standing on end.Let me tell you, I  got switched on.So I&apos;m laying there in my sleeping bag next to a nearly dead fire and clutching my tire iron in one hand and my knife in the other.  I&apos;m telling you, unknown person, that I was in serious trouble.  I felt a threat.This dawning sence of danger and threat escalated into terror.  Thats when the lights turned on.There are not words to describe to you what I felt then.I&apos;m in a sort of cave made my rocks that have tumbled down off a small mountain.  They&apos;ve piled on each other forming a shelter.  It&apos;s open in several places in the overhead and on the deck.  A powerful blue-white light was pouring in from above!  I mean it literally lit up everything.  No sound.  No sound whatsoever.  I could plainly see the angle of the light coming in at 45 deg.  It then started to orbit my little pile of rocks in a counterclockwise direction.  It was moving pretty fast.I&apos;m an ex-Firecontrolman.  USN.  I&apos;ve worked with and still work with some serious electronic equipement.  The Navy taught me a lot of math so as to appreciate how the electronics work.  Well, having done enough firecontrol problems involving range, bearing and height, I quickly had a vision of a upside down cone with me at the bottom, or pointy-end.  The source of that light was at the other end forming the circle, or orbit.  The walls of that cone formed maybe a 45 deg angle.  A best guess.  Knowing my terrain, the mountain was close to the origin, that was my present abode, was very close.  Hell, it was peppered with very large house-sized rocks.  Whatever was above me was very close.  Within a 100ft.  Maybe 75 ft.  Anymore and it would have collided with the mountain.Having been in the USN, I&apos;ve been around all kinds of aircraft.  I been around a lot of machinery.  Every bit of it makes noise.  Noise from gears, turbines, transmissions, AC/DC drives/motors...it all makes a lot of noise.Whatever was at the other end of that cone making the orbit within 100ft of me did not make a sound at all.  If it was an helicopter, for me not to hear the noise of it&apos;s turbine, gearbox and transmissio,n it would have been more than a mile in the air, moving at a tremendous speed in it&apos;s orbit and somehow maintaining a beam of light at 45 deg to me through the mountain behind me when it went throught that arc.It made maybe 5 or 6 orbits and turned off and was gone.I must tell you of another quality to this event.  When I say it was gone, I could feel it.  I could actually feel it was gone.  I don&apos;t know what the hell you are going to make of all this, and this new thing regarding my sence, but I could actually feel the danger abade.  I&apos;ve never felt that before.  I mean, I had a clear as a bell since that I was in very real danger, like maybe I was going to die.  I&apos;ve never felt that before or since.  My life is normal.  I swear it.  I&apos;m telling you, however, that I could feel that whatever that thing was, it was evil, bad, malevolent, whatever.  &quot;It&quot; did not have good intentions for me.  I wasn&apos;t ready either.  I&apos;d like to tell you that I was standing on my feet with my weapons, but it&apos;s like I felt I was paralyzed by fear.  It&apos;s like I couldn&apos;t move.  I was frozen and terrified.I&apos;d like to add that I&apos;ve seen helicopters doing patrol through this area.  I suppose they were Boarder Patrol choppers.  You can hear them from a mile off.  They make a lot of noise.That thing did not make a sound.That&apos;s all I can tell you.  I didn&apos;t see &quot;It.&quot;  I&apos;m not trying to sound proud, or something like that, but I&apos;m a pretty intelligent person.  I know what &quot;It&quot; wasn&apos;t.  Humans can&apos;t make machines like what &quot;It&quot; was yet.  I can&apos;t say what it was either.  Sherlock Holmes said that if you have eliminated the obvious, whatever is left, however preposterous, must be the answer.  &quot;It&quot; was not human.  No one can tell me otherwise.  I&apos;m 100% sure.Maybe five minutes later, I felt like I could move again.  The danger was gone.  I got my fire up and didn&apos;t sleep the rest of the night.Investigation of the area the next day before I left revealed nothing out of the ordinary that I could see.I&apos;ve been fine since then.Like I said before, I don&apos;t have a history of drugs or mental illness.  This is the only time in my life where I was unable to explain what was happening to me.  Definitely, it&apos;s the only time I&apos;ve ever been in fear of my life.  I mean, actual fear of my life.You can&apos;t have much more of an intence sensation than that.I&apos;ll never forget it.

Because the light looked out of place, I parked and began to watch it through a pair of 10X50 binoculars. When I did this, I noticed that the light seemed to be pulsating, going from a dimmer orangish then intensifying to a larger whitish. I wondered if the light was a yard light from a farm house somewhere on top of Monument Hill located just south of Quincy, WA. however I could clearly see the silouette of the tops of the hills, and this light was obviously higher than the hills. At first the light appeared to be stationary, but then it began to move slowly along the ridge of the hill towards the town of Ephrata, WA. It appeared to move along top of the ridge for about 1 minute and then stopped, began to desend towards the hill top. I noticed that the pulsating seemed to get brighter as it began to desend, as it neared the hill top, it was just like someone turned off a light switch. It just disappeared!! I sat there for about 20 more minutes searching the skyline thinking that maybe I just lost it behind a cloud,(it was overcast that night). After about twenty minutes, I spotted the light (or one just like it) about 20 miles to the west of where I saw it desend towards the ground, the light had the same characteristics as before as it seemed to be pulsating the orange/white light.

Everyone had fallen asleep by about 5:00AM and i was the only one left awake . I decided to clean up my friend&apos;s rather attrocious house and this required taking the garbage outside to the garbage bin. It was a somewhat clear night with only a few clouds in the sky.  There wasn&apos;t anyone up and the streets were silent. As I placed the garbage bags into the bin I noticed a bright light far away on the horizon. I remember only glancing at the sight as I assumed it was merely a plane or chopper. It should be noted that I had previously been a skeptic when it came to UFO sightingings. As I turned to enter the house the light began an unbelievable ascent into the sky. I say unbelievable because of the rate at which the object could climb. It was at this very moment that I first entertained the notion of this vessel being an unidentified flying object. The light seemed to be emanating from one source but if I glanced away for the briefest moment the light appeared to be made up of mutiple lights that were arranged in a semi-circle pattern. The object had risen to an enormous height in the sky and I thought it was going to disappear into the night when suddenly it began a descent with the velocity at which it had previously risen. I remember a feeling of fright coming over me. As a rational person I was terrified at the notion that something inexplicable could exist, and yet here it was before me. The object appeared to be coming in my direction as it descended. I lost sight of the object for a second and then it re-appeared directly overhead. I estimate it must have been about a mile-and-a-half above the ground. It sliced through the clouds effortlessly and as soon as it had appeared overhead, it was gone. The underpannel was marked with an &apos;X&apos; and had white lights outlining this shape. There appeared to be a red light moving around the object in a circular pattern.

It was triangular in shape, with a light at each apex--these three lights flashed/blinked red and white at the exact same time.

They went from orange, yellowish, red, and then white, all down the row.  So I was watching this from a hill, and then I went down the hill, and back up, and it was gone.  So I got off K10 at the exit east of Evening Star Road, and watched for a bit.  Then I saw it again, only this time it was west of where I originally saw it, like it went backwards.  It flickered, and then disappeared again.  I got back on K10 again and saw it again, only it was way, way east, almost NE of my location (as opposed to due N of me) and it kinda faded into the city lights.  I also noticed during this whole time many aircraft in and around the area and even more to the east--I mean a LOT, more than one would expect to see, even around an airport.I&apos;m sure many others saw this, the damn thing was HUGE.

I was sitting right below this thing and it was dead silent. I had the window about a 1/4 of the way down and I could hear nothing. It was probably the eariest silence I can ever remember. The light sat there for about 30 seconds or so and finally started moving to my right until it was directly in view of the right side of my car. It took some time for my eyes to adjust and stop seeing spots. But all I remember is having that same bright light to my right and seeing it rise out of view and dart off. It was almost as though it shot off like a slingshot had propelled it at a 45 degree angle. Just like that it was gone. I continued to try and start my car, and, after sitting there for about another minute, it started. It took all I had to catch my breath and try to tell myself ! that I w as okay and to bloc it out as though nothing had happened.

I was looking up at the stars and I saw it over the top of my house. It was small and I thought it was a plane, I noticed it was moving very slowly, and was very dim . I have seen many planes that fly at high altitudes, but ,this you could tell was very high. I was thinking of  maybe a satelite .

He said &quot;What color is that thing you&apos;ve seen before? I think it&apos;s outside.&quot; The object was almost directly over the house, located in the SE at about 500-1000ft in altitude, floating slowly NW. Within a few minutes, it stopped in a hover and was close enough to discern a vague gray colored triangle shaped outline behind the main point of round orange light. At this point, the object began alternately glow brighter orange and fade, then it began to kind of change in appearance. Several times the object was clearly visible as a line of small bright orange dots which would then resolve into one large orange glowing object again. It did this &apos;dance&apos; at least 3 times. During the times it would again resolve into one object, smaller white sparks appeared to fall off the bottom. After approximately 12 minutes, the object began to fade in brightness and float off towards the west. Shortly thereafter, it faded altogether and since the night was clear with an almost full moon rising, the gray outline was visible clearly at this point. It picked up speed and then disappeared altogether from visibility behind some trees in the neighborhood. We then witnessed a local police patrol turn down the nearest street in the direction that the object went, and I have little doubt that the officer probably saw it too. My 15 y/o daughter who also witnessed the event was on the phone to one of her friends; her parents have a police scanner and she told my daughter that the radio traffic from the local police stated it was &quot;balloons someone set on fire&quot;. That doesn&apos;t make sense. Helium filled balloons would not be able to stand up to the heat of any attached fire source, and this object emitted no smoke trail. Nor did it make any sound.

I said, &ldquo; WHAT THE HELL IS THAT&rdquo;! One of my friends responded with, &ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T KNOW&rdquo;! At that point I pulled some blue lights out of my pocket that were attached to a key chain, turned them on and started swinging them over my head hoping to get the orb&rsquo;s attention. When I did so it seemed to move up and away from me. By that point the other members of the group started to chase after me saying &ldquo;stop that&rdquo; we don&rsquo;t want that thing coming here. Then my friend ((name deleted)) (Stan&rsquo;s ((deleted))) said I&rsquo;m surprised Stan isn&rsquo;t here there always around where he is! Right at that moment Stan walked up. I asked ((name deleted)) are friend if he could get it in his telescope. He quickly changed lenses and we watched it for a fair amount of time. After that Stan said he caught some of it on camcorder. Also we noticed a car parked in the parking lot, but it was not until others started showing up that we decided to talk to the people in the parked car. Two of the people that showed up later went and talked to the people in the car and were told that they watched this thing fallowing Stan&rsquo;s van up the road and when Stan got to the parking lot the Orb abruptly turned West right over them and an out house not fare from where we all were.

I saw a star in the small gap between fog/clouds and looked to see if there were anymore visible, when I noticed a bluey green round thing just in view to the left of a cloud.  It was only stationery for a split second, almost as if it realised it had entered a gap in the sky, and then it shot accross the gap (right to left) and disappeared behind the fog/clouds.

On Friday night, I noticed what I first thought was a very bright star from the window of the second floor of my home. I went downstairs and outside for a better look. It was too bright to be a star and it had the shape of a diamond with a blueish color and it seem to be flickering. I waited to see if it was an airplane or helicopter. I waited. It was not. After about 5 minutes I went inside to my office and got a pair of binoculars and was followed outside by two other persons, who witnessed this object. What appeared diamond shaped to my eyes was actually(looking through the binoculars) something very large and round. It was spinning in a vertically. Colors of bright unique shades of some light red, blue and greenish yellow could be clearly seen. The colors were in circles and spinning in alternating directions. The blue color was pulsating and their was white like sparks all around the edges (like electricity popping out of a broken line). At one point a beam of wide white laser like light went from this object towards the mountains. This made us nervous and concerned. We remained outside for another 5 minutes and it remained in the same position. Everyone went in and I called the airport tower but they had a recorded message that sounded like it was for piolets.During the next evening my 31 year old daughter was visiting about 9 p.m. I told her about the previous evening and what we experienced. She said it was on the news because several people had called. The news said it was space debris from a satellite that probably broke up. I told her it was to low, it would have fallen or something. It was visible for at least 20 plus minutes. I took her outside to point out where it was when we noticed three of the objects. One over the Pacific and two almost overhead. There was plenty of space between them. One was almost in the same place it was the previous evening. She used the binoculars  and we were joined by three others who also looked at them and reported seeing what I stated above except that one of the objects had a something like a tail extending from it, that looked like a long streak of electricity. We remained outside for about 15 minutes and during that time all objects remained stationary.Around 10 p.m., I looked again and they were no longer visible.No noise. No movement except for within the objects themselves.This was a very concerning sighting. The laser beam triggered thoughts of some sort of high tech a terrorist controlled satellite. Because it remained undisturbed and returned as three the next night, I assume this is some sort of government project.

I noticed an object (circular) rising from behinds the 10th story of the buiding across the street.  The object was the size of a satellite dish. It flew parallel to the ground before making a sharp turn eastward and climb. The coating of the object flickered from opaque to mirror-like. It climbed sharply but steadily. All of a sudden, a huge cloud seemed to form over a distance of 20 miles (dist. from my home to the CN Tower)very quickly. It enveloped the object.

It doesn&apos;t look as if readers can make contact with other visitors to the site, which is fine, but maybe someone else will chime in or offer an explanation.  Reading the many accounts on this site over time, I&apos;m shocked by how many people have witnessed the black triangular craft that I did, and so many stories match one another - obviously the government has a new technology that they somehow are keeping secret.  Where is it during all the recent crisis, I don&apos;t know, but it sure would be handy.   This is all very surreal to me.  It was around sundown (7pm) on Wednesday March 22 in St. Clair Shores, MI near Metropolitan Beach for anyone who is familiar with the area.   I was pulled up to a garbage can near the park entrance dumping some cups and junk from my backseat to neaten up my car.  While in my cars backseat, out of the corner of my eye I see what apears to be a blimp floating over a trees that surround the park.  I really thought it was a blimp of some kind - it was probably 300 yards away at this time, and looked about the size of a semi truck trailer.  I got out of my car to get a better look.  This thing was obviously metal.  No blimp.  It floated like a hockey puck on ice, gliding along the skyline.  Most eerily, IT WAS COMPLETELY SILENT!!!  It seemed to defy physics; it looked heavy (bowling ball like), but made no noise or showed no fire or jet propulsion.  I could only compare it to when you see a helium balloon that has been accidentally let go and it it seen floating thru the sky, but huge and and shaped sort of like the Pontiac car emblem.  It moved laterally toward where I was so it did get closer, but still far enough to where I wasn&apos;t too concerned.  I remember like it was just yesterday that you could clearly see a lone green light on the underside of this thing...green like a traffic stoplight, and this light had a cup like metal cag! ing arou nd it, very similar to that which you would see in a gymnasium basketball court around a bulb or on a factory to protect a bulb, but allow for light to shine.  The light slowly and evenly got brighter then dim over and over, pulsing, if not like breathing.   The thing also had white lights at each corner, but not at the tips. The lights were in about 2 feet from the corner, but they were dimly lit.  I wanted to shout to someone, anyone and say, &quot;look at this thing, what is that, what the heck.&quot;   I wanted someone else to see it too.  It was incredible!  I didnt have a cellphone back then so I couldn&apos;t call the police, but I wanted to.  I thought I could ask them what it was.  I could kill myself for not having a camera.  The craft, which was creeping slowly in an eastern direction toward the beach then suddenly stopped, then shot sideways out of site behind trees and the horizon.  It still gives me chills typing about it now.  Part of me knows I will probably know what I saw one day soon, via CNN or FOX talking about the latest spyplane, but there&apos;s still another part of me that&apos;s wondering if this was something other worldly.  I jumped in my car and shut the door - I was weirded out!  When I got home, I watched the news, expecting to hear something about it.  Nothing.  I told two friends and my mom about it and they laughed at me and said it was a blimp.  No blimp zips like that!!! Plus this thing looked like a gun.  It just looked like hard black metal - I would compare it to a big magnet.  I never thought of it that way before now, but that&apos;s it!   One friend mentioned that Selfridge Airforce Base is very close to the Metropolitan beach (and after looking at a map, I confirmed that it is) so maybe it was something from there.  I even placed a non-emergency call to the St Clair Shores Police Dept to ask if they had any calls or knew what it was...they said that air force cargo planes often make flight paths over th area, as do the Air Force Blue Angels which often are part of airshows in the area.  Fri! ends, th is was not a known air force jet.  I don&apos;t believe it was a UFO because of the lights - much like you&apos;re used to seeing on a terrestrial plane to have placed underneath, and why would a UFO need lights anyway!!??  I imagine that soon this craft will be made public and become as everyday and &quot;Hollywood&quot; as the Stealth bomber has become, but for now, I feel priveleged to have seen one.  This site is littered with stories of craft identical to what I saw, so something new is out there.

My mom picked me up from school one day and as we were driving home, I noticed a black object hovering in the sky.

It was maybe 200 feet above the ground (without knowing its actual size, it&apos;s hard to know exactly how high it was) and was spinning counter-clockwise relatively to the ground at maybe 45 rpm.

I live on a road that turns off of Highway 67 south almost to Donaldson.  I turned on the road and could see a bright light through the trees.  I didn&apos;t think anything of it at first.  I got up to a clearing where there is a field and could clearly see what the light was.  There was three objects hovering approximatly 50 feet above the trees.  The lights from the object made it very easy to see them.  They were triangle shaped and they were black with lights all the way around them.  The lights were white and did not flash or move or spin or anything. The objects were the quite larger than a C-130 military airplane. The objects were not moving at all.  I paniced and sped up trying to get away from them as fast as I could.  I could still see the objects in my rearview mirror as I drove away.  I did not slow down or stop the rest of the way home.  When I got home I told my mother, my sister, my cousin and her children about what I saw and they all laughed at me.  I convinced my cousin (who is in her 30&apos;s) to come with me to see if the things were still there.  Her and her two sons got in my car with me and we set out on the road. She was still laughing at me until suddenly she stopped laughing and said &quot;Holy ****, what the **** is that?&quot;  I looked to my left (I was driving) and one of the objects came up out of a clearing and flew accross the road until it disappeared.  We watched it fly away to the south.  It was definatly the same thing as the other three I had saw 10 minutes earlier. None of these objects made any sound including this one. When we got to the place where the other three had been, they were gone.  We both started to panic and get scared as we sped home.  The two children that were with us began screaming and crying (one is 11 the other is 8) when the craft flew over the us on the road.  I could not sleep at all last night and thought about it while I was! going t o work at 4:00 this morning.  I have never believed in anything like this until last night.

The lights that were at the bottom part were moving very fast from left to right and vice versa.  The bottom lights had a squared/rectangular shape, but the one at the top, was round. They all moved together so they definitely were part of an object. They were also very bright! This object  was moving from west to east slowly. It wasn&apos;t producing sound, but what really shocked me was the SIZE of what I saw! I&apos;m not telling I saw something at the horizon....NO...I saw something that was the size of a roof top and was just of few feet above the ground.After that, I wanted to keep looking at it but I had to make a left on the light...and when I tried to find it again...it was gone.I drove for almost a half-hour looking around everywhere but nothing else happened...I&apos;m TOTALLY SURE about what I&apos;m describing!

It had different colored flashing lights blinking on and off. The lights seemed to be in a circular arrangement under the craft. I found myself drawn to it and kept thinking I was going to drive close to it. I cannot believe, that I kept driving towards it, without fear.There were several cars on the highway heading the same directions. No one stopped, or turned around. The craft was further from me than I thought. I thought the craft was located on the corner of Hwy 90 and Hwy 326. But when I got to that intersection it was further ahead. The craft was to the right of the highway, and I am guessing it was about 100-250 feet hovering above the ground. I am not exactly sure what date, or month. It was in 1992, between January and October of that year.The shape is hard to describe.I am curious if anyone else reported a sighting around this time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I believe they were silver, as the sun was brightly reflected off of them.  What caught my eye was that one of the spheres was making impossible movements.  It was moving back and forth in perfect swinging pendulum types movements.   It was moving very quickly like this, back and forth for some time.  I parked my car in a parkin lot on Ynez and Winchester Road and continued to watch a bit longer.  There were two other sphere shaped objects above, however, they remained stationary.  At one point, the sphere that was moving had attracted two large hawks to it.  The two birds and the sphere seemed to engage in a playful game together.  I think this is significant because comparing the sphere to the birds, I would say the sphere would be about 3 to 4 feet in diameter.  I sat and watched this for about 45 minutes total.  At 1300 hrs, I ducked my head back into my car (I had been standing outside of my car) just long enough to unbuckle my baby from his car seat.

As I was tending to the turkey, I heard a very loud jet roar. The sound was louder than normal so I looked up. The first thing I noticed was a very thick double contrail not very high  up in the sky.

There was a short moisture contrail behind it suggesting the path and turn. There are visible short extrusions on both sides I take to be wings but these have a forward curved appearance and come to a sharp tip which seems as though the extrusions that are coming from the main body of the craft and ended up curved toward the bottom of the craft and then forward. What I feel is the top view of the craft, I note two dooms side by side but with gentle curves and a forward aft oblong doom, just shy of the nose of the craft which I took to be an intake of some sort.

I&apos;ve studied botany, zoology, geology, meteorology, astronomy, chemistry and physics, i. e. I have a solid background in the natural sciences. I currently work as a fisheries observer collecting scientific data for the state of Alaska and the federal (US) government.I have never before seen or reported a UFO.On the night of 9/14/01, while doing a tour of Canada by car, I decided to camp just N of km 85 on the Trans Labrador Hwy (provincial road 389)in the province of Quebec. The nearest town was Baie-Comeau at the beginning of the highway and my campsite was miles from any human habitation in the Laurentian Mountains. I was utterly alone in the Canadian bush and I don&apos;t recall one vehicle passing on the road after about 20:00 hours. My campsite was off a small dirt driveway leading to some high tension power lines about 300 meters to the east (the  driveway was blocked about 10 meters west of my campsite) and about 50 meters off the main paved highway. I was invisible from the road. Directly across the main road was another dirt driveway, very overgrown and rarely used. I walked about one km down this road the next morning looking for signs of human use but saw only one set of very old tire tracks. Clearly no one lived nearby. About 100 meters to the south of my campsite was an intersection with a paved road leading to a hydroelectric project. The road was a T junction and traveled west away from my location. I drove for a mile the next morning on this road and saw no one or any sign of human habitation. The weather was cold with a hard frost occurring on the morning of the 15th. There was not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind. There was complete silence without even the rustle of leaves. After setting up my tent around 20:00, I sat in my car reading under the dome light until right around 22:00 hours. I looked at my watch and decided it was time to turn in. I often admire the skies at night and stood outside doing just that for a few minutes before retiring. A brighter than average yellow &quot;star&quot; just above the horizon (there was a low ridge to the east of me)caught my eye but my first thought was that it was probably Venus. As I watched it, I thought I could see the vague shimmer of green and red lights, obviously a plane in the distance or so I thought. That didn&apos;t explain the yellow light but I didn! &apos;t think of that until later. The odd thing about it was that it wasn&apos;t moving. Planes always move somewhere. This really aroused my curiousity and I grabbed my Minolta 7 x 50 binoculars to get a better look. The object was bright yellow with a pulsating green light on one side and red on the other but completely stationary. As reference points were three pine trees which I thought were near the top of the ridge to the west; since these were in my field of vision with the object I could gauge any movement. The next day I discovered that one of the trees was actually on the roadside about 75 meters from me; the other two were near the top of the ridge. As I studied this thing it began to move very slowly and I then observed a white beam of light (it had almost a bluish tint to it) aimed toward the ground appearing much like a searchlight from a helicopter. I could not see any evidence that it reached the ground. As it moved it moved behind the nearest tree and I expected it to disappear but then it passed in front of this tree which I&apos;d estimated to be about 300 meters away, much closer than I&apos;d imagined. The next morning I discovered that this tree was only about 75 meters from me. I continued to watch it through my binoculars and observed a pair of beams of light shine out from the main orb. Again, they did not appear to reach the ground that I could see and emanated about one diameter from the object before dispersing. The object itself appeared to be between 30 and 45cm (12 to 18 inches) in diameter. When the beams disappeared, a blue light remained in the center of the red and green lights with about an equal intensity. Next the lights quickly faded to a red point of light not more than a couple of inches (5cm) in diameter much like the light of a laser pointer and it began to move like in a laser light show in an erratic fashion like an insect around a night light. The odd thing was that it never moved outside of the silhoette of the tall and narrow pine. After one or two minutes of this unusual behavior, the red l ight changed back to the larger yellow (no other colors reappeared) which slowly moved down and to the north. It slowly disappeared, obscured by the undergrowth, to the roadbed. I only realized the next morning that it was on the road although even when I thought it was 300 meters away, the hair on the back of my neck was standing and I thought of abandoning my tent and coming back in the morning. I doubt if I&apos;d have had the courage to get a closer look. The next morning I thoroughly checked out the entire area looking for any evidence of anything unusual. If one were to do this for Hollywood, how would it be done? The hovering lights could be done by a remote controlled device, possibly an electric motor, but not a sound was heard all night. Nothing and it was dead calm. As for the laser light, there was only one point because of the undergrowth and the height of the sighting where it would have been possible (it was not possible from the road) and that was about 10 meters from my tent surrounded by undergrowth making it impossible to move in complete silence. Also there was no signs of disturbed ground debris or soil, no footprints, no evidence whatsoever. No vehicles passed until early the next morning and I heard no sounds whatsoever so I have to conclude that due to the remoteness of the site and the results of my investigation that the chance of this being an elaborate prank is extremely slim although not impossible. Why would someone go through the trouble? I really don&apos;t think so but if it wasn&apos;t a prank, what the hell was this thing that I studied for 20 minutes with binoculars? I know of nothing in the natural world that would fit the discription of this thing and have no answers.", "the orange light passed directly over the house,humming and vibrating the window frame.it travelled north slowlyI was unable to get out of bed.An orange light moved over my house from south to north,there was a low humming sound,the object moved quite slowly...perhaps 20mph.The memory of this only surfaced recently,after I heard a conversation between two other witnesses.I have since heard a story about a ufo that apparently traveled through Wales,across the Bristol channel to Cornwall,turned around and retraced it`s path back north.I have been searching for collaboration for months,this feels like a memory that is somehow partly erased,this I don`t understand as I`m a very observant person.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

We lived a primitave life style growing our own food, a hand pump outside and an outhouse.One evening when the family had gone to bed, I stepped outdoors to releive myself. I was facing north looking for the northern lights when I sensed movement behind me. There was a cigar shaped object traveling west to east and slightly downward. It dissapeared behind the treeline. I thought it was a falling star at first but then I realized it was moving much too slow and was not brightly lit.The more I thought about it the more I thought it must have been an UFO.

The event was recorded in the Pine City Press.I have never reported this to anyone except my family and some freinds. I don&apos;t remember the date but I am sure it will be found in the Pine City Press.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

I was dusting off the floormats when I caught a flash in the corner of my right eye really bright and brief when I turned in the direction it came from I saw what I believed at first to be an airplane heading towards me. After a few minutes the lights began to flash red and blue and back to white. I wanted to get a better look so I walked to the back of the property and watched it dance for a solid twenty minutes. I had my phone in my pocket and called my friend who left his camera in my truck from the previous weekend I told him what I saw and he asked me to tape it for him to check out later. His camera was a high eight with a ffity power zoom and when I started taping I had to ask him how to turn it on and how to focus. As i was taping he was coaching I found a perch on a fence rail and sat motionless taping for fifteen minutes I suppose and decided to call my neighbors to get another opinion. They saw it too. I asked my neighbor if they would watch through the little three inch viewer to see if what I was seeing was real it was a glowing and pulsating orb of indistinguishable size was hovering in the atomsphere right on the horizen it was covered or enclosed partially in some type of banded material which fit around it similar to that of a globe it had a cylindrical snout that seemed axised to some point in the center of the sphere and the whole sphere seemed to rotate around it. Also I was sedintery with a stable position and the thing appeared to jump in and out of focus repeatedly with no notice of sound at times it would flutter back and forth and others would seem to flash away in a millisecond. I live in a small town where the night sky is highly recocnizable and anything differant is noticable, both the Leonid and Gemini showers were visible here in September, November and December.

As I approached Reagan, TX on State Highway 6, headed in a south easterly direction, I saw a light that seemed bluish in color traveling in a path perpendicular to mine. At first, I thought it was a lower flying plane. But upon further inspection, it was clearly not a plane due to shape, speed, altitude, and lack of any further lighting. The strange thing to me was that I&apos;ve witnessed meteor showers and they have always seemed to be coming straight down, are very fast, and are very short lived. The object I saw was traveling in a very horizontal direction angling slightly downward. As I was driving, I noticed it in about the 11 o&apos;clock position from the direction I was driving and proceded to follow it visually for 3-8 seconds as it continued to head perpendicular to my SE traveling direction. It seems the light strength faded somewhat as it continued until I lost visual sight of it at about the 3 o&apos;clock position to the direction I was traveling. I didnt have time enough to slow down and stop and track the thing. My initial thoughts after I knew it was not a plane, was that it was that fallen satellite I had vaguely heard about. But then, I recalled that it had supposedly landed much earlier in the day in the Egypt area. While I am a young college graduate with an engineering degree, I can not say what it is I saw. From my experiences, it was no type of meteor due to it&apos;s relatively slower speed than all the meteors I&apos;ve seen and it&apos;s brightness and direction of travel. It could have been a plane in the process of crash landing, but I have heard nothing of that in the news today. Also, an argument to it being a plane is that it was just a brighter bluish light. It appeared round and not very distant from my location. As I have grown up close to the DFW airport. I have seen thousands of planes come and go, and for the object to have been the same size I saw without seeing wings or the rest of a plane, it would have ! had to b e at extremely high elevation which it was not and was traveling much too fast for a planes at most heights. I hope this was witnessed by someone else...", "Black shape floated slowly across the sky late one clear august nighti am writting this for my girlfriend. She was the witness of the event.At approx 1 am in the morning. I&apos;m not sure of the exact date, I was sleeping over at my girlfriends house. We had been watching some boxing matches that night and after they had finished we started getting ready for bed. I went on the computer to do some stuff and my girlfriend went outside for a cigarette. We are on the second story of a 4 unit apartment and she went outside on the balcony. The balcony faces in a north-west direction. Her apartment is within one block of the detroit river that seperates windsor and detroit. Let me just say that I have been studying UFO&apos;s for a very long time and in the back of my mind I feel I may have been abducted at about 7 or 8 years  old. But everytime I talk aout UFO&apos;s or the X-files or anyother conspiracy theories she gets upset and tells me to keep it to myself because she didn&apos;t believe any of it and nothing I said could change her mind. Well we&apos;ve been together for 3 years now and I havn&apos;t convinced her of my views one bit and up until the moment she saw the ufo she was in total disbelief.Well my girlfriend was sitting out on the balcony for about 2 minutes when I heard her call my name. I didn&apos;t think anything of it and brushed it off. She than called my name again and I thought maybe it would be something going on so just as I was getting up my girlfriend came in the door and told me to come outside. She seemed pretty excited to I rushed right out. When I got out, she was looking up at the sky. As I walked up to her and started looking up she told me that she had seen a black object moving in the sky. Like I said I have followed ufo&apos;s for a long time now so I believed her and started looking for the object. I didnt&apos; see anything in the sky so I went around back and looked around but still didn&apos;t see anything. I looked in every direction but it was gone. When we got back in the apartment she told me that what she saw was a totally black object with no lights at all. She could not describe the shape of it but because of the shape of it she could tell that it was not a plane. It was a very clear night and she said the object wasn&apos;t very high off the ground. So it would easily be below 10,000 ft.When we settled down a bit and got back into the house I called the local pigs, whoops, I mean Police. and tried to make a report. I had no Idea who else to call. When I told her that I wanted to report a ufo she started laughing and ridiculing me asking me if I had seen anyone aboard it or anything. I got very offended  and told her that it was a brainwashed responce to ridicule people that witness ufos and laughter and ridicule are the reasons people do not come out with their encounters to the public and than I hung up.I dont&apos; know what else to tell you. From the time my girlfriend called my name to the time I got outside was only about 30 seconds to a minute so this wasn&apos;t much of an encounter, but my girlfriend said the object wasn&apos;t moving very fast.Thank you for your time and if you have any questions please feel free to email me or even call me at 519-((number deleted)). I will get my girlfriend and myself to answer any questions you may have.P.S. In writing this report I hope that you are not connected to the governement in anyway and will just use my stroy in helping with the cover up.((NUFORC Note:  We are not connected with any government.

It looked really bright. at first we thought it was green when we were sitting in our car and seen that it was moving in kind of a triangle shape then it would dissapear and then a few seconds like mybe 30 seconds would go by and it would come back. we got our telescope out and was looking at it and it was like a rectangle with a clear but shadow lin very thin running in the middle of it. on the right side it was like dots connected together with a bright electrical blue color. and on the left side it was like three thick shadow like lines connected together. it would sit there like that for a bit then all of a sudden the right side the electrical lines would fade and the shadow like lines on the left ould start movingg in different directions kinda slowly all over the figure with a strange pace to it. and then it would dissapear and come back.and the thing would do the same thing over again.but as we were watching this there was another craft that came along on the right side of us and it looked like a plane at first but it was really low to the ground and did not make as much noise as a plane and there were no blinking lights on it and the lights looked real bright like it was nothing but one big light that never blinked or flickered.((NUFORC Note:  The first possible explanation of the sighting to be ruled out, we believe, would be some kind of celestial body.

I saw an airplane flying with the ufo behind it. I couldnt describe the movement of the ufo because the physics of it is speechless. This all happened in some time between 1 and 3 seconds. I was going  to get up and see it but something &quot;forced&quot; me back to sleep. It was like a ringing sound. I woke up again still thinking about what I saw then the ringing sound occurred again and forced me back to sleep. But I woke up the next morning still remembering the physics of this object.

It moved from up and down and side to side quickly.I just got off work Saturday and happened to be looking at Orion&apos;s Belt. I didn&apos;t really think of it as being anything special at the time. Just another group of stars in the sky. I started to try to put together other constelations when I noticed a light in the sky. At first I thought it was just another star though I&apos;d never noticed it before. I started to ignor it when I saw it was moving, thinking it was a plane, but realized it couldn&apos;t be.It moved oddly, to fast to be a plane and it was too bright, small, and it wasn&apos;t actually going anywhere. It continued to pretty well hover just below and to the left of Orion&apos;s Belt. I noticed it was making small swirling movements only to stop, not moving at all, then doing it again. I ran to my friend&apos;s house and dragged him outside. He noticed it was moving as well and ran back in to get another of our friends.We continued to watch it for another few minutes as it moved slightly, maybe an inch in the sky, though it covered that inch quickly. I&apos;m not good at math but given the distance...I don&apos;t know. Planes just don&apos;t move like that, not in so many directions so quickly.We debated whether it really was moving or if we were all just seeing what we wanted to see. We decided to sit for a moment and watch. It did indeed move though only two of us could see it clearly. My other friend had just taken out his contacts so he couldn&apos;t say if it was moving or not. We did take a picture though we haven&apos;t yet decided if we are going to send it anywhere yet.I ran home to get a pair of binoculars but couldn&apos;t find any that allowed us to see it any better. After a while we gave up trying to see what it was and went back inside. When I left the house most of the stars were gone because it looks like a storm is rolling in. That was around 1 Am.I can&apos;t say anymore because my friends and I wish to remain anonomous. The only reason I&apos;m sending this is because I have never seen anything like that in 12 years of traveling the United States, on vaction, or anywhere else. Nothing can cover such a distance in the sky like that and not be some kind of air ship or spacecraft. Whatever it was it seemed small, and fast.((NUFORC Note:  Witness chooses to remain anonymous.

The night sky was bright (good moon out). The craft was triangular. the two sids came to a point in front. There appeared to be two rows of either lights or windows on each side, about ten in all on each side. The back had a series of lights which moved from the outer edge to the center.If I recall correctly, there were some kind of lighting systems on the under side as well. I don&apos;t recall any sound that the craft made, I believe it was silent. It flew in a N/NW direction. There is no way to determine its speed or altitude given there was nothing to match it against. Once it was close to overhead, it changed direction and moved West. We lost sight of it when it passed the back side of Mt. Monadnock.I hope that this is of interest. Currently, I work for a bioteck company in Greenwich CT. I have a MA from Boston University. My classmates who were with me are all professionals (two other boys and three girls, yes, you can guess why we were on the Upper Field). Even with the opposite sex distractions, we all became immensly intreagued with the craft. We thought it was some sort of experimental aircraft; however, Pease Air Force Base was quite a distance away, and our aircraft in the late 70&apos;s didn&apos;t look much like this. The new B2 Bomber, though somewhat triangular is also a different shape that this craft.

I always look at the sky when I drive just to see if I can see anything out of the ordinary. Well this night I did. What I witnessed were three lights. They were larger than any star, and had a yellowish orange glow to them. They were in a triangular patern like an isoceles triangle, almost perfect. They seemed to bee about a kilometer up maybe less. They just sat there for about five minutes and then two of them on the northern most sides of the triangle took off so fast they seemed to be at a constant velocity, not acceleration, but velocity and were gone in a matter of seconds. The last one stayed and hovered for at least another ten minutes, but I wanted to go home and show my girlfriend so that I didn&apos;t think I was crazy. I was talking to her the whole time on the phone explaining what was happening. When I arrived at my house the last object was no longer visible. I know none of our aircraft with the ability to hover could have accelerated at the velocity that those two objects left at, it was just to fast.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

THE LIGHT WAS STATIONARY &amp; I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRCRAFT LANDING LIGHT, A SEARCH LIGHT OR POSSIBLY A TOWER LIGHT BUT REALIZED THAT IT WAS TOO HIGH ON THE HORIZON TO BE A TOWER LIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS STATIONARY. AT THIS TIME AND FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MILES, THE LIGHTS DID NOT CHANGE IN SIZE OR INTENSITY. THERE WERE BLINKING RED &amp; GREEN LIGHTS DIRECTLY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BRIGHT CENTER LIGHT FLASHING IN A REGULAR PATTERN AND APPEARED TO BE DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE CENTER LIGHT RATHER THAN OFFSET FROM IT.WHEN I EXITED I95 AT EXIT #25 SOUTH, I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BEHIND TWO OR THREE OTHER CARS &amp; TRUCKS THAT HAD ALSO STOPPED TO LOOK AT THIS OBJECT, I WATCHED AS IT BEGAN TO MOVE DIAGONALLY FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST VERY SLOWLY IN THE DISTANCE.  AT THIS POINT I EXTED MY TRUCK AND OBSERVED IT FROM THE ROADSIDE ON FOOT WHILE SPEAKING TO YOUR OFFICE VIA CELLPHONE. IT THEN CHANGED DIRECTION AND FLEW ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.AT THIS POINT I COULD SEE THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT FROM BELOW AND IT APPEARED TO LOOK LIKE A WEDGE OR CHEVRON WHEREIN I COULD MAKE OUT WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PAIR OF SWEPT WINGS ATTACHED TO A CENTER FUSILAGE WITH SOLID WEBBING BETWEEN THE WINGS AND THE FUSILAGE.  THE LENGTH OF THE APPENDAGES OF THE VISIBLE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE EQUALATERAL WITH A SLIGHT CURVITURE OF THE WEBBING AT THE TRAILING EDGE.

THE CLEAREST DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT I CAN RENDER AS IT FLEW OVERHEAD IS AS THOUGH SOMEONE SHINED A SPOTLIGHT DIRECTLY UPWARD AT THE UNDERBODY OF A SWEPTWING AIRPLANE AND ONLY ILLUMINATED THE CENTER PORTION OF THE PLANE.THE OBJECT FLEW VERY SLOWLY OVERHEAD AND APPEARED TO PROCEED IN AN ELLIPTICAL PATH FROM SOUTH TO NORTH THEN SOUTH AGAIN RATHER THAN CIRCULAR SINCE THE VISIBLE CHANGE IN DIRECTION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATE AND DIDN&apos;T APPEAR TO ALLOW TIME FOR A WEST TO EAST ARC. THE PATH OF TRAVEL BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF FOUR BASKETBALLS (WHEN HELD AT ARMS LENGTH).  THE MOON WAS NOT VISIBLE (AS A REFERENCE OBJECT) FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT AND THERE WAS AT LEAST ON STREET LIGHT NEARBY AT THE COMMUTER PARKING AREA.THERE WAS NO DICERNABLE SOUND FROM THE OBJECT AS IT FLEW OVERHEAD.  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JUDGE THE ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT OR ITS RELATIVE SPEED. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING VERY SLOWLY WHEN CONSIDERING THE RELATIVE CLARITY AND SIZE OF THE VISIBLE UNDERBODY AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD. THE RELATIVE SIZE FROM MY VANTAGE POINT WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE SIZE OF A QUARTER WHEN HELD AT ARM&apos;S LENGTH. THE SKY WAS EXTREMELY CLEAR WITH SEVERAL CONSTELLATIONS CLEARLY VISIBLE.UNTIL I SAW THE UNDERBODY, I THOUGHT THAT POSSIBLY THE OBJECT WAS A POLICE OR SEARCH HELICOPTER WITH A SEARCH LIGHT GIVEN THE SLOW RATE OF SPEED, THEN WHEN IT FLEW OVERHEAD I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS POSSIBLY A SEARCH OR TRAINING FLIGHT FROM THE BRUNSWICK NAVAL AIR STATION.

However, we do not know whether it was the cause of this sighting.  Date of sighting may be approximate.  PD))", "The object was the size of a basket ball. Cotten white in color. Came very very close.I believe I might be able to account for this story, but feel I should tell it so that others might have a comparison if they encounter the same event and yes it is very odd to witness this phenomena. This event took place on Rampart lake located just outside of Divide Colorado. I was accompanied by my brother and a cousin .  The event took place as the sun was setting but being down between two mountains you can&rsquo;t see the sunset but you can notice the light of day fading.As, it grew darker and cooler the lake was cooling fast and thus causing a very thick layer of  fog to form  across the full breast of the lake. We all were standing at the lake edge chatting and waiting for our wives to arrive and pick us up after a day of fishing. I noticed a subtle white ball of light over the water and out in front of us. It appeared to be about 60 yards or so away from us. The funny thing was that the fog was really getting thick and visibility over the lake was only about 4 feet or so. But yet this light could be seen moving in an arc. The ball of light would move about in a 90 degree arc or so. At first we thought it was a light from a boat however, this was not the case. The object then moved directly at us doing about 5 miles an hour or so. It got so close at this point,I would say no more then 12 feet or so. The light was about the size of a basketball. At this point we all was getting a little concerned about our visitor. Now, this event so far has been going on for about 15 minutes or so and we have been discussing and detailing the event the whole time. As we all was very curious but trying to remain calm and for me this was a chance to really take in and understand the event.  Now, this object was about 7 or so feet away at this time and hovering above the water at about 12 feet up and 7 feet or so out. Now at 7 feet, this was a little to close. So with this being the case, I could clearly sum up that the object was indeed no boat. So I picked up a rock through it right at the object.I did this several t! imes and came very close if not hitting the light. This action had no effect on the ball of light.But not long after throwing the rocks at it and by the way keeping my cousin from shooting it with his pistol. I knew he had it the whole time. I was sure it was not man made but I didn&rsquo;t want to make a bad mistake.The ball light object next slowly withdrew in the same arc as it arrived and that was that.What do I now believe it was?  Not ball lighting that I am sure of.  We came back to the lake the next day And I took a stock of the lake and noticed an aspect of the layout of the lake and roads coming into the lake. I noticed that there was a road on the other side of the lake. It was about a half mile or so directly in front of the lake and had about 45 degree turn and was about 30 yards from the lakes edge. Now, grant it that is really some distance away from where we had been standing. But I now believe that even though the fog was thick and we could not see far at all, a car turning that corner with the brights on could shine into the dense fog, it&rsquo;s at this point that the phenomena occurs. The fog was able to condense the light beams and merge them together at just about right in front of us and above the lake at about the same height as the road is above the lake some half mile or so in front us.  Now, I know this does not account for the period of time in which we saw this event about, 20 minutes in all. I can say that maybe the car parked on that corner and then backed away accounting for the arc exit of the light. Or, the car had passed but the condensed fog was able to absorb the light. Which, then continued to break the light apart over and over. Next,it was then picked back up and then amplified just like the intensifier tube would do for a night vision scope.", "Another sighting in the SAME field that we saw &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot;, on 09/02/01We were just shooting off model rockets again the same as on 09/02/01!  There was a pretty clear sky with a few clouds.  We shot off about 7 model rockets, C-class engines.  My little sister (11) then said she saw something.  When I looked I saw 3 white dots very far away in the sky.  We had seen planes flying over head before this.  The white dots seemed to go closer and further apart to each other the same way they did on 09/02/01.  Then they disapeared and we saw a red dot in the sky with our naked eyes.  Looking through the binoculers we saw that it was an oval, silverish, craft with a red center.  All together we saw 4 &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot;.

When you are just looking at the four in a row, they seem to stay in the same place, but looking through the camcorder, the four lights come together. The other time we saw two, and they also came together through the camcorder but not just looking at them.  These are very strange lights. They stay lit up for different amounts of time. They seem to disappear when there is a plane coming. Would like to have a explaination for what we have seen.", "It was the day airplanes resumed flight after the sept.11 attacks.

I know this because the plane flew behind the object. As the plane was moving the object was not. MY first reaction was disbelief. I did not take my eyes off the object. It was cigar shaped, silver.It engulfed the airplane as the airplane flew behind the object. It did not move. It seemed the sun was shinning on it but the shape was very defined. The plane kept moving and the object was still.I counted 11 as I was thinking this has to be real because the airport has just opened, no blimps, no small aircraft, no helicopters were allowed.Then as I blinked it was gone.

S.-Mexico border the California desert, approximately 70 miles east of San Diego. At approximately 0530 hrs. (Pacific Standard Time), on Thursday morning, 31JA02, the officer was seated in his patrol vehicle, facing south toward the Mexican border.  His dog became visibly agitated, at which time the officer began to discern a warbling sound, which fluctuated in pitch.  For a moment or two, the officer thought that the sound was being generated by his vehicle.  The officer reports that he was quite surprised to see a disc shaped object, with a noticable bulge on its top, and fluctuating illumination around its flange, fly from west to east, directly above his vehicle.  A moment later, the officer looked back to the area of the sky from which this first object had just flown, and was equally surprised to see a cluster of discs, similar in appearance to the first disc, fly across the sky in the same direction in which the first object had flown.  In the center of the cluster of objects, the officer witnessed a &quot;boomerang-shaped&quot; object, which he at first took to be a &quot;military bomber.&quot;   ((NUFORC Note:  Presumably a B-2 bomber, which looks like a flying wing.  PD))The officer quickly jumped out of his vehicle to get a better look at the objects as they moved fairly rapidly to the east.  At approximately that moment, the boomerang-shaped object, the officer reports, suddenly accelerated in velocity, began to rise at a sharp angle into the cloudless, dark morning sky, and disappeared from sight.  A short time later, the discs also accelerated, and flew off in the same direction that the boomerang-shaped object had flown. NUFORC hopes to be able to obtain more information about this incident.

I then noticed how fast it was moving and yelled at my co-worker to look but it passed very quickly horizontally from west to east at what appeared to be exactly the same altitude.Didn&apos;t look like a shooting star-too low , no tail, and the light was a steady rate of speed and much too fast &amp; silent for an aircraft. Wondered if anyone else saw it.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from the east coast for this date.  PD))", "Unidentified string of ball lights seen in valley of Shaftsbury, near Rte 7A..heading South to Bennington spotted off Old Depot rd.While walking my dog at night, I saw what appeared to be lights in a string across the sky. I thought a plane was low-flying and perhaps ready to crash..I thought the lights I saw were strung across the front of the plane and wings. However, there was absolutely no sound to be heard from the object. I then supposed I maybe saw a searchlight going across the mountains but it did not really make sense since I heard no sound of either a helicopter or plane. It appeared to be a string of beaded lights in a horizontal pattern. I ran inside and got my daughter and son to come out and look at the strange object, since I had no clue what it might be.My mom brought my brother and I outside to see some sort of object...I asked her what it was that she was taking us to look at but she didn&apos;t know. At the time I thought she had seen a wild animal in the woods and wasn&apos;t sure of it. When we were outside we went to the top of the driveway and looked out over the mountains. We then saw about 50 lights-ones you might see on a passing airplane, none flashing- about halfway down the mountain. It moved slowly across the mountain in a horizontal fashion, with a few lights disappearing from the left, and then reappearing on the right. It gave a creepy sound, one that you might hear if a person was trying to sound like a ghost...one you might hear one an episode of the Twilight Zone. The sighting of this object frightened me and I wanted to go back inside, which we did. When we got inside, the object was gone with the sound from our view, down south towards Bennington. My mom and I were baffled of what it might be, thinking of all we could, we only came up with ideas like &quot;A stealth plane&quot; or &quot;A helicopter sending out a search light across the mountain&quot;, none made any sense...except a UFO.", "large round bright object fast moving on cameraI woke up the night before and saw a larg round illuminated object that hovered for about 20 seconds and i thougth i was dreaming so i went back to sleep. the next morning my friend came over and told me the night before he was awoken by a strange noise and saw a large object the next night i was awoken at the same time this time i9 had a camera and got it on film and now im reporting it to you", "Bright flying light in sky at night, Northampton Massachussetts - Jan 27th 2002next to quad dormatories, a bright white ball going through the air at a gently downward angle.  it was nighttime, only one - but it was brighter and larger than venus in the night sky.  there was no streak or trail left behind.  i tried to run forward to see where it went before the trees got in the way, but i could not run fast enough and it disappeared.", "Bright light hovering over Williamston MichiganAt approx 23:00 I witnessed an extremely bright yellow/white light hovering above the ground, it appeared to be above the Williamston, MI about 4-5 miles west of me, and 1 mile above the ground.

No other colored like red or green that you would usually see. It got bigger and bigger, and we realized it was not an airplane at all. What the heck is that? All of a sudden, it appeared to get smaller and smaller until it finally disappeared. Where the heck did that thing go. It moved forward and then backward and finally, completely disappeared from view.As we watched the skies, suddenly from the left and below the point where we observed the light, a big fireball with a long streak of orange appeared out of the sky and headed for earth. We actually stood and waited to hear the explosion when it fell, it seemed so close, but we heard nothing. Have checked the local news and have heard nothing about it.

Suddenly, my son came running into my bedroom and shook me awake, yelling &quot;Mom, come look, there&apos;s something funny outside&quot;.  I got out of bed and went to the porch and looked outside above the house.  Above us I saw, about 50 to 80ft above us three rows of lights that seemed to outline a large craft.  As I watched for about 2 minutes, the lights slowly faded out. It was so weird, not even the crickets were chirping.  It was dead silent.  I never said much to anyone, but it seems that no-one but us saw it...at least I never heard anyone talk about it.  It wasn&apos;t until much later, when I read in a book (unfortunately I can&apos;t remember the name of it,) that a woman who chased these sightings down, mentioned that they could just fade away, but that it didn&apos;t mean they were gone.  When I read that, I felt more secure in my sighting.  I was afraid to say anything about it because people tend not to believe.  To this day, my son won&apos;t talk about it because when he woke up at 3:00am, he said he was standing up, and didn&apos;t remember getting to his feet.  It scared him to talk about it because he heard that these &quot;people&quot; kidnapp people.  His friend claims not to remember, but I know he does.  I have always wondered why they are so reluctant to talk about the incident. By the way they also told me that it was very bright until I got there, that&apos;s when it became dimmer.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

My mother and I saw what at first appeared to be a plane crashing. We did not have a camera or a telescope. The oject was red with a long tail coming from it. My mom and I decided that it must be a meteor, however in a few minutes, the tail disappeared and the object began climbing up towards another object in the sky that we had not at first noticed. The two objects were beside one another for a few seconds, then one went straight up into the sky, and the second one began to descend. The one that was climbing up looked kind of like a squid because of the twin trails of smoke coming from behind it. We lost the descending one behind trees in the distance, and the ascending one became blocked from our view by the sun. There were a lot of other cars on the interstate during this event, but I do not honestly know if anyone else witnessed it.

I was walking south. Looking up at about a 60 degree angle...I saw a blue circular light swoop in towards the north and it seemed to be descending then it suddenly vanished. No sound. The color of the blue was almost a turqoise blue. Ever see those circular fluroscent kitchen lights for the ceiling light? thats what it looked like, a blue ring with darkness in the middle.

I started to reach for my binoculars (which were six feet away) but then I realized it object to be out of sight before I could zero in on it. Four mornings later, at about the same time, I saw the same or an identical object moving in precisely the same way over the same stretch of ocean. We live in a studio apartment directly on the ocean and had a clear view of the object. I am a retired attorney and marine naturalist and we are both good observers who have never before seen a UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar sighting from same witnesses for January 26, 2002.  PD))", "I observed an object with a peculiar flight path and unusual lighting characteristics.I went outside to investigate whether some rumblings I was hearing was a storm approaching or just a military exercise off in the distance. It was just a military exercise as the sky was quite clear. As I was looking around in the sky for signs of any approaching storm I noticed a bright light that moved at a fairly quick pace (I would estimate the speed of the object to be a little faster than a fighter jet). At first I thought that this was an airplane approaching me directly as the intensity of the light would have been about right. But I quickly ruled this out as the object moved along a perfectly vertical path. I would estimate the object to have been somewhere in the range (+/- a couple miles) of 5 miles from my position. The object rose rapidly in altitude and then came to an abrupt stop. The distance it traversed was about just over a foot (estimating 15 inches) in about 1 second. The light then disappeared for about 1/2 second. When the light came back on the object was about 4 inches above where I last spotted it. The object then remained stationary for 1 to 2 seconds. At this point the intensity of the light was about the same as when I first noticed it. The light then began to change. It started dimming until it again disappeared. As the light dimmed it seemed that the object became smaller but this could have been due to the reduction in the intensity of the light. The light then reappeared (the object still had not moved) with the same intensity as it had at the begining and the dimming sequence was repeated except at a much quicker pace. I called my wife outside and continued to look for the object to reappear. After observing for about 5 minutes and seeing nothing unusual we went back inside.", "dim light mocing oddlyI dont remember the exact date. I was working outdoors at the Disneyland Hotel, it was a slow night and i was just staring out over the sky line when a dim starlike objet in the distance (south/west). I first thought it was just an aircraft (since there are quite afew that fly in that area). What caught my attention tho was that it wasnt moving, then shot up and stoped, stayed motionless for a few seconds and then moved slowly up out of veiw into the clouds.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It made no noise whatsoever and turned abruptly and quickly accererated into the midday blue.  What was most amazing was the lack of sound, the incredible speed and the brilliant silver tone of the object.", "Observed bright light traveling rapidly northwest to northeast.Time of sighting is approximate; we went outside at 18:45 and had been out for several minutes at the time of the sighting.  Observed bright light traveling roughly northwest to northeast from our location (approximately 36.317N, 119.204W).  Light was about 30 degrees above the horizon.  The light was traveling very fast.  The light faded in and out similar to an Iridium satellite, but much faster and not as high in elevation.  Also, we have never seen an Iridium traveling in this direction.  When the light faded, there were no marker lights visible.  It was very dim when it faded, but still barely visible.  Before we went out to stargaze, I printed out a list of satellites from the Heavens Above website.  Using the flashlight, I looked on the list for something of a similar brightness, time and direction.  The brightness was matched for ISS, but it was in the south.  The next would have been the Shenzhou III, but we saw it several minutes later; the altitude was much higher (59 degrees) compared to the earlier light.  The light appeared to be at an elevation similar to a jet, but did not make any sound.  We are close to several flight paths, primarily Fresno (FAT) and Lemoore Naval Air Station.  After the light disappeared, I looked around for any planes; saw what appeared to be a jet to the northwest that was at a much higher elevation and farther away and I could hear jet noise.  We are familiar with the local air traffic, satellites and meteors; this did not appear to be any of those.  Weather was clear, temperature probably close to 70 degrees or a little above.

I didn&apos;t think anything of it at that moment. As I was driving down our road home, going around curves, up and down some small hills, I still noticed this bright light. It was in the northeast sky.As I neared our home, going down this one particular straight stretch of the one lane road, I noticed this same light, brighter than ever before, right above the hill line, right above our property.  It was 10 times larger and brighter than when I had first seen it, turning off the main highway, 3 miles away.As I pulled down our driveway, our pet dogs ran in front of my van, barking, yelping and acting scared to death.  I could not see this light from the bottom of the driveway because we live down in a narrow holler, but I did see it still hovering over the trees BEFORE pulling down the long steep driveway.  When I got out of the van, I noticed no sound whatsoever. I thought maybe the light was a helicopter hovering. But, I heard no sound. It was deathly silent all around, except for our dogs.I told the kids to quickly get out of the car and run to the house. When we all hopped out, the dogs started running around and around our home, barking, looking up at the sky. When I mean running around our home, that is exactly what they were doing. They were running at breakneck speed, in circles around the home. They may have circled around our home 3 or 4 times, all the while barking and yelping. After making sure my kids were safe inside, I opened the door to look out to see if I could see anything.  The dogs were there, right against the door, and when I opened it, they ran inside. Now, my 2 dogs are outside dogs and NEVER come inside.  This was very unusual behavior for them.  I couldn&apos;t get them back out the door.

After he got outside again the lights weren&apos;t showing theirselves that much anymore so he wasn&apos;t even sure if he would capture them, but tried anyway.He saw something bright while taping and tried to zoom in to check it out, the image seemed too distant to view on tape nontheless he had to try.

Cloud cover was at 3-4000 feet and no blue sky (it&apos;s Scotland in March???).   It was dark grey with blue and red colours (not lights) on either side and had something trailing underneath it like a re-fuelling rod (DC-10 with 4 F-18&apos;s and a RAF Tornado flew low over the city the day before with DC-10 trailing fuel rod and planes lined up behind it - last time this happened about 8 years ago there was complaint made as to how low aircraft were over city).  Since I have always been a plane spotter since childhood and local airport is about 8 miles and RAF base is 30 miles away she knows what a plane looks like, commercial or Forces, and still thought this was a balloon, however strange it looked, with it&apos;s curvy hourglass look and trailing rod.  She went to get the telescope to have a closer look and ran to the bedroom on the other side of the house as she knew with it&apos;s speed it would be over the house before she got to the telescope even though telescope is in her room next to cupboard by the window.  When she got there she was surprised to see two of the same description flying in the same direction as the other one and about 3 times as high as the one that caught her eye.  She focussed the scope on the lowest one before it disappeared behind the rooftops of the neighbouring houses and still it looked as she described earlier.  She focussed on the other 2 objects and they were going as fast as the other one was which she described as your typical RAF jet speed for the area, about 300 mph with no noise at all.  Our location has a good horizon to horizon view from east to west (about 3 miles west and 1.5 east and RAF fly it every ! day) and we get very strong winds here but rarely exceeding 70-80 mph and that day was only a 15mph breeze.  The more she thought about it the more it seemed strange but if she had to define her sighting she would say it was a weather balloon, the fastest weather balloon she has seen.  NEVER, never have we or I in all my time looking up at planes (even when there are none there) ever seen a weather balloon in our area and if they did fly over this way??? why so low and more importantly, how so fast?  I have to stress that at first sighting she jokingly thought we were being invaded she told me(seeing as object was unknown to her) but as she watched approach a bit more it became clear this was not a normal sight you would see flying in the skies over our city.", "My friend and I were on our way to my summer place in Canada and had pulled off I-81 for a rest stop.

It almost appeared to be a craft silently cruising without it&apos;s lights on. It was a black shaped that moved across the horizon. It lasted approx. 30-45 seconds, then it was out of view in the dark.I estimate by it&apos;s proximety to the ground, and to us, as well as it&apos;s scale against the various buildings around that it was aprrox. 300-400 feet long and approx three times the &quot;height&quot; of a large airliner.We looked at each other and my friend, whos dad was a pilot and who was very familiar with aircraft said...&quot; I have  never  ever   seen anything like that have you?&quot;........I replied &quot;No____,...I have not&quot;.

The light were white with some blue and pink in them.  I considered I was possible seeing a plane at some strange angle, but there were several aircraft in the sky over Denver and this was very different.  The lights seemed to be larger and brighter than other aircraft lights.  The object was silent and started to move 1 direction only and that was straight down.

There was also a large blinking light in the center that was much brighter.I have no idea what it was, and don&apos;t even know if it was a &quot;real UFO,&quot; though it is certainly unidentified to me. Doesn&apos;t make sense to me that a UFO would have blinking light in the center.

Given youracademic background, I would presume that you had ruled out all obviouspossibilities, e.g. aircraft, blimps, advertising lights, celestial bodies,aurora borrealis, etc..Did you stop your vehicle at any time to look at the object, or were youdriving during the sighting, please?  Also, were you looking through thewindshield or window, or did you roll down a window to look at it?We will post your report to our website, probably tomorrow, and perhapsothers will respond from Nashville, if they saw it, or if they know what itwas.Thank you very much for taking the time to share the information with ourCenter!Cordially,Peter Davenport((RESPONSE))i Peter,Certainly wasn&apos;t any plane, cause it wasn&apos;t moving like a plane...was hovering, then went kind of back and forth, whereas planes fly forward. At first, I thought it was a helicopter, but I that wouldn&apos;t explain the three glowing lights at the edges. And I know it was not any celestial body or aurora borealis. I did not stop the vehicle and look...I was looking through the windshield, but the windshield was not obscuring or altering my view. I was not looking through a crack or dirty area. Moreover, as I passed, I got the same view of the object through my driver&apos;s side window as through the windshield. I tried to turn around, but I was on the interstate and couldn&apos;t turn around for like five or ten miles. Feel free to post my sighting. The University of Tennesee has a Space Institute somewhere near there, so who knows, maybe it was an experimental aircraft. There were other people driving on the interstate that evening, I was hoping there had been other reports, and that someone would have more visual detail on the thing than I did.

The movement was quick and seemed to be wavering and moving in an upward/downward(occasionallateral movement) pattern--watching this movement made me feel a little dizzy.

In June, 1968, aboard the US Navy ship Hyades (AF-28), we were notified that the USS Scorpion (nuclear sub) was overdue and the last known position report was in our area (just off the Azore Islands, Atlantic Ocean, known as the Atlantic Ridge area.) We immediately commenced a search of the area, which for us lasted 3 days and nights.  We were the first ship on station and searching. The water depth averaged between 6,000-12,000 feet deep there, with undersea mountains in the 4,000-10,000 ft. range, I remember (fathometer readings). On the second night of searching, an object was reflected in the searchlight (24&quot; mercury arc light) I was on.  (I was a signalman and my duty station was on the signal bridge running the light).  As the ship turned toward the object, it went out of the &quot;beam,&quot; and was lost due to darkness (it was a cloudy night with no moon or stars, pitch black). The next day we were relieved on station by the rescue ships and continued on our way to the Sixth Fleet in the Med. A few years later, I read about the aforementioned incident and that the object (which was lost in the beam) mysteriously lifted off the water and disappeared in the sky.  Also, the sinking of the Scorpion has been attributed to the &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; curse. Does anyone have any info regarding these allegations?  I was involved in the actual incident and would like to hear any about any info suppossedly existing about this. I realize the time factor involved here, but it is something that has been of interest to me for many years and I have decided now to see if I could get any info it.Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was no ordinary contrail. First, it did not dissipate for over half an hour or longer. But most important, it was not in a straight line, but rather in extremely tight loops, zig-zags, and sharp angles. It looked like random scribbles in the sky. There&apos;s no way a conventional aircraft could produce this, and yet it was definitely artificial, and appeared to be at low altitude, I&apos;d guess less than 4000 feet.I am definitely not the only person to observe this phenomena.

Here is a complete description of the sighting.As I drove west of Denver on Hwy 6 at about 20:20 Mountain time on 4/17/02, I was looking at the western sky at dusk to see if I could observe an astronomical event of planets aligning (see astronomical bulletins).  As I looked up again I noticed two star-like lights traveling at what appeared to be a very high altitude and very high rate of speed (above 200 mph at least).  They had no blinking lights but were apparently luminescent.  They remained equidistant apart and were traveling in a southeast direction.  I happened to be on my phone with my wife, who was traveling on I-25 North (about 10 minutes from where I was)at the time of my sighting.  I told her about it and then pulled over to get gas and get out of my car to look at it.  I saw the lights continue Southeast so I yelled over to a man getting out of his truck and asked if he could see these objects.  He stated he could.  I asked him if he knew what they were and he stated that he did not know.  He appeared interested and then went into the convenience store.  I started pumping gas and called my wife again and asked if she could see the lights.  She responded that she could and she pulled off the highway to get a better look.  She stated that they continued on their way in a southeastern direction at a constant rate of speed and distance apart until out of sight.  My reaction during the sighting was one of calm surprise and excitement to confirm it&apos;s existence with my wife.  I was also excited that my wife would take notice of something like this at the end of the day going home from work.((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station, possibly still in formation with the Space Shuttle, passed over Lakewood, CO, from 20:16 to 20:23 hrs. on this date.

We we&rsquo;retravelling eastbound on the downhill portion of I-44, with Forest  on the right and Lone Elk County Park on the left, a mile or two west of Peerless Park in southwest St. Louis County, Missouri. The sky was clear blue and cloudless, with a fair wind.My wife was driving our car.  She was looking upward through the car windshield and said to me, Look out your passenger-side window and tell me what you see.  All I could see out the passenger window was the close-in trees which is what I told her.She said that she saw a large (as big as a silver dollar held at arm&rsquo;s length), round object that was dark gray with a silver reflective edge.  (The sun was slightly behind and to the right of our travel path at that point.)  She also said that she expected whatever it was to pass right over or in front of the car  from right to left and that I should watch the other side of the road (while she negotiated the interstate highway traffic) to see if I could see anything.Only a few seconds later, we were on the flat portion of I-44 with a break in the trees on the left/north side of the highway.  I immediately spotted a highly reflective, glaringly silver, object seemingly hovering in the distance.  The object was oblong about an inch long at arm&rsquo;s length  and very thick.  It was much thicker (at least two or three times) than the fuselage of an airplane.  It had no appendages, or wings, at all.Since we we&rsquo;re travelling at highway speed in the car, the object may have been moving at an equal pace in relation to the speed of the car.  However, I did not detect any movement on the object&rsquo;s part in relation to the ground.  But, the object was well above the background scenery -- between 20- to 30-degrees in elevation, with clear blue sky all around it -- so there was no easy reference point.I only caught sight of the object for 2 or 3 seconds before an additional clump of trees obscured it from view.  It was only another couple of seconds before we passed that final clump of trees and the object was suddenly no where to be seen!  It was not seen again.  (Since she was paying attention to traffic, my wife was not able to look over in time to see the object that I saw on the north side of the highway.)((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted as an e-mail message, and entered to the NUFORC database at our headquarters.

It&apos;s path appeared near horizontal with only a slight decrease in altitude.  The fireball first appeared almost white and as it streaked lower into the atmosphere, it&apos;s color quickly became more greenish in color.  It appeared to &quot;burn out&quot; over Seattle.  I noticed a very faint smoke trail behind it as it streaked across the sky.  It&apos;s altitude in appearance when it burned out was equal to that of incoming aircraft to SEATAC.  Fortunately no aircraft were in it&apos;s vicinity when it burned out.

I was sitting on my couch one day, watching TV, and happened to look out my window. From my window I can see the East side of Manhatten, I am directly across from the United Nations building. In any case I saw what appeared to me at first to be birds flying. Like seagulls, when they just kind of float in the air. Their movement was like that two objects just kind of circling each other ove and over. It occured to me after a few seconds how high they were in the air. I got up to get a closer look, and sure enough they were not birds. My second though was military planes, like an F-14. This was in and around the time they were still patrolling over the City. But because of the movement, I would have to rule that one out too. They managed to saty there for about 10 minutes appearing and disappearing, reflecting light of some type of metallic surface. They were so far up it was hard to get a good read on its surface properties.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I noticed it because it was bright - brighter than any of the stars around it and it was moving fast enough to get my attention. It took perhaps 30-45 seconds to move from just over the horizon to nearly overhead. I still thought it was just a satelite - but then it stopped. The light did not change it just stopped.

I know it was moving because I had to walk from the West to the North side of my house to keep it in view. Then it was gone. Through the binoculars, the object emitted a faint redish light. It&apos;s movement was extremely fluid. When it zig zagged, it looked like a tadpole swimming in shallow water.

It was an extremely bright light racing toward the south. It did not have a trail nor did it make any noise. I don&apos;t if you would classify it as a fireball or a light.

Another friend of ours (a little skeptical) told us about a green light she viewed during the daylight hours.

Tropicana) when I noticed a strange slightly illuminated shape in the distance. My first impression due to the object&apos;s shape and speed was that someone had let off a large cluster of helium party balloons and the wind was carrying them. I thought the hotel and street lights along The Strip were illuminating the object. A few minutes later, I looked up and noticed the object was a bit closer and I became a bit more curious as I began to see some detail. First, rather than being a cluster of objects (aka balloons), it seemed like a more continuous mass where parts of the object had a dull glow of various intensity that changed, as if there were slowly moving parts that were rotating as the object moved forward. The object was about half the size of a fist at arm&apos;s length at the closest point as it passed. The object&apos;s flight path seem to run parallel along The Strip during the first 10-15 minutes after I first spotted it. And its velocity seemed constant - it moved very slow. In fact, it was pretty breezy outside, so I would think a mass of balloons would be drifting by faster and moving erratically assuming the wind speed was constant higher up. The precise movement of this object gave me the impression as if &quot;it&quot; was spying on the activity of The Strip below. It seemed to be positioned right above The Strip but fairly high up. As the object moved further north along The Strip, passing by the building I was on, the lights remained about the same intensity. Again, it&apos;s as though certain parts of the object would move every once in a while, causing some of the lights to shift. I could see where from a distance, someone would classify the shape as a diamond at times due to the main illuminated areas being on the ends of the object. However, the shape seemed to change as the lights moved (or illuminated parts moved?). If I were to assign a color to the object, it was a dull mottled color, lighter than a gray, almost like a tan or light brown.! I point ed out the object to a few friends and joked around that it was a UFO coming to join our party. However, my friends were not very sober and lost interest quickly. I, on the hand, was completely sober. I had celebrated a friend&apos;s event the night before, so I had decided to take it easy and drink non-alcoholic beverages all night. I noticed at some point, the object made an abrupt turn and started heading westward. The lights did not change as the object moved over an area off The Strip which was not as illuminated, again suggesting the object had its own light source. As the object went further west, it became too small to see and was out of view eventually. The entire sighting was about 20 minutes. Being the rational person I am (I have a B.S. in Biology from a top university) and with all the literature I&apos;ve read on the UFO phenomenom and common explanations such as military craft, I thought this might have been one of those private, experimental craft that some hobbyists like to build (they look like hang-gliders with propellers). I&apos;ve read a couple stories where some jokers flew in unison with these craft with lights stringed across and tried to fool the public into believing they saw an extraterrestrial UFO sighting. Anyway, it was 3am, so if it was some kind of trick, someone was motivated. Alternately, it could have been a military craft, e.g. unmanned aerial vehicle, on a test run, considering LV&apos;s proximity to nearby installations.", "A light followed me home and then dissapeared!I was in the car coming home from Karate when I saw this light.

When we reached our destination a couple of hours south we checked the car and there was a residue. Being late, we decided to check the car out in the morning light.

This object flashed a strange bluish-white light that gave off a sharp triangular appearance.  I soon realized that it couldn&apos;t have been a plane because those give off repetative rythmical flashes.  This object&apos;s flash was not like that.  It would flash, pause a second, flash two or three times, pause a couple seconds, then back to one flash, then one long pause, then flash again.  It just repeated like this, very unrandomly for about 7 or 8 secs.   Then suddenly and without warning it made a sharp and quick 90% turn west, flashed again, then was gone.  I also noticed that when it wasn&apos;t flashing, the object seemed to have a grayish-metallic spherical appearance to it.

A call came in on the north west side of the city, which was in a separate district of the city in which we where working, however we shared the same radio channel. The call was that there was several unidentified object flying over the north west part of the city, at this time only a couple of calls had come in and my partner and I thought nothing of it at the time and the comments on the radio of the north west units on patrol, more orless joked about the call.

A north west car was dispatched to the call. Shortly upon our arrivial to our view piont, I along with my partner could see one object directly north of our position, placing it in the far west of the city&apos;s north end approx 3 miles north of us.

Both of these objects where hovering over the city, i would estamate at leat 1,500 feet above the ground and from our vantage piont we could see a bright white light in the centre of the craft and a blue light on top rotating in one direction as though it was mounted on the out side of a saucer and the saucer was spinning, there was a red light on the bottom this was a red light and moved in the opposite direction of the blue light that was mounted on the top. The blue light was mounted in the same way as the red light, as though it was on the end of a sauce.Looking further east and north of the city another object could be similar, however this object was estamated to be at least 5 to 7 miles away. When we looked south of our location we could see another object identical to the first three objects and this one was directly in line with the north west object if your drew a line directly south of the north west object. The object was was approx 3 miles south of our location and appeared to be higher above the ground, i would est. to be 3,000 feet above the ground. There was a second object in the south west of the city which appeared to be inline with the second north object that was over the north centre of the city. All the object where of the same configuration.Shortly after our arrivial, the unit in the north stated over the radio channel that a citizen had lent him a pair of binnocular&apos;s, and he stated that the craft was &quot;saucer shaped with blue light on the top and a red light on the bottom&quot;. The north west unit then turned on his over head emergencie equipment (patrolcar lights - red/blue).

The airport was contacted by our communications personel and we where informed that the air port could not see any thing and had nothing on radar. The airport is located in the north east corner of the city and had a view of the entire city from the north east. Upon arrivial of the MP (military police) the witnesses the same objects. With in a short time the MP recieved a dispatch call from thier dispatcher saying that Spokan Washington had just been in touch with Ottawa and they said that they knew what the objects where and not to worry about them.

I have to admit that I was kind of wondering if I would see something strange in the sky.Almost directly above my head  I saw three dim, but clear lights, (they appeared to be stars, solid white)  moving across the sky in a triangle pattern.They did not move in a totally even pace but constantly normalized themselves in what appeared sort of like a stuttering action so that they kept in a basic triangle formation.  They continued moving in the same direction for approximately one minute and covered about half of the night sky or a little less.  After the minute or so the first one in formation just kind of shrunk and pinched out of sight and the other two did the same once they reached the point in the sky where the other one had pinched out.  The pattern they had been moving in was one of the three leading the other two which took up flanking positions in the rear.  It was like a triangle being led by one of its points.Two things keep me looking at the skies Ever since fourteen or so I have kind of wondered if I would see something in the sky strange because my friend and I had seen a star, solid white, move across half the sky over about two minutes and then just all of a sudden without stopping it just changed directions and went back the other way across the whole sky.  He and I both witnessed this and we talked about the details again recently.I believe it was that same year, 14,  (i am 24 now) when I had a dream that there was one of those aliens that you always see in movies like &apos;fire in the sky&apos;.  I had been sleeping in the basement while the rest of my family slept on the second story of our house.  The way the dream went was very strange.  I remember kids were playing with a ball of some sort and then a door to my left opened and one of those aliens was behind it.  The strange thing is that the dream faded away and I was in my basement and one of those things was just standing in the dingy doorway to my basement at the foot of the stairs.  I did not believe I was dreaming at this point.  I tried to hold myself up from my bed, and resolved that I was going to fight this thing.  Then it just went black.  I woke up on my bed with my legs hanging off and my blanket on the ground.  I ran up the stairs and I noticed that the side door lock which went directly to the basement was broken and hanging upside down on the door.

After watching four straight episodes of a Quartermass series (ironically), it was getting really late and we decided to break up the party. Around 3:30 am we gathered in the street to leave, when one witness needed to go back inside to get something. When he returned, the second witness began telling me a story of an encounter he had had recently (more irony). As he was telling the story, the third witness looked up and said, &quot;Look, a UFO&quot;. The four of us looked straight up and saw three dimly lit glowing orange orbs moving from East to West overhead. The details are as follows: The orbs (or disks) appeared to be self illuminated, but not very bright, like a candle flame through a transparent orange balloon; which was a different colored orange than the city-light reflections on the clouds. They were traveling directly above us, just below the spotty checkerboard of cumulus clouds, which were estimated to be about 1500-2000 feet high, and the moon was directly south of us at about 65 degree angle from the southern horizon (my estimate). The two outer orbs (north and south)were flying in a straight vector, while the middle orb was &quot;playfully&quot; zigzagging between the other two, yet more closely to the northern-most orb. There was no sound as they passed over.Myself and another witness watched the objects the longest as they passed behind a nearby building, which obscured our view at about a 45 degree angle from our viewpoint. After witnessing these objects we had ruled out these objects as being seagulls, common to this area, as there were no signs of wing-flapping, the objects were not oval-shaped as a seagull&apos;s body would be and the maneuvering of the middle object was to fast and erratic for a bird. Seagulls and other birds tend to make sounds when flying as well.After talking about this between a couple of us later, we did not seem to surprised by what we saw, nor disturbed. It just seemed to cap off a perfect evening.

It was a large delta shaped craft which emited a low pulsating hum, it hovered at what apeared to be at the bottom of the hill where I live before it drifted lazily behind a large tree and was lost to view due to a further squall. B ecause of the weather conditions at the time and the fast decending twighlight it was hard to judge the size of the object but I would guess it was at least 20m in width at its base. I also couldnt see any of the crafts fuselage only three flickering bright white lights.((NUFORC Note:  Witness remains anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Saw silent, triangular craft at early twilight that was almost blended with the sky background.I stepped out behind our house after dinner to get something out of our storage shed.  pon leaving the shed, I glanced up at the sky as I locked the shed door. The sky was clear.  It was early twilight.  Almost directly overhead was a triangular shaped craft.  completely quiet.  The triangle would be roughly a 70 - 70 - 40 degree triangle with the apex of the 40 degree angle apparently the front of the craft.  The apex of the nose was blunt as if the front few feet were removed.  It left a distinct triangle with a square front end.  Along each edge (left and right) was a defined area that was slightly lighter extening front to back and possibly 8 to 10 feet wide.  In essence, it looked like two stripes, one along each edge of the triangle (but not the back edge).  Set in each of the stripes and spaced equidistant from each other and within the area of the stripe were circles that looked like dull dome lamps.  The circles were perhaps 6 to 8 feet in diameter.  I believe there were 5 along each edge.  I don&apos;t recall if there were these circles along the rear edge or not. In the area between the two edge stripes and starting perhaps half-way back from the leading edge of the craft was an area that appeared to be somewhat darker than the rest of the craft.  It was uniform in color but only a part of a shade darker.  The curious thing here is that while I&apos;ve described a craft with stripes and lights, it was very pale against the twilight sky.  I don&apos;t believe that I would have seen it if I hadn&apos;t just by luck looed straight at where it was.  The color was almost the color of th sky with just a little difference.  The overall shape, the stripe area, the large circular lights were definite shapes but the color was so weak as to be almost blended with the ambient image of the sky.  There was no sound.  I waited and listened closely for several seconds to see if I could perceive sound.  There was none. I live next to a little league ball field.  The field lighting was on.  I almost believe that reflected light ! from the field was what enabled me to see this thing.  From a size standpoint, there is no way to know.  If the visual cues from other aircraft I know are valid, and if the altitude was from 1500 to maybe 2000 feet, then the craft was about 120 feet long and 50 or 60 feet wide at the back.  If that was valid, then I would estimate the speed at around 100 to 150 knots.  If the size cues were wrong, then the actual size could be anything.  We live onthe edge of an extended traffic pattern for Scottsdale Airport.  It was curious that the craft had no  beacon or anticollision lights.  That makes me believe that it should have been much higher than I think because of the danger of collision in an airport traffic pattern. I don&apos;t recall the altitude requirements to cross over the airport control space but I think it&apos;s around 7500 feet.  If the craft was at that altitude it would have been enormous andwould have been moving at perhaps 300 or 400 knots.  I&apos;m a former military pilot.  I know aircraft.  My distance vision is excellent.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like this before.  I can say what it wasn&apos;t.  It was no known aircraft in the inventory of any country I&apos;m aware of.  It was not a hang glider, an ultra-light, baloon, F11, B2, Beechcraft Starship, Dick Rutan creaation, or anything else I can think of.  It was not shaped like a blimp and besides, you can hear them easily.  I watched the craft for approximately 10 seconds until it disappeared behind a tree that blocked my vision.  It held a steady course, altitude, and speed - traveling from southeast to northwest.  I have filed a report with MUFON some time ago.

The movement of the craft was instantaneous and very smooth. From my experience of observing aircraft no known modern craft is capable of this kind of movement.

Being that the only thing I can remember as far as the month would be arround September or possibly even October. The area I lived in was mostly farmland and the fields got plowed just before winter after the crops were harvested. I lived on route 2 Twin Falls,Idaho in a big two story home surrounded by bean and lettuce fields. It was arround 8 o&apos;clock or so when my two brothers and myself went out to go clobber each other with dirt clots in the bean field just left of the house. The sun had just barely set wit hjust a hint of purple left in the sky.That was when the low hum and the mistlike clouds came. Kinda like a fog. We all looked up and saw a craft right above us in the field. It was about 100 feet or so high. Again this is an approximation, being I was only about 8 years old when this happened so it could have been lower. It had one main large light which made a beam shooting straight down. It didn&apos;t burn or make us feel weird or anything it was not brilliant. The beam was about the strength of a good maglite flashlite. There were off center on both sides of the light in the middle a row off smaller colored lights which changed color. We were in awe as I can remember just standing there looking at it. Off in the distance we heared sirens and soon we heard my Father pull up to the house in quite a hurry. We looked away from the craft to see our Father and the flashing lights comming down the road. When we looked back and I know it was very quickly looked back. The craft was gone. Now the strangest thing is that my Father saw this craft near the south hills as he was comming back from a customer sight, he leased farm equipement, he called the air force and they were chasing this thing. How it came to be coincidentally above us when he got home is odd. We do recall that there was some time loss because when we got back inside it was 10:45. We were not outside that long, there is just no way. The air force did investigate this sighting and questioned us and my Father the next day.

The farm I was on was being used to grow potatoes. There was posibly 80 or so acres of cleared land sloping downwards to a dam.  The valley was surrounded by a eucalypt forest. The distance to the dam would be approximately 250 metres.I was in the laundry doing washing.  The laundry building was detached from the house - and there was about a 10 metre walk to get back to the front door. I was walking back to the house and turned around to face west and looked down towards the dam, over the cleared field.From the tops of the trees at the left of the dam a silver-grey shape appeared.  It was in line with the treetops and slowly moved over the dam. It was in full view for about 60 - 90 seconds. It was travelling northwards very slowly over the dam - and then went behind the treetops on the northern side of the dam.It was a solid object, very clearly ly the work of an intelligence and definitely not a weather phenomena or a trick of the light etc. - but I had the distinct impression it could change &apos;dimensions&apos; if you like.  It had a very distinct pink/light mauve &apos;halo&apos; or field around it.

No &quot;skidding&quot; was noted of the object during length of sighting. There were no lights visible on the object.", "Pulsating Lights Make &quot;Drops&quot; in ArizonaI should start by saying that I have seen this object 4 times.I will start with the first. The first time I saw this object was in either 1998 or 1999. My boyfriend and I were sitting in a porch swing in front of my house after midnight when I noticed this amber-colored light a few miles away. It was rising vertically in the sky. But what caught my eye the most was that the light was pulsating. It was fading in and out. It was very high in the sky when it became so bright that it looked as if it were going to burst. It then dropped something that looked like shiny gold-colored stuff that sparkled as it fell down. The light then dimmed down until it vanished. Soon after, 2 planes flew over in its direction. My mother later told me that she had also witnessed the light the same night.The second time, I witnessed the same exact thing, in the same exact spot, a few months later by myself. The third time, around March 15th, 2002,my boyfriend and I were driving when we saw the amber light again. This time it was moving above us and only about 5,000 ft in the sky,  probably closer. I stopped my truck and we got out to watch it. There was so much glow around it that I could not make out a shape of the object, let alone,see what it was made out of, and there wasn&apos;t any sound coming from it.When the the light stopped quite a few miles away,  again, it became very bright and dropped the same stuff that we saw before. Then the light just disappeared.And again,planes flew over to the area that the object was last in.The last time we saw this object it was around 1:30 in the morning today, April 1st (yeah, just what you need, a sighting on April Fools Day). I met my boyfriend at the track at the high school to go jogging after work. We were walking along when I spotted the amber light. It was moving very slowly and doing the same pulsating stuff. This time, when it became VERY bright, it looked as if it produced a red &quot;flare&quot; and then dropped it. The red flare-like thing seemed to burn out before it hit the ground. It repeated this once more before it disappeared. I didn&apos;t notice any other aircraft flying to the area this time.I really wish I could find out what this is. My boyfriend thinks its a military helicopter test. This would have convinced me if the object would have made some sound when we witnessed it up close.((NUFORC Note:  We have received many reports of amber lights over Arizona.  Some of them may be military flares, but follow-up investigation is the only way to distinguish flares from bona fide UFO&apos;s.

T ere is an area close to our houses where at the time there was some development going on.This spot is nestled in the foothills. We were admiring the sillouette of the mountains against the dark blue sky.All of a sudden a tear shaped object flying pointed end forward skimmed barely over the crest of the mountain.The front portion of the craft was glowing in a blue/purple color while the rear of the craft pulsed in a peach color.It left a slight trail but made no sound.It flew directly across the sky and into a small cloud.The amazing thing was that the speed it was traveling at,it never came out of the other side of the cloud.We stood there shocked and amazed not breathing.Finally one of us broke the silence by yelling &quot;WHAT IN THE HELL WAS THAT&quot;. We sat there and talked about it for two hours hoping we would see it again.Upon arriveing home(about two miles away)my little sister and my neighbors son were sittin in the yard.They described seeing the same object at the same time we saw it only they were directly under the cloud it flew into. They said it disappeared in a flash.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

What little was visible of it resembled a delta, or &apos;V&apos; shaped object.  Very little detail could be made of it, some very very dimly visible leading edges giving the impression of the delta shape.  my son thought it was a plane, but there were &apos;zero&apos; lights present on the object.  I personally thought it might be a hang glider, but it is two hours past sundown and cooling dramatically outside.  Besides...it seemed awfully high.  it followed a south to north path pretty well perfectly.  no sound was present at all, and flew at an estimated/guesstimated 10,000 feet.  Don&apos;t quote me on that altitude as size was an issue to determine.  I thought it could have been the ISS, but checking the position of the station found it to be only &apos;approaching&apos; the western coasts of S.America and following the wrong course for what we saw.  If it was a plane it was running silent and dark.  If it was a hang glider it should have been dropping fairly quickly in suburban areas.  Either way it was unlit, V shaped, and very quiet.

The star appeared to slowly but surely changfe its position -- drifting aimlessly.Since it was twilight, I checked another bright star 90 degrees to the right of the moonfor comparison purposed. It did not move but the bright star near the moon continued to move. I then called 911 and reported this to Mr. Davenport.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, who sounded quite credible.

Just as abruptly as it appeared it went completely dark. The brightness did not last longer than a second or two but I cant be sure.The only thing I could think it was was a meteor coming straight at me from above, something I&apos;ve never seen before.

About 20 minutes later my friend called me outside to watch unusual lights he was observing. In the western sky 4 or 5 blinking lights were moving about in no particular order. Every once in awhile 3 or 4 very bright triangular white lights would seem to emit from the blinking light in a staggered formation.I saw this happen about three times. Then one light emitted 4 or 5 very bright balls of white light in a straight line out the back. These emitted lights lasted only for seconds, though the blinking lights were constant. I don&apos;t know what flares look like, so that is what it could have been, except for one thing...there was one light that did not blink. It moved very very rapidly diagonally and seemed to stop on a dime and change direction. Then it started to blink again and move towards another blinking light. I have no way to judge distance, but they seemed to be very high in the atmosphere. After 15 or so minutes, all the lights moved north towards Tucson (50 miles away. The unusual thing about the blinking lights was that they seemed to move in a very disorganized way. 45 minutes later, the foggy bands were still in the same place in the sky, though I don&apos;t know if the two are connected.", "many years ago my brother and i heard a &apos;whirling&apos; loud sound maybe 10&apos; above our heads one early morning but could&apos;nt see anythingtSometime in 1975 when I was 11 years old, my brother and I were camping in the backyard of my uncles house and were up early in the morning as we were excited about going fishing that morning with my uncle...it was near Ballarat in Victoria, Australia, which at that time was a fairly rural countryside area...it was about 5 in the morning and it was still very dark, there was no moon and there was no clouds, the nightsky was very clear as i remember..my brother who was 10 at the time, said something like he &apos;saw a black star&apos; moving in the sky...i looked for it but did&apos;nt see anything...we moved around to the front of the house to have another look and then we heard what sounded  like a fairly close &apos;whirling&apos; sound above us...but we could see nothing above us, we saw open stars directly above our heads...the sound continued directly above us for a bit and then it started to move away from us at a fairly slow speed, the sound did not zoom off...almost as soon as the sound had disappeared in the distance then what looked like a small shower of sparks rained down above our heads for a few seconds...like shooting stars but as i remember it, the sparks seemed to be shooting down and ending only a few feet above our heads...I don&apos;t remember telling anyone, i don&apos;t remember talking to my brother about it...i don&apos;t remember what we did directly after this...in fact i completely forgot about this event for about 17 years...i only remembered years later when i was 28...a friend had lent me a book that mentioned an &apos;invisible black helicopter&apos;...when i read that phrase the memory came back...at first i thought it might be some kind of confused childhood memory...i live in the united states and my brother lives in australia so we don&apos;t see each other or talk much but when i saw him about 5 years ago..i asked him simply &apos;did he remember anything about that trip to our uncles?&apos;, he immediately repeated whet i have reported above&hellip;((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate.

As we were looking up at the moon and stars (we were facing west and looking Northwest), we noticed two very bright white objects - which at first I mistook for stars.  As we watched them though, we noticed that the bright white objects were moving from the northwest towards the south about the speed which airlines normally travel from LAX to SFO.  One was trailing the other very close - too close for conventional commercial aircraft in air corridors.As a matter of fact, these objects were traveling in the vicinity of the air corridor for air traffic flying between LAX and SFO, with the exception that they appeared very high in the sky - higher then normal air traffic would be.  Since I have a commercial pilots license (in-active pilot), I was trying to see the red and green wing tip lights that would determine they were either private or commercial aircraft.  After watching for a minute, I could never make out the shape of the object or see any wingtip lights.  After concluding that they must be commercial aircraft, I went up to my apartment and turned on the TV.Unfortunately, that was not the end of the story.  The next morning I saw the maintenance man who had watched the objects with me the previous evening.  He told me that had I stayed another 1 1/2 minutes and watched,  I would have seen something unexplainable for an ordinary aircraft to do.  Evidently, as the bright white objects were getting closer towards LAX, they separated with one shooting straight up and the other going up and out-of-sight at a very steep angle.  He thought that it might be a &quot;stealth&quot; aircraft but I told him that &quot;known&quot; military aircraft cannot achieve those kinds of speed.I have read other reports for April 17th which seem to mirror the events we witnesed.

I could see that it was a solid white object gleaming in the bright sunlight.  It was not moving and was at very high altititude.  It varied slightly in its brilliance, as if wobbling slightly toward a duller surface.  I pointed it out to a co-worker who looked at it briefly.  I watched it off an on for 5 minutes.  Then it began to move slowly in a flat trajectory and after travelling the length of a finger held out faded away.  So it could not have been Venus and seems it could not have been a balloon as it remained steady for 5 minutes before leaving slowly.

My first sighting was certainly not during the rainy season.I was a bachelor then and as usual I entered my hostel room and opened all the windows and went on to remove my shoes and all most at once the windows slammed crazily with a sudden gust of wind and simultaneously it became dark , I came on to the balcony and scanned the sky and to my surprise the sky which was so clear hardly 5 min before had turned into inky blue, but only to a limited area .Above the dark clouds I saw a flash of red light and thought that it was an aircraft perhaps going to land. Then all of a sudden I noticed that the moving light was not flickering and that it had already come to a stand still . My mind was trying to figure out &apos;is that a chopper, no chance if it was one then the sound of the chopping blades should be audible.( from the time of the sudden slamming of the window my mind was strangely working on the UFO lines) Then I saw that the RED light had changed to ORANGE and as well grew larger in diameter - I should say it was almost having a sharp oval shape.Now the colors began to change in waves of pink,yellow,orange,red....  it appeared that it was emerging from the bottom of the craft , perhaps from a single light point having the characteristics of changing its color like a chameleon. The light flowed from that point and simultaneously increased the sharp oval diameter and as well as the luminosity.I knew that I need a witness now and therefore dashed to the next room and found one of the inmates and forced him out to have a look at  the unbelievable phenomenon. He gaped at it for a while and then asked me what it was and went on to say whether it is a plane or a helicopter. I asked him to observe as keen as possible with out diverting the concentration.Then the craft began to HOVER  so very slowly and majestically with all its splendor and glory circling elliptically and moving in our direction and stopped again , then after a moment it started to move fast in a straight line parallel to the Earth&apos;s surface maintaining the height perhaps around the height of a 6 to10 story building (we were on the 2nd floor)    .Then the light  which  was so wide spread , shrunk back to its point of origin , the mid point of the bottom of the craft and then it zipped into nothingness perhaps changed into another dimension????? CHAPTER  : II The story of this sighting went around and finally surfaced a couple of days later when there was a gathering of the hostel mates around 10 pm and the location was an open balcony on the II floor of the building.The entire group which was all set to make fun of me on the subject of UFO , began to do so by countering every detail which I was providing them,emphasizing that what I saw, (which was as well witnessed by the next  room mate ) was an UFO and not an imagination. Even the witness kept tight lipped during the entire course.And as the commotion got heated up,  I said that someday I will show them what I had seen and that could happen even today , saying so I look up into the sky, My God , I saw the craft circling almost above us, the sky was so clear and almost above that UFO was the bright full moon , it was like a heavenly spotlight focusing on the UFO.What more do I need , it was My turn to bully them and asked them what on earth they were seeing , each one began saying that it was an airplane, a helicopter etc but then finally they realized that what so ever they were seeing was unexplainable .An UFO???? CHAPTER III There after for over a period of more than an year and a half , I used to see the UFO frequenting the Chennai sky (Madras sky).During most of my sightings,  I observed that the UFOs would be coming from the  direction of the airport towards the sea coast,  to be more specific that was the landing route of most of the aircraft .Most of the time these UFOs were moving very lazily stopping here and there and when once they reach the coast line they would fly parallel to the coast towards the nearby rocket launching station.On two occasion I saw the UFO chasing an aircraft almost zipping from far behind and on reaching the top of the aircraft  it used cut down the speed almost at once effortlessly and then travel along with the speed of the air craft .Am sure that these UFOs will be seen everyday in the Chennai skys, but when I realized that I was going nowhere by simply observing them, I gave up sky watching.Am willing to answer any specific questions on the above sightings which could help the science of UFOs.Regards ((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  We will have the witness attempt to establish the precise date of the incident.

It was totally black, and the lights did not illuminate any portion of the craft.

I turned the ignition to aux to have the radio come back on, to know when the shuttle was launching, and looked back and the object was simply gone. I got out of the van, and looked around the sky, but there was nothing. There were no contrails in the sky as well. I might note also that I travel this area twice a week, and very rarely see any conventional aircraft at all.The shuttle launch was not visible due to the clouds. As a side note, before I left on this trip, I set the digital clock on the radio to sync with my local radio station from Tampa (970 WFLA) and after this event, the van clock was two minutes slow. The reason I set the clock, was the van had had a starter replaced the previous day, and the clock was hours off.

Two males and one female were traveling north on Cordon Road just on the East side of Salem where the city ends and farm land begins. They first noticed what appeared to be two bright car headlights just above some trees ahead about a quarter mile and above the tree line on the left of the road. As they began to approach the intersection of Cordon and Sunnyview, the view to the left and above became quite clear as the trees on their left gave way to the scene ahead of them...a craft slightly larger than the house it hovered above between 50 to 100 feet quietly sat as they and a few other drivers on the road passed in both directions. The house this craft was situated over was sitting by itself in an open farm field.At this point in the sighting, as they drove below and to the right of it, they report seeing what was described as a craft in the shape of a triangle, only the front end of the craft was not pointed, but instead having a straight edge. At the corners were two bright white lights which were bright enough to illuminate the crop in the field below in front of the home. As they came along side the craft, they stretched their necks to look up and out the car window. The middle section on each side began to rapidly flash red lights in a strobe like manner. They also report a dome like structure centered in the middle of the craft. One of the witnesses recalled wondering how the craft would land as the dome underneath would make the craft wobble upon landing. Passing the craft, they report seeing two bright white lights on the back corners as well. The witnesses continued down Cordon road a short distance and turned left on Walker road while viewing the back of the craft. They then turned again left as Walker road curves left in an attempt to come up on the other side of the craft. It was at this point that the craft departed the area at a high rate of speed. It was noted that there was no sign of &quot;slow to fast&quot; acceleration, that the craft simply &quot;took off&quot; from a point of motionless hover to speeding away at the blink of an eye. Several other motorists appeared to have seen this craft as well, according to the witnesses, but none have come forward as yet.The Salem Police Department was notified by the witnesses as they didn&apos;t know who else to contact. The Police put the witnesses in contact with Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, who in turn contacted Oregon UFO Research Director Skip Schultz.The next day, Saturday the 30th at 11am, Director Schultz and Assistant Director Eric Byler met with the two male witnesses at the intersection of Cordon and Sunnyview and were told of what had happened. Schultz and Byler were also given drawings of the craft in question. Both investigators were in agreement that both witnesses were sincere with their story and were of a very credible nature. A better idea of the altitude of the craft was given at that time and it was decided the craft was around 75 feet above the field rather than 100 feet. The female witness was working that morning and later sent a report to the Review via e-mail. Byler returned later that day and spoke with the home owners that lined the opposite side of the field in question in hopes of finding other witnesses. While no other witnesses were found in these homes, it was discovered that while some of the neighbors had not been home during the sighting, the rest conveyed that they were either in watching TV or eating dinner. None of them reported being either outside or in a position to see the silent hovering craft above their homes.If anyone was driving either North or South on Cordon road near Sunnyview at 7:20pm on Friday the 29th of March, 2002 and witnessed this event, please contact either Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle at 206-722-3000, the Oregon UFO Research Hotline at 503-463-1467, or the Salem Police Department.OUFOR would like to thank the Salem Police Department as well as Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle for passing on this sighting to us for investigation and for his continued cooperation in helping get to the bottom of UFO sightings Nationwide.

They looked to be about the distance apart of one centimeter held at arms length.  The two white lights with hints of many more smaller lights between and around, likely part of the same object, moved to the left and then stopped dead before moving back to the right and continued in that direction untill it was out of site about 15-20 seconds later.  The two lights stayed the same distance apart and at the same horizontal orientation to each other which rules out a plane banking. As its direction changed the one in the lead that was the brightest grew darker, and the one now in the lead grew brighter.  Its position in the sky was very close verticaly to the tree line on the other side of a clear cut that is about 500 meters across. The object was in my opinion about 1/2 mile away.  There was no sound at all or blinking running lights like you see on all aircraft.  If it was a rescue helicopter from CFB Comox (the largest helicopters in the area) it would have been fairly loud from that distance and it moved unlike any fixed wing aircraft commercial/private/or military.  Im located just on the outskirts of Courtenay B.C. to the west of town and I was looking north.((ADDENDUM SUBMITTED MARCH 23, 2002))Oops.  I submitted another report to try update my first report.  Then I saw it said to email updates, sohere it is.  I went into further detail on certain points, and I also belive that I now know what kind of craft it was.    &quot;I saw two bright lights moving in an unconventional fashion.  When I first noticed the light it was behind a group of trees that was blocking my view.  I moved my head around to get a better look through the branches. After 20-30 seconds I gave up and continued with my smoke.  A half minute later I looked back at it to see if it had moved enough for me to see it better.  It had moved, to the left of the group of trees.  I was curious what it was because it was brighter than a plane.  As I studied it I noticed that it was actualy two lights close together. They looked to be about the distance apart of 1 centimeter held at arms length.  The two white lights had hints of many more smaller lights or possibly a reflection between the two.  It moved slowly to the left and then stopped dead before moving back to the right(it didn&apos;t seem to excelerate, or decelerate. It was just moving or it wasn&apos;t, with no in between speed) and continued in that direction until it was out of site about 15-20 seconds later.  The two lights stayed the same distance apart and at the same horizontal orientation to each other which rules out a plane banking. As its direction changed the one in the lead that was the brightest grew darker, and the one that NOW was in the lead, grew brighter.  Its position in the sky was very close vertically to the tree line on the other side of a clear cut that is about 500 meters across from my backyard. The object was in my opinion about 1/2 mile away, but could have been much further as its size was hard to judge.  There was no sound at all(it was a very quiet night) or blinking running lights like you see on all aircraft.  If it was a rescue helicopter from CFB Comox (the largest helicopters in the area) it would have been fairly loud from that distance and it also moved unlike any fixed wing aircraft Commercial/private/or military I can think of.  Im located just on the outskirts of Courtenay B.C. to the west of town and I was looking north.     Since I reported this I found a video on the net of a sighting from Belgium of a triangle shape ship. There video shows it from below, and also from the side.  When shot from the side you can only see two lights, again with more small lights or a reflection connecting them.

It was so bright and full of color I could not exactle make out the shape until it started moveing.  It seemed to take the shape of a fire ball.

Our house was the last house at the end of a dirt surfaced street.  There were no houses yet built across the street (very rural). I was sitting on the grass in the front yard our ranch-style home waiting to be picked up by friends to get an early start to go surfing. It was quite dark, as there were no street lights yet in this area, and our house did not yet have yard lights.I suddenly realized that there were none of the usual night sounds (crickets, far away dogs barking, etc.). It was so quiet in fact that I could hear the blood pumping in my ears. I was suddenly compelled to look up over my left shoulder in a northwesterly direction (I was sitting indian style, facing east).  My eyes rivited on circular black shape that blotted out the stars behind it. Its apparent size would be that of a 33 1/3 record album heald at arms length (large!). It was approximately 20 degrees northwest of the zenith. I do not know how long it had been there before I detected it.

As we back up to the woods we are somewhat isolated from other neighbors so there were no distractions or any other lighted areas. I was leaning on the South side of my deck at around 10:10 pm talking to our friends when in the distance coming from the north I saw through the trees a flash of light I could not initially distinguish the color as looking thru the trees dulled any color recognition. I want to add that our house sits in a slight valley as we are in the foot hills of the appalation mountains so  there are many high and low areas.I did not think to much of this light but noticed it was coming in my direction low and in my direction. Once it came over the tree line I [which is about 150 yards from where I was standing] had a better view of something traveling south putting out a bright green light. The light  looked to me like a straw or a cigar object. The light came on every approx. 2 to 3 seconds directly over our house continuing south then out of sight over another tree covered area. There were no engine noises, no other lights. It was not a shooting star. This situation was so unusual that I had to report it.

Nights vary, but over the past few years (first seen by myself Spring 1999) in the eastern sky, a very, very bright light frequently appears.  This light regardless of the season will always show up in the same general area of the sky.  It will go from being stationary to moving in figure eights, to north&amp; south in the sky changing direction too fast to be anything I know of.  It will some times swing like a toy tied to a pole down left then down up, reversing direction and then doing so to the right.

Not believing me, we walked out into the street where it can be seen through the trees and it happened to be there.  Tonight we saw more movement on it than I have ever seen before.

It worked its way down the sky (we marked our original position with Pepsi cans) and continued to walk backwards until it was too low to be seen over the hill.  I have fixed various telescopes and binoculars on it when it seems to be stationary and nothing signifigant can be made out about it.  It just becomes a larger bright light in the sky.  I know it cannot be a planet because its always is in the same general place in the sky no matter the season, it is too bright, and it moves so visibly.  Tonight it was only myself and my friend who viewed it, but my father and another friend of mine have all seen it over the years.  Just randomly assuming this object is only 150 miles away (and it has to be further because of the attempts to view it through magnification yields nothing) its movement variation is so radical, I know that nothing known can reverse direction, turn, or even move that fast.Time of day seems to vary, but it is always seen at night.

On a Sunday in mid-September, I was driving to a Golden Corral located on the West side of Roswell, New Mexico then located on West Second Street just East of the State Police Station also located further out on West Second.  It was a beautiful cloudless evening and I was only thinking about what I might order for dinner at a restaurant that I had only visited a few times as I normally fixed meals at my apartment located on the corner of Sunset and, whatever the cross street was, that I was driving North on, when I saw the aerial object I am reporting.  I gradually became aware that something was in my peripheral vision to my far left and up in the air possibly 15 degrees above the horizon.  As I turned my head, while driving my little pick-up truck, I saw a huge gray metal saucer or disk shaped craft, full face top-view with it&apos;s top side facing me hanging in mid-air.  I saw what looked like an aerial and portholes on what I would call a conning tower.  There was no sound whatsoever and the thing was bigger than a house.  In a matter of the blink of an eye it was gone.  My immediate impression was it was either going straight down or straight up, to or out of the ground.  There was a YMCA building to the left of the object which gave me some sense of the size of the object. However, I realized I could not figure out where it went into or out of the Earth which makes no possible logical sense.  I became so excited by what I saw I abandoned all idea of going to the Golden Corral to eat and drove my vehicle all around the adjacent neighborhood going all the way North driving around the deserted runways of the old Roswell Municipal Airport which had been converted to a Municipal Bldg including housing the Police Department.  I drove all over the whole area including all of the streets that abutted to the Airport which included a golf course and a City Park.  By this time, the thought of eating had completely left me even though I had been extremely hungr! y when I left my apartment.  I drove around there up until almost dark and finally decided to return home.  I called the N.M. State Police Headquarters and the officer wanted my name and address after I gave him the basic details as written in this account.  He said something, at this juncture, which I have never forgotten, &quot;Well, maybe you were the only one who saw it this time&quot;!  I became very fearful at this point and refused to give him my name etc, because I held a government job and knew stories about what happened to other people&apos;s careers and lives once they reported something like this, and knew I didn&apos;t want to go thru that myself.  I quickly hung up.  Then I called the relatively new Roswell Airport which is located out where the old Walker Air Force Base was and spoke with an air traffic controller, I assume, in the Control Tower.  I asked him if anyone had reported seeing anything unusual in the skys or if anyone there had seen anything?  He calmly answered no and he wanted my name etc., also.  I hung up again. Then I called the Roswell Daily Record and surpringly enough got hold of an editor who just happened to be there.  I told him the story, but said I would not give my name or any personal information.  He suggested we go to a local restaurant at some future time since nothing much is open in Roswell on a Sunday evening.  He wanted to meet with me and discuss the event later!  I never called him and tried to forget what happened.  But, unfortunately, about two weeks later I had what I would call a serious depressive episode which almost got out of hand. That was just the beginning of my personal and professional problems.  I had other experiences later which were terrifying and which I have rarely discussed with anyone out of fear of ridicule and social and professional ostracism which to some extent has happened anyway, and that is why I decided to contact u and file this report!  This is not a joke and I am not psychotic!((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the witness for submitting such a nice report!  Date of sighting in September 1988 is approximate.  PD))", "UFO seen over Texas skys in the late &apos;70sA friend and I were outside his residence late one evening in the summer of &apos;77 or &apos;78. He was playing his guitar and I was lying on the hood a car staring up at the stars.  The first unusual thing to happen was a meteor that curved as it entered the atmosphere.  I mentoned this to my friend.  Then about 5 min. later I was still looking up when an object appeared.  It was moving across the sky in a perfect straight line directly over us.  It was an elongated oval shape.  It had no color and made no sound.  There were no lights.  It was difficult to tell how high or how large it was but if I had to guess I would say about 50 feet long.  It moved sideways and stayed on a perfect line until it disappeared into the horizon.  It was traveling mabye at 100 mph.  But again it was difficult to judge speed or size.  The thing that sticks in my mind is that we could see the object very clearly.  It was directly overhead and the lights of the city seemed to illuminate the bottom. It was a dark object. We got a very good long look and talked to each other about it as it passed overhead.  The next day I called the local airport and asked if any reports were called in or any balloon type craft were in the area at that time.  None were reported.  My friend and I lost contact with each other shortly after the sighting and have never spoken about this.  I understand that a weather station somewhere in south Texas used to lose balloons occasionally and this could be a possibility but I have never seen one of these balloons to compare, but the object I saw appeared solid and did not rotate or change attitude or altitude as I would think a balloon would.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "this was so coolit was about eleven pm and i saw something in the sky and i dint know what it was so i got out my telescope and looked it looked just like the teardrop they paint on a clowns face it was extremely extrordinary so i hopped on my computer and started searching on the internet trying to find anything related to the ufo i saw and i found you it was great thanks if any one else saw what i saw i would be happy to see what you have to say((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Silent triangular shaped craft observed in daylightOn Thursday, 05/02/02, at 7:45 PM I stepped outside on the balcony to watch the sunset. I live near a small airport and frequently see small aircraft like Cessna&apos;s and corporate jets. The weather was clear with a few very high scattered clouds. After several minutes of looking up I observed to the south of me a triangular shaped craft flying from south to north. I estimate it&apos;s altitude at about one half mile and the distance from me of less than one mile. I could see it clearly. The craft itself was triangular with rounded corners, dark in color, didn&apos;t reflect any sunlight and made no noise that I could hear. I would guage the size of it to be similar to a large commercial aircraft. The surface that I saw appeared to be smooth without any lights on it. When first seen I thought it was a kite drifting on the wind but it flew smoothly in a straight line, not erratically like one expects a kite to do. It flew slowly enough that it was in sight for at least two minutes. During this time it maintained a steady flight path and did not change it&apos;s altitude or distance from me. I finally lost sight of it to the north due to the edge of the building I was in.While I was watching this craft a small Cessna took off from the airport and reached an altitude of about 1500 feet going south/southwest. The engine on this plane was easily heard. It appeared to be about midway between the ground and the triangular craft but closer. I should note that there are several military bases to the southeast of Kansas City. Perhaps what I saw was an aircraft from one of them. I&apos;ve seen the B1/Stealth aircraft in flight at distances of a 1000 feet and the craft I saw yesterday evening was a little different. What impressed me the most was the rounded corners, total lack of noise, it&apos;s shape and that it didn&apos;t reflect any sunlight at all even though it was in the light of the setting sun. There are lots of small aircraft the use the nearby airport and Kansas City International Airport is about 30 miles north of my position. I assume the craft was tracked on radar by both of them and was visually observed by others on the ground and in the air.I am ((deleted--40 + year-old)), college educated, an((military)) veteran, worked many years in the ((medical)) field and am currently state certified in ((public service)). I&apos;ve never experienced any kind of visual hallucination, don&apos;t drink and don&apos;t do drugs. I currently hold a responsible management position. I&apos;ve been on a number of military bases, had flight line clearence but have never before seen a craft exactly like this one.", "Looked like the bottom of a carWe were at the Marion Primary School to pick up our son. I looked up and there was this craft that looked like the bottom of a car with all four tires lit up. The object just sat there for a few minutes then took off at a high rate of speed. I also was this type of craft when I was a child.", "3 orange dots in triangle formation ,followed by another three 30 seconds later .seen by seven adultstraveling south due north ,first three orange dot,s in triangle formation ,came in to view and traveld the distance of the sky left to right ,and then the other three same as the first but spread out further ,traveling very slow ,seem to be getting higher in the sky ,sorry but no photos,or video .keep looking up.", "Circular pulsating lights on sides of large, silent, disk shaped objectI sent this last night, but I got a &quot;Server not responding error&quot;, Sorry if you get this twice.I was on my deck with my wife around 10:30pm last night and we were looking up at the stars, the little dipper in particular.  We were about to head back inside, when I saw something.  It was what seemed to be circular or disk shaped and had yellowish/orange lights that pulsated in a circular motion around the object.  However these lights were only on the sides of the object, not the front or back (not on the sides that were in front of or behind the direction the object was travelling).  There were about four or five &quot;panels of individual light&quot; on each side and went like I said in a clockwise direction around the object, with only one panel lit at one time. The object  was about the size of two full moons when the moon is high in the sky, and travelled about the distance of 30 full moons in 3-4 seconds.  It made no sound at all and almost appeared transluscent, the lights were the only things I saw.  There were no clouds at all in the area.  As soon as I noticed it, I pointed it out to my wife, who saw it immediately due to it&apos;s size.  She confirmed the lights were pulsating.  The object seemed to vanish into thin air, I had an unobstructed view in the direction it was travelling when it disappeared.  I am also very close (within 4 miles) to a small airport and the FAA tracking center for the East Coast.", "The object was turning I could se a visible trail or tail when it vanished from the sky.I saw one object in the distant dark morning sky it looked like a large red glow(like fire or flames)from each side of the object which was coming towards us from the south west sky then turned south for a few seconds and then then as it turned west the red glow intesified and while it was turning I could see a trail or something like a slide show viewed in sections like a trail as it was turning it completly vanished with no visible evidence it had exsisted.", "flashing white light taperingout as it moved then reappearing in a completely different part of the sky,as if it was attached to a huge pendulum.", "UFO&apos;s spotted for three hours. After flashing the primary object with a flashlite, a object from the south west chased me.At about 10 pm I took our dogs outside . I live on 35 wooded acres, and it is very dark, and farily remote. Walking around the rear side of the house I spotted a craft preforming manuvers that are not possible by any known craft of human design. It was really buzzing around back and fourth, up and down round and round. I watched for about 15 minutes when I ran in and got my wife when I was sure it wasnt going to leave. It was at this time I spotted two additional craft,one north and one southof us. The primary craft was west of me,exactly one mile west of M-52 is where I live and then it was west of that. These two other craft were so far from me I could only tell they were moving, thats all. After a few minutes my wife went in, she&apos;s not really interested in UFO&apos;s. I had a large flashlight with me as I always go out at night and play fetch with the dogs,they can see; I cant. I took the dogs for a long walk down the road on our property, making sure I left the light off. I did not want to attract any attention to myself away from the house, where I would be a sitting duck if this thing moved closer to investigate the light source. I played with the dogs for about two hours by the next door house light, then returned to the house where I felt very secure and brave. I was 100 yards from our house on top of a small inclined dirt driveway when I let loose with the light in a series of three bursts at regular intervals. After about five minutes of no responce I put the light on the craft of unknown distance for a few moments. This was done for about a minute each time. I did this on three seperate occasions only a few seconds apart. From out of nowhere a bright shimmering lumonious object the size of a house came screaming from my south west on an intersept course,just above the tree tops.My God the size and speed of this thing; I was in total shock!!! I have heard of this happening to other people and thank God I was ready to respond. I was very ready to respond,in fact! I couldnt believe this was happenin! g to me, it was like I was watching a movie. I kept thinking, I will die of a heart attack if this thing catches me. I ran as fast  as I could with both dogs in hot pursute; after I screamed run!!! Thank God in heaven I beat both dogs to the house, scrambling to the saftey inside.I dare say, that would be a record 100 yrd dash;bar none! Hours later I went out by the door I went in , and sure enough at least two of these craft were still malingering. I did this until sun up, no way could I sleep. Ive never been so scared in my whole life, and I am 48 yrs old. To make a long story short If you ever see a craft be damn careful if you try to shine a light on it in hope of a responce. You may just get much more than you bargined for. I did try to call the St.Charles police when the objects were first spotted. They didnt answer, we have a very small town. I told my dad about what happened, former Saginaw Chief of Police Wesley F.Alcorn; he said I should have tried the sherifs office. This never crossed my mind until he mentioned it. This is not the first UFO experience I have had out here, I cant count on both hands and toes how many craft Ive seen out here. This is however the most frightning and serious. I have no doubt whatsoever they would have captured me,were they able! Needless to say I wont provoke another UFO responce ever again, this has been enough to last a life time!!! Isn&apos;t there a radar around here that should be picking these things up? Why isnt anyone elce seeing these objects? Does anyone elce in this area have any similar experiences? I cant bee the only night owl. I also cant believe I have been the only one too see these craft.I have been seeing similar craft for at least two years now, but none like this one! I have never reporded a sighting to anyone,until now. These guys are real slick, they dont come at you with the craft your signaling, but send out one your not aware of or cant see to try and capture you. Thank God I knew this and was ready, expecting a encounter from my right or left side. ! It came from my left side. I just hope they dont come back and catch me with my pants down again!", "bright egg shaped object,no trail.myself,my girlfreind,and her grandson,and his girlfreind,were returning from titusville fla,we had just left lakeland fla,heading to zephyrhills fla.when a light caught my attention out of the corner of my left eye,i turned and looked at it,and saw an egg? shaped object?,light?.it wasnt an airplane,i dont know what it was.an meteor?,but it had no trail.it moved like a meteor except it wasnt moving fast enough,and was larger.i can only say that it wasnt anything ive ever seen before,and didnt look normal, to any extent.it seemed to be following the arc of the earth,like it was in orbit,but ive seen satelites before.and this wasnt like that.it was bigger.a half hour later we did see a shooting star,meteor,and the aforementioned object was much larger.oh and it was a clear nite,still is for that matter, and there were numerous planes flying around.and this object sure didnt look like them.the color was bright whitesh, kinda yellow.the object was heading to the west,as the road we were on heads to the northwest..", "3 spheres flashed colrs as we were riding our bikes in a circle around a lantern.Some friends and I were at a local basketball court that is in the open and we had a lantern in the center of the court and we were riding our bicycles around the lanternto make the sparkly lights when we noticed 3 flashing sphere shaped objects in the sky that were about the size of marbles. They were constantly changing colors and &quot;jumping&quot; around in the sky and making a low droning saoud suckh as that of a muffles vacuum cleaner.Attempting to catch thes objects, were what appeared to be millitary style fighting jets. The objects flashed colors such as green, yellow, red, and blue. When we all stopped riding in circles so did the objects in the sky. After about 20 seconds the spheres turned a crimson red color and then jetted away at an incredible speed. The bjects left a trail that was visible for about 2 minutes. These trails had the shine of somthing that had a color of mother of pearl. And then it was gone.

The craft was cheveron shaped, light in color.The top was more of a white color and the bottom portion was  metal, shinny. I told my son to look as I also said it is a UFO.Look at it it has to be, the shape isnt like a plane.Then it just vanished.I asked my son,ok if it wasnt , then where did it go?", "The craft was fast and strobing.My mother and I saw the craft outside our home window.  We live on a river bank and the object was flying quite high.  Aircraft come in all the time as we are quite close to the airport.  The ufo wasn&apos;t going in the normal directions every single other plane does.  It was going in either a North or North East direction and was very very fast!  I tried my best to reason out what this thing exactly was.  I checked for reflections in the window, and there wasn&apos;t any lightening.  The craft didn&apos;t appear all of the time, but it looked like a strobe light moving across the sky.  The strobing pattern was sequenced, so that rules out any natural occurances in nature.  The light itself was white.  Its flight path was perfectly straight, but accelerated upward at times.  (Also, it went behind some buildings)  The flight path was very linear!  The very next day my father head a ufo report on the radio, but this one was in Phoenix, described the exact same way as my sighting.", "A sphere with a sail on top that changed into triangular shape then back to spherical, that would shrink then expand &amp; blink lightsAt 7:00 Wed. evening, my brother &amp; I took our mother into the courtyard of the Transition Center (part of Kootneai Medical Center) for a cigarette.  My brother &amp; I were observing what we thought to be a helicopter coming in from the East.  As it got closer, my brother asked me if that was a helicopter.  I looked back at it, &amp; at first I said yes, just then it changed shape into a triagular shape, I made the comment &quot;Is that the Stealth&quot;, I had heard that the Stealth had flown over Spokane 2 days prior to that.  Then I commented that it couldn&apos;t be the stealth because it was moving far to slow.  At that time it turned back into a sperical shape.  It had moved closer to us.  It was approximately between 40 to 50 degrees in relation to the Earth.  We then observed that there was some kind of a sail on top of it.  The sail would go clockwise for awhile then it would go counter clockwise, it kept doing that.  At the same time, it seemed to be wobbling.  We got the impression that it was having some kind of mechanical problems.  It would also every once in awhile shrink into a smaller sphere, then expand again a few seconds later.  The object was Jet black and had a white aura around it.  Twice that I seen lights blinked on in a circular motion around the object.  One time a beam of light shot straight out from it across the sky.  It made the sound of heavy machinery far off.  We all also felt a vibration from it.  It is strange but the vibration seemed to be very calming.  After the first 5 minutes or so of observing it, I noticed The CNA Wendy at the door.  I called her out to see it.  She came out, &amp; she looked for a while, then ran back inside and grabbed several other CNA&apos;s &amp; Nurses to come out &amp; look.  There was approximately 14 of us outside at that time.  They all heard and felt it just the same way as we did.  We discussed all the possiblites of what it could be, &amp; there was no explanation other than UFO that fit.  The object was moving very slowing, from East to West.  When it was almost directly ! overhead it started moving straight up in the sky until it was just a little pin point.  One of the CNA&apos;s (she did not observe) was so interested in our siting that she has been checking into it ever since.  She found out that on the 3rd floor of the hospital several patients, nurses, &amp; even 1 doctor had observed the UFO also.  She is in the process of trying to contact all the witnesses to have them come to this site or call the hotline &amp; report it (she gave me the phone number of where to call)", "5 lights like big star dancing direction NNW - SSE looks high in the sky looks bigger than artificial satellite colour : orange no sound sky very clean constant speed like a plane high in the sky i know it was not a plane, helicopter, shooting star or artificial satellite..observation around 1 mn since i saw them above me until they diseappeared far away", "It is just the plain truth about a craft that made a lasting impression in my mind as I looked it over.This is a testimony I wrote and sent to another UFO site a while back. I thought you may be interested. This is not about moving lights, or fireballs, it is not about an encounter with people from another world! It is just the plain truth about a craft that made a lasting impression in my mind as I looked it over.Just call me ((deleted)). I&rsquo;m fifty-((deleted)) years old, and I&rsquo;d like to share an experience I had, when I was seventeen or eighteen years old, with you. This happened in the late summer of 1963 or 1964. I do not remember the exact date, because I tried for a while to try to forget it. Things like I&rsquo;m about to talk about were taboo in the home of a southern Baptist preacher at that time! It was best to keep your mouth shut and try to pretend it didn&rsquo;t happen! The following event took place in upstate SC. Within 30 miles of Spartanburg-Greenville airport. The reason I mention this is, the airport had very good radar at that time, and the Air Force Base at Sumter is less than then fifteen minutes away for an interceptor. None showed up.My brother {who is two years younger than me) and I usually sat out on the front porch each week night after school started back in late summer, and talked for an hour or so before we went to bed around 11 o&rsquo;clock. Our front porch faced about 10-20 deg. northeast. There was a wooded area directly across the street in front of us, that had a lot of trees in it that were 50 or 60 feet high, so our view of the sky was limited down to about 1 o&rsquo;clock. This night the moon was very bright and probably within a few days of being full, which made the porch dark where we were sitting. We heard a strange sound coming from across the street in the sky and out of our sight. It sounded like a multi-engine aircraft that was straining real hard. We sat there and listened at it for a couple of minutes as the sound got closed and the noise changed to more of a whine, almost like a locomotive without the rail noise. In a minute or so we could see some lights through the trees and a huge shape moving slowly toward us. My brother said it was &quot;one of those flying wings&quot; speaking of some multi-engine aircraft at that time that looked like wings. As it cleared the trees we realized it was a &quot;flying saucer&quot; and the sound had changed to a high pitched hum. We watched in awe as it came slowly over the road and over the house beside us on our left or west side. It was very low and not moving much faster than a person can walk. We jumped up and jumped off the porch and walked beside the house watching it as it moved over that house and than just stopped and hovered over the back yard of that house. The hum changed to a hum like an electric motor, as I remember standing there in our back yard and staring up at the huge craft. It was a round thick disk with three or four little blue lights on the side I could see. It had a big dome on top of the disk and it had a few amber lights around it about a third of the way up. It looked to be about a hundred feet across the disk, and maybe fifty feet high. It was about five hundred feet up an! d maybe a hundred feet west of us. (The reason I can describe the size so accurately is, I went back there several years ago and stood in the same place and looked the same way I did that night, and it was almost as if I was reliving that night. And I figured out the size and altitude than.) It was a dull gray color and the moon made it look very dark underneath. The odd thing was, the moon didn&rsquo;t reflect off the dome in any way that I could see. The craft just sat there motionless, as we stood there looking it over. I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of it at all, I was fascinated as I watched it. There was something about it that seemed to make a weird sensation in my body. After what seemed an eternity, which in reality was probably around a minute, the sound changed to a high pitched hum and than it seemed to get out of the sounds that a human can hear. The craft started to move up and back a little to the northwest at a very steep angle, slowly at first and that it left so fast that it was gone in about two seconds. I remember as it was going out of sight I saw a red light blink somewhere on it. I can remember the feelings that I had as it disappeared; I felt as if I&rsquo;d just lost my best friend! I was excited, but I had a empty feeling! Now the weird part is, my brother and I have talked this over several times during our lives, and we remember the same things until the craft stopped. His version is quite different than mine up until it started to leave.Well anyhow, that changed my life! I knew that everything that I&rsquo;d been taught in church and history was wrong. Whenever I mentioned the damn thing to one of my friends, they thought I was crazy! So I quit talking about it. My brother and I didn&rsquo;t even talk about it! That experience did something to me, I have thought about it daily all my life! It has caused me a lot of problems! I&rsquo;m going to cut here as I don&rsquo;t think the rest of this testimony has any information on the craft.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At first thought it was a satellite, but then it stopped dead. Then it started to speed up again, then disappeard altogether.

Being so close to Chicago, star visibility is rather poor, I can see the big dipper, some planets and a few bright stars and I have a knack for spotting satellites.  The majority (satellites) I see over time tend to travel South to North, I&apos;ll pick it up in plain site and try and follow it acoss the whole sky until it fades out of view.  The one on Monday was something I never saw before, I thought I spotted a satellite, a pinpoint of light just moving in a straight line (North to south, this time) and 2 seconds after I spotted it, it began to slowly grow in white brilliance (I immediately thought this thing was entering the atmosphere) the &quot;glint&quot; on this object got to be as bright as a full moon, and I noticed I had to squint it was so bright....suddenly the light contracted and continued its straight line course, returned to its normal illuminated pinpoint of light and faded out.

I was used to seeing the planes land at night and was familiar with the slow approaches from the south and the west to east patterns of planes landing. I was also familiar with the airplanes turning in the final approach to the airport at night. What I witnessed or thought I did was a disk shaped object with illuminated window panels and blinking red and blue lights on the outer edge of the object traveling east. At first I thought it to be a blimp traveling west to east or an advertising plane - I had also seen these at night. What struck me as strange was the speed, sort of a slow deliberate and perpendicular path that was too straight. I witnessed this and thought the distance to be at least a half mile away which would make the object huge. From my vantage point the object moved slowly and did not produce the jet sounds that I could make out from that distance that airplanes usually made. I still thought it was a single blimp until it reached the far eastern edge of my view and another similar object entered my view from the east but moving in a gyroscopic fashion - at the same plane of the horizon and perpendicular direction. I became excited as the first object stopped dead still and seemed to wait as the second object approached from the west. It was too much for me to believe and I watched for several minutes (about three) before I left the window to get some water and regroup. I returned to the window and to my surprise both of the objects had left the area, I remained watching for a long time but did not see them again. This has been bugging me for over 25 years, want to know for sure.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate.

This light was stationary and what appeared to be a tube of light began decending towards the ground.  It took approximately 10 minutes to reach the ground and the tube was visible from the light above the trees to the ground and could be described as an elevator shaft.  After the 10 minutes or so it began to ascend again towards the bright light in the sky, just as if the elevator was returning to the top of the shaft.  the tube of light began to disappear from the ground traveling upwards toward the bright light in the sky.  This tube seemed to be about 10 to 20 feet in diameter.  When the lighted tube collapsed at the bright light at top, a very large cloud of steam or smoke appeared and began drifting south west at about 5-10 miles per hour.  We had all gotten out of the car to observe this and returned to the car and followed this cloud for about 5-7 miles where we saw a sheriffs car with two deputies standing beside the can.  We stopped and asked if they had seen the same as we and they replied that they had seen the drifting smoke and were looking for the source.

I had watched it for a minute, not thinking much about it as I was listening to my walkman in the family van. I could look away, and it would still be there, and still slowly moving. It was very close the buildings and looked very odd and somewhat dangerous. I would cirlcle around the buildings not changing much in elevation, just 3/4 of the way up and sometimes higher. I found out much later there is an airport nearby, but it doesn&apos;t explain a disc shaped craft moving 1-5 mph 20 ft from the buildings for 3-4 minutes. The craft would move behind one of the buildings and be only partially visible, but circle around another building and become visible again. As we got to the end of the highway, I was excited to get a closer look and find out what it was and why it was so close to the buildings. It started to move behind a building again and became totally hidden behind a building, and I never saw it again. No sound or exhaust trail. I looked out every window of the van and it was nowhere to be seen. The three other passengers did NOT see it so of course when I told them about it I was not believed and teased about it. Oh well.

Tonight (04 May &apos;02 around 10:15 p.m.) I was sitting outside since there was nothing overly interesting on TV.  I was watching one of the many of what I assume to be satellites go thru the night sky.  One in particular caught my attention because it seemed much brighter than the rest.  I watched it for maybe 15 seconds or so pass almost directly overhead going south to north. My attention was distracted from it for a couple of seconds by a loud pickup leaving the intersection just to my east going east.  I reached over to the small concrete step for my pack of cigarettes.  I found them quickly because of the moonlight and then it hit me that I couldn&apos;t even see the moon from where I was sitting.  I looked up and there was a really bright light almost directly overhead.  Kind of like the light coming from a full moon.  The only sound I remember hearing was the normal non stop barking of the neighbors dog and myself saying &quot;OH SH**!&quot;.

I&apos;m kind of freaked out from it all and I loaded every gun in the house but there is a about an hour or so I don&apos;t have a clue what went on.

What&apos;s that!&quot;  I noticed he was looking up into the sky.  I looked up also and saw approximately seven points of light moving from south to north.  We were facing toward the east.  The points of light, as I call them, were red in color and did not blink.  Although clearly visible, they did appear to be quite distant.  As compared to a satellite visible at night, these lights (as a whole group) moved somewhat faster and were easier to see (brighter although not as bright as airplane lights).  These points of light were moving together as a group, however the distance between each one was constantly changing.  There was no set formation.  One light would move forward, another would move back.  One would move from one side and another to the other side.  They did not move one at a time either.  Two or three would be displaying this characteristic at the same time.  I was not able to determine any rhythmic pattern to their movement.  Generally, they were all travelling to the north, however each seemed to have a &quot;mind of it&apos;s own&quot; by switching places with another.

I was driving at the time, heading south, and was on a road with very little traffic, so I could speed up and try to get closer to it.  I sped up to try to get closer and it appeared to be slowing down.  I kept watching it and when I became parallel to it I pulled over and turned off my car.  The lights were coming from the back of the craft and there were no lights on the front.  There was a less bright light above the two, creating a triangle of three lights.  It was making some noise and the closest thing I could compare the noise to was a high pitch radio frequency.  I watched it briefly and after about 60 seconds it slowed almost to a stop. It began to go straight up and turn directly around and went towards the north again.  I tried to follow it again and it quickly drifted to the west and I no longer could see it.I, the observer, have never previously seen any objects I believe to be ufos first hand.

It still maintained its pattern of movement; slightly vertical and slightly horizontal, and would periodically flash blue and red.

He was one of the eyewitnesses who saw the UFO and was also the radar operator who actually tracked it.  He explained the situation as follows:  The Sebago was conducting an Ocean Station Patrol in an area near Bermuda.  As was common practice during the late night hours, the ship&apos;s engines were stopped but still on-line and the vessel was merely drifting in the open ocean.  Around 2 or 3am a lighted object was spotted low in the sky off the starboard beam at a distance of only a mile or so.  It also showed up on the air search radar as being stationary.  At this time there were several watch personnel on the bridge, including the Officer of the Deck.  They watched the object for several minutes before it started moving slowly in a circular pattern around the ship.  When it reached the starting point it suddenly headed away from the ship at a rate of speed which was beyond the capability of the radar to measure.

As I drove on northward on highway 174 towards my friend&apos;s house in Joshua, I noticed that this huge light was not getting larger-or smaller-as at first-I thought it to have been a low flying private airplane of some sort (Note: commercial jet airliners would not be found in this part of the sky-as they are always heading north of Cleburne to the west of town-then they bank to the east towards the Dallas/Fort Worth airport, and if they are departing D/FW airport and heading south towards Austin or Houston: they fly to the far east of Cleburne-but in either case: they never fly directly over Cleburne).Just as I realized that this huge light could not have been an airplane-as it was devoid of &apos;belly lights&apos; and &apos;wing-tip&apos; lights; the softly glowing light blinked out.As I drove on-now out of the city limits-driving up the bridge (over-pass) that crosses over the railroad tracks (Cleburne is a &apos;hub&apos; for the railroads) at about 50 feet above the ground-but high enough to see clearly-suddenly, there appeared &apos;colored&apos; lights all about the object-so many-that it took my breath away.Having been a Veteran of the war in Vietnam-and having also worked my first job back from the war at Delta Airlines: I certainly know the placement of &apos;ID&apos; lights on airplanes, helicopters and all &apos;known&apos; earthly aircraft. These lights were nothing at all like standard aircraft lighting.There were just too many of them of too many different colors.I drove on as the mileage grew in approaching this object, which was heading in my direction (its path would have been to the due south) just to my left, or to the west of me. It was huge. I compared it immediately to the Super Dome in New Orleans, or about 400 to 500 feet across (or roughly,166 yards) and about 200 to 300 feet in height, based upon the placement of these mentioned outwardly seen lights.As for these &apos;lights&apos;: there were three (3) small blinking lights on top at &apos;dead center,&apos; which were, from top to bottom, red, soft yellow and white.All were blinking in an odd pattern of off and on, very swiftly. They were evenly stacked atop of each other.Below these &apos;center&apos; lights: the area underneath was completely dark to my vision, yet obviously, solid in nature, since the lights were certainly &apos;fixed.&apos; Outwardly from the &apos;center&apos; to either &apos;end&apos;: the distance was amazing at several hundred feet. I judged the distance between this object and me to have been about two (2) miles. The lights at either &apos;end&apos; were solid, softly lit and multi-colored-yet larger in size than the &apos;center top&apos; lights.Some were blinking-some were not. They were placed in a very odd fashion with no reasoning-as they were staggered in placement.There were about 4 to 5 lights at either &apos;end&apos; of the object.To the &apos;bottom side&apos;: these lights were the oddest, as otherwise, &apos;belly lights&apos; of normally &apos;known&apos; aircraft have a single red blinking light-with white and either red or blue &apos;wing&apos; lights found latterly. These &apos;bottom&apos; lights were strung out all along the bottom, making, again; no known pattern or reasoning to their placement. They, too, were multi-colored and were all of the same &apos;brightness,&apos; which was not so bright as to have been difficult to look at.As I approached it--and it was approaching me; I decided to pull over to the shoulder of the road and to stop, which I did. By now, the huge object was almost even with my car to my left, or, I was looking to the western sky. It was now completely obvious that this object was no more than 1, 000 feet off of the ground-and VERY huge! I turned off the car engine and stuck my head out of the driver&apos;s side window-to listen for any noise, which may have been emitting from the object.There were NO SOUNDS whatsoever. The huge object was traveling so slowly, that if it had of been a &apos;known&apos; aircraft: it would have fallen from the sky.I watched in pure and total amazement, as the object just glided by me-within one (1) mile from my position.I was speechless-within the quiet of my car and on this part of the country highway that I know so well. This was just outside of the city limits where there are only a few farm houses spread out in the area-with patches of remote woods to my left and right sides as well as to the front, or north of where I was. (See &apos;Drawing&apos; of the object attached).The huge object glided on by not making a sound-not making an effort to turn, climb, ascend nor descend, as I watched it and etched the size and its likely shape within my awe-struck mind. Regrettably, I had no camcorder, nor still picture camera to record this.It continued on its course to the due south-and drifted further away. It was still within my sight as I started the engine of the car-and drove away.I was very calm, having seen, witnessed and videotaped UFOs several times in my past life-proving ALL to have been &apos;unknown&apos; aircraft--beyond a shadow of a doubt.For more information on me and these former sightings, please see: http://jasonleigh.org for the Reports and documents of proof.I affirm that the above details of this amazing &apos;sighting&apos; of a huge UFO on Thursday evening, March 14, 2002, is a true accounting-to the best of my ability.Jason Leigh((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Mr. Jason Leigh, from Cleburne, TX, for submitting the report.

We live at the top of the interbay peninsula within Tampa Bay, of which at the foot is MacDill AFB. We regularly see airliners on approach to TIA, and tankers on approach to MacDill. This object was straight above the peninsula, heading West. At first it looked like a silver Mylar balloon, but to be that big, it would have to been very close. A balloon nearby is buffeted by air currents. This was flying in a straight line, at a steady pace. It did not have contrails. It looked like a one-foot wide Mylar balloon at 1,000 feet cruising at 100 mph. We are good at spotting different airliners, tankers, and other aircraft night and day. In the day you can see the silver cylinder of a jet. This was a wide round silver object.I wish I could be more specific. It was only visible for a brief while, and at first was difficult to notice as my girlfriend was pointing it out. She saw it only because she was looking at the moon. If it was large, it was very high up, and moving fast, but not too fast to watch.As for backgrounds, she is an ((profession deleted--financial)); I am in graduate school at the University of ((deleted)) ((deleted--pertains to space exploration and astronautics)).

To my surprise I saw some odd looking lights moving from more or less Northwest to Southeast. I opened the window to get a better look and was astounded! It&apos;s confusing to me because I&apos;m still not exactly sure if I was looking at a single craft of multiple craft. What I saw was several blue white lights evenly spaced in a crescent shape, and an odd fuzzy looking larger light or multiple lights. That was odd as well. I was facing West at the time and the larger light may have been some kind of light in the center of a circular craft. It was a different color than the other lights, and was a little farther to the West, and may have been at the center of a craft. At first I thought I was looking at about 20 craft, but now I think it may have been one very large craft. I grabbed my binocs and ran out to the front yard to try to get a better look, but was having trouble getting the binoculars focused, and there is a kind of haze in the sky tonight, so I didn&apos;t get to view it long. I could see it south of here, but it faded into the night sky rather quickly. This thing was making no sound at all. I can hear jets and smaller craft very well when they are headed into the airport at PDX, which is only about a mile or so from here &quot;as the crow flies&quot;. I think the lights in the crescent may have been on the edge of one single craft. It was low in the sky, and if you held your arm out and hands about a foot apart that would be about the distance from the first light to the last. They didn&apos;t seem to be much brighter than an average star. I don&apos;t know what else to tell you about this one. I&apos;m the only one home tonight so, I have no other witnesses.

The object seems to have between 30 and 40 meters (or more) diameter, and was following our airplane (Piper Cheyenne III) in such a way that we did not see it during the flight. It camouflaged itself pretty well it seems.Maybe &quot;they&quot; wanted us to record them in our pictures, a great mystery.  You are invited to come to our office in Lima to see the video and a 1280x1024 digital photo where the craft appears.  Or you can make us an offer to have us email the proofs to you.

She had just picked me up from work and it was about 11:30 PM. We had pulled over for a few minutes to talk  and to switch seats as she said she didn&apos;t feel like driving. While we were talking she pointed out in front of the car and said &quot;Look at that.&quot; There were 3 white lights in a perfect triangle formation straight out ahead of us and just above the tree-tops. The trees are I&apos;d say no more than 1/8th of a mile straight out from our location. At first they looked like very bright stars and other than being in a perfect triangle didn&apos;t look much out of the ordinary. Then the light that was on the lower right of the formation began performing some very radical movements. It would do 2 or 3 short tight loops and then shoot straight up or down and then back into formation. It was one of the strangest things I had ever seen. Very fast movements. This went on for a few moments and then the whole formation began to move slowly in our general direction. My ex-wife was a little scared at this point and I was beginning to feel the same. I decided to start the car and head toward Xenia. I did a U-turn in the road and accelerated heavily. A few seconds later my wife became hysterical and grabbed on to me. She said &quot;Oh my god it&apos;s behind us&quot;. I looked up in the rear-view and there it was. From what I could tell it just looked like a very very bright spotlight with what looked like 2 smaller lights right and left of it. I remember seeing a bit of orange around the edges and a glowing green on the bottom. Thats the best I can describe it. It appeared that it was extremely close behind us. I did notice that the ground ahead of our car was lit up as well. At one point the light seemed to be swinging like a pendulum in an arc while chasing us. I was truly horrified. I didn&apos;t even notice that we had reached the end of the road where it &quot;T&apos;s&quot; into another road. I hit the brakes just a! bout whe n we were passing the stopsign and we went off the road into a large field. The ground was very dry and there wasn&apos;t much of a ditch between the road and the field so I was able to get the car back up onto the road easily. We weren&apos;t hurt and the car had only very minor damage. Once we got back onto the road I noticed the light was gone. It was a very scary thing and my ex-wife still doesn&apos;t like to talk about it. It took her days to recover emotionally from the incident. We told very few people about it, however I did report this to a UFO researcher in Cincinatti sometime in 1999. He sent me an email informing me that my report was one of SEVERAL describing the same type of craft and incident in our area in the summer of 1993. Seems we were not alone in this. If any of you out there have any knowledge of these events I would like to talk to you. j_dog25@mindspring.com From what I could tell the objects made no sound. The light emitted did not look &quot;normal&quot; it was very pure much like L.E.D. light. At first sighting the objects were about the size of normal bright stars in the night sky. The one that appeared close to us in the rear view mirror took up about 1/3 of the rear-view mirror&apos;s area. The car did not seem to be affected by the objects in any way.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I walked out into the yard for a better view and didn&apos;t feel fearful since &quot;it&quot; was flying away from me in a southwest/northeast direction at approximately 35-40 mph.  The light was a flat type with no projection.  Perhaps the strangest thing I noticed, in addition to the whole senario, was the absence of any sound.  I didn&apos;t see any structure around the lights but they were in a triangular/delta pattern.  I watched it until it disappeared, then went into the house and called my boyfriend who lived 1-2 miles away in the direction that the ufo was traveling.  He looked out but saw nothing.  For a day or two, I watched the newspaper for any other reported sightings, but saw none.

We were on the interstate and several cars were slamming on their brakes and swerving, obviously they were seeing what we were seeing.  As the sun continued to set and into the darkness we could see 5-9 lights that looked like they may be planets in a line above the horizon and below the cloud thing that would be in a straight line and then move to a triangular shape and back to a line.

It was obviously many miles away on the horizon but it didn&apos;t disappear until we got into the mountains around Hoover Dam.....Very strange...Don&apos;t know if anyone else has reported it but we would like to know what it was we saw that night!!!!

Nobody believes us!", "While driving on the highway one night, I drove right underneath a saucer shaped UFO hovering about 75 feet above the road.I&apos;ve seen UFO&apos;s three times in my life.  Once during the daytime when I was twelve, and two more night-time sightings as an adult.  This isn&apos;t counting strange lights or something you&apos;re just not sure of, these are actual craft that I could see clearly.  Anyway, my most memorable encounter happened on the night of February 4, 1996 at about 11:00 at night.  At the time I was living in Brandon, Manitoba but the man I was seeing (now my husband) lived in Winnipeg, which is where I live now.  As he had two small children from a previous relationship that were with him every weekend, it was much easier for me to make the trip in by myself than for him to come out to see me and bring the kids with him (they were two and three at the time).  So every Friday night I would drive into Winnipeg and return home Sunday night, usually leaving around 9:00.  I would invariably be tired and anxious to get home, so the lights at the Carberry intersection at Highway 5 on the #1 was always a real landmark that I watched for because it meant I only had half an hour left before I was home.  I was always glad to see the lights at that intersection as I approached it.On this particular night it was quite cold and I had left Winnipeg a little later than usual.  After checking my watch and doing some calculations I was thinking that by the time I hit the intersection it would be pretty much exactly 11:00 which meant I would be home by 11:30.  Having driven this stretch of highway so often I knew exactly when to expect to see the Carberry lights.  As they came into view, I noticed that there were two other lights hovering just above the streetlights.  I kept watching these lights as I drove and they didn&apos;t move at all, up or down or side to side.  From the time I first saw the lights to the time I reached the intersection was about 7 km.  As I got closer and closer I could tell that these lights were hovering immediately above the streetlights, I&apos;d say 10-15 feet above them.  Let&apos;s say that the poles are 60 feet and the UFO was 15 feet above that, that would make it about 75 feet off the ground - pretty darn close! As I approached the intersection, I could see the thing that was making the lights was on the other side of the streetlights, so I couldn&apos;t really see anything more than a dark saucer sharp as I drove through the intersection because I couldn&apos;t see past the glare of the streetlights.  It wasn&apos;t until I was completely through could I look up and clearly see the UFO.  I was driving in the passing lane because as I was coming up to the intersection there was a white van in the right hand lane that wasn&apos;t travelling quite as fast as I was, so I was in the left lane going around it.  We were travelling pretty close together as we passed through the intersection, so I know someone else had to have seen this.I was looking at this thing the entire time as I got closer to it.  As I got past the glare, it suddenly came into very sharp view.  I was driving directly underneath it, it was right above me!  I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing!  It was round and flat.  I couldn&apos;t really see the top of it, but the bottom was very clear.  The two lights that I had seen were different colours, but I honestly can&apos;t remember what they were now, it&apos;s been too long.  Blue and white, maybe.  Anyway, there was a third light as well on the bottom of this thing (this one was red, I think), which is where the first two were - on the bottom of the craft.  I remember thinking at the time that the thing must have been tilted towards the west and that was why I hadn&apos;t seen the third light until then.  I saw two other vehicles on the other side of the highway headed east towards Winnipeg and thought that they must have seen three lights as they approached from the other direction instead of two as I had.  It was hovering over the left side of the highway, not in the middle, so my car drove directly underneath.  I looked up at it and thought how it looked just like something out of a movie.  It was metallic, dark but shiny, reflecting the lights from below.  It was covered with what looked like machinery of some sort, all curvy tubes and pipes, all over the bottom of it except around the edge.  It was somewhere around 35 feet across and I did not hear any noise emanating from it at all (over the road noise, of course).  It was only about 75 feet off the ground so I got a really good, close look at it.I have wished heartily ever since that I had pulled over for a better look, but I didn&apos;t.  First, it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 7:00 the next day so I really wanted to get home to bed.  Secondly, it was the middle of winter and it was, as I mentioned earlier, fairly cold.  Also, I was by myself.  If I had been with someone else I probably would have been braver.  And I was in the passing lane - you can&apos;t stop on the shoulder of the passing lane.Anyway, that&apos;s what I saw that night.  I did arrive home at 11:30, so there was no weird time loss or anything like that.  I&apos;d be interested to know if anyone else reported seeing anything there that night.", "Road sightingThe object flew over the car, the was a bright light and i woke up 10 min later to see 3 object, flashing and leaving a long reed trail going over a hill top to the direct front of me.

At one point the base was on alert and the flight line was shut down.  You have a report from another person in your files who has reported this sighting.  The lights were photographed from high buildings in Clovis and appeared on the front page of the Clovis news paper.  Being assigned to the flight line in support of F-111s several of my people reported near encounters with the lights (ufos and were visably shaken by the experience.  There was also the experience at Holloman AFB in 1967 when aircraft were launched to intercept lights over Alamogordo, NM.  The official report was that the lights were aircraft dropping flares.  This is a bunch of crap as Lincoln National Forest was on high fire danger at the time.  Having talked with at least one pilot who confirmed that they tried to chase the (UFOS) but never got close, I know that a lot of people in the USAF have had their experiences.  Some will talk and some won&apos;t.  These are but 2 of the numerous sightings I have witnessed.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At the time of my encounter, though, I was a columnist and editor, so I like to believe that, given my educational background and exposure to the public, I am not one prone to delusions, misinterpretations or any type of need for acclaim. It was a cold winter evening. The bus had just dropped me off near the corner of Guelph Line and Upper Middle Road. Before me lay perhaps two acres of school property that I needed to cross in order to reach home. While walking across the field, partly covered in snow, I noticed a chevron-shaped object silently hovering perhaps 500 feet overhead. Rather than immediately wondering what the object could be, I wondered how anything could hover, since the winds were quite fierce from west to east. Focusing my eyes on the object, I couldn&apos;t make out its true shape, given that the object was obscured by the thick snow clouds racing past. Yet a series of red and blue lights along its bottom ran in the shape of a chevron, so I could only assume that the craft was the same shape. I watched the object hover for perhaps a minute, and then it slowly began moving northward while retaining its altitude. I don&apos;t know why, but I began running after it, yet it slowly moved away. Pausing just south of Dundas Street and Guelph Line, the object then moved slowly westward before disappearing amid the clouds. Afterward, for all of the running that I&apos;d done in the cold, and for all of the deep gulps of air that I&apos;d taken in my exertions, I came down with a severe cold and had to spend a few days sick in bed. This is the first that I&apos;ve spoken of the incident since it happened, and I don&apos;t know why I waited so long.

I STARED STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR. FINALLY, I FOCUSED MY EYES ON &quot;SOMETHING , that was WAY - WAY - UP THERE. IF I had to guess, I would say , at least 15,000 ft. (now that I have flown , many times in a small airplane.)I could not believe what I was seeing. Confused , I ran down the street, yelling, &quot;WHAT IS THAT ? WHAT IS THAT ?&quot; NO one seemed to listen to me ?? I couldnt figure out WHY ?LATER when I thought about It , I would QUICKLEY , CONVINCE MYSELF THAT NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE ME.WHAT I SAW, WAS almost the SAME THING THAT THE MOVIE &quot; INDEPENDENCE DAY &quot; had in it.UNBELIEVABLE, ISNT IT . I ALMOT FAINTED , WHEN I SAW THAT MOVIE, BROUGHT BACK BAD MEMORIES.  SEE ,THAT IS WHY I KNEW NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD . YOU MOST LIKELY DONT BELIEVE ME , AS AN ADULT....IT wasPEUTER&quot; in color. HUGE, HUGE &lt; HUGE &gt;THE clouds were rolling very fast &amp; the edges would show here, &amp; there ,until I had a comlete picture of the COMPLETE SIZE &quot;  I ALWAYS  THOUGHT I WAS NOT SUPOSED TO TALK ABOUT IT ,  SO I DIDNT .. I COULDNT SEE ANY &quot;DETAIL&quot; ON IT . IT had to be several &quot;MILES&quot; ACROSS .IT COVER THE WHOLE SKY. OVER RICHMOND..((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

PD))", "At 10 PM my wife observed a light in the southwestern sky that was odd because it was moving erratically. I joined her on the deck and saw a red and green light that were close together. I assumed it was an airplane, but it suddenly made a sharp movement to the side, then an up and movement. Now the side to side movement could resemble a very wide winged plane with the wing lights flashing alternatly. But this didn&apos;t explain the up and down movement. Also the light stayed in the same place, every so often jerking to one side or the other or up and down. I looked around and observed an identical light in the western sky with the same movements. We watched for about 1/2 hour and they stayed in the same position. My wife went to bed and I continued to read. At a little after 11 PM I went out to check and the light in the southwest was gone, but the western one was in the same position and still jerking around. I got my binoculars, hoping to see more but the light just was sharper. As I was watching two more of the same type lights appeared in the northwestern sky. These acted the same but also blinked off and then on every so often. After about another 1/2 hour these two lights suddenly moved at an extremely fast speed toward the western light and when they neared it they disappeared. Now these two lights seemed smaller or further away. When I went to bed an hour later the west light was still there. I can think of no logical explanation. All the light were red and green and seemed to be very close together.", "Drove up to downed ship.I was driving down an unlined country road with a friend.  I started to experience static on my radio and slowed as I attempted to adjust it.  My car cut off in the middle of the street and I was unable to get it started again.  I noticed outside the drivers window a circle of light on the ground on the ground in a field next to the road.  I said to my passenger, &quot;I don&apos;t remember there being a water tower here?&quot; and when I looked again I noticed that this watertower had no legs.  The next thing I noticed was that there was no sounds.  This was especially odd as we were next to a small lake and dam where the water could be heard almost all the time.  There was no cricket or frog noices.  It was the loudest quite I had ever heard.  My friend became hysterically screaming and pounding on the dashboard of my car saying &quot;Let&apos;s get out of here!&quot;  Then I was compelled to get out of the car.  I remember thinking to myself that this was incredible and I wanted to remember it.  There was an old fence around the field that had some vine type growth on it and although I don&apos;t recall crossing it, I remember standing very near to the circle of light on the ground and noticing that the hairs on my arms were standing up and I was not cold.  I also noticed that there was no filteration of light from its source to the ground.  I could look across the circle of light into the woods at the edge of the field and it would appear as if no light was around.  There was no spreading of the light.  I wanted to remember this.  I looked up into the light source and saw what appeared to be a circler light the size of the stars in the sky.  However, it was only about 50 feet off the ground and the other stars seem to only be visible in a circle around the object, which was black as the sky, approximatley 50 feet from the center.  The light source had a 50 feet diameter length of blackness the same color as the sky around it and then you could see the other stars in the sky, so the craft was vertually invisible.  I looked over at my! friend, who was perfectly still in a pose that looked as if she stopped in mid stride of hitting the dashboard of the car.   I looked back and noticed grooves on the underside of the craft along with what appeared to be a flag and symbols and then the crafts light went out or it shot straight up until it looked exactly like its surrounding stars, no blackness around it any longer that was unusal compared to its neighboring stars anyway.  Then the star did a criss cross toward the north until I could no longer see it.  I was very excited about it and wanted to discuss it when we got home.  However, my passenger was unable to stay awake and two hours had passed that only seemed like a few minutes.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was on the west side of town driving east. Suddenly, dead ahead, I witnessed a red flat glowing disc, approximately 1 cm at arms length, race north across the visible sky towards Mission. Since Abbotsford is home to an international airport I was used to seeing and hearing many types of aircraft at many different alltitudes in under different conditions. I estimated it&apos;s altitude to be 250 feet, and it&apos;s speed at about 700 miles per hour. I instantly slammed on the breaks, stopped the engine, and got out of the car as quickly as l could, to catch the sound of crafts engines. There was no sound however. Abbotsford is situated in a valley surrounded by mountains. That is how I managed to gauge it&apos;s speed and alltitude.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We walked out to the truck after dark &amp; obout 1 mile away in the sky was a light formation that was just hovering.  I was studying the solar system in class so I was always interested in the sky &amp; stars.  As we drove closer, the formation still hovering became more apparant that it wasnt a regular aircraft.  My dad thought it was a helicopter but once we were directly under the formation we stopped the truck &amp; turned off the engine.  This is in the middle of the country so no sounds of cars or trucks could be heard.  We listened....dead silence.  Then the formation took off at a very smooth yet fast pace &amp; flew up &amp; away in the sky.  It then was gone. I have thought of this experience every since.  I truly beleive what I saw was a UFO.  I have had no other experiences yet, but I do look forward to the next time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The day before I had escaped from the reformatory at Gatesville,Texas. I had gone through Clifton because I had reletives that lived there and was seeking help from them. They did not aid me of course so I walked on out of town trying to keep out of sight of the law. shortly after the sun came up I came into a small fishing community not far from Lake Whitney.Ther was a car there that had the keys in it setting along side of the road in front of one of the houses. Being on the run I stole it and headed out of town. When I felt I was clear I checked out the inside of the car and noticed I had three quarters of a tank of gas. The car also had a clock which I also noticed was running and showed at that time a quarter past six. The two things I mentioned helped me to realize that there was a time lapse that I could account for but that is getting to far ahead yet. I do not know where I was exactly but I had driven for about two hours and Ihad just looked at the clock and the gas gauge. The clock read 8:30 and the gas gauge showed a little less than half a tank. When I looked up from the dash, there was this bright light that actually hurt my eyes. when my eyes focused on the road there was a model &quot;A&quot; Ford truck with wooden side rails on it in front of me. It was green and looked new. There were two people rideing in it that I could see from the back window. The truck started slowing down and the driver gave the signal to turn left by sticking his hand out of the window. I slowed down but then that flash thing happened again. I was looking out of my right window to see where the truck had turned and there was no truck. There was no road there either. The sound of the truck had gone as well but I had heard it only moments before. I checked the rearview mirror and saw nothing. I was startled by this and looked at the clock to make sure I had not fallen asleep. The clock read ten fifteen. I looked at the gas guage. It was a little past half just like befor! e. I tap ped the guage but the needle stayed where it was. I had never heard of abduction or anything like that but could not figure out what had happened back then. I still cannot. I drove that car till it ran out of gas and didn&apos;t see another car or anyone for the rest of that day along that road.

A minute or two later one of the objects approached from the west and flew directly over our car which was pulled over to the side of the road. There was no noise at all. This was about 9:00 PM. The object then came to a complete stop about 200-300 yards east of us and started to descend. It hovered for a few minutes maybe only 500-1000 feet altitude. It then ascended and flew off. We could not chase it anymore since there were no roads east of us.Had many more sighting between 1973-1976 in the Milwaukee area.

I also do not know if airliners from Europe on route to SA fly over Bridgetown airport as a checkpoint.Contrail was short, uneven and evaporated quickly and stretched about 10 or 15 lenghts behind object and seemed to be uneven with apparent bubbles as if using pulses.Of course I had no camera and the event was so fast, I wouldn&apos;t have been able to focus it fast enough.I estimate body length to width ratio of 5:1 to 10:1.I am sending this from back home after the end of my vacation.Image is clear as a bell in my mind.

It looked like a star/planet except it was about 3 times the brightness of jupiter and it was facing north. I immediatley knew this was not a star.&gt;From my upstairs window i have a great view of the sky over Charlotte facing north towards downtown. I can see about half of the sky including the buildings downtown. The light hovered just above the trees for about a minute. It appeared to be about 2 miles away from me. After about a minute the light started to drift a little to the right and then a little to the left. I lined my eyes up with the crosshairs in the window to make sure i wasn&apos;t seeing things. I wasn&apos;t. After drifting further to the left the light abruptly turned and sped off towards downtown. It passed behind the Bank of America (BOA) building a flew off out of sight. As it was moving away from me I noticed a small red light behind the light.I was astonished at how fast this light moved across the city. I spend a lot of time watching planes and helicopters fly around the city and I have never seen anything cover that much distance in so short of time. I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to convince myself that I saw a helicopter that was hovering with a spotlight on and then speed away very quickly. The only problem is the math. It took the light approx. 5-10 seconds to go from the spot where it was hovering to behind the BOA building. Taking the angle that i saw the light from my window and drawing a line out across the city, the closest point from that line to the BOA builind is 1.75 miles (this is best case scenario. i think the distance was more like 3.5 but i am taking the closest possible distance). 1.75 miles in 10 seconds is 630 miles per hour. That is again using the best case scenario (at 3.5 miles the speed is 1260). I am not aware of any helicopter that can go 630 miles per hour from a dead stop. Also the helicopters i have seen flying around have 2 blueish/white lights on the back not a small red light. I also did not hear a sound from the light. I can usually hear planes and helicopters all the way to downtown.I have no idea what i saw but it&apos;s not anything i can explain using rational logic.

The object seemed to be at the height of about 100 storied building. The object was illuminated ( same as tubelight). When i saw it it started moving towards front-left dirction off the road in parabolic trgectory. Within 10 secs. it vanished behind one building. I was aware that the building next to this building was demonished by muncipal corporation and that is why i started running expecting that i can still see this object through the gap. but i did not had to run much and by the time i reached to my class place the object once again came on the road (front-towards the center of the road again in parabolic tragectory). When it reached at the center of the road, i thought of showing this object to 3/4 boys near my class. But the light in the object suddenly went off exactly when i thought of doing so.

I was somewhere between Gray Mountain and the Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, when I witnessed a very strange light to my right in the dusk sky that looked like some sort of flying aircraft, but I couldn&apos;t really see anything of the craft except an very bright light being emitted from its underside, down in a beam like pattern for perhaps 100 feet, although it is very difficult to judge distances in the sky.  It was not completely dark yet, but the light was certainly bright enough to stand out much more than any faint stars in the distance.  I would estimate the object to be a few thousand feet high, and to the south of the object a mountain peak in the distance gave some sense of depth and height perception.  I was driving about 80 miles per hour and the area is quite flat as you head back to Flagstaff, and I studied the object for about 20 seconds, while trying to determine whether it was a plane or some sort of hovering helicopter.  I thought perhaps the craft was heading back to the Grand Canyon Airport, but it didn&apos;t seem to be moving at all.On the horizon, out where the Grand Canyon airport could be, maybe 60-80 miles away, I could see a blinking light that most definitely an airplane off in the distance.  It occurred to me that as I looked at this craft, it looked surprisingly enough just like a &quot;flying saucer&quot; would if it were hovering and just emitting a large beam of light from its underside.  The beam spread out from the bottom of the object in a solid ray pattern, and I realized that I should take a picture of it with my digital camera.  As I began to slow down the car, which took about 20 seconds, there were some trees on the side of the highway that kept interrupting my view of the craft slightly.  As I was pulling past the sparsely populated stand of trees I could see that the light was beginning to rise slightly in the sky and a cloudy material was beginning to surround it.  In less that 10 seconds, the light rose probably several hundred feet, and as it did the cloudiness, or smoke, or whatever enveloped it.  Before I even got my camara turned on, it just disappeared in the smoke, the light was gone, and I couldn&apos;t see anything else in the twilight, except still the blinking light of an airplane very far in the distance on the horizon.  I sat there mesmerized for a couple of minutes, trying desperately to see something else, but could see nothing, and then I was trying to determine if the cloudiness around the ship was really clouds or not.  There were a few clouds in the distance, but none at all in that area of the sky.  While I watched, the foggy sort of cloudiness eventually dissepated, within about five minutes it was gone and the area where the craft had been was clear and open sky.I was very dissapointed that I didn&apos;t get a picture of it, I&apos;m not really sure what I saw, but it was definitely not any sort of flying object I&apos;d ever seen.  I told my fiancee Lorie about it that night, and she didn&apos;t really know what to think about it.  I have been very hesitant to submit this report, and was actually waiting for a while to see if anyone else reported seeing the object on the same night.  I felt that I should at least give an account of what I saw in case anyone else witnessed it.  I have no explanation for how it vanished, and I admit that it sounds very skeptical that it disappeared before I could even get a picture of it, but as God is my witness, this is a true account of my experience on that night.  I am a chiropractor in Ontario, Canada, and was actually on a trip to look at offices for sale because I will be relocating to the western United States this year.

I thought that this was probably an illusion because of the motion of my vehicle. I continued to watch the object however. On getting closer to my house, I saw another one of these objects. This one was closer. I could make out 3 blinking lights, that seemed to blink in a pattern. This object did not appear to fly eratically, but the blinking of the lights appeared almost in a revolving motion. In addition, flying lower than this object, looked to be a slow moving passenger plane. It had the front white headlights of an airplane. All of a sudden, the white headlights turned off and the object was blinking red lights.I finally got to my house and it was 3 o&apos;clock in the morning. I was extremely hopeful I could get a good look at one of these objects on the ground. Then off in the distance I saw a slow moving object with two white headlights coming toward me.Again, it appeared to be a plane, moving at a set flight path. The object dropped altitude and continued to come closer. Once it got closer, the object appeared to turn, but it did not turn at an angle like a plane. It appeared to make a horizontal right turn. At the instant it made the turn, the white lights shut off and red blinking lights came on. I made out 4 red blinking lights. The object flew low and parallel to my house. As it flew by it made sort of a quiet droning noise. Hard to describe the noise because I&apos;ve never heard a plane make that monotonous sound before. I could not make out the outline or shape of the aircraft. I would estimate its size to be about that of a small jetliner (737), but again, that is hard to determine, based on the fact that the red lights were all blinking from the rear. The object never displayed both white and red lights congruently.This aircraft was very mysterious and interesting to watch. This is just speculation, but this aircraft seemed almost as if it was trying to simulate an airplane. That night, I saw 3 of these objects.

It was a beautiful day as the sun was shining and visibility was straight up (10,000ft ceiling maybe), and no cloud cover. We were sitting in traffic for oh, maybe 2 minutes when something just above a building across from us caught my eye. The distance, ground, was maybe 100 yards to the building, and vertically maybe 12 stories high. The sun wasn&apos;t shining in our eyes nor was there any glare to obscure our clear path of vision. This thing behaved like a living creature, it sat in the air just above this building and slowly rose and began to move horizontally over canal street. Immediately i asked my girlfriend to look and comment on what she thought it was (still sitting in traffic we had ample time to peep it). Her initial comment was that it was a string of black balloons floating carelessly in the air and rising upward, made sense to me judging it&apos;s appearance BUT balloons wouldn&apos;t behave like this thing did! This idea of it being balloons was dashed against the rocks due to it&apos;s size and nature....was maybe 45 feet in length and altered its shape Allow me to explain in bulleted points: 1. The object was hovering in place and changed direction a few times smoothly, against the breeze which was blowing. Did not react to wind direction or speed, as the wind would gust.2. Object was close enough to the street (like 100 feet) that it would be affected by same wind we were.3. Was jet black and appeared to be almost like a giant oarfish moving in the air in a twisting fashion. This thing had what seemed specific motions which were repeated over and over such as a sidewinder snake moves...deliberate and repetitive.4. Would stop, hover, twist, move, stop, hover, twist, move, etc. all the while changing shape from long and snakelike to rectangular and spherical.5. After floating and shape shifting above and around building (it wasnt tethered as the wind would whip it a certain way)it moved &quot;fast&quot; (maybe within 2 secinds time) the length of 3 blocks NE then stopped to begin its dance again. Then moved an opposite direction just as quickly and stopped.As it moved on it began to head due NE towards the east side and east river then ultimately dissappeared behind a large building maybe 6 blocks from my car, at this time it reached an altitude of maybe 350 feet then just vanished.

I was alone.  It caught my attention as unusual.  As I watched, it changed back into what appeared to be one star.  It wasn&apos;t as if the lights merged; it was as if some lights were shut off.  Next it appeared to be a regular, but bright star with a thin &quot;X&quot; light shine pattern coming out of it.  Went back to the &quot;ball&quot; shape.  An arm of light appeared to project off of it, making it look kind of like a long, thin arrow.  The light didn&apos;t appear to be projected, but again as if it were turned on.  A few times there appeared to be a gap between the arrow tail (the ball) and the shaft of the arrow.  It was moving in a northerly direction, but very, very slowly.  The &quot;arrow&quot; seemed to point easterly.  There was no noise, and the light appeared to be quite high up, but I don&apos;t know, as the light was all I could see (no outline of any shape).  The &quot;ball&quot; part of the light looked about the size and intensity of Venus in the night sky.  There was a very, very faint aura of light around the object.  I phoned my son to ask him to go view it, but he had company, he said it was probably a satellite, and he refused to go look.11:15 PM As at the first sighting, the look of this object wasn&apos;t constant; it changed.  A few times it appeared to project a very thin green &quot;X&quot; light pattern off of the ball of light.  The shaft of the arrow would appear and disappear.  At times there appeared to be a red light at the tip of the arrow.  At times it appeared to project thin green lights that gave it a diamond shape, with one tip of the diamond being at the &quot;ball&quot; and the other tip being at the end of the &quot;shaft&quot;.11:54 PM It appeared much the same as 11:15 PM.  It had moved higher in the sky (more easterly).  I could see it moving, but the movement was very slow.2:20 AM Still fluctuating between showing the different light patterns as described above, mostly appearing as a star-colored ball with a shaft of light from it.  It wasn&apos;t like a searchlight being projected, but like lights being turned on.  Still quite close to the same location as 11:54.3:10 AM The object had moved way off to the north and was quite a bit lower in the sky than at 11:35.  At this point the lights appeared to be pulsating.  The ball was red, and the shaft was green, then they would trade colors.  There didn&apos;t appear to be a set rhythm to the color changes.  After this, I went to bed.At each observance, I watched the object for approximately ten minutes, but it was close to 30 degrees on my front porch (facing west), so I couldn&apos;t stay outside long.At noon today there appear to be some &quot;clouds&quot; -- fanned con trails? -- that have strange patterns to them... then don&apos;t sweep straight across the sky like a con trail, but curve.

only to give some idea of there action because in actuality they were black box shapes moving back and forth as though searching the area.I mean black,everywhere they passed went black as coal.I can&apos;t explain it but thats what I was seeing.We quickly got back in the car and started it up no problem.R1 would not speak to me only stare out at the pond so I told her to watch the pond and I would carefully back out up the  road.I think I saw some color on her face because I stopped backing up and looked forward and realized something large and dark was rising above the mist and it had a red light on top of it.This light seemed fixed,not moving freely like the dark lights were.It&apos;s shape reminded me of a submarine but it was nearly as long as the whole pond and it was rising way to far from the water-I think I was seeing 2/3 of it and that was above the 8 foot wall of mist.The red light was facing forward on the vehicle(shining to our right) and slowly turned our direction as the whole thing began to turn towards us.I returned to the job at hand and carefully resumed my backing when something hit my side of the car hard enough to push us into the steep ditch I was trying to avoid.A return the following day to get the car out of the ditch revealed tire tracks that were proceding up the middle of the road then abruptly made a 90 degree slide sideways into the ditch some two feet or so yet there was no damage to the car.We were stuck in a steep ditch,no way to open the passenger door yet the next thing I remember was R1 standing outside the car reaching her hand to help me out.We were bathed in the red light.There was no sound.The object was no longer moving but was fully facing us some 20 yards away and I was petrified.When R1 helped me out of the vehicle I actually stopped to relieve myself before beating feet out of there.R1 is a large,strong woman and as hard as she was pulling I kept fighting to look back and the last I saw of it it was sitting on top of the mist staring directly at us.We moved up the main road back to our house as swiftly as we could but it became apparent that something was following us along the side of the road just inside the treeline and fear began to rise again.I remember nothing after that until we rounded the corner into our driveway on foot.We had arrived at the pond around midnight, watched three or four cycles and covered four or five miles it should not have been more than two or three am at most.It was in fact 7:30 am and the sun was up and the birds were chirping and R1 wasn&apos;t speaking to anyone not even to R2 who was impatiently waiting for us to return with her car.I explained what you just read and R1 only nodded at appropriate times to verify what I was telling her.R1 and I returned with a friend to pull the car out of the ditch (R1 would not again return to that place or let her kids swim there  for quite some time) and found the car as I stated and there was no sign of anything out of the ordinary.We searched the whole perimeter of the pond and saw not one thing that would help explain the happenings of the night before.R2 and I returned the next several nights to see many strange things,thankfully nothing to compare to the first in fact each night was completely different.What I can tell you is that we brought others there as witnesses that knew what had happened and on other nights we brought poeple that had no idea.R2 and I and one other person saw many strange events while all the others did not-some things going on within feet of us all.Each night before dark we swept the trails clean and set trip wires around the entire pond in hopes of foiling a hoax only to be denied the following morning.Some of the later events even had some audible traits-it really seemed to us that we were being toyed with and were completely helpless.I can&apos;t explain it,it is simply what I saw.It dramatically changed my life and I wish I could say it was entirely for the better but that would be untrue.You learn alot about your friends in situations like this.Some poeple simply cannot deal with things like this and that&apos;s a shame because that is when you need them most.You learn quickly to keep it to yourself.The most bizarre,the most overwhelming and unexplainable event in your life and you can&apos;t let it out.There is some tragedy in that as many of you know I&apos;m sure.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It went directly over.I had posted this at another site previously so this is an copy of that.It was the summer of 1981 I believe. Carnes, MS.(35 miles SW of Hattiesburg) About 8pm. My wife and I were walking around outside and talking. It was a clear cloudless night so I was looking at the stars. As we turned to go in I noticed it. It was coming from a West-North Westerly direction. It was moving at approximately 10-15 mph and maybe 10-15 ft above the pines. It was a 3 sided and I think a little longer than wide ( my wife says diamond shaped) with white lights spaced around the sides. Maybe 6 lights per side. Of course I was excited to see this and was making funny comments about being &quot;beamed up&quot; but my wife was terrified so I took her in and calmed her. As quickly as I could I went to the front door and looked in the direction the object should have gone. Seeing nothing I turned to go in and saw it (actually another like it) going back in the direction it had come but it was 1/4 mile north of where it should have been. As it went out of sight I turned to go in again and realized why it wasnt where I expected it to be. There was another (or the original) moving in a Northerly direction about 1/4 mile south-east of me. Just then it makes a turn (more like a stop and turn) back to the same direction it had come from in the beginning; about a 20 degree turn. As it turned the light at the front of the object got brighter, just as a flashlight seems to brighten as it sweeps past your face. This time I stayed outside and watched it, over my wifes objections. It went directly over my home, just above the tree tops, 10-15 mph and at no time did I hear any noise from it. Since it did go directly over my home I was able to estimate it to be about 60-70 ft wide and maybe 80-100 ft long. As close as it was, I could still not make out any other features. Except for the lights, it blended in with the darkness because of its color. It continued at the same speed and altitude till out of sight.

It appeared to be black in color and did not make any noise that I heard.I saw a similar craft late winter/early spring of last year hovering in the sky above my house.  A second or so after I saw it, it moved away. It was perfectly triangular in shape but it had a light in every corner and one in the center and was black in color.  It made a noise, but it was more of a deep rumbling than the sound made by any jet engine I&apos;ve ever heard.

At approximately 16:00 hours myself and two friends were on campus near a field shooting at gophers with bows and arrows.  One of my friends shot an arrow straight up in the sky and while we were watching the arrow go up we noticed a lot of bright, white colored shiny dots way up in the sky.  We counted at least thirty of them. They were in a cluster shape and were moving around.  Some appeared large and some very small.  They seemed like stars, they twinkled.  We also noticed a commercial airline jet flying overhead leaving a trail.  By comparing the jet to the objects it seemed as if the jet was flying through them, also some of the objects seemed way above the jet and the larger ones below the jet.  One of my friends went running back to the dorms to get his binoculars.  The sky was blue and cloudless with no wind.  The objects moved slowly to the Southwest.

The objects were moving far too quickly to be airplanes. I saw the first object moving by itself very quickly toward my direction and then it veered off in a northerly direction. A few minutes later I spotted two more objects of exactly the same quality and size moving very quickly but always remaining the same distance apart. I called my roommate outside so I&apos;d have at least one other witness. He and I both watched the two objects quite clearly for about 45 seconds. He went back inside when the objects disappeared behind one of the few clouds in an otherwise unusually clear night sky. The strange thing about these two objects was that they never re-appeared on the other side of the cloud as a satellite or airplane would have had to do (at their rate of speed, we figure it should have taken them no more than 10 or 15 seconds to re-appear). I later spoke with one of the local TV weathermen who had mentioned on his weathercast the next night that he had seen these same two flying objects. He told me that he and his son also had seen them disappear behind that single cloud and never emerge on the other side! These were the only two of the total seven objects I eventually saw that did not appear to emit flashing light.Finally, to my amazement, several minutes later I spotted FOUR MORE of the lights (craft?) traveling in a different part of the sky and going in a totally different direction from objects 1 and objects 2 and 3. These four &quot;flew&quot; from south to north and the four of them maintained strict relative position to each other but were not flying in a straight-line pattern. All four had regularly flashing lights.This is the first time in my life I&apos;ve seen anything remotely like this. The objects made no sound, had no red lights as are typically found on airplanes, and they travelled at what must have been very high speeds, though they did not &quot;dart&quot; around, nor were there any &quot;gaps&quot; in their flight patterns.

I am very skeptical of any Ufo sighting, and I can usally tell what something is right after I see it, but this had me stumped.  It wasn&apos;t any aircraft I know of, and I know of a good amount of aircraft.  It was too small to carry humans( about 5 ft. in diameter and 7ft long), and I don&apos;t see how it could fly as straight as it did, or how it could fly at all. There was a haze around it, but this might have been shock waves( like those visible when the F/A-18 hornet is approaching and reaching the sound barrier.  There was no aircraft following it(I beive the closest Fighter base to the sighting is Ottis ANG base, which deploys F-16 fighting falcons) and it was too small to appear on radar, so obviously there was no way for fighters to be scrambled to trail it.  It was silver-gray, and egg-shaped as I said.  It had no markings visible to me, although I only saw the underside of the craft and there may have been markings elsewhere.  I don&apos;t think it was an alien space craft, but it could have been an experimental military drone, possibly based at Quonset ANG, which would be the perfect place to keep the vehicle,seeing as Quonset has not had at test or fighter sqaudron based there since the 40&apos;s and 50&apos;s, so noone would look there. this is not the only explanation and I&apos;m open to suggestions and I would enjoy them very much.

From the west, below the horizon a light lifts steadily and quickly, like dawn, but much faster. Lights up the entire sky but no object discernable because of the cloud. Lagoon waters turn blue, like day. Birds fly startled from the trees.  Roosters crow. The light passes overhead then up and away (rather than bending over the opposite horizon}.

Some say they saw a blue light. A group of football players, resting after a practise match, say they felt a strong rush of wind as it flew past. One guy saw it while out in the ocean fishing and jumped for cover under his boat. Seasoned merchant navy sailors, home on vacation, had never witnessed or heard of anything like it before. To this day no one has a clue as to what it could have been. Footage on tv of metorites entering the atmosphere, while spectacular, were nothing at all like this. Here the entire sky lit up, not just a portion of it. As the source of the light passed overhead there was a reddening low on the Western horizon, like explosions, things dropping into the ocean, burning, then blackness.

We will contact local authorities, in attempt to obtain more information.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))Dear Peter,Thanks for your quick response. Yes it was something very strange and very spectacular.  It has been a few years since the event and no doubt some witnesses have moved on. Good guess, but no I am not the Director ((deleted)), although ((that person)) was sitting not twenty feet from where I was and witnessed everything I did. I will try get ((that person&apos;s)) email address and pass it onto you.Tuvalu is a really small place and in 1997 there were no newspapers, so no written reports to the best of my knowledge. As you can imagine it was the talk of the town for a few days then back to normal routine. If you are really interested I will put you in touch with a few people whom I know personally witnessed it and you can take it from there. A couple of daysafter the event I spoke to a few people who lived on one of the outer islands [Niutao] - about 100 miles North of Funafuti - and they said they had seen strange lights in the direction of Funafuti - so I gather from this that the event was local to Funafuti - even though it appeared [from Funafuti] to cover the entire sky.  Some have suggested a Nuclear explosion in French Polynesia - but that is 2000 miles away - and none were reported.Another theory is re-entry of the spaceshuttle but I doubt that would brighten the lagoon and startle birds. A very large meteorite skipping off the upper atmosphere perhaps, but how could bend over the western horizon and brighten the sky as it did. Its a pity about the cloud cover, but in some ways it added to the spectacle, - the source of light silhouetted the banded cloud (herringbone?) - and as it rose it looked like a curtain rising.  As people were watching the light I cast my eyes back to the West and that&apos;s when I saw what looked like a uniform explosion low on the rim of the western horizon.   In the days following the event a friend (another witness) tried to get in contact with the international press to tell the story but in those days Tuvalu had not yet been hooked up to the internet.

Meantime I shall try get you some other addresses.regards((name deleted))((SECOND FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE))Dear Peter,I have no problem in you featuring the article - that would be great - provided anonymity isassured.

We were driving west on the 401 when we noticed a VERY bright light off in the distance.  We made a game out of it, trying to guess what it was.  It was very bright and white.  We guessed a radio tower at first, then, as we neared decided it was far too bright.  Next we guessed a plane - again, it was too bright and we could not see any strobes.  For about 8 minutes we tried to guess as we drove closer and closer to the object.Finally, after nearly 10 minutes, we closed in on the object and it flew past us.  It was triangular and had four lights - all of them white.  There was a white non-strobing light on each top with a large circular light in the very center that was very, very bright.  This must have been the light we were trying to identify only moments earlier.  The object made no sound as it passed by at an estimated 500ft or so from the ground.  It was moving east, past us.My friend and I, being younger childern, became quite upset and my father pulled the car over after voicing a &quot;what the hell was that?&quot;.   My young friend and I watched as the aircraft flew past and crossed over the highway.  We thought it was coming back around so we both screamed for my father to get back on the road, nearly in tears.

While my son and myself were walking around in the parking lot we heard this very loud sound similiar to a jet engine which came from 5 or 6 different directions at one time in about a 4 second time frame.  The two of us automatically looked into the overcast sky thinking it was some type of jet since they were landing right over our heads.

We went behind a hill for about a half mile &amp; when we could see to the south again it was still there. Using the lights from the windmills on the hills (approx. one mile to our south) to position it, it appeared to be stationary. We continued to travel east, and after about a minute, the one large very bright light changed to two smaller lights. When that happened we could make out the shape a little better. It seemed to be oblong &amp; shone silver in the reflection of its lights. There almost seemed to be a long skinny pipe coming out of the bottom at an angle. It was too far away to estimate size. We drove for about another mile and at the bottom of the hill, when the object was directly to our right, there was a road heading straight towards it. The object appeared to stay stationary this whole time. We turned right and slowed to a stop, about 20-30 yards down the road. However, as soon as our headlights swung around to point in the direction of the object, the two lights went out. Within a few seconds a small red light and a small blue light appeared and began blinking like a normal airplane would. The lights then moved off west-northwest (not towards the airport in Tri-Cities) very, very rapidly. Faster than a small plane like a Cessna could travel.

My husband (a well educated person) and I (an accountant) were traveling on highway 27 between Harrison and Mount Pleasant Michigan. We just left his brothers house near Crystal Lake going home to Livonia. We were discussing a quiz from my accounting class about ethics. The radio was off, and all I had on was my little flashlight (one of those small ones that help you find your lock on your door at night). I was reading an article to him from the New York Times, when we both looked out my window (looking West), and noticed two strobe lights on what looked like a long wing about four bus lengths apart from each other flashing three times each but at different times with no hesitation between the flashes from one side to the next. My husband said he noticed the lights reflecting on the car and I noticed the flashes from my peripheral vision. The first thing I thought of was the stealth, except it was longer and not what I would imagine the stealth to look like (granted I have never seen a stealth). The object was silent, but our windows were up, but we didn&apos;t hear anything! It was about 150feet high, no higher then 200feet up. It went right over our car from a bit south but more West to East South, and it was going around (best guess) 120-150 miles an hour. My husband asked as it went over to watch it, which I did, and noticed that its left strobe light turned off, it made a decent and disappeared for about 15sec maybe 20. I told my husband that it appeared to have landed in a thicket of trees but I couldn&apos;t be sure. When it suddenly showed up again and flying very fast from where I last saw it going now straight south but then we noticed it had red and blue lights flashing along with the outer white lights and again in a strobe light manner, they were in perfect sequence with each other. The craft went at least three miles in about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes tops. It appeared to land again, when we saw i! t cross the highway going south west again, it was closer then and we couldn&amp;#8217;t explain that (about 1 mile if that away from our car at that point) as we got closer its lights went back to just the white strobe lights on the out side of the wings again, and at this time it was crossing east again in front of us still around a mile ahead of us away. It turned so fast North that it was next to our car again, (drive&apos;s side window) we watched it as it was now behind us around a 1/2 mile back again when we turned off the freeway (m20, Mount Pleasant exit) and stopped our car at the side of the exit ramp, we jumped out of the car and looked up. This thing should have flown over us, there is no doubt in my mind, when it turned from South to West again, it did it in a quick (and I mean quick) U turn and only two BRIGHT lights like car lights steady not blinking now, were coming over a trailer park that was right next to where we were parked now. It had to have been flying around 70 miles per hour (I would estimate) and it should have flown over us, I was standing on the car outside my door (you know that section of the car where the door meets next to your seat?) so I could see it as it went over better and closer. It never went over us, and I SWEAR it should have. My husband and I just looked at each other and asked, &quot;Where did it go!&quot; But we never saw it after that, we stopped at this gas station just about 1 block west from our exit ramp and I got out of the car and looked up while he pumped gas. I must have looked like a freak, but honestly nothing like that has ever happened to either one of us before.

Its skin color was &quot;the blue of a clear sky&quot; and &quot;a black thing that appeared to be an eye but low where a nose should be.&quot; Mrs. C. said her granddaughter and the boy had the creature in view for about nine minutes but did not hear any unusual sounds associated with the entity.In a followup communication, she reported that two other children at the same school had just reported seeing a similar sky-blue creature &quot;in the same spot sometime in the spring.&quot; (Email Interview) (Editor&apos;s Note: There was a UFO flap in the Path Valley, near Chambersburg, between March 3 and March 20, 1996, about 100 miles southeast of northern Indiana County.)Reported from:  http://ufoinfo.com/roundup/v01/rnd01_31.shtml ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the individual who submitted this report, and to UFORoundUp for making the material available.

I live in Woodinville (a mere 3 miles away from Bothell) and balloons go over my house about every other day. These balloons frequently fly above my house at a very low altitude (somewhere in the margin of 250 feet) and there is usually 1 at a time in the sky, and they never fly in the full darkness, so i find it hard to belive that those objects could be the balloons.

I was cleaning swimming pool because our children would swim the next day. To clean the pool I used a long pole with an attached brush.As I moved my arm up the pole I turned my head to the rear and saw a craft headed in my direction at a low altitude and with lights on the front. What caught my attention was the width and pancake layout of the lights. As I stared at it for about 8-10 seconds, I realized it was not a helicopter (I have group propulsion systems background and aeronautical engineering studies). I ran toward the back patio door (about 20 feet away) and called to my wife and children to come out and see it. My wife was the only one who did. As I turned with her to look, the craft was now directly over our house and stationery. Perhaps, the swimming pool lights attracted it. It was about 75 feet above us for 40 seconds. It made no sound, had circular windows in the lower portion of the upper dome, it had no visible connections and appeared as it were one solid piece, the skin was metallic, silver and shiny.We noticed a rectangular window about 8-10 feet long and 4 feet wide in the frontal leading edge but just beneath the front circular edge. There was an orange, redish light emanating from inside but could not see any occupants. The craft moved as if it were caught in a slight breeze but made no sound. It angled forward and downward for a few seconds. We could see rectangular shapes (2) that ran the diameter of the craft under the concave bottom. We also saw two ski like devices in the front lower side that seemed as hanging or docking devices rather than skis because they were to far in front of what I considered a center of gravity of the craft. The craft had a diameter of at least 75-100 feet with a height of at least a 1.5 story house.My wife kept repeating &quot;oh my god&quot; over and over again while I kept thinking take me with you! We decided not to discuss it but to draw what we each saw and then discuss it.I know this craft did not apply earthly technology. We will never forget the experience and continue to search the skies.((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1980 is approximate.  Minor typos corrected at request of witness.

The time of the occurance was roughly between 10:00 pm and 10:30 pm between Fargo and Hickson ND on well traveled Hwy 81 south.  There were two wittnesess to the event.  It was a Friday night, my girlfriend and I decided to go out to Hickson, ND for a few drinks and fun.  We left from Moorhead, MN (which is across the river from Fargo, ND) and proceeded across the river on the far south side of Fargo and turned on Hwy 81 south for about a 15-20 mile drive to Hickson.  Hwy 81 is a well traveled road, especially on the weekends, there are a number of small town bars that people enjoy within a radius of 20-25 miles from Fargo-Moorhead.  As we traveled down 81, we were having a calm - dissagreement about something, and noticed a group of red lights above the treen line some miles ahead(the night was clear, and black, but you could still differentiate the tree line from the sky line).  As we approached the lights stayed at the same location without moving, and became larger the closer we got.  My girlfriend asked if I saw the lights - and asked if it were a plane.  I replied that if it were a plane, it was flying very low, and incredibly slow (also, earlier that day 747 airplanes were doing touch-and-go landings at Fargo&apos;s Hector Airport- in the winter the winds are very calm - so they use the airport for training purposes - because were not the busiest location in America - but this was not a 747 on a training mission).  As we approached I slowed down (we were driving a Mercury Mountaineer) and the lights were from our left (heading south) to our right, half were red, and half blue, one solid row, no blinking/flashing of any kind.  We don&apos;t remember how many total colored lights were in the row, however we do know a few things for sure: 1.  we had not been drinking,  2.  we were of very sound mind and body,  3.  we were very rational  4. Hwy 81 is a busy road - and we were over half way (15 miles or so)to our destination ! - and ha d seen ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER VEHICLES - none from the north, south, east, or west NONE!  As we slowed down to where our vehicle was now under the object (we could see the row of colored lights right above  us) the colored  lights suddenly went off and two large - spot lights came on and lit up the entire area around us.  At that time my girlfriend put her head out the window and looked up and listened - all we could here was a dull hum - no jet engines, helicopter engines ect.  I never came to a complete stop, the vehicle was always moving but a very slow 5-15 mph once we were near and below the object.  We continued slowly until we came out from under the object - this is when we really started to wonder what it was - just a matter of seconds (10-15 maybe) we looked back and the lights were completely gone - nowhere in sight.  We turned the radio back up a little, and proceeded to Hickson - never seeing another car.  When we got to our destination, we talked to friends both seperately and together, and never mentioned a word about what we saw- it was like we were thinking about it, but for whatever reason, never mentioned anything to anyone else.  After closing, we headed back to Fargo-Moorhead, and saw numerous cars on 81 and the other adjoining roads - at that time we began discussing what we saw.  The next morning, we each took a sheet of paper and seperately drew the object from what we remembered from the previous night.  We then &quot;compared notes&quot; only to find we had both drawn virtually the same object.  I would just like to again say, we were both of sound mind and body - and still are - what ever it was - we had never seen before - and couldn&apos;t explain it.  There were too many coincidences that night - no traffic anywhere, over a 20-25 mile drive with many conecting roadways, homes and BARS, on a Friday night, just south of a community population of close to 200,000 - where nobody takes a bus - everyone owns at least one car - most have two or three, not to mention snowmobiles - it&apos;s a big deal to ! ride sno wmobiles from bar to bar is this area - no snowmobiles = ZERO activity in this area - VERY VERY VERY STRANGE.

My moms&apos; friend was driving and she was very upset, believing that some &quot;idiot&quot; was driving to close to us.( This stretch of road was usually busy with big trucks)...she then pulled over to let them pass us......but it didn&apos;t end there. The light didn&apos;t go away.....She got out of the car as did the rest of us, to see what was happening. We all saw the object above the car. It appeared to be triangular, the entire underside of it just pure intense white light. If we had all stood on each others sholders, we could have touched it. None of us were afraid( I guess I don&apos;t know why ) It moved so slow, as if it would fall out of the sky at any moment....There was no sound what so ever. Years later we all have talked about this and it hasn&apos;t left my thoughts all these years. When I went to my ten year reunion....I spoke to my friend who had been in the car with us...He also stated that the encounter was something that he never forgot. I want to say that what is so amazing is that none of us can remember what happened after...Did we go roller skating...did we go home....None of us remember....We never checked to see if there was any time loss(as there was not as much information back then about what can happen if such an event occurs.....Several years later there were numerous cow mutilations on local farms.......nothing was investigated , and the police had nothing to say...They treated us like we were all crazy(only saying that they probably had been killed by animals)......I have often thought about going under hypnosis to see if I can remember anything else about what happened or didn&apos;t happen....Was it a UFO?  I can&apos;t answer the question and may never remem! ber anym ore detail.....But this is my story, of what happened that night, that had such a huge impact on all of us. Even though we can&apos;t remember anymore of what happened that night; we still like to talk about it .........and just wonder.", "Hexagonal formation of white lights with a blue light offset from the center and a bright red flashing lightWhat woke my wife and I up was a sound like a cross between a really loud lawnmower and a helicopter, it then sounded more and more like a jet engine as it got closer. We jumped out of bed and looked out of the window, toward the northeast, and saw a cluster of bright lights at very low altitude. My best guess is about 3000-5000 feet. it looked like six bright white lights in a hexagonal cluster with a bright blue light offset from the middle and a flashing bright light near the bottom. The red light was the brightest of the lights. It was moving very fast from the east to the west. I ran to the front of the house and looked out of the front window to get a better view. and saw it for about another 10 seconds before I lost sight of it behind some trees.", "Three lighted triangular craft make no sound and erratically circle just north of Orlando for five minutes.While working as a security guard I observed from atop a downtown parking garage what appeared at first to be three craft approaching from the north like airplanes do going to the main airport.  But then I observed that they were much too closely spaced to be regulated aircraft.  As they got near downtown they began to move in motions of lazy turns, banks and doublebacks like seagulls, at random and not in formation, and not like any planes I&apos;ve ever seen.  The front of the craft had half a dozen white lights.  There were no other lights and no sound was heard.  I used an 8x eyepiece to get a better view. The rear of the craft was square so the whole thing appeared to be an obtuse triangle with the large angle at the nose.  The craft appeared black.  I double-checked myself that these were not blimps, spotlights, laserlights, helicopters, normal airplanes, birds, nor reflections.  Their size appeared to be about twice as big as a large commercial plane.  After a few minutes they moved slowly off to the northwest and disappeared in the haze.  Their altitude was about that of planes coming into the city just about 5-10 miles from the airport.  Their speed was similar to jets flying normally, or just a tad faster.  The weather was mostly clear with some haze.", "A triangular craft 200ft high and 500 foot from my position..hoveringDecided to take a ride through the country last night.I live in a rual location in north Baldwin county and trees in my yard limit my view of the sky. I had been out in the yard with nothing seen but the usual commerical/private traffic. At around 21:45 I got in my car and proceeded to take a ride. Went south down co. rd. 47 (Rabun Rd.)and turned right onto co. rd. 96 traveling west. At the end of co. rd. 96 I took a left on hwy 59 and proceeded south several miles to co. rd. 94 (may tower rd.)where I turned left. Now I&apos;m heading back east torward county rd 47. After traveling a short distance down 94 i noticed a car back behind me and thought to myself &quot;thats all i need , a car riding my butt&quot; . About 2 miles down 94 there is a curve to the right. As I rounded the curve there the damn thing was.....just sitting there...right in front of me ....in a hover. A triangluar craft about 200 ft are less off the ground and about 500 feet from my position. It had a white light in the bottom at each apex and no strobes could be seen. I was traveling at a slow speed (aprox 35 to 40 mph) and at this time the car behind me had caught up (about 200 yds max behind me). About 200 yds up on the left is a drive which leads to a friends house so pulled into the drive and stopped to allow the car behind to go by. Durning this i&apos;m still looking at this craft sitting in a hover. AS the car behind me passes by i backed out into the road. The front of my car is now facing the object ( now I&apos;m facing west again). This quick turn around must have alerted the craft to the fact that I had seen it because at this point it starts moving off to the SW. I gave chase hoping it would stop again but it proceeded to gain speed until it was out of sight. The craft clearly was triangular in shape and made no noise. I will send a detailed map via e-mail shortly. Also as stated above I turned around in a drive which leads to a friends house. This thing had to pass right over his house prior to me seeing it. I will call him this afternoon whe! n he get s in from work to see if he may have seen it. Also at this time let me state when turning around in the drive i noticed a car coming down the drive as coming from my friends house. But at this point I was giving chase so did not stay to see who it was. I would estimate the craft to be 50 to 70 ft from point to point. The color appeared to be black.", "ufo sighted near alexandra palice north londonwalking my dog one evening in may 1993 it was a monday i noticed a saucer shaped craft low in the sky.it was totaly motionless after a while sudenly a flash like afirework exploded in front of the craft followed by dense smoke which fell to the ground what amazed me was all this hapened in north london 8.o clock in the evening and nobody got aphoto of this event though the local paper did report the ufo sightings a fortnight later((NUFORC Note:  Date in May 1993 is approximate.

It looked like a triangle comprised of 4 rows of lights, two pairs of red lights on the inside and two blue lights on the outsides. As we were driving away we looked back and noticed that it was almost just hanging in the air, not moving, then it turned itself around and began going the other direction, but by this time we had already driven to far to notice anything else.", "((NUFORC Note:  Report of missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  PD))Strange jet-trail-like thing sighted over mountainsAt about 6:00 PM, I called my friend to let her know that I was probably going to be late to her house (I was supposed to come over). However, while I was on the phone, my friend was talking and talking about some strange thing in the sky, that she couldn&apos;t exactly describe very well. I wasn&apos;t so terrified of it, because I wasn&apos;t a believer at the time, and I&apos;m still sort of doubting the existence of aliens. Well, my friend was telling of an object that zoomed into the air from the mountains, zig-zagged, and finally disappeared, leaving a very prominent trail. As my friend said, there was a red circle surrounding it, but she wasn&apos;t able to describe the circle very well (like whether the circle appeared when the light disappeared, or how big the circle was...etc), so I&apos;m doubting the existence of the red circle in the event. Well, while I was still talking to her on the phone, actually on my cell phone and she on her cordless phone (while she was outside checking out the strange light), our connection began to get more and more static. After a few minutes, Bridget had an idea that she would go and get her dad&apos;s digital camera and take a few pictures. This was when the light had disappeared suddenly into the mountains. By this time, it was approx. 6:20. Bridget took the pictures, and after coming over, I was able to see them. When I got to Bridget&apos;s house, the jet-trail was still very prominent. The trail just stayed in the air, without leaving until about thirty more minutes later. Also, at the points where the trail began to turn to make the trail a zig-zaggy form, there were bright lights. The top of the trail was already beginning to drift right, because of the wind. My friend and I decided to look at the pictures then. All the pictures that Bridget took of the UFO contained orbs. Bridget took a picture of me then, to check whether the camera lens were dirty or not, and the picture of me came out perfectly fine, and without orbs. After thinking and thinking about this event, I knew that the UFO had b! een in t he Earth&apos;s atmosphere, because the wind could blow the jet trail away. The jet trail was vapor, I think, because after thirty more minutes (6:40 PM), the trail had faded. Also, before taking the pictures, when there was still some sunlight left in the sky, my friend and I could see a small rainbow, probably from the sun shining through the prism. I highly doubt this is any UFO event, because we do have a air base near by, and they were probably doing some experiments/tests/launching missiles. But the occurrence just seemed so unnatural, because of it&apos;s zig-zag shape and the bright lights at each point, and how the light just disappeared. Another thing I&apos;d like to point out is that my friend, who witnessed the whole thing, saw the light coming from somewhere behind the mountain, meaning it was probably under 2000 feet. Either the UFO landed, or the people at the air base were doing some experiments. Another thing, although this might be totally off subject (but I did hear orbs may have relation to dead people or angels), my friend&apos;s friend was shot in the chest, and found on March 14, 2002. My friend found this out March 15, 2002, so perhaps the orbs were intended for my friend (does that make sense?). I just wanted to clear the situation up, so maybe you can help me determine whether the object was an UFO or not one. Thank you very much!", "We went outside to watch the conjuction of the planets.we did not see the conjuction as it is only visable at dusk.I focused on a fixed star.I was facing east the star was at about 1&apos;oclock.The star began to move quite rapidly and eratically accross the sky until it eventually disappeared.This lasted approx 2mins we then continued looking at the sky and exactly the same thing happened again.stars do not drop from the skies.", "object seems to disintergrate as if re-entering the aptmostphere((NUFORC Note:  No other information provided by witness.

When I arrived at her door I rang and I looked up to the second floor window. That is the window of her apartment, she mostly opens the window to throw the keys. When looking up I noticed 9 bright lights. There course was WNW. They made no sound. They seemed to be flying very fast and very high, though the lights were very bright. I couldn&apos;t distinct if anything was between the 9 lights. There were no blinking lights. It was as if you see 9 sattelites flying over in perfect inverse V formation. During the V formation the speeds of the lights was constant.Then suddenly I knew it weren&apos;t just planes or helicopters in formation, cuase the shape just changed to a double inverse V formation!!! The changing of the formation was only a split second, and the movement of the different lights were smooth without one of them crossing onother one. The movement of the different lights wasn&apos;t symmetric, the left side of the V moved differently then the left side of the V... ..   ..     ..       .(if this works out this drawing... they moved from the shape above to the shape beneath) .   .. . . ..   .   .The pattern in the movement (!which went very smooth!) was like random.

The light appeared over the trees about a half of a kilometer away from us on the far side of the lake (I checked a map later for the distance), it was a very brilliant white light and it was travelling silently (at first we shut the boat off to listen and started it up again) but slowly to the east. We had a perfect view of the light as it moved and we noticed that it would speed up a little then slow right down. We sped up in the boat to get closer and the light continued to move away a little faster but with the same speed up and slow down movement. We noticed that it travelled in a straight more or less and watched it for a good few minutes as it travelled to the other side of the lake (about 5kms) where it moved over the trees and out of sight. This area of northern Ontario is very sparsely populated and is for the most part thick forest for hundreds of miles, there are no airports nearby aside from the odd private airfield. Two nights later it was approximately 3 am on another clear night with some clouds rolling in and again we saw the light over the lake. We were sitting on the deck of the cabin with all lights off looking at the stars in recliners when we noticed the light again but this time very high up over the lake. At first it seemed to just sit there for a few moments and then it began to move slowly. It would change directions instantly at sharp angles with no curving. And a couple of times it blinked off and then blinked on in another location in the sky. My best estimate is that it was at an altitude of about 1 km.  We watched it for about 3 min in all and lost sight of it when it moved into approaching clouds. We waited another hour for another look but by that time there was cloud cover and we saw nothing.

It had been flying in a westerly direction.  A moment after the airliner turned, the disc also turned in the same direction.  However, as the disc made its turn the rear of the disc dipped down and for a moment I could see the dome in the middle of the disc.  After finishing its turn the disc leveled out and cought up to the airliner.  Both continued flying in a northerely direction.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I have been carrying my spotting scope with me ever since the last incident on April 1st. So I got the scope out and viewed the light through it. I am not sure if it was because I could not keep the scope very steady, but it looked like the craft was almost.... well, plasma. It dropped a red &quot;flare&quot; thing just like the last time, but then it dropped some other stuff that was really bright. This time the stuff that it was dropping didn&apos;t burn out- it was actually dropping to the ground! Now, the next thing that happened REALLY freaked me out! As I was staring at the light, a second light came from the ground!!!  It floated vertically, and when it got as high as the first light, the first light faded to a dot. Then the second light droppped some bright things, too. But it droppped like 5 things  one after another. All of the stuff it dropped looked like it landed on the ground near some houses!!! (In Lake Havasu City, there are lots of hills and most of the streets are on hills, so if you are on top of a street that is on a good hill,  you can see across to other neighborhoods.)  The first light started to float over to the north more, and went behind the mountains. A few seconds later, the second light did the same thing.  We drove over to where it looked the craft had dropped the things, but didn&apos;t find anything. Now I am going to make my boyfriend carry his video camera everywhere we go. Hopefully I will be able to get it on tape this time and send it to you!", "We saw a strange orange fireball four times across the night sky.We were outside at about 10:00 pm. We saw a strange orange fireball fly away from us. It seemed to big to be anything like a meteor and it was flying away from us. It then disappeared suddenly. We shook it off, but then we heard neighbors talking about how the planets are aligned. We became a little interested. We then continued walking around and saw another one exactly the same, fly by across the sky at about 1:00 AM. Later at 2:00 we saw the same thing. At about 4:00 am we saw it fly across the sky again and suddenly vanish. We live near an airport but their is no way this was anything I have seen before.

It seemed to be hanging in the sky some distance south of Sacramewnto, California and west of Highway 99. It was defined only by its lights, making it hard to tell its exact shape. It looked like a Y at first and then seemed to turn &amp; become triangular, without changing its location. One light was pulsing, the others, in a row, were steady. The pulsing light was in front of the others and vanished as it turned. Even at that distance it looked very large.

We were back within 5 minutes and watched it for another 15 or 20. It was getting cold, so we went inside. I looked out again about an hour later, but a mist had closed in and I didn&apos;t see it.

I was cleaning the surrounding yard where we had a bonfire the night previous.Weather Conditions: Clear/Sunny, Temp 56 degrees, Wind 8-10 mph out of the NW, Unusually clear day, as was the night before, No clouds, no Chemtrails.Sighting: The time was about 12:50 pm when this sighting occurred. I was looking up at the sky, at a passing jet plane. Normal contrail formation that rapidly disapated. Jet looked to be at about 10,000 feet up or about the size of a dime at arms length? As I was looking at the jet, I noticed some white flower petals, or something similar floating through the sky about 50-100 feet up, so that my field of focus switched to that for a moment. Thought nothing of it until I noticed one white object sitting in the sky. Object was at 85 degrees above me, (90 being directly overhead). Sun would have been at 80 degrees towards my back or 15 degrees from this objects position. This object remained stationary and looked to be spherical in shape. Color white, size undetermined, however this is where I got lucky and determined that this was in fact a ufo. Another jet passed over the same flight path of the last and crossed over this object. Now I was able to determine that this thing was below the plane. By how much, I do not know. The object remained stationary for 1 minute, then moved quickly about 2 feet over to the left. 2 feet relative to where I was staring if you were to point your finger on the object. The distance up there could be a few hundred to a thousand feet then? I continued to stare at this thing, it began to circle, in a spiral pattern, which made me think, &quot;Is this perhaps a local weather ballon caught in a wind pattern?&quot; Then it began to glide back to the right to it&apos;s original position, and ZOOM - it took off to the west, GONE!

Previous to then the sky was pretty busy since we live under flight paths for the Oakland airport. I live near town about .2 mi. from dowtown lights, so the sky is not extremely black. I noticed a line of different colored lights, one white, one red, and one amber. As I watched them float across my path at approx 60-70 degrees line of sight angle, from where I was standing, I realized that the lights were disappearing as it was approaching directly overhead and that a section of the sky and stars were being blocked out immediately behind the line of lights, It was as if the original lights I saw were on the top and front of some solid object and when it floated by my view of the lights was obstructed as well as the sky. The patch of darkness behind this line of lights was approx.4&quot; x 4&quot; at arm&apos;s length. I could not really discern any specific shape but I want to say triangle. There was absolutely no sound even though it appeared to be quite close and it gave the impression it was floating. Since I don&apos;t know how far away it actually was I don&apos;t know how fast it was going but it travelled across approx. 110 degrees of arc above me until I lost the blackness in the night sky. I kept looking for flashing strobes or red and green wing lights but to no avail.

On Christmas Day night at 6:42 p.m. a family of 4 were on their way from Sioux City, Iowa to Omaha, Nebraska on I-29 (southbound, about 3 miles north of the North Omaha Exit which turns west on I-680) when they sighted a lighted object about 1/2 mile ahead of their vehicle.  As their vehicle neared the white-lighted object, they saw that it was hovered near the opposite side of I-29 approximately 500-600 feet ahead and diagonally to their left (SE) of the witnesses&apos; vehicle, at an estimated altitude of 500 feet.  (Investigation shows that the cloud ceiling was 2,200 feet, so we at least know that the object was below 2,200 feet.  Without the ability to be more specific, what seems obvious is that the sighting was close, and at fairly low altitude.)  Traffic on the northbound side of I-29 had slowed down drastically, with 4 vehicles pulled over, and with at least one individual standing outside his vehicle looking up at the object.  The bright lights, seeming to present a visual crown effect, and perceived by the witnesses to be somewhat smaller than an airliner, suddenly did a &quot;back flip&quot; - that is, the lights did a 360 degree turn, as the object rose straight up and ascended through the cloud ceiling.  Three (3) of the four (4) witnesses were interviewed at the site, the father and two adolescents, age 11 and 12.  The adult witness is a thoughtful type individual, with no apparent desire to embellish or over-conclude.  The two adolescents are intelligent youth, fascinated and amazed by what they saw and articulately willing to share their perception of the incident.  They exhibited nothing giddy or frivolous as they described and drew sketches of their perceptions of the incident.  As an investigator, I consider this a multiple witness sighting with 3 good witnesses, who from their position in the family van had a good vantage! point f rom which to view an anomalous object.  While this is essentially a &quot;lights in the sky&quot; kind of sighting, with only an impression of curved edges, which might suggest a boomerang or disk,the bright lights, the low altitude, the nearness of the object to a heavy trafficway, and the report of a &quot;back-flip&quot; as the object rose straight up, make it an interesting case for examination, even though no other reports were called in to local law enforcement, and FAA at Eppley Airfield indicated nothing unusual on radar.", "6 Bright orange lights in pyramid formation heading NW to SE moving as fast as comets, but as far away as starsThe six (6) objects were flying from NW heading to SE.

We had passed overhead of Toronto and were proceeding in a straight line from Toronto to Vancouver. We were flying at FL390, and making good a track of about 300 degrees magnetic. It was a clear night, no moon, and many stars visible. When we were south of Sault Ste. Marie by about 80 nautical miles, I suddenly observed two large bright white lights in our 1 o&apos;clock position.  At first I thought they were two aircraft in formation flying towards us. They seemed to be about 8 to 10 miles away. I brought them to the attention of the F/O, and we both agreed that they were very unusual.I then asked air traffic control if they were aware of any aircraft in the area, and they said that there was nothing in the area either on radar or know of.We observed them for at least one minute, possibly close to two minute.They appeared as very bright white objects followed by a very long trail. The trail appeared to be about ten times the length of the object. The trail seemed to be illuminated, almost phosphorescent in color.The objects seemed to be brilliant white in color, and I felt I could see one or two individual white lights for a split second on the second object. They appeared to be in formation proceeding in a northeasterly direction at about our altitude.We watch them move from our 1 o&apos;clock position to our 3 or 4 o&apos;clock position, then the second object seemed to become two (perhaps one was hidden by the other), the second and third objects suddenly disappeared from sight and the lead object carried on for about 15 seconds more, then it disappeared as well.I have been flying for more than 25 years, and have operated all over the world; I have never seen anything that looked like this before.", "At 22:40 pm three lights making a distinctive triangle in the sky was observe passing overhead at a high rate of speed silently.At 22:40 Pm I was outside on my second floor deck brushing my teeth.

Suddenly three light came out of nowewhere while I was looking to the West.The three lights were moving at a high rate of speed in a West to East direction. The lights made up a triangular formation. My hous is a large house and my visual range is very good from my second and third floor decks. I saw the lights probably 1-2 miles away. The lights which were in a very distictive triangle mad no sound and was traveling at least 400 mph. I know this because I can see the jets entering for final for North bound land trafic from my house.As the lights passed over I noticed very distinctive crosses for each light. Each ligh looked like it was one of the sun flare crosses if you took a picture fith a cross hair lense on a camera. The lights seemed to apear a bluish color with a golden yellow center where the lines crossed. Each light was an individual cross and sepereated equally in a very clear triangular form if one was to conect the lights together.As the lights passed over there was no sound, you could not see a ship of any type, though the space between the lights did not look like normal night sky. The altitude appeared to be about 6000 feet to 4000 feet. I watched the lights travel to the East for aproxamatly 6 seconds looking for some kind of tail section or visual rear of a craft. The lights just simply disapeared. The craft simply vanished as if it were extremly thin or moved so quickly I could not see it any more. Incredible speed in comparison of a jet.Within 10 seconds I visually was watching come into view in the area a large size jet bound for Seatac Airport on final. The lights of the jet were moving much slower than the craft which I was watching.

I understand and know what is normal. This was not normal.The weather tonight was totally clear, with a temperature around 50 degrees and no visual fog or moisture in the air. On a clear day I can see Mt Rainier, and the cascade range. The craft would have been over the cascades in seconds at the rate it was moving. I consistantly watch aircraft traveling and turning into SeaTac for landings. This craft should have been visible to the aircraft that was heading north and a second aircraft which apeared shortly after the first. The three light should have been in Radar space of both McHord Airforce base and SeaTacs Air space and should have been picked up on radar.

I had this strange feeling. I looked in the yard -nothing. I looked up, and there, to my left, above the trees was a ufo. This was what I remember; the craft was hovering, not too high, at an angle. The side closest to the ocean tilted slightly down. The house itself was three blocks from the  water, and the craft appeared to be just a bit closer than that. It  was  saucer like, fat in the middle, and I remember  thinking how it looked very sleek. The moonlight reflected off the craft, illuminating it&apos;s shape. It might even have  been a full moon that night  which inspired me to look out the window.The  craft had lights (round)  encircling it. They  would seemilngly rotate around the craft, changing colors on the way back around. I remember seeing blue and red, aswell as orange.I casually told my friend there was a ufo outside, to impress her with my blase  attitude. She didn&apos;t believe me at first, but then she saw it. We sat in her bed for a while staring at it. W e  thought about waking her  grandparents, we  joked  about very tiny green men marching in the house if  we didn&apos;t  wake them. My friend went to  sleep shortly afterward. I would occasionaly check to make sure the craft was still there:it was reassuring.  The next thing I  remember is  realizing I had fallen asleep.

I was to excited the first time, and I now belive I know what kind of ship it was.-update- I saw two bright lights moving in an unconventional fashion.  When I first noticed the light it was behind a group of trees that was blocking my view.  I moved my head around to get a better look through the branches. After 20-30 seconds I gave up and continued with my smoke.  A half minute later I looked back at it to see if it had moved enough for me to see it better.  It had moved, to the left of the group of trees.  I was curious what it was because it was brighter than a plane.  As I studied it I noticed that it was actualy two lights close together. They looked to be about the distance apart of 1 centimeter held at arms length.  The two white lights had hints of many more smaller lights or possibly a reflection between the two.  It moved slowly to the left and then stopped dead before moving back to the right(it didn&apos;t seem to excelerate, or decelerate. It was just moving or it wasn&apos;t, with no in between speed) and continued in that direction until it was out of site about 15-20 seconds later.  The two lights stayed the same distance apart and at the same horizontal orientation to each other which rules out a plane banking. As its direction changed the one in the lead that was the brightest grew darker, and the one that NOW was in the lead, grew brighter.  Its position in the sky was very close vertically to the tree line on the other side of a clear cut that is about 500 meters across from my backyard. The object was in my opinion about 1/2 mile away, but could have been much further as its size was hard to judge.  There was no sound at all(it was a very quiet night) or blinking running lights like you see on all aircraft.  If it was a rescue helicopter from CFB Comox (the largest helicopters in the area) it would have been fairly loud from that distance and it also moved unlike any fixed wing aircraft commercial/private/or military I can think of.  Im located just on the outskirts of Courtenay B.C. to the west of town and I was looking north.Since I reported this I found a video on the net of a sighting from Belgium of a triangle shape ship.  There video shows it from below, and also from the side.  When shot from the side you can only see two lights, again with more small lights or a reflection connecting them.  I belive this is the same type of ship that I observed.", "Three triangler shaped crafts flying in formation over Everett  WA.Three Triangler shaped crafts flying in triangler formation.The crafts were flying faster than any aircraft I know about.There was little to no sound, except a quiet buzzing/whistling sound almost a hum The crafts were lighted with a solid color of white light. No flashing or blinking lights were seen.The crafts were flying from the South to North.", "Saw flying object travel very quickly, stop, then accelerate againI went outside to smoke a cigarette, and out of the corner of my eye, noticed what I thought was a plane in the air.  I walked off the porch to get a better look because it was traveling so fast, which seemed strange.  It seemed to be two or three miles to the west, and still heading west very quickly.  Then it appeared to stop completely.  A couple of seconds later it very quickly accelerated upward and to the north, and was gone.", "blue belly: ship with blue light outlineing the bottom of saucer, white ball of light on each end. top: one white ball of light on  topblue belly:i have seen a ship, it had a blue curved line;a lighted line (the color of blue chalk on a chalk board) on the bottom of what appeared to be a disk shaped vehicle. on the front and back end, it had a small ball of white light, and on the top was a slightly bigger ball of white light. there was no noise at all.                     one night around 1978-1980, i was sitting on my porch with my 2 yr old nephew, and my small terrier dog was on my lap. i was around 12yrs old.    my dog became incredibly nervous, so i put her in the house. (my memory of the date is terrible, but remembering the incident is extremely vivid) approximately 5 min. later, after the dog was put in, i saw the &quot;blue belly&quot; enter the sky to my left, it seemed as if it had slowed down for a minute. it moved around 8-10 miles (from Tracy to French Camp) at a speed of (estimate:10,000 mph) for almost 1-2 seconds, then took off(probably way over 15,000 mph)towards tahoe for a visable 1 second.then it seemed to cut into the sky and disapeared. it left a bluish vapor trail.(i must say, the haunting image i can never forget was:like seeing god; it was so beautiful, sacred,and graceful; and there&apos;s nothing like seeing advanced technology in action:it&apos;s awsome!((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

Looking up into the cloudless sky, I observed four lights, slightly dimmer than stars, moving east to west at a tremendous speed.  It could have been either four objects in formation or one object with four lights in a chevron pattern. This craft was MUCH faster than an airliner and was out of sight in about seven seconds.

I could see an object traveling south to north (just off the outerbelt) heading my way.  It was a cloudy, gray day. The object was not traveling at a great speed, and it was only probably two hundred yards in the air.  My first reaction was to pull off to the side of the road, but I immediately realized the object would be out of sight by that time.  The object was round, and doomed and very dirty looking. What stuck in my mind for several days was the object reminded me of a picture I had seen several times, years back, on TV.  My reaction to the picture on TV was &quot;This round, doomed, dirty looking, fakey looking object is suppose to be a UFO.  No way.&quot;   I wonder now.  Because it was 12:50 Pm and the outerbelt was crowded, their had to be hundreds of cars that saw the same thing I did.  But they probably were heading to or from work, or had other business, and brushed off the object like I did.  The object did look like what I always pictured a UFO not to look like.

Sort of a rounded rectangle, it appeared to be grey in colour. It couldn&apos;t have been more than 150 feet off the ground. At first I thought it may be an unusual hot air balloon. Except it had no basket at all. I then noticed it was moving very slowly away from my position to the south.

Then right behind it came another light and then another. I went out onto our back deck and these three lights slowly (it seemed) glided silently and circled back over the trees. After a few minutes, they came over the trees again and two arched to the left and one to the right until they were out of my range of vision. I ran upstairs to get my sons&apos;s binoculars and went back out. Again two white lights this time came over the trees and throught the binoculars I could make out blue and red lights on either side of the white light (which was in the middle). Again they went over my house and out of my view. This Friday we had sudden and violent storm activity and as it darkened, there was periodic clouds and clearing. After the 3rd time, there were two-three more sightings-always in sets of two or three. Because it was dark, I could not make out the shape, but could through the binoculars see the blinking of the blue and red lights on either side of the white light. During this span of time, I called the State Trooper barracks in Wurtsboro to find out who I could report this to and they gave me the # for the FAA in Newburgh-I tried several times but it was always busy; I also called our friends the next road over from us being the lights went in that direction and asked her to go out and look; I grabbed my Kodak &quot;throw-away: camera and took as many pictures as was left on it but haven&apos;t had it developed yet. Unfortunately, my husband was at a meeting that night and didn&apos;t get home until 10:30pm. At some point during the night or early am, I awoke because the house and my bed was vibrating. It felt like a tremor and stopped shortly after and I fell back to sleep. The next day (Saturday), my friend called to say she didn&apos;t see anything when she went outside the night before but there was an earthquake further upstate. The newspaper reported a 5.2 quake in Jay, NY, and that two years ago on th! e same d ay in the same place (Jay, NY) there had been an earthquake of approximately the same magnitude.

They witnessed this as well as the formation which moved to the south.

This time I called my girlfriend and 13 year old daughter who did not witness the first event to come see. We watched them for approximately 15 seconds move to the northwest and disappear rapidly.

Well, on the night on may 10, I got much more than expected! At about 1 AM a meteor streaked across the sky; and as I was looking in its direction I rested my glance on a dark patch of sky into which it disappeared. A few short moments later a light appear in the dark patch. Based on appearances it looked like any other star, but then it began to pulse:bright, less bright; bright less bright, it continued in this rythmn for about 2-3 minutes then began to move from its location WSW sky(from my perspective) to ESE sky. It was VERY high in the sky and had no accompanying noise until a 45 degree angle was formed with me being the crux. In other words, if I stretched out my arms at a 45 degree angle and extended the lines in the sky, that was where the noise was relative to the &apos;ship&apos;.Perhaps 5 to 10 minutes later another streak painted the sky and disappeared into darkness. I waited and sure enough a light appeared and then began to pulse. What&apos;s more is out of my peripheral vision I noticed another pulsing. It appeared as if the two were communicating because when one would pulse the other refrained and vice versa. Again the incidences were in the WSW sky and started to move ESE.Two more occurences happened in the same way witht the correlative streaking prologue to the pulsing.The sixth event happened as before except there was another light which necessitates a brief explanation. Imagine a cloud in the sky with a bright light behind it resulting in a fuzzy light. This fuzzy light looked as if it was lower in the sky than the others but ascended straight up at an incendiary pace then disappeared. The sixth light began to pulse and the seventh light appeared in the NWN sky and these two began the &apos;conversation&apos;. The sixth started its migration to the ESE sky and the seventh began its travel to the NEN sky. I followed them both until they were out of sight.When these things appeared as lights they were the color of a star-whitish blue, but the pulsing was red. This red light seemed as if it rolled across the width? length? of the object. Perhaps it had wings or was triangular in shape and had alternating red lights on both ends? The actual shape was too difficult to discern as there was a new moon.It is important to include Luke Air Force Base is les than thrity minutes away by car.

(I have never seen Mars before in the night sky and thought that this was one of the planets in the planet alignment that is going on at the moment.) I said to my husband &quot;Look...that must be Mars...thats right the planet alignment is still happening now&quot;.  We have been looking every time we remember to see if we can see the planets align with our naked eyes every time we leave or enter our house.  We have been seeing big bright stars that we are gathering to be the planets that are aligning...but this one was different in the fact that it was a BRIGHT ORANGE!  THat is why we assumed it must have been Mars.My husband said &quot;WOW.&quot; thinking it was Mars.There was a small but bright white star just above this bright Mars-like planet and it was very close above the star like maybe a centremetre at the most directly above the orange planet.This was all very interesting but not unusual in the idea that we were looking at what we thought was Mars.Then as we were almost at the intersection I said &quot;Look-its moving!&quot;...my husband looked up from the road and said &quot;What...Mars?&quot; with a tone of disbelief in his voice, as I would have also if I were him.I said &quot;No...the little white star above it!&quot;.He looked and yep it was moving alright.  He didnt believe it until it actually OVERLAPPED THE MARS LIKE PLANET!  then it kept on falling/moving down vertically.  It was descending at a slow steady pace.  We followed it to a darker part of the same road and when we got to the cemetary we stopped but about halfway up the road before the cemetary the white star faded out kinda instantly.I said stop the car when we got to the cemetary a few hundred metres later as I still wanted to stare at the sky (as my eyes had been glued 100% at this white descending star) and I wanted to get out of the car and look in the darkest part of the road where we were now at.  My husband wouldnt let me get out of the car as he feared we might get mugged and rightly so lol.  I also didnt know we were next to the cemetary or I might not have been so keen lol.I looked up again from where the white star had vanished about a quarter up from the bottom of our windscreen (we drive a small car) to look at the Mars like planet again and my husband said that it had gone...I said &quot;it has not&quot; and I looked at where the Mars like planet WAS and it WASNT THERE ANYMORE...I said &quot;What happened to the Mars thing?&quot; and he said with disbelief and incredulity in his voice &quot;DIDN&apos;T YOU SEE IT? It disappeared exactly like the little white one did!&quot;...I said with disbelief in my voice &quot;NO!&quot;  and he said &quot;Yes...I saw it...didnt you see it?&quot;  I said &quot;No...I was too busy watching to see if the little white one would come back&quot;...he said &quot;Well it did exactly the same thing as the little white one did-where is it then...look its not there..I&apos;m telling you it did the exact same thing as the white one did!&quot;  I said...&quot;What it descended vertically and then faded above the horizon in the same place the little white one did?&quot; and he said &quot;Yes!&quot; ON a side note...there was an article in our local paper about LOTS of ppl ringing in to report large orange lights in the skies a few weeks ago...I thought nothing of it as we didnt see them...and secretly I thought that they were silly and were mistaking the planets in the planetary alignment for UFO&apos;s...now I know better!  If we didnt see this ourselves than we would have thought that all those ppl that reported those lights weeks ago were idiots...but now we know that they are not! I read about the other reports from Wodonga and Adelaide on this sight with great amazement!  I didnt know that Adelaide saw those lights a few weeks ago also? But what about tonight?  Did anyone see anything tonight around 6pm? We also saw what we thought were stars too small and too fast and too horizontally moving to be be stars or meteorites on the night of those meteor showers a month or so ago but that was NOTHING compared to this sighting and whereas I could be fairly easily convinced that those were airplanes...I KNOW THAT THIS SIGHTING TONIGHT OF THE ORANGE MARS LIKE PLANET AND THIS SMALL WHITE STAR WAS NOT A STAR OR PLANET-BUT SOME SORT OF UFO.As for airports and military bases...well there is an airport in the opposite direction to where we saw these objects tonight...and there is a military base at Bandiana past Wodonga.What are these spacecraft/lights? And why so many sightings now?  Is it because of the theory that UFO&apos;s like to try and hide in the sky when there are meteor showers and alignments so you&apos;ll confuse them and think that they are normal occurances?  By the way I dont think that there was a moon tonight...we didnt see one.I&apos;m not sure if there was a moon the night of the meteor showers but it was also a dark night.I think I&apos;ll go write a letter to our local paper now...my first letter ever to a paper as I am motivated by the thought that there are other local ppl that might have see this tonight.Thanks for listening.By the way...the mars like planet and star were high in relation to our car windscreen..in other words it was about 3 quarters up the windscreen at least.Also there were no noises that we could hear and no other effects  these were purely light objects...in other words no &apos;craft or metal etc&apos; could be seen.", "A dark, vertical boomerang that moved slowlyI was walking my dog in town at about 11 PM. The sky was clear and stars were visible. Looking NW, an area of the sky was blacked out, at an angle between 20 and 40 degrees from the horizontal. Looking closer, the blacked out area was the shape of a boomerang, oriented vertically, wider in the middle than at the ends, somewhat larger in the sky than a full moon. The concave side of the shape was in the direction of motion. I stood still, and the shape moved slowly westward, blocking out stars behind it. As I focused, I could see that the object had a surface comparable to dark, polished aluminum, as the stars&apos; images slightly wrapped around the edges of the object as it moved. I saw no lights on the object itself and heard no sound. Its distance from me must have been at least two miles, but probably not more than five. As it continued to move westward it passed behind some trees. I tried to get an unobstructed view again, but by then I could not see it any more.", "It was a triangle shaped object with lights, hovering over a small airport next to a casino.I was driving north on Hwy 1 about 1/2 mile from casino when I noticed an object to my left across the street over our small country airport.  It was a triangle shaped object with lights flashing up and down around the shape of the triangle.  It just hovered there.  I drove slow watching it.  As I got in front of the casino and stopped at the red light I looked back and it slowly started to move.  I lost sight when I moved on.  This is my third sighting since we moved to this area 8 years ago.  And this was the only time I didn&apos;t have witnesses.  I remember my teacher from junior high saying he had seen the same thing several years before.", "dull red traingle forming lights seen travelling north to south in liverpooli reside a very short distance from one of liverpool&apos;s city parks, princes park. I was out walking the dog and was heading in a clockwise direction around the small man made lake when i noticed  three dull redlights in the sky in an unequal triangle formation. there was partial cloud cover and a break in the cloud allowed a fairly clear view of the stars. plieides, taurus, orion on view, although a fine cloud mist still blaked out the background stars. there was a lot of air traffic - four planes moving at normal speed, but a lot of jet noise. at first i assumed the red lights were plane lights but the formation was moving at exactly the same speed and had no additional standard aircraft lights as did the other planes. the lights appeared to be part of one extremely large craft that was moving far faster than the assumed passenger planes(liverpool airport is a short distance away and there is usually high air traffic) the planes, two of which were going in approximately the same direction(south &amp; possibly chasing) were still on view well after the ufo had dissappeared into cloud. this meant that the object was travelling at least two to three times as fast as the planes, although did not &apos;zip&apos; out of sight. furthermore, as i was almost around the lake two more dull red lights slowly appeared at the front end of the triangle seemingly forming the shape of two unequal triangles tip to tip.it is viable that the lights were from five individual military jets, but they were travelling very quickly and seemed to be lower than the other  planes, although i am not certain of this.if the object was one craft, then it was huge. it was above the cloud base, but semed to dissappear into it, as did the planes due to the &apos;whispy&apos; nature of the cloud it was heading into.n.b. i have also seen a similar thing several years ago whereby when reclining in another park, sefton park, during partial cloud cover two white lights travelling at the same speed flew by at the same speed. this was for about ten seconds.to clarify...the red lights where the same approx perceived size as medium intensity stars."]
