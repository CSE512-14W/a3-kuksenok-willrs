I then went back outside looking for it but did not see anything. I knew it was moving so fast it would already be past the trees. Then from the same point in the sky I saw a point of light take off in the same direction. This time I watched it till is vanished overhead. It got very dim and disappeared.

This is what hapened.We were parked in by an unlit country lake.There was a glowing, but very illuminating light in the truck. I loked out the back window and saw two crafts hovering( NOT MOVING) over the trees by the lake. They were about 20 feet from us. Once we looked, they slowly went right over the truck. We looked up and saw the underside. I did not hear a thing. I saw two oval objects surrounded with amber lights. The lights were amazing. The lights were a soft light but completely lite up us and the surrounding area. I could look straight into them without any discomfort. Anyway after they went over the truck they seperated. One appeared to land in a cotton field about 100 yards away and the other speed up so fast it just sort of blinked out. We tried to shine our lights out in the field, but did not see anything.

On Tuesday evening I received a message from my dispatcher advising me that a subject in Gilford, NH observed flares shooting in the sky in the area of Red Hill, a small mountain in Moultonboro. I and the other officers on duty set up strategic observation points and observed no such flares or lights. About 30 minutes later I was near the Moultonboro Airport, a small private unattended airport, and observed a military turbine helicopter (I was unable to determine the type because it was dark but, from my experience, it appeared to be a Blackhawk.) make an approach to the airport, land and then take off. This is not unusual as I have observed military helicopters making practice approaches to the unattended air strip in Moultonboro in the past. Shortly thereafter, I observed what was clearly a military aircraft flying in an area north of Moultonboro, most likely over the town of Tamworth or Sandwich, dropping flares. My dispatcher radioed me and advised me of a resident in Tamworth observing a military aircraft dropping flares.I am also a pilot and have flown in this area extensively over the past 17 years. The geographic location of Moultonboro is at the north end of Lake Winnipesaukee and at the southern edge of the Yankee One and Yankee Two MOAs. These two military operations areas encompass most of the White Mountain National Forest. We live and work just south of the White Mountains. (A New York VFR sectional map clearly shows these two MOAs.) I have observed dozens of military operations in this area over the 25 years we have lived here, especially at night. I have also contracted through the Carroll County Sheriff&apos;s Department to fly drug interdiction for the Nat. Forest Service and have flown all over the White Mountains and, while doing so, have observed Military jets flying operations at tree top level in this area. I have also been involved in the investigation of a military jet crash about 14 years ago that was participating in a training exercise in this area. The Yankee 1 &amp; 2 MOAs are primarily used by reservists flying out of Otis AFB on Cape Cod, the Air National Guard out of Concord, NH and I also believe aircraft from the Brunswick Naval Air Station in Brunswick, ME. It was also used for a training area for aircraft out of Pease AFB before its closure several years ago.All the lights and flares I observed Tuesday night definitely came from military aircraft. I am certain that anyone else who observed these lights were watching the same aircraft I was. What puzzles me, was the number of calls that were received regarding these observations. This type of military operations in our area is not that uncommon. Granted, most military operations take place farther north, deeper into the White Mountains which is virtually unpopulated. However, this is certainly not the first time I have observed military aircraft engaged in training in our area. This is especially common at night. In response to your comment regarding dropping flares over forested land, the dozen or so flares I observed being dropped from aircraft Tuesday night burned out long before reaching the ground. I hope this answers some questions and clears up some of the mystery of this event.((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to this witness, and the several other witnesses, who submitted reports in response to our letter-to-the-editor to The Citizen newspaper in Laconia, NH.  Based on the information available to us currently, we believe that the most likely explanation for the event is flares launched by military jet fighters.  However, this explanation does not appear to explain away all aspects of the event that have been reported to our Center.  We are uncertain as to what caused the event.

Now because of my flying experience I know that if this was a smaller plane theres no way in the world it could keep up with the jet.There were no sounds or anything with the object just the object and  the plane.

The smooth, metallic ball was at least 3 feet in diameter and weighed a couple hundred pounds or more. Aside from a series of numbers stamped on its slightly dimpled surface, the sphere offered few clues as to its origin.     &quot;It looked like it may have been in the sea for awhile, but we just had no idea what it was,&quot; said Segneri, a vacationer from Tampa, Fla.  Segneri&apos;s family wasn&apos;t alone. A parade of authorities from local, state and federal agencies examined the odd ball Wednesday. All came away scratching their heads.     &quot;Strange,&quot; said Isle of Palms Fire Chief Ann Graham, shaking her head.  &quot;We&apos;re calling it a UFO - an unidentified floating object.&quot;     Two Segneri family members first spotted the sphere Monday afternoon when the sun glinted off its surface as it bobbed in the ocean. Thinking it was giant beach ball or a stray buoy, they swam out to grab it.     &quot;We tried to push it toward shore, but it was just too heavy, and we had to let it go,&quot; said Tony Segneri, Marie&apos;s nephew.     The ocean eventually coughed up the ball later that day. Someone called authorities about the sphere, and the town sent a firefighter to investigate. A decision was made to leave it there and take another look when the sun was up. But when firefighters returned, it was gone.     That&apos;s because Segneri stumbled across the silver sphere while walking along the beach that night with her nieces and nephews. Concerned that it was a hazard to children, her relatives pushed the sphere up a ramp from the beach and deposited it in the dunes in front of their Ocean Boulevard house, where it became something of a curious lawn ornament.     &quot;We just didn&apos;t know what to do with it,&quot; she said.  Unable to determine what it is was and tired of looking at it, the family called police Wednesday. In no time, the area was roped off with yellow tape and official-looking people were crawling all over the sphere.     The Segneris had planned to spend the day visiting local sights, but instead cracked sodas and pulled up lawn chairs to watch the action from their back porch. In the course of the afternoon, police, firefighters, the Air Force bomb squad, Coast Guard personnel and an inspector from the stateDepartment of Health and Environmental Control came to examine the orb, which was parked on the ground beside a barbecue grill.     Various people poked, rubbed, studied and photographed it. They contacted agencies such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but no one claimed ownership.     The Coast Guard&apos;s best guess was that the sphere was some sort of flotation device used in a dredging operation. But the ball had no hooks or clamps where a line might be attached to hold it in place, Graham said.     Finally, at about 4 p.m., crews hauled the sphere to the town&apos;s public works department for safe keeping. In the process, the orb cracked in half along a seam. No little green men came out, just some old seawater.     &quot;There was nothing green, nothing glowing,&quot; Graham said. &quot;It will probably just go to the scrap yard.&quot;     Glenn Smith covers police and crime.

Very obvious in the sky, just hovering over the football field was a large triangular spacecraft, at least as big as the field.  It did not make any obvious sounds, but we were ina car on the highway,  so that presents noise of its own.  However, above that normal highway noise, there was nothing unusual.

It appeared like birds but only to big to be birds. Because they covered the ball, it appeared they were startled from the lighting and they flew into a boomerang type formation. There was a yellow glow at first turning to red as they drifted southeast, towards Canada.  When the lighting lit up the sky, the top of the building lit up white.

I then looked around and didn&apos;t see anything until I looked up into the sky and saw this round object with the same coloured light on it as that of the rectangle on the grass. I then ran back inside being affraid of being abducted.Towards the end of the summer myself and another counsellor and a couple of kids saw in broad daylight, a round silver metallic object with no sharp edges and no sound flying over the baseball field ( near the rechall).

There were no flashing tail-lights or any identifying light patterns that signalled any aircraft we were familiar with, so this was rather a mystery.  If it was indeed a plane that made a suddenly turn, it&apos;s puzzling why no other lights were then visible.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))Orange Bright Object Suddenly Vanishes: part 2, seen in Sacramento, CAThis is to update the earlier report. I spoke with my mother and she described the intensity of the light as &quot;brighter than any object in the sky&quot; (including the moon) and that it looked to her as though it were actually out in space, &quot;not in our atmosphere.&quot;  My earlier description was more of an estimate of size, since I was tired and not thinking terribly clearly.  Yes, it was brighter than the moon, though of course much smaller.  It was as bright as a firework, but again small, meaning you could imagine it being a planet, though in comparison with Jupiter/Venus etc. it&apos;s bigger, as it appeared on the ground.  She also was skeptical about the light being a plane landing light, since the light did not diminish before vanishing; wouldn&apos;t a plane landing light fade somewhat as the projection of that light began to make its turn? And why no flashing tail lights? Was this a distant stellar phenomenon perhaps?  There must be some other reports of this somewhere.", "3 star-like lights moving in straight line across the sky.

I asked my sister if she saw that weird thing in the sky...It seemed high in the sky yet pretty darn big because we could see it clearly. It was shaped like a jet but with NO wings or lights.  It was extremely shiny, unlike an airplane.  It appeared to &quot;float&quot; in the air.  We noticed other people were seeing it too.  It was DEFINATELY NOT an airplane or a blimp or anything else.  I was really confused on what to think because I have NEVER in my life seen a UFO. So we chaulked it up to something weird until my sister and I saw two more strange things some time later in the summer.  My sister and brother in law saw a formation of shiny, bar shaped UFO&apos;s in the day sky near Federal Way.

I first became aware of the object as a firey streak in the upper perferial vision of my left eye.  Thinking it was a shooting star, I quickly looked up, and indeed saw what appeared to be a very brightly lit and slow moving shooting star, (about 4 - 5 times the speed of a jet seen flying at high altitude) leaving an endouring firey trail in its wake. Just as I was about to dismiss the event as an &quot;identified object&quot;, my shooting star executed a series of very quick and very tight course changes resembling the letter &quot;S&quot; just before vanishing, more like &quot;burning out&quot;.

It shined it&apos;s searchlight onto the desert about a mile away from us for a second or two. Then my friend called my attention to a flashing white light over Driscoll Mt., GPS coordinates 32.11 by 110.27. When I looked to see it, it wasn&apos;t flashing, it was a steady white light, looked like a bright star. Then a second later, it took off to the right (south) at about 300 MPH (with no sound or acceleration time), and then disappeared behind the bottom of a cloud. If it would have continued on it&apos;s course, it would have popped out from teh other side of the cloud in a couple of seconds. Then the storm that was approaching us started to lightning.

I looked and first to mind it was a helicopter - but we could not hear it as we typically do for the Life Flight helicopter at the same distance and approximate altitude - which for the object we saw was about 8K feet above the water. I am a component engineer in the electronics design industry and am 46. The craft stayed - not hovering with movement - in one place and had two lights shine down to the water in cone shape with the wide part of the cone illuminating the water. The craft appeared to be a helicopter but had no wop wop sound. It shined a light toward our direction in the direction of east that was very bright as if to hide the outline of the craft while lighting up the water in an alternate sequence with each beam lasting about 2-3 seconds before switching to the other beam and often more rapidly then that. There were two red lights seen on the  craft separate from each other but close - if it were a private plane the red lights were about 10 feet apart. We watched the craft stay in one place doing all this for about 2 minutes. It then turned off the beams down to the water and the light shining east and came slowly east toward our direction for about a minute or so as if on a tightrope and then turned southerly angling toward Seatac airport at which time I saw a strobing white light in front of the craft, the two red lights, and then heard prop sounds typical of prop private airplanes and it continued flying toward Seatac. It was about 23:01 when I called the Burien police and told them and then called the Coast Guard at their prompting to tell them what we saw. I could not see the outline of the craf! t becaus e if was too dark outside.

They were in a V position. One at the front, then two behind it, then two more, and then another two. Me and two other work mates were sitting outside my house having a cigarette and beer when i heard a strange buzzing noise. It was like a loud hum and sharp radio frequency buzz at the same time. At first we thought it was a car, then the phone, then our pages, then even the fridge or microwave. But we couldn&apos;t have heard that noise from inside because we were atleast 30 feet away from the house. A small flash like a comet flew directly over us, it was pretty high in the sky though. Then two more, and two more and then two more. All seven crafts flew over my house. We could clearly make out the shape of them. They looked like air-craft that the Navy uses but literally 50 times bigger. They dissapeared every minute or so and then re-appeared with one large lige on each of them. As soon as i got my video camera from inside and ran outside they had already been there for close to a minute. Each time they flew over us the noise they made got more high-pitched.

It was admittedly rather hazy that night, though what kind of conventional aircraft appears as a bright light periodically highlighted by flashes of red and blue and stays in one place for exceptional periods of time? My roommate gathered three of his friends to watch the show; helicopters (we think, they didn&apos;t make any sound) had begun to show up at about ten past eleven and circle around the light. Wanting to be a bit more indulged, I went down to the street (East 3rd) and ventured west to Jordan Avenue to have a closer look. I&apos;d at first thought the light was much farther northwest, but apparently it was less than a mile from our dorm and thus slightly north of the campus, directly up Jordan Ave. As soon as I made the intersection and this observation, it arced up to the west very, very quickly from a dead stop. I lost sight of it for the trees, so I kept going west along 3rd Street and made a stop on top of the Ballantine Hall parking garage. I looked around and didn&apos;t see anything, so I headed back. As I approached Jordan Ave. heading east, I saw it again, motionless over a residential area to the southeast, seemingly about the same distance it was from me before. The helicopters were gone at this time. I didn&apos;t bother going after it; the cops were prone to patrol the area for party-goers at that time of night and it was late. I thus sat out in front of my dorm and watched it do practically nothing for the next half-hour or so and went back up to my room, as there wasn&apos;t much left for intrigue. I did some work until about 3am and went out for a coffee, and was a little surprised to see that the object was still in the same place, still doing practically nothing. It was in the exact same place for the duration of the same time ! period t wo days later as well.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object may have been a celestial body, but that is only a guess.

After about a second of looking at it through the binoculars the color changed and suddenly appeared neon green and a redish pinkish color.  It looked really amazing.  Suddenly the street light by my house went out, the lights of the apartment next door turned on, my friends house across the street&apos;s lights started going on and off, and the wind picked up and began to blow the trees rapidly about.  The nieghborhood grew quite odd for a few minutes with many wierd things occuring.  The object changed speeds all of a sudden and moved very quickly for about an inch and a half distance (that is it seemed from down here on Earth meaning it must have been miles).

I happened to look up into the south east sky at a passenger jet that had just taken off from DFW airport, that was traveling south west and that was turning further west. As I was watching the jet, the bright silver light caught my attention because of it&apos;s proximity to the jet. I thought it was a small plane and that the jet might crash into it. As I watched, the jet passed in front of it, occluding it just like one object passing in front of another one. My attention was focused entirely on the silver-white ball object that the jet passed in front of (from my perspective) at that point. Over the next two minutes, as I watched, the silver-white ball got smaller and smaller, as if it was receding in distance away from me, and it got dimmer and dimmer, and started to turn a soft shade of blue white, the same way the moon appears when seen in the sky during full daylight. It gradually got smaller and then dissapperared entirely, never changing altitude or azimuth in its relative position to my position on the ground, and then just dissappeard when it got too dim to see any longer.

All of those things follow the physical laws of orbital mechanics. These lights that I saw, did not. Even if they were naked eye, and even if one was pretty shakey through a pair of 10 X 50 binonculars, they must fit into the category ofunexplained and unidentified, at this point.

It was the night of the eclipse; also Seattle was having its air show. My daughter was at another camp playing cards and I had taken my three sons to a neighbor&rsquo;s camp to watch the eclipse. When it was finished we headed back to go to bed. As we came under the trees at our camp sight we heard a strange rotary sound as though rock was being ground in a circular Mattoon upon stone. As the noise came closer it slowed in the cycles of the sound. It stopped directly above our camp and a white light, brighter then I have ever seen made a pillar of light down into the camp. The boys who were about eight ten and eleven began to scream in a horrified whale as I tried to run out to the creek so I could see the UFO. No mom they screeched at me as I tried to escape then and run to the river. They clung to me so horrified that I could only comfort them and tell them it was all right. Then the thing began to grind faster and faster and even faster as the light moved away from us. Finally it sounded like a great whirring insect.Friends of ours were coming home up the mountain. As they pulled in and the boys ran to them they informed us they had just seen an orange ball of lightning.No one in the camp area, and it was full had seen or heard anything and there seamed to be a laps of time.The following day I went into the small town to get groceries. I heard several people discussing the UFO they had seen the previous night.Two years later as I told my story around the campfire at our camp at Sultan Basin a fellow camper ask me if this had happened in Aug. I said it had and he proceeded to tell me of the experience he had had that same night. He said he had seen it and that it was large and disk shaped and had shined a light down into his camp. He said he had shot at it before it took off and disappeared into an orange ball and faded out of sight, He said it whirred.The following year my daughter saw a disk shaped object hovering above the horizen. She ran home afraid. She was seventeen at that ime and her friend also saw it.Through the years we camped at that same spot. At night you could hear a whirring sound like mashinery comming from a distance. There were many sightings throughout those years.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I clocked it at approximately mach 3 (2250 mph), which is well beyond the bounds of civil aviation. It then pulled up and lost speed faster than I have ever seen a human aircraft do. When it slowed to a stop, it simply slid backwards until it was behind a building in the distance. Obviously, this surpasses the capabilities of *any* human-built aircraft.

I had just turned off my reading light to try and force myself to go to sleep because I knew I needed to get up relatively early in the morning even though I wasn&apos;t particularly tired. I lay there in bed and happened to look out my second story window and saw a small gray object outside my window. I wasn&apos;t sure what it was so I sat up and took a closer look. As it turned out it was nothing but some piece of electrical equipment attached to an electrical wire coming from the pole. I had a good laugh at myself and was about to lay back down when a quick flash of light caught my eye. My window looks directly east.  ((NUFORC NOTE:  Should read &quot;west.&quot;  Please see note below.)) In my field of vision was a two story apartment building with parking lights pointing in my direction. Directly behind that is a 4 story hospital. Well about 1 1/2 hands high above the hospital is where I saw the light. It was a smallish light - mostly white but every once in a while I would see red glimpses. The reason it caught my eye is that it was moving at incredible speeds. So I sat there and watched it for a moment. At first I thought thought there were 2 or three lights in the sky -because it seemed like they were chasing each other. They were doing impossible loops, switchbacks and S curves. I got excited and ran downstairs to get my housemate who was still up watching TV to make sure I get someone else to see this so nobody could say I was crazy. He came up and and saw the light too. He saw them doing the loops, etc. but he is the kind of person that quickly dismisses anything outside his purview. He said: It&apos;s just a light - probably a spotlight - and left to go back downstairs. I continued to watch it. The light(s) were appearing on just past the edge of a line of clouds from a front that was passing by. The front contained the kind of clouds that look like thick fish scales - I forget their name - like a tight pattern of small cumulus clouds but not very thick. Just past the front where I was seeing the light ! there we re some high cirrus clouds that were thinning to the point that I could see a star. When I first noticed the spectacle I thought that there were 2 or maybe 3 lights up there dancing around, but the more I watched I realized that I was just watching one light - the other must have left or it was always just the one. Anyway, the light was smallish in size - about as bright as say Venus or Sirrus and about as big in size. I got the impression that the light was quite a distance away because as it was doing its loops and spirals it was reflecting its light in the thin clouds around it. With my roommates thought of a spotlight in mind I tried to discern whether this was really the case as it was staying in the general vacinity of where I was looking - namely just above the hosiptal. I quickly dismissed this idea becuase it wasn&apos;t showing any kind of pattern that I could see. At times the light was moving slowly and then it would suddenly move as fast as a shooting star. It seemed to be roughly circling something but it was just going around in cirlcles. It was doubling back on itself in extremely tight turns at very high speeds. Because there were some electrical lines in my way of sight I decided to go downstairs to see if I could get a better view. I ended up standing on the bed of my roomates truck and ended up watching the light for a total duration of about 1/2 hour - 45 min. Even though there were lights illuminating the parking lot across the street the light could still be easily seen darting in and out of clouds and doing its dance. The light was not constant in that I could always see it. For brief moments it would disappear behind the clouds or moved so fast that my eyes had to catch up with it. It watched it until another line of thick clouds obscured the light and I thought it was over so I went back to bed. Once upsatairs and in bed I took one last look outside and saw the light one last time - this time it shot straight up and that was it.  I never thought I&apos;d be reporting a UFO though I&apos;ve alw! ays want ed to see one. I&apos;m currently an umemployed fine artist and I had just moved here less than a week ago. I like to think that I have an excellent eye for detail and have enough control over my emotions not to latch on to any one idea, having a very open mind. I was a Benedictine monk for 2 years and had just recently finished a 6 month stint infiltrating and gathering information on a racist organization. (if you could leave that part out it would be greatly appreciated). I am telling you this to let you know that although I may be eccentric and in some folks eyes considered weird - I have my head firmly planted on my shoulders. Also I was completely sober throughout the whole experience. I would like to know if anyone else in this area had seen this light. The next day I looked at a map to see what falls directly east of where I live. The Ohio river is directly east of me along with a neighborhood and right on the river I saw the Louisville/Jefferson county Riverport Authority which according to my map which was dated 1995 was still under construction.

Except for the dog, we were all very silent as the small triangle of lights flew over us.  i had to cover my dog&apos;s mouth for a few seconds to hear the faint high pitched hovering or humming sounds coming from up above.  you could only hear them if you listened carefully because they were so far away but they sort of sounded like a swarm of Bees.  my cousin said in a nervous voice &quot;lets get out of here!&quot; after the lights passed over us and continued flying south, they disappeared completely. me, ((name deleted)), and my cousin were silent for a moment but the dog continued barking.   i asked my cousin what the heck that could have been.  and he didn&apos;t know, neither did i, nor billy. No one of us slept for a few nights becare it was really a hard to forget, scary experience.  we have told a few people about this but no one believes us. We don&apos;t do drugs, and as neither of us had any money for liquor that night, no one of were drinking and we were totally sober.  it&apos;s something none of us will every forget.((NUFORC Note:  We will request corroborative reports from the other two witnesses (excluding the dog).

However, it was at least 3 or 4 years before the death of my dad, who was the other witness to this phenomona.  3 bright lights that did not move as airplanes and lined up one after the other.  Precisely, they flew in laze curves.Secondly, I have seen the standard gear on planes to know a jet, or a helicopter from an object that puts out a blinking white glow or a solid white glow.  A UFO doesn&apos;t resemble a jet or a helicopter.  And it is very easy to tell them apart.  A UFO will actually fly higher and faster than the commercial jets.  Dad and I used to spend many hours on summer evenings looking for the space ships when I was a kid.Finally, of this night in question, not meteors, meteors leave trails.  Nor do they closely trail each other low in the sky over the area near CDA.  They do not travel as though they were manned.  I have seen meteors too, they do not act as UFOs.  Folks, I neither hoax nor joke.  Dad is dead now, but I still remember this event very well.In closing, how well does a &quot;weather ballon&quot; shine at night.  Does it have an internal &quot;light source&quot;?  How fast do &quot;weather balloons&quot; travel to out speed air force fighter jets?  The attempt to debunk becomes ludicrous on the facts.  Further, how fast can &quot;Venus travel&quot; if you are laying down and watching the night sky and see &quot;Venus&quot; blinking and moving very fast from one horizon to another from the north to the south, to the east, to the west.  Isn&apos;t that strange behavior for a planet?((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1996 is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in June 1996.

Suddenly vanished at about 21.40.", "Black object hanging in the sky possible cause of geese flock disappearanceThis was a dark or black sphere shaped object that was hanging about 200 ft above the Rio Grande river near Albuquerque. I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of where I was working at the time, eating a snack and waiting to clock in to work, when I noticed a flock of geese circling above the river just behind the building where I worked. They were in their usual &quot;V&quot; shaped formation but instead of flying off into the distance, they appeared to be confused as to what direction to go. They seemed to be concerned because they were not making their usual honking while traveling sounds, instead the sounds where different, more high pitched and stressfull. I watched them circle and listened to their cries for 4-5 minutes, then as I was reaching over to the passenger seat for the other half of my sandwich, the sounds stopped. I took a bite, a sip of my drink and intended to resumed my observation, but the geese were gone, dissapeared within the 10-15 seconds that I looked away. I got out of my car immediatly and looked all around the sky to see where they may have decided to fly off to, but they had dissapeared altogether. The last time I saw them they were circling above the parking lot, not enough time for them to fly out of sight or to land at the Rio Grande river a quarter mile away. This was very strange, and I was in disbelief that they could have vanished. As I was still searching for the lost geese I noticed a dark, round object hanging above the river south of my position and about a mile away. I guessed it to be 10-15 feet in diameter and about 200 ft above the Rio Grande River. At first I thought it to be a large balloon tied to a string because it seemed to move a bit from side to side and up and down, but then I realized that if it were tied down and the wind was pushing against it, the movement would be in the shape of an arc, this was not. It seemed to be trying to maintain a particular position drifting +/- 15 to 20 ft on a horizontal or verticle plane. Two hours later and just before su! nset whi le on my first work break, I went back outside and it was still there. I pointed it out to someone else who confirmed it, but expressed no curiosity about what it might be.In conclusion: I am thinking that this hanging object may have caused a kind of navigation problem for the geese, causing their stress and confusion. But because of their dissappearance, it may have opened or closed a gateway in time or place. The geese may have been traveling in one place or time, and then suddenly emerged from or vanished into another.Second Sighting: I had nearly forgot about that sighting until I saw it again, this time in Oak Ridge nearly three years later. It was the first week in June 2002 about an hour before sunset. This time it was a little further away, maby a mile and a half and floating about the same hight above the ground as before, which I guess to be about 200 ft. It had the same characteristics as before of drifting on a horizontal and verticle plane, and not in an arc which would suggest it was tied to string or rope. I watched it for 30 mins or so in its stationary position, but as the sun began to set I noticed the object getting smaller and smaller, and believed that it was now moving further away from me in a northern direction. Finally it was so small I could no longer see it in the dim light of dusk.", "Flashing red, blue, yellow, green lights - stationery object.Noticed what appeared to be a hovering helicopter with red, blue, green, yellow flashing lights, but was quite some distance into sky.

Noticed four others around it but they seem much further away.", "hovering craftI was at a friends house in Belleville.  I went outside to watch the metor shower.  My friend was inside sleeping.  I was watching the metors for a while when I noticed a strange object in the sky off to my right.  It seemed to be just hovering there &amp; was dark in color.  At first, I just passed it off as some sort of metor or a star.  But after sitting outside for a while, I noticed it was still in the same area, justhovering.  If it was a metor or str it would have been moving, because the other strs &amp; metors in the sky were moving, but this was just hovering.  I got up from my seat and started string at it.  Then I relized it was metalic in color.  It was kind of low to the ground &amp; just hovering there, it had kind of a dome on top of it.  Then I decided to walk closer to get a better look at it. As I was walking closer to it, it just took off &amp; disappeared into the night sky.  This kind of gave me the chills &amp; scred me so I ended up going in the house afterwards &amp; not even finishing watching the metor shower.  This object was not really making any noise, except like a humming noise of some sort.", "Oval shaped craft with red green and white lights with windows,that had a grayish beam coming down- usOval shaped with 1 red light, 1 green light, several white lights around craft, no noice. The craft came right above our open mesh tent, where it hovered above us, with a grayish,tunneled beam started coming down towards us. Many windows were noted  at this time. Camping, and hunting, on Imuruk Basin (lake), the craft came across the lake about 50 feet above water silently,then rose to about 100 ft.Coming across the lake it looked to be about the size of a cessna 206, above us it appeared to be about 100x100 ft.in size.

At about 22.40 I went out side to look at the sky. It was filled with stars. I was looking in a easterly direction at a group of bright starts.I saw the lights of a airplane going in a general direction of north east to south east.Stand still and raising you ary in line with the airplane I wouls say it was about a thirty degree elevation from the horizontal. It was moving at the speed you would normaly see from a airplane. I looked back to the large group of stars when I saw what looked like a bright star moving,I thought it was just my eyes , that it was not moving. As I kept watching I could tell it was moving and very fast. It was twice as high as the airplane,moving in the same direction.Holdinf my army straight and putting my thumb under thi light it was about half of the size of my thumb nail.As I watched i could see that this light was not white like to stars, by more of a yellow.I dont know how to judge speed, but I can tell you that it must have been traveling about 6 times faster that the airplane. It only took about nine seconds to travel across the sky and move over the horizon. I watched this light move across the sky using stars to try to gage it speed I dont know the distance between the stars but it went across the path of three stars an about a second and a half.I never see anything like it before. I saw the space station go over heard one night about 4 years ago,and thought that moved very fast. What I seen was higher in the sky and moving faster,.((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station was visible over Indiana from 21:12 to 21:17 hrs. on this date.

Kind of secluded with bunches of trees all around.  It was about 9:30-10:00 pm and I had stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and decided to look up and I saw a small star(?) moving along slowly across the sky. A few minutes later I saw 2 very bright lights that looked like huge stars stream across the sky...almost like they were chasing each other. They were moving so fast I saw them about a split second each maybe? Now I watch x-files and unsolved mysteries and all that is going through my mind is abduction so I turn and run in the house. I sit there and decide it was 2 shooting stars that I saw. I went back outside and ever so often I would see these lights darting through the trees and across the sky. I say I was out there about an hour and I saw these lights maybe 7 or 8 times through out that period of time. Each time these &quot;sighting&quot; lasted between 10 seconds to maybe a minute. I thought maybe they were fireflies but the lights were white not yellow. And they moved so quickly with no sound at all...they usually started out in almost a straight path, then they would change direction instantly and just zig zag a little bit. They blinked every...2 seconds maybe? Not blink like an airplane but like someone turning on a light every 2 seconds and turning it back off after a split second. Its hard to explain...darkenss for 2 seconds and then light for a split second. I could usually only see them through the trees but a few times they came out in open sky and they were moving so fast that there was almost a small streak behind them that made them look oval shaped...either that or they were already oval shaped i dont know. I could not really see them for too long. The only way I could really have a chance to really inspect their shape was to guess where the next light would show and sometimes they would change direction and be so quick that I would just see it out of the corner of my eye. This is so hard to explain. It moved cross the entire sky i! n about 5 or 6 blinks. Then it would be gone and come back in a couple of minutes. Sometimes it would make an entire spuratic circle around the yard through the trees. Then I saw a 3rd shooting star zip across the sky in a split second. I guess it could have been fireflies...i dont really know their behavior. I know for a fact it was not any kind of aircraft known to man yet. Can fireflies move in a straight line almost, skip around very quickly at will, are they that fast and bright, do they blink as systematically as an airplane would...as on-point as a computer cursor is when it blinks? These things could move so fast sometimes I couldnt keep up. If anything...it was quite a light show. A few airplanes came through the area while I was out there also.  After about an hour the lights were gone.  I am going back out there tonight to see what I can find.  Maybe get a picture.  I had seen something like this before in the same spot but I was inside looking outside and only saw it for a brief moment a few months ago.  I have read the other messages posted here and there are a few that sound similar to what I saw.  If it wasnt fireflies...it was incredible...I have never seen anything like it.

I had sat in a chair looking up into the sky, and had seen a few coming through the atmosphere. I had seen a few passenger jets go over, and noticed something moving to my left, i looked up and saw 2 dark grey objects, which i thought at first was a meteor breaking up. So i looked closer, i noticed that they werent meteors as they werent burning up. It was 2 UFO&apos;s, they looked triangular, although it was hard to see as they were dark grey against a black sky. The 2 objects were moving close to each other, occasionally moving apart, or one infront of the other, they were travelling from west to east at a very fast speed. I thought they may have been fighter jets, but there was no light from the rear as you would expect. They passed over head and had gone out of my vision in about 6 seconds, i listened out for any sounds that might tell if they were jets, but they were completly silent. So they must have been using propulsion technology that doesnt involve burning fuel as there was no sound, or no light from the craft.

I have been noticing on several occasions in the late evening, flying crafts traveling either due North or due South at high rates of speed.

My friend dropped me off at my house at 9:27pm one evening in january of 2001 it was most likely after the 10th, but before the 14th (which is the day I went back to school).  My friend and I had just gotten back from town when I stepped out of the vehicle and then he left.  For some reason both of my parents came out of the front door of the house and out onto the side walk.  I asked them why they came out and at that exact moment all three of us looked up at the sky (it was a very clear winter night, no clouds at all) we saw a very large and strange circular object flying overhead.  The only reason we noticed the object was because of the different array of lights (it did not make any noise, but an airplane would flying so low).  My mouth gaped open because I knew exactly what I was and so did my mother.  My father was very skeptical, but we all concluded most diffinitely it was not an airplane, helicopter, stealth bomber, weather balloon or anything we had ever seen before or anything else that people blame these accounts on.  The circular craft flew very slowly and did not make any noise.  The craft was at a very low altitude (I will venture to say 300 - 400 feet) and we watched it for about 3 minutes as it passed over the trees and out of view.  I know what I saw and no one can tell me any differently they just dont make planes circular in shape and that large.  And another thing the craft had a sort of central piece that did not move, but the outer circle of the craft seemed to be spinning very slowly around the central part i could draw it for you if i had some paper.

I am an avid star watcher so this was a great time to just stop and look up.  I noticed an extreamly bright star and stared at it for a moment, then it seemed to move and I looked at it harder and it almost seemed as if it noticed me, im sure that it didn&apos;t but the reason I say that is becuase when it moved and I really started to look at it, then it zipped down so fast and as it zipped I thought immediately that it was a shooting star but then then stopped, then it zipped across the sky to the left and I would have to estimate 100 Miles in air space or more within a split second then it stopped again, zipped back to almost the same location only this time higher up and then zipped what appeared to be straight up and then it was gone.  I cannot be sure of the actual distance this object was traveling but I know for a fact that there is no craft that the USAF has that can travel at such speeds and the flight pattern that this craft was making.  Picture an odd shaped triangle it started at the top zipped down then to the left then back up to almost its original position and then poof it was gone.  There were no sounds at all whatsoever.  Now to confirm something.  Where I grew up in California I was lucky to see the SR-71 Blackbird fly many many times.  I saw the SR-71 go sonic and let me tell you that was one fast plane really really fast but there is a catch to speed and that is a Sonic Boom.  When that plane went Mach whatever it did, there was a boom that shook my whole house.

It was quite cold with several inches of snow on the ground.  As we approached the university observatory my buddy noticed that the dome doors were open, there was some light inside and that the upper end of the telescope could be seen swinging back and forth in the opening about every ten seconds. When we were passing the building, we saw that the entrance door was open, in spite of the cold, and we were curious enough at that point to enter the ground floor.  It was a fairly small building, round and perhaps about 20 to 25 feet across. In the center, some kind of support for a small telescope had been constructed  to hold the telescope mount about 10-12 feet above the floor. This was surrounded by a grille platform.  The telescope  was a refractor about6 - 7 feet long.  The man using the telescope was walking it back and forth rapidly the lengh ot the dome opening.When we began to climb the stairs to the platform, he swung around to look and then exclaimed &quot;Thank god you guys are here.  Come and look and tell me I&apos;m not crazy!&quot;Explaining that he had seen something strange in the starry sky, he asked us to each look at whatever he had been observing and not mention what we saw until all of us had a good look.  The two of us each had, I believe, about 2-3 minutes for the initial observation, with the telescope fixed in position.  This was an old instrument, in good condition, but dating probably to the late 1800&apos;s, and not very powerful.  It was a cold, very clear winter night.  The star field seemed very rich to someone like myself who had grown up near New York City. As I began my observation, a moving light entered the field and traversed it completely in, I would guess, about 5-6 seconds. The astronomer told me to keep looking. I wasn&apos;t counting, but I would guess that within another 20-30 seconds the next light appeared, and then another and another.....until I had seen ten or twelve.  At this point I turned it over to my friend, Dick, and he made his observation.  Fun! But what were we looking at? Comparing notes, it quickly became obvious we were all seeing the same objects.There was an unending stream of eliptical or circular objects crossing the heavens, obliterating stars as they passed at a high rate of speed. They were apparently navigating an unseen highway, because each followed the same track.  The only details visible through that telescope were a gray bottom surface, slightly lighter than the night sky background(possibly starlight reflected from snowfields far below, but maybe not)and a thin bright yellow orange trailing edge which seemed to ripple slightly.  Some were a little brighter than others.  None of usrally had any ideas what we might be looking at, but the astronomer assured us he&apos;d never seen anything like it.. he then released the telescope so that it could be moved freely, and we were able to track these objects from zenith almost to the horizon, a traverse that only took about 15 to 20 seconds, I think. We each looked at another 25 to 30 or so, and then decided to call it a night, as neither of us was dressed to stand around in that weather. The other recollection which comes back to me clearly was that each of these craft, or whatever they were, arrived at approximately the same area the track they were following and appeared to make a little hop to one side and continue without losing speed, perhaps following a magnetic line to the north.  With the naked eye, they were essentially invisible in the starfield.  We never met the astronomer again, although Dick and I discussed it a number of times.", "I was on I-5 South around Aurora to Woodburn. The craft was a white sphere approximetly 5-10 miles away on the left side of the road. It stayed at about the same speed and distance for a while then changed course from south to west then disapeared into the clouds. I saw it for about 20 minutes.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After just two minutes of looking out into space (facing generally up and to the north), a large, very slow moving object caught my eye, emerging from the limb of a building rooftop to the NNE.  It was a dark grey in color, appeared to be more or less diamond-shaped, and it had four lighter colored spheres or disks on its underside.  The object was approximately the size of my thumbnail held at arm&apos;s length, so it was quite large and easily seen &amp; tracked even though it did not have any lights on it.  It was moving very slowly from roughly NNE to SSW, curving slowly to the W as it passed nearly overhead and then headed out away from the city.It displayed a slow oscillating motion; appearing to twist back and forth but with its movements limited to perhaps 10&deg;, so the leading edge never became the trailing edge or vice versa.  The movements were very regular, like a cam on a slow-turning gearhead motor. It did not appear to emit any light of its own, nor did it emit any sounds that I could hear.  At first I thought I might have been witnessing a stealth aircraft of some type, but the very slow forward travel and the slight but noticeable oscillating motion ruled that out pretty quickly.  Birds in flight were also ruled out due to the very slow forward speed and the lack of flapping wings, which would have been visible on something of the same apparent size as what I saw.After viewing the object for perhaps 20 seconds, I stumbled into the next room and grabbed a pair of 10X50 binoculars, then went back to the window and tried to zoom in on it.  I lost 15-20 seconds of possible viewing time in getting the binoculars. By the time I had finally got myself up to the window and located the object again, it had dimmed substantially and moved out over Elliot Bay; and I didn&apos;t see any more detail on it than I originally did with the naked eye.  After viewing the object in and out of binoculars for an addition 50-60 seconds, it faded from view; though only due to lack of illumination as it flew away from the downtown Seattle core and out over water. It was still plenty large enough in the sky to see with the naked eye had there been more light.The color of the object body appeared to be a dark grey; and the color of the four circular devices or projections on its underside appeared white or light grey; the only source of light striking it was the sodium vapor lights reflected off the streets of Seattle.   Shape was that of a slightly elongated diamond with significantly rounded edges; and the round or spherical projections were positioned just inside each apex of the diamond.  Of several unidentifieds I have witnessed in Seattle, this one had, by far, the largest apparent size of them all.  Its longer axis was more or less aligned with its plane of travel at all times.Actual size and altitude are difficult to determine as there are no clouds or other objects to use as a reference.  I would have to estimate the altitude to be 1,000 to 2,000 feet, and the object&apos;s size to be approximately 20&apos; long by 15&apos; wide.I&apos;ll try to depict what I saw in Photoshop and then email it to you.((NUFORC Note:  Simulation provided.

I and our chase acft. had just cleared the crew for take off when I noticed a light at eye level out in a field to the left of the hangar and runway. The light sort of wiggled and then disappered as I asked one of the other pilots with me in the hummer if he had seen it.  He responded by saying see what, of course it was gone and I just blew it off, when suddenly the light appeared agian and I once again said to my freind what is that when simultaneously a huge what looked like lazer light very white almost blue colored shot out in a giant fan configuration such as maybe a giant scanner.

When it finally got to us my partner had ducked under the dash of the Hum v and was trying to stay out of the scanner?

I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s metoers, or our imagination working overtime...or some rich kid on the hill with neat-looking toys.  One night a few weeks ago we saw a whole bunch of firey balls darting to and fro over the sky towards our west, and we watched them for 20 mintues.  Some came, some went away, and some stayed, and kept moving.  Some were going straight, and some made sharps turns.  Some got brighter, and some faded. There were no metoer showers reported. We thoughts some planes were about to crash.  Tonight was like my umpteenth sighting of something strange.  I woke of insomnia and was looking at the stars, when a big flash of light came out of nowhere, and I thought for a long time what a bright plane it was.  Then I thought maybe it was a angel.  But, as it got closer, it&apos;s path northwest to southeast, I noticed it had a line of lights at it&apos;s middle flashing different colors.  It was pretty close to the ground.  I don&apos;t know, it may just be someone playing with a giant toy to freak people out at night. I don&apos;t necessarily want to be contacted by any investigators, but, I can show you where the sky is hot.  North of town in Durant, Oklahoma. I have seen another freaky thing recentyl.

It was dark in the middle, and red glowing.", "It  scratches and gives electric shocks to the people sleeping in open area and flies with a high speed leaving a trail of light.We were on the roof top of the second floor around 22:30 pm on 08/06/02 while we heared a noise of a group of people and within a few seconds of time we heard a sound with a shooting star like thing coming from down from the direction of noise of people. This light was flying roughly 100 meters over our roof top. It took a projectile path  with a trail of light. The trail went aound 100 meters. The object then disppeared in mid of sky.

PD))", "Interesting aerial phenomena just after darkfallI was outside letting the dogs have their &quot;moment&quot;, before going inside to catch something interesting on the TV.  The sighting took place at almost exactly 2124, according to my cable box before I went outside (I was watching Junkyard Wars; got an addiction to it).  The angle of view that I have from the backyard is small.  I was facing due East, and looking up to see Cassiopea (just to be sure I could still locate it, I was an amateur astronomer in my teens).  I noticed a very bright light, travelling at about the same speed as a satellite.  It travelled from north out of Cassiopea to the south in almost direct North to South direction.  Once it left the constellation of Cassiopea, it headed towards a large fir tree that I was standing almost under.  It slowly began to fade out, to a dot, then to nothing.  The trees that caused the narrowness of my observation are in a line on the property line between our neighbors and our house.  I stepped back and went around under the tree to see if the light would brighten again and reappear (again, too much high end cable; I thought of the solar panels discarded by the astronauts from the space shuttle, that never really re-entered..).  Needless to say, it didn&apos;t.  I returned to my original position, and looked back up to make a sighting of the area that I saw this interesting phenomenon, and saw it happen again!  Exactly in the same manner!  Again I retreated under the tree, and looked to see if it reappeared.  It didn&apos;t.  During the first observation, I noticed a standard jet liner (Paine Field and SeaTac both have planes visible in holding/landing patterns in this area) flying under the object...  Very obviously under the object, with sound and all the attendant lights.  After observing this, I realized that total darkness had happened somewhere around 2050 to 2110 pm.  Whatever it was I saw, I firmly believe was of terrestrial origin.  Both of these objects had an interval of about 1 minute between sightings, and followed the exact same trajectory, and brig! htness t o disappearance ratio during the time of visibility.  I think that whatever it was was either, a) a set of high flying aircraft, that had no paint (i.e. aluminum skin or some other reflective surface), or b) a set LEO (low earth orbit) satellites that caught the suns&apos; rays at just the right place and just the right time, before travelling out of the sun&apos;s light and into shadow.  There were absolutely no trails from the objects, and both were exactly the same in appearance and disappearance.  I wish I knew what they really were!  I&apos;d like to note, after making a selection below this text box, that there were aircraft in the sky, but they were NOT chasing the objects I viewed, they just made the idea that they were LEO much more attractive.For the investigators: If an investigator would like to contact me I work odd hours, please leave a message on my voice mail system if you don&apos;t reach me immediately.  I would be glad to call you back and further discuss/investigate this interesting phenomenon.

I then asked her if she&apos;d ever seen a star that low as it appeared to be just above the horizon of the ocean. She said no. She said that if in an hour its gone we should get suspicious.

Nearly directly overhead was a brilliant light about as bright as an aircraft landing light but with a bluish cast to it similar to the newer driving lights on autos.  It was obvious the light was not a stellar object because of the size and color. The size was larger than Venus at its brightest but no more than 1/8th inch in diameter at arms length.  The light remained absolutely stationary for about 25 seconds.  There was no sound or other identifying marker lights or markings discernable.  Suddenly the object rotated in a circular path and appeared to rise rapidly.  The circular path would have been approximately the size of a dime at arm&apos;s length.  The path was only 180 degrees in rotation.  At about the 180 degree point of rotation the craft had already vanished down to a pin point and vanished.  The rotation maneuver lasted only about 1 to 1.5 seconds.  During this maneuver the portion of the light that was originally facing downward was angled as if the craft were banking while rotating and it became apparent that a light shaft was being emitted from that portion of the craft now assumed to be the bottom.  The light shaft was approximately 1/4 inch in length at arm&apos;s length.The instant the light vanished I grabbed a pair of 7x50 binoculars that were 10 feet away and looked at the area where the light last appeared.  Nothing was observed in the area where it was last seen.The sighting took place at approximately 10:30 PM mountain time.  The sky at that time was clear with numerous stars visible.  No cloud cover was present and visibility could be classesd as unlimited.  The only obstruction to view was the ambiant light of the neighborhood (street llights and entry lights on homes).

Upon exiting my residence, I looked up in the n/e sky and witnessed two stars like objects moving across the sky following each other headed north. After about a minute the one object faded and disappeared. I called for my father to come outside when the other continued north until trees and houses blocked it. My father was present during the sighting and he figured due to its path and extremely high altitude it was most likely a satellite. About a minute later after seeing it disappear, there it was again now headed south. It was on the same course as before but now headed south. The next thing that occurred was when it was directly in sight it began to light up intensely, (about 5 times brighter than any star in the sky) then dimmed again. This might have been due to entering the atmosphere then exiting again. After watching travel halfway across the sky heading south, it then turned 90 degrees and went east towards NYC. Due to the light pollution from NY, It became very dim and lost sight of it.

Took I-29 south, at approximtely 1845 hrs topped the &quot;buffalo ridge&quot; and was travelling along the Waubay nat&apos;l Wildlife refuge.  Shortly thereafter a large antenna field used by the US NAVY had its antennae strobes on, the weather was much better above on the ridge than towards north down the ridge to Peever, SD.   Sky was 20% cloudy but extremely windy and with a -35 degree fahrenheit temperature (the reason I know this is that the interior of that cars windows will begin to fog and ice up about 1 inch down and around the sides; at -40 they are completely iced over in side the car) the sky was partially clear, able to see some stars.   I was in the process of passing a slow semi-truck when I got neck and neck with him on I-29.   I thought the driver was asleep but instead saw he was slowing down, I discerned he was looking at something, so I glanced in the same direction West by Southwest.     The appeared to be the reflection in the strobes of a very large aircraft over the antenna field.  The reflection revealed at first a shiny silver surface, possibly the side or bottom of a fusilage but this &apos;craft&apos; was moving extremely slow and was huge, at least 100 ft in length.   As I finished passing the semi-truck, under several near instantaneous bursts of the antenna strobes  the was a 3-4 blue then purple colored lights which revealed the top of the &apos;craft&apos;, was slightly flat and the bottom was curved.   Severl seconds later, there was an intense flash from the object, while the strobes that blinked were blinking were bright this flash was like a welders arc, I mean damned near blinding if it had not been for the extremely short time of the burst.    I saw trhe trucker flashe his lights at me and put his cab light on pointing to the west at the antenna field.   I heard a loud thunderous bang, similar to hearing a heavy metal object fall like at a foundry or steel mill, only muffed by the dista! nce and wind.  I got off at the US Route 12 exit going across I-29 to the Conoco truckstop.    It was approximately 7:15 pm when I got because I pulled up to a pump and topped my gas tank off.    I told the attendant, a woman what I saw, that an airplane exploded in the air.   She said that i ought to call the sherrifs department, just then the trucker came in and went through the same story with the cashier.    After I phoned in what I saw so di the trucker.   The dispatcher said there was a depuites car in the area.    The Sherriffs depty came in at 7:35 pm, his car was spotless, as was his uniform and overall appearance; HE did not have a South Dakota accent.  As  the trucker and I were giving our  statements a rancher and his wife came in all excited about the the loud explosion and huge plane that fell.    When I explained to the Sherriffs Deputy that I saw no flames or crash on the gound-the rancher said he did not know the Sherriffs deputy cutting into our conversation.   The trucker and ranchers wife asked where he was from and he got flustered becasue as it turned out the uniform and car were recognized as belonging the the local sherroiffs department , the cashier was listening all of this we were the only people at the truck stop and the cashier spoke that the deputy was not from around here, he said eh would explain once he got our statements, later explained that he was on loan from near Aberdeen, SD.    Once we gave our statements he said that we saw a satellite re-entering the earths atomosphere.   For being a Sherriffs Deputy he unusually well informed, he said we would be contacted by the USAF after giving our name, age and phone number (he noted the sex of each of us, independently of his questioning).

It was sometime around 10 pm in the spring/summer time.A friend and I were driving west on Downs Blvd (he was driving, I was in passenger seat), moving into the Ridgecrest Heights area (which is very dark at night at this time).  Sky was cloudy and had been sprinkling earlier, clouds approximately 3000 to 4000 feet.  There were no aircraft that were discernable in the sky below the clouds.At the same time, we both suddenly noticed a bright, fireball-like object that appeared to come down from the cloud level and drop below the level of the hills to the SouthWest of town.  It&apos;s color was a deep reddish-orange.  It seemed to drop much slower than an object on fire would fall.  The object lit up the clouds and hills below it as it dropped, and once below the hills disappeared.  Due to the distance (approximately 5 miles from where we were driving) I was not completely certain, but it appeared to NOT be trailing smoke at all.My friend turned to me and asked &quot;Did you see that?&quot;  I confirmed that I had.  We both discussed it for a few more minutes, initially thinking perhaps it was an aircraft from nearby China Lake Naval Weapons Center that had gone down... but rejected this thought later as there was no flash or explosion or otherwise once the object fell below the hills, nor was there any sound of explosion at all (we would have heard it from the distance we were at I am certain).  The color of the object also bothered me, as the fire on most burning aircraft is much lighter... yellowish orange.  As I worked on the China Lake site for a Government contractor at the time, I assumed that it would be common knowledge of a plane went down from either China Lake or Edwards Air Force Base... however, no one I talked to had heard of the incident, and no aircraft was reported to have gone down at that time.  Not sure what the object was... and had forgotten about it until I found this site.  Initially I dismissed it as some strange anomaly, but after reading more and more of the sightings posted here, I have become fairly convinced that my friend and I witnessed some sort of craft that night.A quick note on the hills in question - These hills are largely rolling hills West of town and have little real height.  Ridgecrest sits in the bottom of the China Lake valley, so seeing beyond the hills is impossible when in the town itself.  However, due to their small height, any large explosion or other like flash would easily be seen above / behind these hills.Background info - I am currently a 33 year old male who grew up in Ridgecrest (living now in WA State).  I am a Computer / Network Systems Analyst.  I grew up in Ridgecrest, and was always fascinated by aircraft.  As a result of living near China Lake and Edwards AFB, I was able to determine the silhouete of just about any US aircraft at close and distant ranges.  Working on site at China Lake I also was privy to viewing testing of missiles, bombs,  and other such weapons, which accustomed me to seeing burning aircraft in flight and falling debris from such tests.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After shining on us for about a minute, it stopped shining as bright.  It continued moving north until it zigzagged and disappeared, disproving any theory that it was a satilite.  We were so psyched that we began flashing a flashlight at the sky and turning it on and off.  Another one appeared at approx. 1:15 zig zagged aroung the flashlight and disappeared.

I am confident it was circling because it would come from behind the object fly around in my field of vision, and then go back in behind.  The object was at least 1 or 2 Kilometers away from me and it was very large.  From the distance I was looking at it looked to be the size of a small building.  The color was steady orange and at the end the object simply faded out and disappeard, but I could still see the smoke that was coming from it disipating.  I could see the other object still circling with the stars in behind.  The other thing I forgot to mention was that this was a clear night with the Moon shining down.  This is the first and only time I have ever seen anything like this. It was definetly a new one to me.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "multi colored triangleAt around 2 am myself and a couple of friends were camping at my parents cottage we were sitting by the beach and to the left over the channel and tree line i saw these diferent coloured lights seem to come together and make a triangle mass wich then moved over the trees fairly low and with no sound .i turned to my friend and asked h if he see,s the same thing as me and yes he did so we stood up amazed and watched it move across ther sky when my other friend ran to get her digital cam up at the cottage,but when she returned it was for gone across the sky and dissapeared out of our sight.my friend and i ran down the road to try and get another look but we were in  a pretty dense wooded area and couldnt really see through the trees.We waited up a few more hours but it never came back.we told some of the locals the next day but noone else had seen it.i was kinda reluctant to report this but less than a week ago  there was another sighting in nova scotia of the same damn thing in a place called cow bay.", "Over about a 15-minute period, I saw either 6 or 7 bright white, rice-shaped objects moving steadily across the sky.At about 6:45 in the evening (it was still light out), I saw two rice-shaped white objects in the sky.  They were moving parallel to one other, somewhat slowly, but steadily.  A minute or so after they disappeared from sight, I saw another similar object moving in approximately the same direction.  Shortly after that one disappeared, I saw another one moving in the opposite direction (the only one moving in that direction).  I saw a total of either six or seven objects, over about a fifteen minute period.  They did not move in an unusual way, they just looked different from anything I have seen.  At one point during my &quot;sighting&quot;, (I would guess the third or fourth object that I saw) the object appeared very bright, or reflective.  That brightness/reflectiveness lasted a few seconds.   And also, during this (approximate) fifteen minute time interval, I saw a military aircraft (dark gray in color) in the same general area of the sky in which these other objects were appearing.  A military maneuver of some kind??????  I am interested to know what these things were.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke to this witness as length, and we found her to be exceptionally credible.  We do not know what it was she witnessed.  We know that the beach at Hilton Head, SC, has a high frequency of osprey birds (&quot;fish eagles,&quot;) but we seriously doubt whether the witness would have mistaken these birds for something other than what they are.

However, as the craft came closer to allow for an inspection of the common blinking lights that planes or helicopters have, I discovered that it had none.The two lights that were visible were also in the wrong position for a plane type craft as they were one in front of the other. As the craft moved out of sight, there was still no sight of red, green or any other color strobe light that would indicate it was a normal type of craft. As I live where i can see planes and helicopters fly over the city on a consistent basis, I would say that the elevation was similar to the height of a craft at 10,000 elevation. It moved fast across the sky and was out of sight quickly.", "these objects darted about.  Quarter size objects with radiant light beams all around hovered in vertical line then dartedMy daughter called me from Richmond Maine to tell me of this event.  I did not see them.

The lights would change in size an color, but seemed to stay in a certain patter to where they would go. At one point the lights formed a circle and then broke apart and went into different directions. Sometimes the lights would fade away, or split apart, then come back even brighter than before.((NUFORC Note:  Ordinarily, based on what the witness has written here, we would wonder whether the he/she might have been looking at either 1) twinkling stars, or 2) advertising lights.  The report seems to present data that is consistent with one, or the other.  However,  it couldn&apos;t be both.  Advertising lights traditionally are not operated for 3+ hours, and stars do not change their positions.  We do not know what the person was observing.  PD))", "Two five-second bursts of multi-color lights accompanied by unusual mechanical soundsJust before 3:00am my wife and I were woken by a very loud and sudden noise outside our rather isolated rural house (1 home within a half-mile).  The noise resembled the rough sounds of a very large grinding engine, but was overlayed with a rythmic &quot;swishing&quot; sound reminiscent of our dishwasher.  It was loud enough and sudden enough to immediately alarm us into instant wakefulness and we looked out the window to see the sky illuminated by rapid flashes of red, blue, and green lights (not isolated in any specific area, just covering the 15-degrees of arc or so we can see between the eves of our house and the trees surrounding our home).  The sounds and lights abruptly stopped after fix seconds or so.  There was a pause of perhaps ten seconds while we tried to figure out what it could have been, and then the lights and sounds resumed and lasted for another five seconds.  The power died sometime during these two events.  We ran outside at this point, but the sky was completely clear (no cloud cover to reflect light effects from ground-level).Five to ten minutes later we noticed the contrail of a high-altitude military jet coming from the direction of the Whidbey Island Naval Station and heading due east perhaps a dozen miles south of us.My best hypothesis is that perhaps the lights and sounds were an electrical effect, such as a transformer blowing.  The only problem with this theory is that all the local power lines are buried -- the nearest transformer is perhaps a mile away.I hopped in the car to drive around on the chance that the lights and sounds had come somehow from an aircraft in trouble, since the Abbotsford B.C. airport is only a few miles away.  During my drive through the cornfields I noticed that the power outage seemed restricted to an area of a square mile with our home near the center.I decided to post this based on another post here from Surrey B.C. on July 20th.  Surrey is only ten miles northwest of our home, and the sighting there was only a few days prior to our experience, and at approximately the same time of morning.", "Single pulse of light followed by a high rate of speed and extraoridanary altitude.We were gazing at starts and looking at Satellites in the sky.  My wife was the first to see a light that started to shine brighter from what we thought was a satellite.  It became brighter and brighter and then dimmed at the same speed.  After it dimmed, it continued to travel on a path, speed and altitude that a satellite would also travel.  There were absolutely no additional indicators that this could be a domestic aircraft.  The speed of the object well exceeded any aircraft that I have ever witnessed.", "looked like a flickering planet but a little larger than the largest thats visable to the naked eye.when i went outside in my backyard to smoke a cigar, i saw what looked like a planet, i check them out every night , i go to my garage and turn on KSRO radio station 13.50 to listen to the Jeff Rense show so i am somewhat familar with sightings etc. i have heard jeff talk about sending info to this research co up in seatle washinton, but i did not think that i would need to or ever see anything. anyway i saw what looked to be a planet which looked like a large bright star kind of flickering just over my roof line like i have seen before, but after i went back outside i went straight up and out of sight from what looked like it was sitting still. it dissapeard in just a in about a 1/2 second. i did not tell my wife because she does not take a interest as i do. i am a construction foreman an am recovering from back sugery so i have time on my hands and have been trying to find out as much as i can about ufo,s and ebe,s from classified documents from the aif force and all agencys i can think of but not having much luck.i have found many sites on the computer but not much info other than speculation. frustrated ((name deleted)).", "soft green glowing object seen 40 miles west of Edwards AFBMy wife and I were watching the sky for falling stars, the milky way was very evident on this nite we both observed an object, coming from the north on a straight projectory.it seemed to have a wingspan similar to a stealth.almost like a triangle though.it was slower than a falling star,but much faster than any plane I am aware of, it took 2-4 seconds to cross the sky.but it seemed to go perfectly straight.this is my first experience with anything like this, We would be very curious if anyone else saw this object.Right after the object passed we saw three falling stars.", "BRIGHT LIGHT SEEN SOUTH OF THE SAWGRASS EXPRESSWAY HOVERING  FOR A MINUTE  THEN DISAPPEARED.WHILE TRAVELING ON THE LYONS ROAD HEADED SOUTH FROM BOCA RATON FLORIDA, JUST SOUTH OF THE SAWGRASS EXPRESSWAY I WITNESSED A LARGE BRIGHT LIGHT PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FEET UP.

As we were heading to our cars, we were talking and not paying any attention to the night sky.  As we were walking through the downtown San Antonio skyscrapers, something caught my eye in the sky.  I suddenly noticed a small green ball of light weaving its way around a skyscraper directly above me and my friend.  It was so sudden and it streaked downtown but at the same time, the green ball of light was WEAVING through skyscapers!!  carefully avoiding to not crash into the skyscrapers.  As it streaked across, it left a green glowing trail as it sped away.  At the same time, two helicopters were giving chase.  But the odd thing about these helicopters were that they were silent.  I could not hear either helicopters rotors whirling, nor its engines running.  The whole incident took place quickly.  The green ball seen lasted about 2 seconds.  The seen helicopters lasted about 5 seconds.", "My inquiry is to determine if anyone has reported a similar event to my experience.  I am certain it was paranormal, but have never heard of any similar occurrences and have no bases for explanation.  I can only describe what occurred.  I do not necesarily wish this information to be placed within your database but wish to receive a response informing me if others have had a similar experience.I have approximated the date knowing it to be sometime during the first 10 days of June.  I awakened during the night with a sense of some presence in the room.  Looking toward my door, I saw, fading quickly, something which almost had the appearance of a hologram.  Next, shadows appeared outside the windows in an erratic shape.  I thought the shadows to be from trees moving in a strong wind.  The appearance was of a storm blowing the limbs to create these shadows outside the window.However, there was no storm.  I looked out the adjacent window on the side of the house facing opposite and there was no wind at all.  In fact, there were no trees positioned in such a way to cast a shadow.  I opened the blinds to see what might be causing the shadows.  I saw what seemed to be a hologram with the shape of two small eyes moving erratically outside the window.  I was frightened and closed the blinds.  I moved to another bedroom in the house and tried to forget what I had seen.Two weeks later, I was awakened late with by a humming sound and again saw the erratic shadows outside the window.  This time, knowing there was no storm or other possible source of shadows from trees or anything else, (I had investigated possible sources and found none,)I was very frightened.  I watched the shadows for 10-15 minutes and then called the police.  When the policeman arrived, we walked out on the back deck to investigate and found no visible signs of any intrusion whatsoever.  After the policeman left I walked toward the door facing the back porch and saw a large burst of bluish white light.  It looked unnatural, almost like a laser.  I wondered if something were trying to inform me they understood what I had done by calling the police.  I have not seen this since but am very curious to know if you have had anyone report a similar experience.", "On August 10, 2002, I was camping with my family and we were watching for falling stars on a clear night.

It definitely was not a falling star as it was traveling across the sky horizontally in a straight line and in a conrolled manner. It went from horizon to horizon in a bout 2 minutes time.

It was not a plane, helicopter, or a good year blimp or  air balloon. It was something unlike anything I have ever seen. It was a UFO. Again it was a Red/ Rust color but I got a vague glimps of something blue on it, and it was oval but round in hiegth and it it had something consistent along the belly of the  craft like air holes or somtthing it was a consistent pattern all the way around.", "((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from same source for locations in Arizona and Colorado.  PD))Several red/green randomly flashing lights bouncing in and out of an area with bright flashes (without lightning bolts or thunder).Camping at 12,000 foot Cumberland Pass, San Juan Mts. continental divide, Colorado; GPS coordinates: 38.41 by 106.39, nearest little town with more than 100 people would be Buena Vista, off Hwy 24. Over 40 miles of extremely bad dirt road to get there. First I saw numerous flashes for over an hour, that looked like lightning, but not really because there were no bolts or anything, at GPS coordinates: 38.42 by 106.22. At first I thought that was UFO activity. Then after adventuring all day in the area, I camped there again the next night. Both nights had no clouds, no pollution, and no moon or planets (Venus I think) making light after they both set an hour beforehand. So I was in the best stargazing conditions possible - the highest elevation I ever camped at by 700 feet. When I camped there the next night (after scouring the whole area all day looking for a place to camp with a better view of that area so I could see it again, which there wasn&apos;t any because the stupid forest people closed all the dirt roads, so there was no way other than mountian climbing to get a better view of this - probably why they chose that area to do their thing so obviously), I saw thunderheads in a lower valley in the same area, so now I&apos;m attributing the flashes to lightning far away in a much lower valley close to Buena Vista. They were also having some kind of celebration in Buena Vista, so they may have been doing fireworks (but why fireworks on Friday night and then none on Staruday? And that was only 12 miles away, and I think fireworks go higher than 10,00 feet, so I would have seen them clearly if that what it was). Anyway, I concluded that the flashes were lightning, even though not once did I hear any thunder, and it&apos;s weird that clouds would all be so low - all under 9,000 feet. All that time, while there were bright flashes every ten seconds, in the completely clear, pollution-free, cloudless sky, there were these UFOs going in and out of the area of the flashes. They randomly flashed red and green lights, not p! eriodic like regular planes (and car turn signals). They went into the area with the flashes, and then right after a flash, they came back up. Extremely high speeds - thousdands of MPH with no noise or acceleration time. It looked like the same ones I saw chasing a storm cloud from a commercial airliner in the Sierras in CA July 2001. Several times it looked like one would go and touch another one that was just hovering after it got hit ny lightning. It looked to me that they were sucking up lightning from the storm, then feeding it to ships that were more stationary. This went on for so long that I tried to take pictures. They were moving way too fast to see with binoculars. As soon as I got out the camera, they disappeared. Also, maybe this was just a conincidence since it was almost peak annual meteor shower time, but several shooting stars came from space and disappeared into the same area. They looked like normal shooting stars, but they burnt out and disappeared right where all of the action was. In my opinion, they saw that I got my camera out, and then disappeared. There were a couple of UFOs that didn&apos;t look like the gatherers (all you could see where the randomly flashing red and green lights), it was too dark and they didn&apos;t emit enough light to see them well enough to describe them. I did manage to get some shots, but I doubt they came out (I have yet to take the film in to get developed.). Got bored and went to sleep. I went back and camped the next night a little higher, 12,200 ft. on the west side of the dirt road so I could get a better view in case it happened again, but absolutely nothing happened, even the thunderheads in the valley, that I couldn&apos;t see before, produced no lightning or thunder. Lots of shooting stars, but none that headed into that area again. One of the most obvious and flagrant display of UFO activity I&apos;ve ever seen, and I see a lot because I camp at high elevations and look about twice a month all over the U.S. I think they didn&apos;t care because the only area I know of with l! ess peop le is Canyonlands Nat&apos;l Park, Utah.

(I can&apos;t remember the exact date but I may be able to find out.)  We walked into the village I think it will have been about 2am and we went our separate ways.   I was walking for a while down a street which was well illuminated by streetlights and nobody else was around at this time when a circle of light appeared on the pavement in front of me, it was about 2 feet in diameter.  It was as though someone had held a really bright light above me almost and shone it onto the pavement.  Bear in mind the street was already well lit up and so this had to be a very bright light, but there was no visible beam just the circle of light.  I didn&apos;t step into the light but I did stop and look behind and up into the sky wondering what had caused it, I didn&apos;t see anything and when I looked back in front of me it had gone.  Meanwhile my friend walked to his home which has a dark farmyard and he too saw two lights on the ground without beams projecting them.  I thought no more of it until the next day when I mentioned what I&apos;d seen to my friend, who was relieved that I had mentioned it as he wasn&apos;t going to say anything thinking nobody would believe him.  We have talked now and again about this for ten years now and still can&apos;t think of anything that can make a light like that.

I lived in Dallas but was working on assignment in the Houston area. It was Thursday night around 8:00 to 9:00 pm and I was driving back to Dallas (home) on Interstate 45. I had just passed through Conroe going north when my Ford Pick-Up just quit running, at 70 mph all the idiot lights came on and that was it. I coasted as far as I could then finally stopped knowing that 2 associates of mine would be coming by momentarily on their way back to Dallas and I&apos;d be rescued. I turned the emergency flashers on and went back and lowered the tailgate of the truck to sit on while I watched for my associates. After 10 minutes or so I looked up and noticed for the first time how beautiful the stars were out in the country without all the city lights to block them from view. I kept looking up until my neck started to hurt and then I remembered a 4 ft section of plywood that I had laying down in the bed of the truck. I also had several cement blocks among the other junk that seemed to always occupy the truck bed. I quickly got up and arranged the blocks so that they were under the plywood, holding it up at about a 30 degree elevation so I could lay down to look at the stars and still see the oncoming traffic. I laid down and began looking up at the stars. I had been watching the sky for about 30-45 minutes when I first saw it. It (the object) was really nothing more than a very bright light that appeared to be 10 to 20,000 ft. up.Nothing unusual, right? Nothing could be further from the truth. I watched this....thing....for what seemed to be about 30 minutes or so and during that time it went across the sky in mere seconds.....it made right angle turns......it got bigger and brighter and then dim again, it crossed the sky once more from east to west then in mid-flight just seemed to disappear. I mean one second it was there, then the next second it was GONE! Now up until this point in my life I had not ever thought much about UFO&apos;s however I was beginning to re-evaluate my way of thinking. Anyway, with that over my attention now was re-directed to watching for my associates and getting rescued from my predicament. As I sat quietly and watched for my friends it became increasingly clear that there was far less traffic on this road than there should be at 10:00 pm at night on an Interstate Highway, 60 miles out of Houston. Up until this point it had not dawned on me to look at my watch since I knew roughly what time it was, but when I did look at my watch I got the shock of my life....IT WAS 1:45 AM. IT WAS ALMOST 4 HOURS LATER! Reality started to set in at this point.....I must have fallen asleep and missed my associates.....but I DID NOT FALL ASLEEP! I REMEMBER EVERY LAST DETAIL OF EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED. This missing time thing was real creepy but I had more important issues to deal with at the moment. I got on my CB radio and called out for anyone that could help. After 30 or 40 minutes of doing that, I got a response. It was a partially loaded Car Hauler and the driver said for 50 bucks he&apos;d take me and my truck all the way to Dallas. What GREAT luck! In an hour or so we were loaded and on our way to Dallas. When we got back to Dallas we unloaded the truck and I thanked the driver and went into my house. Several hours later I went out to check the truck for problems. I got in and turned the ignition and it started right up. I never found any problems with the truck and it never repeated.It was a few years later that I heard about abductees and all that. I mentioned this to an acquaintance at work and this guy looked at me like I was a fool. He told everyone at work about it and then I was &quot;BRANDED&quot; The resident UFO Nut! It wasn&apos;t long before I was forced to quit this job and go elsewhere for work. I never mentioned this again before now.After this incident, my life took a nosedive into the toilet. It was weird. It was like I had a big sign on me that said &quot;UFO Freak&quot;. I went from a 6 figure a year sales career in insurance to selling cars for a living. As incredible as this may sound, I lost my ability to sell that night. From 80 to zero literally &quot;Overnight&quot;.I firmly believe that I was abducted that night. I don&apos;t remember any of it, but I know it happened....what else could explain the loss of time! If I ever find one of those people that can do hypnotic regression, I find out for sure. I hope that this is not too long but I know of no other way of explaining this to your readers.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have received many similar reports from across the U. S..

There was no exhaust but heat waves seemed to disapate from metallic surface. There were several different colored lights around perimiter of craft. Also on upper deck there was a rectanguler window which appeared to have 12 yellow lenses or lights behind it, of course as craft would rotate this window would come around once per revolution.

I heard on the TV news a few years ago that others saw it too, but they reported it, and the local newspaper printed a story about it, only I never reported my sighting nor did I see the story in the paper. But that story is in the news archives here. After all those years, I found out others DID see it. Are there any others on this site that saw what I am about to tell? If they did, they will know the city where it occured, and you can tell me by e-mail.It was a warm summer night in August (somewhere between the 3rd and 6th) 1973, when my 4 children and I were out in our yard watching the stars in the sky.The sky was so unusually clear. Soon two very perfect cumulus clouds moved into our view above us. Really perfect clouds, like a Disney drawing. There were many other clouds far away on the horizon. But these clouds were seperated by ample spaces of black, star splattered sky, and were very close to us. As we were observing this beautiful sight, a huge, perfectly round very huge sphere started slowly inching its way out of the top side of the cloud on our left. It had a green glow to it like a radium numbered watch. I thought it was the moon until my oldest child pointed out that the moon was to the west, and as I remember it was not a full moon.Before long there was lightening in those clouds. But it never went to the ground. After a while the lightening started going back and forth between those two clouds, across the star splattered space between the clouds, and all the while that sphere was slipping out of that cloud till it was almost completely out. Glowing steadly, not a flicker but that steady greenish glow. I thought it might be a weather balloon untill that very active lightening that was dancing from cloud to cloud, struck the sphere and red sparks flew out in all directions at the piont of contact. Then the sphere started retreating back into the cloud where it came from, and it took as much time to retreat as it took to emerge before; till it disappeared back into that cloud completely.All this took about 35 to 40 minutes to happen. But the strangest thing I can remember is that those clouds stopped moving in the sky untill the whole episode played out. Then the clouds moved on. I told my brother, who was in the Air Force at the time, and he made such fun of me, I never talked about it again. Have you ever heard of any sightings like this before?

I didn&apos;t trust what I was seeing with my own eyes.My husband and I were spending the night at the home of friends, in Keystone, Colorado.  This is a resort town in the mountains and because it&apos;s far from city lights the night sky was filled with stars against a pitch black sky.  I awoke about 4 in the morning and because it was chilly I decided to close a window.   I looked up at the sky and was in awe of the stars.  One particular star looked a little brighter than others so it caught my attention.  As I stared at what I thought was a star--I thought I saw it move.  I kept staring...and finally realized that it was moving...not a lot--but up and down and sideways.  Then shortly after fixing my sights on this &quot;star&quot; and noticing that it was moving--I saw a short burst of white light.  I kept staring and watched as every few minutes other short bursts came from this star--but not always from the same spot.  Sometimes to the right...sometimes to the left...sometimes above the &quot;star&quot;--and occasionally (very occasionally) from further out to the side...further than most times.  My mind was racing for an explanation.  A UFO was not the first thing that came to mind.  Frankly--nothing came to mind other than sheer wonder.  So I sat down on the bed and just watched...for maybe 15 minutes.  Finally I thought I&apos;d better wake my husband because he simply would not believe me if he didn&apos;t see for himself.  So I woke him up and got him to come to the window.  He also saw what I&apos;ve just described but had no explanation.  Unfortunately he had taken a sleeping pill earlier and wasn&apos;t as thrilled with this discovery as I was...or as curious.  He went back to bed but I kept watching...and wondering.  After about 30 minutes I noticed something that took my breath away.  Another &quot;star&quot; of a lesser intensity was located directly below the one I had been watching...and it was moving IN TANDOM with the brighter &quot;star.&quot;  Each moved slowly one way then another--up a  little then down a little.  So I started searching the sky for other &quot;stars&quot; that moved like these and found ! one more to the right.  It didn&apos;t move in tandom but it was moving just like the other two.  All three &quot;stars&quot; exhibited the light flashes I described earlier and in the same patterns.  Occasionally I thought perhaps I saw a red light but that&apos;s tough to tell for sure because I was staring for an hour at this display.  At one point I did see what I thought was a very fast &quot;shooting star&quot; to the left side of the two moving in tandom.  It&apos;s not that unusual to see a shooting star when the sky is that dark, but usually they don&apos;t move as quickly as this one.  And also, normally you can track them in the sky at a longer distance than what I saw.  This was so quick and short I questioned if I saw it at all--but I&apos;m sure I did.  I sat there for about an hour all total--and I&apos;m not sure what time it was although I&apos;m guessing all this started about 4 in the morning. (It was so dark I couldn&apos;t find my watch and there was no clock in the guest room.)  Finally, the sky was starting to lighten with the rising sun so the &quot;stars&quot; were fading and so was I.  As much as I hated to, I went back to bed.  I told everyone in the morning what I saw and I was so grateful I had woken my husband to support my story.  (Not that no one would believe me, but my husband is a very respected, retired businessman.  Definitely &quot;no nonsense&quot; and not one to say he saw a UFO.  In fact, he still maintains there has to be some logical explanation.)  As for me, I&apos;m 54 years old, and semi-retired.  I don&apos;t quite know what to think, but I know what I saw.  I&apos;ve never said I believed in UFOs, but I&apos;ve always left room for the possibility that it is possible.  In fact--when I returned from the mountains this afternoon, I went on-line to find a &quot;UFO Reporting&quot; site and this was the first time I&apos;ve ever even typed in &quot;UFO&quot; on my computer.  It isn&apos;t something that interested me--until now.  So--that&apos;s my story and I&apos;m sticking to it!((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the excellent report.

At about 10 degrees below the zenith, this vapor trail made a sharp turn of about 90 degrees and at this point, it appeared to continue on, parallel to the ground, moving straight towards the SSE.  It seemed to have crossed directly over my neighbor&apos;s house and it seemed unusually low for a chemtrail. This vapor trail was about 2 inches wide, overhead. I was mowing grass at about 100 feet west of this house when I noticed it.  As I mowed, I saw that it spanned about 2/3 of the way across the sky but no further. It seemed to have stopped, as though, it were freeze framed. At the very front of this horizontal vapor trail, I saw a motionless and intensely, luminous, white diagonal line that was about 1/2 inch long at arm&apos;s length. It was tilted upwards at about 50 degrees, towards the right or towards the south. This luminous line had a small, yet, definite, dark area at its mid center. I observed it for about 90 seconds and it maintained its position, just to the left side of a tall tree. Using the house and tree as a guide, I noticed no movement of either this luminous white line or its vapor trail.  I never saw any of this vapor trail being made although, it  should have been within my visual field while approaching overhead.  Everything about this sighting seemed motionless, as if, freeze-framed from my first observation to my last. I&apos;d looked away for about 30 seconds, to turn my mower around and when I looked back this luminous diagonal line was gone. Although, the chemtrail remained, its vapor stream abruptly ended at the exact location where I last saw the luminous, diagonal line hovering.This luminous line&apos;s shape was thin and rectangular but visually flat and without a shadow side. It had perfect symmetry with clean, sharp edges! . Nothin g wavered or dimmed. The horizontal vapor trail was rippled, as if, composed of many small clouds, placed side by side. The vapor trail seemed unusually sparse, semi-translucent, soft-edged and light-violet-gray in color. It wasn&apos;t an opaque white. None of this horizontal vapor trail was reflecting any sunlight. The sun was at the opposite side of the sky at that time. I saw no clouds, haze nor other vapor trails. I didn&apos;t see anything about this sighting wink-out,  fly away nor move. This wasn&apos;t a normal flight path.  The winds were calm but I didn&apos;t watch the chemtrail dissipate, either. I just forgot about it and kept mowing.", "Neon green flying object seen over Gillette, WyomingAt first glance it seemed to be a shooting star, but it was larger than a star and was neon green and was flying horizontally.  It has a large streak behind it, because it was moving at such a high rate of speed.  My husband says it appeared to be the size of a football, but was at least 2,500 feet in the air.  It went through the clouds and you could still see the glowing green and it&apos;s streak behind it, then appeared in the clear sky and &apos;took off.&apos;  My husband says it seemed to go at least 700-800 mph.", "Strange moving light/object over country border (Poland and Ukraine)The object on the sky was moving slowly on east, then it slows down and stop.

The object was close enough to actually be heard. My girlfriend says that the sound was like a light whistling(kind of like the sound of air coming out of a tire). The object itself (at the head or heart) was not perfectly round, it was sort of odd shaped, more oval with the sides being more square than round. The coloring of the object had a White center(heart), Black outline, and Orange around the whole object. The tail was very long and white. The object was lost sight of behind", "Bright light seen in the northeastern sky over New York tonight.In the northeastern sky, I noticed a light coming from mid-skyline.  I did not notice how long it had been there, but it caught my eye.  I thought it might be landing gear lights on an airplane but the airport is in the opposite direction, the object was traveling in the opposite direction, and the object was high in the sky.  The light was aimed towards the city as I think the object might have been at an altitude that normal aircraft fly, although it was hard to say.  The light was very bright, seeming like the object was just 5-10 thousand feet in the air (like a hot air balloon), then, as the light began to weaken, the object seemed to travel farther away (the trajectory path was not altered).  After 5-6 seconds, the light completely disappeared and the object looked like a speck in the sky (like a satellite).  My wife was sitting with me but I just thought it was a plane and did not tell her what I saw until the light went away.I did not get a detailed look at the craft, all I saw was a bright light in the sky.  I like to think of myself as someone that doesn&apos;t get fooled very often and is very skeptical of certain things.  I don&apos;t see but maybe one other explanation other than a U.F.O.

The horses graze on approx: 5 acres of open field. We usually park our Explorer near the barn, however this evening we parked in the wide open. We set up our chairs facing west,started a small charcoal fire in the Weber in prepartion to roast some hot dogs. We watched as the sunset, the sky grew dark and we began point out the usual constellations. We noticed want we thought be be the &quot;evening star&quot; in the lower western sky. As I tended the grill, my companion indicated she saw several shooting stars. At least an hour passed, we finished our meal, poured some coffee and relaxed. As i fiddled with the Weber, my companion said that the &quot;evening star&quot; was getting brighter and comming in our direction. As we watched the light grow in size, indicating that it was approaching, small colored lights became visible around the center light. I was the first to leave my lawn chair and got down on my hands and knees, the light had now become two very distinguishable &quot;head lights&quot;. The lights were now about 300 yards away, just above the tree line which separated the two farms. At this point the head lights turned downward and two beams were now shining on the tree tops. The &quot;craft&quot; was now moving straight towards us, the light beams moving down the trees, unto the ground and were then shining on the horse&apos;s pond. We were scared!!! We watched and said many things to one another. There was no Sound!! As the beams moved up the hill towards us a third beam shone down from the rear or side of the &quot;craft&quot; to light up the earth from which the two front beams had already been. The pond was about 150 to 200 yards away from us and the lights stopped about half way down the hill. There was still no sound. It looked like one of those police helicopter search lights, but there were three of them and no sound. The beams began to move towards us again but now there was a sound like you hear when you are on a jet approaching the runway and the engines have decelerated just b! efore la nding. All the while we are whispering all kinds of scared stuff. The ground was now lit up just 50 yards or so infront of us. Whatever this thing was, it was right on us. Then the beams went off and the blinking could be seen on this black space above us.It slowly began to hover southward, leaving &quot;our space&quot; I stood and watched it accelerate as it climbed, not too high and began to head for the horizon. At that moment while facing south, another set of colored lights appeared just southwest of the spot we had/couldn&apos;t move from. These lights were alot farther away and they started heading eastward and took the same flight path as the first. We watched the second light cluster disappeared. I started to look around the rest of the sky and now I saw the same distant type light, very far up in the northwest sky. It was the samre light as the first, but it was traveling at a good clip across the northern sky, then the eastern sky and then disappeared on the horizon where the first two had gone.

It was at the same height as our small truck- maybe a few feet higher. It started swaying from side to side like it was going to crash.  It stayed with us for about one minute and then dove down into the corn field and completely disappeared.  We kept looking back and never saw it or any others again.

Saw an early (just after sunset) bright satellite/iss&hellip;very nice.  Also saw several shooting stars&hellip;very nice.  As the night wore on and into the early hours of the morning, I saw a number of satellites/orbital objects.  Characteristics:  very very dim, some fading in and out.  One object in particular caught my attention.  A very dim satellite/object moving near the zenith (top) of my field of view, slowly dimming even more, then suddenly, a relatively weak strobe (bluish light, same color as object), followed several seconds later by a very very bright strobe (astoundingly bright), followed by perhaps another several strobes of various intervals/intensities.  Object faded, and was very dim to begin with.I have seen beautiful satellites before which are apparently tumbling and reflecting the light back to me in the proper manner to give me a &ldquo;light house&rdquo; effect&hellip;that is a rare treat.  But a strobing satellite ?  Do some satellites come equipped w/ strobes ?  My thinking is a military spy satellite with a given wavelength HID strobe where a high gain can be applied to that wavelength to amplify the illuminated image relatively free of noise.  Another theory is just an ordinary function of satellites so a ground observer can do a quick and easy visual check to verify proper functioning of the satellite (in other words, just another cheap easy, fail safe check&hellip;why not).  My final theory is that it may be part of a function to freak out paranoid terrorists (and I DO HOPE it freaks them out!).  Any thoughts ?  This is the second time I have seen this sort of thing.  The first one I ever saw was just a bit after 9-11-01, and was observed over St. Paul, MN.  Looked like a satellite, and then one HUGE strobe flash (brighter than the one I saw over the lake).

The section I&apos;m talking about is directly to the left of the restaurant Skyland, right over Skyline Drive here in Luray, VA.The two objects were flashing red and white lights, possibly blue or green as well.  And they were moving in ways that I&apos;ve never seen anything move before.  Suddendly jerk to the left or right, constanly verying speed and direction in a 3-dimensional space.  I know this because their also happened to be a small patch of clouds in the same area that the objects would move in and out of.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, the two objects were soon joined by 5 or 6 more objects that included smaller triangle orange-white lights that didn&apos;t blink or strobe like the others.  The strobing objects flashed in an irreglur pattern.  When they would go into the cloud, you could see flashes like heat lightning kind of.

This is the 2nd time in 7 months that I have seen similar objects over the exact same area.  The first time was about 7 months ago and there were two other witnesses that time.  We saw a similar irreguraly strobing light over the same spot but it remained concealed from view within a low cloud.I have never seen anything like what I saw 2 nights in my entire life and it was a very powerful experience.  I get upset sometimes when I think about it.  And then other times, it feels kind of like its hard to hold on to vividness of the memory.  When I do see vividly in my mind what I saw, it&apos;s frightening and hard for me to deal with or understand.  I&apos;m certain there will be more occurrences, as 4 other people so far have told me they saw similar events here in this same area, and I haven&apos;t talked to many people about it yet.

We were situated in our boat just above the Guntersville Dam on the Tennessee River.  My husband and I have both witnessed some unidentified objects in the sky and on the ground before, but we never really talk about them much until this weekend when something strange happened to us.  We were out at about 23:00 pm doing some catfishing.  We witnessed an object that appeared to be round fly across the sky just about 200 yards above some treetops.  It appeared to be comet-like in appearance but the trail it left behind did not fan out like most comets do.  By no means am I an expert, but I am quite sure this was not a comet.  It went horizontally straight across the sky above the treetops.  It appeared out of nowhere and continued for a long distance across the sky to only disappear in thin air.  It has an orange &quot;trail-like&quot; glow behind it, but the circular part up front did not appear to have any glow around it, it was just in front of this trail.  It was faster than any jet that we know of.  My hubby is an Army brat so he has seen a few up close up and personal.  There was NO sound whatsoever.  Okay, we were trying to convince ourselves that it must be a comet...however, it never descended toward Earth.  Then about 15 seconds later, ANOTHER one, but only this one came from below at the edge of the treetops and ascended into the sky.  It had a blue flame and it was almost on top of our heads when it appeared.  It had a shorter trip than the first one, but it was just as spectacular.  I have never seen a shooting star ascended from that far down into the sky and that quickly to boot.  I didn&apos;t think a comet could do that either.  Had we only seen the first one, we would have wrote the event off as being maybe a meteroid but the mystery was it remained completely horizontal across the sky to disappear as quickly as it appeared.  I would have thought had it been a co! met, we would have seen it coming from the distance and approach and then pass by.

TO my great surprise, and genuine startled sensation, a person in Rochester, (which is not too far from where my stepfather and I originally saw this UFO, in Ethel, WA) described a very similar shaped craft and an unusual time disorientation feeling both my stepfather and I had experienced after the craft departed.  For whoever wrote about the V shaped craft, I want you to know, you are not alone in seeing this. Both my Stepfather and I saw it, and we saw it within very close proximity and in broad daylight.Here is my account of the incident: My stepfather was picking me up from a friend&apos;s house at the top of the Hill on an old country road called Larmon road about 1 mile east from where the road meets into Hwy 12.  I remember I had rode the school bus up to my friend&apos;s house that day to go play on his go-cart, as it meant I wouldn&apos;t have to try and ride my bike up that incredibly steep hill.  We had left my friend&apos;s house and we were driving East back towards the hill, That is when my stepfather turned to me in the passenger seat and said quite casually, &quot;Look, a UFO.&quot;  My reply was &quot;yeah, right&quot;, until I looked past him and out the driver&apos;s car door window, then I actually saw it.  My stepfather slowed down the car as we saw looked in disbelief and eventually came to a stop there on the road.  There it was this huge upside down &quot;V&quot; shaped silver metallic craft.  It was hovering no more than 15 feet above the grass in an empty cow pasture right off to the left of the road.  I remember just sitting there in the front seat, looking at it, in total disbelief as to what we were both seeing.  It was there, in a field belonging to my friend&apos;s grandparents facing North of the road.  It cast a giant shadow on the ground, but I remember it looking as if it were just hanging there in the air, it was impossible for our eyes to comprehend, as it defied gravity, just hanging there.  The top of the &quot;V&quot; was facing towards the sky.  And in the center, I remember a circular domed area, and what looked like domed windows.  It was not a plane, as there was no noise, and this craft was a lot larger than a regular plane, or even a jumbojet, it was very big.  The house of my friend&apos;s grandparent&apos;s was just to the right of where it hovered, and it made the house look like a shed in comparison. We were probably no more than 150 ft from where it hovered above the pasture. I remember seeing the grass below it reflecting on the tips of both sides of the V.  It had lights, green, red, and blue.  I remember seeing the green light the most coming from the centermos! t point of the craft, where I had believed to have seen windows on the craft.  The light got intensely bright, and after that, I remember being suddenly startled and then suddenly looking out the window of my passenger window, as if something was there, I for a moment thought there was something there.  It was at this time that time seems to have skipped on us.  We both felt as if some serious time had passed since first encountering the craft, that we had something like a time hiccup is the best I can describe the sensation.  Like we hiccuped and we moved ahead in time, like we had been gone for hours, but somehow equated out to no time loss at all.  I have no idea if we were abducted, as I have no memory past looking out my passenger door window, I just remember being very startled and was compelled to look away from the light.  After I saw there wasn&apos;t anyone there, I looked back at the craft, and it was gone.  Suddenlt there was a noise, a very loud thundercraking sonic boom type of noise, but when we got out of the car to see if it had made the noise, there was nothing visible in the sky.  For a good five minutes, we sat on that road looking at a craft that was in no way shape or form anything I have seen before or since.  It was huge, and it made no noise.  We proceeded down the hill towards home and went back into the house.  When we got into the house, my mother asked quite sternly where we both had been, and we both said we just came straight down the hill.   She said that it had been well over an hour when my stepfather had gone up the hill to pick me up.  We lived no more than 2 miles from my friend&apos;s house.  We never reported it, but not long after that incident, My stepfather somehow developed a very serious and debilitating brain tumor and died three years later.  The effects of the tumor started to a few days after we saw that craft.  I do not know if this was somehow connected, but it did appear very strange when the right side of his body went dead and he started having seizures not long after our encounter.  So, to whoever saw this same shaped craft, you are not alone, My stepfather and I saw it as well. And I believe something else might have happened to us.  Although I have always been very healthy, I have the feeling that something else occured that day.  For whoever wrote their encounter regarding the craft in Rochester back in 1979 - 1980, I hope that these people will share my contact info with you.  It is because of what you wrote that compelled me to share my experience.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This was not like an airplane.  I went inside to call my sister and as I was speaking, the brilliant light slowly, very slowly, went behind the mountain.

There was another group there 150 yards to our west, The Greer Group (Disclosure Project).  Just before our sighting many of them were yelling excitedly.  My wife Ferne and I searched the sky to see what the excitement was about.  Ferne saw it first right overhead and it was three lights moving in an elongated triangle formation.  One of the trailing lights was a little ahead of the other.  Was moving slowly from north to south.  After a few seconds it made a banking 180 degree turn returning to the direction it came from and the lights kept in formation.  About 3 seconds after the turn all three lights gradually faded. There was no noise and a clear moonless night. The formation was directly overhead of us. Saw another triangular formation last year about this time but it did not turn as this one did. We did not see an object enclosed within the light formation. I tried to video this event but it did not record. I was trying to video record the lights and as soon as my wife said its a triangle the camera stopped recording and the tape was blank upon review. I did not get any video of it. I had the formation in view all the time as I thought I was recording. In one year of skywatching this is best sighting I have experienced. The lights did not strobe or look like lights on a plane. The lights were white but rather dim.((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),Thank you very much for the interesting report!I have a few questions about your sighting.  First, what was the apparent size of the formation of three lights, relative to the size of the disc of a full Moon, please?  Also, did the entire formation &quot;bank,&quot; or the individual lights?  What direction did the object turn, please?  Did it end up going to the east, or to the west?Did you look for the object on the following night, by any chance, or on any subsequent night? Also, when the lights faded, did they all fade together, or did they fade at different times?  If the latter, which one faded first, they subsequently?You state that &quot;one of the trailing lights was a little ahead of the other.&quot;  Do you mean that there were two behind, and one of them was a bit ahead of the other?Thank you very much for your report.  We will post it in the near future.  I do not know what it was you saw, but we would like to know more.Cordially,Peter DavenportPeter:  The size was about was a little larger than a full moon.  The entire formation made a banking right turn (east) and the lights stayed in the same relative position turning east and continuing to turn untill a 180 degree turn had been made to go back north. So after the turn it was going north.  The next night we decided to go home since I had to work the next day and clouds were building up.   All three lights faded out together.  ((NUFORC Note:  Triangular formation of X&apos;s deleted here.  They will not survive the transfer to the website.  PD))      The formation look somewhat like this, the top being the leading light.   We are going back to Mt adams Friday for two nights of skywatching since we were quite excited to see this.  The Greer group is supposed to be there untill sunday.  We are not part of the group, and the leader of the group has requested privacy from the rest of the guests while they are there.  We have been helping James with maintenance of one of the buildings and helping out in general.  We go there quite frequently when the weather is good to skywatch.  I have seen many moving lights while there over the past year, but this one is the most unusual I have ever seen anywhere and needed to be reported.  As far as I know satellites cannot do this and it definatly was not an airplane.   The one we saw last year looked like this:((NUFORC Note:  Triangular formation of X&apos;s deleted here.  PD))  It did not turn, was about  the same brightness, and when it faded out the lead light went out first and when the two trailing lights reached the same place they went out together.  The size was slighty larger than the one we have just seen.    If you have any more questions feel free to send an email..

My father was working outside and I was hanging out with him, when it got dark my mother called me into the house to get ready for bed. I had been in the house for just a few minutes when my father burst into the house yelling &quot;Everyone come outside quick you have to see this&quot;. I ran out the front door after my father and followed him to the end of our walk. He stopped and turned back towards the house and dropped to his knee,grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me around. There to the right of our house up in the black night sky were 3 luminus disc shaped objects traveling from East to West very slowly. I became so scared I ran back into the house at full speed with my father right behind me. He was trying to catch me to bring me back out to watch the lights but his foot steps behind me scared me even more. As I entered the living room he grabbed me and picked me up and said &quot; you have to see this you may never see anything like this again in your life&quot;. He took me back outside and made me watch. The lights were behind the house by then so we moved to the driveway to the left of the house. There they were 3 pulsing discs glowing brightly gliding through the sky, silent, silhouetting the trees that were between us and the objects. A calm came over me as my father set me on the ground, as I watched the 3 objects I noticed something dropping out of the back of them it reminded me of the tinsel we put on our Christmas tree. This tinsel like substance was also glowing as it dropped out the back but soon disappeared a few feet under the objects. I just stood in awe watching them now really starting to study them I noticed that as they pulsed at the dimmest part of the pulse that you could almost see through them like they were semi-transparent. They flew along and finally disappeared behind a wooded area out of sight. Then as I stood there in somewhat of a trance I was startled by the sound of the night insects, the katy-did&apos;s and the like, all starti! ng their sounds together. It was then that I had realized that they too had been in a trance and were silent untill the objects were gone.

I remeber he was telling me that a town right next to us, Dunedin, FL, had one of the highest recorded UFO sightings in Florida.  I shrugged this off, and started strumming the guitar, looking out into the ocean.  I was facing North West when I noticed 1 light far off into the distance, in the ocean.  At first glance I thought it was a star or satellite, or even a plane.  The sphere was barely a speck, red in color.  This made me consider the fact of a plane even more, until I saw it turn.  The turn was not a curved or graceful turn whatsoever, it was like the object shifted.  It was at one spot one moment, and all of a sudden, it dropped a good distance, then shifted to the left immediately.  I pointed this out to my friend, and we were both amazed.  We watched this light and 3 others that joined it for a good half hour, sliding up, down, at sharp angles, almost as if they were following a line, instead of a curve.  During that time, we saw one aircraft fly past, and the four red lights seemed to group together until it flew past their general area.  It almost seemed like the four lights were playing with each other, chasing and being chased.

All of those things follow the physical laws of orbital mechanics. These lights that I saw, did not. Even if they were naked eye, and even if one was pretty shakey through a pair of 10 X 50 binonculars, they must fit into the category ofunexplained and unidentified, at this point.

I was so mesmerized by it,I failed to take the binoculars off to see if you could see it with the naked eye! I believe though that if one would of been looking I think they could of been seen! This thrird time now I noticed it was on pretty much the same course as it was last year when I saw it! I watched it until it got to far east and then the lights just faded out!((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the three U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellites may have been the cause of the sighting.

I am an American visiting the UK for a few weeks.I have borrowed my father-in-laws computer to make this report.My email address is ((e-address deleted)) I was the passenger in a car on July 16, 2002 at 10:30am traveling along hiway B936 near Fruechie, Fife, Scotland.  The sky was mostly clear with unlimited visibility.  I spotted a silver spherical object in the sky approximately 2/3rds of a mile north of the road over a farmers field.  It was approximately 200-300 feet above ground level.  At first it was stationary with no apparent movement in any direction.  I thought it might be a ballon, although it was perfectly round with no protruding parts of any kind, such as a gondola.  After a few seconds it began to move towards the east at a speed of perhaps 70-100 MPH.  It passed over the village of Kettlebridge moving below the line of hills east of that village and I lost sight of it.  It was clearly not a conventional aircraft and clearly not a ballon.  The grid reference on your UK Ordnance Survey map for the initial sighting is NO 2907.I am 47 years old.  I am a pilot and familiar with estimating distances and altitude.  I am a former US Army Captain and a retired California Peace Officer.  I am excited and wanted to pass this on.  There were three others in the car with me and they all saw the silver object in the sky too.   So there you have it.  Please pass it on to whoever in the UK keeps track of such things.  Thanks &gt;From ((names deleted)) the wanderers", "At approx 1335 8-7-02 I was seated at my desk which is on the 2nd floor of the building where I work.  My office window is on the southside of the building, the building is located immeadiantly to the west of the Arlington airport, at the south end of the North to South runways.My attention was caught by a bright flash outside, which at first I thought was an airplane entering the landing pattern of the airport.  However, when I looked out the window, I observed an object which appeared to be hanging motionless in the sky, at the top of a cloud formation directly to the south of my location. The object looked like a straight dark line running from east to west.  As I watched, it remained stationary for approx. 2-3 minutes, then began a slow, jerky, upward motion, until it was slightly above the cloud formation, where it stopped again.  It remained motionless for a few seconds, then tilted forward at an approx. 20- 30 degree angle, and began moving very slowly, and wobbly toward the northeast.  At this point the object reflected the sunlight.  I could see that the object was a elliptical shape that appeared to be approx 3-4 times longer than it was thick when viewed edge on.  It also appeared to be oscillating or rotating clockwise.  It again stopped and hung motionless.At this point I went down the stairs, to the 1st floor of the building, to tell other people of the object.  I encountered our computer system administer who is a former combat helicopter pilot, having spent some 14 years in the U.S. Army as a Warrant Officer in that capacity.  I told him to look out his window and tell me what he saw.  He looked, saw the object, and said he was dammed if he knew what it was.  He and I continued to watch the object as it moved slowly up and down, and back and forth, side to side.  It tilted several times, and displayed a definate silver metallic color on its topside.  When viewed edge on, it continued to appear dark in color, and thicker in its middle than at its edges.  We both agreed that it was metallic in appearance, and appeared to be oscillating or rotaing clockwise.  We then advised the switchboard operator, who also looked out and observed the object.I had the operator dial the number of a friend who works in north Everett.  I told my friend what we were observing, and asked her to look from her location for the object.  She called back in a couple of minutes and advised that she could not see the object as there were cloud formations at her location.  The system admistrator and myself stepped outside the building where we continued to observe the object as it hung motionless, or slowly moved up, down, and side to side.  During the time we watched, approx 15-20 minutes, several private planes entered the landing pattern, generally by flying in from the north,on the west side of the airport, banking to the east, and turning north again to approach the north-south runways.  All of the planes were between us and the object which appeared to be approx. 2 miles (somewhat of a guess)from us.  The object appeared to be somewhat larger than a Cessna 172 type plane would at the smae distance.We continued to watch the object until it started slowly moving to the southeast, appearing to slowly be losing altitude, and eventually was lost to our sight behind buildings approx. 1/4 mile south of our location.  This was observed by the 3 of us.  Again, I would estimate the entire length of the sighting at 15-20 minutes.I am a former law enforcement officer, and served in a jet aircraft fighter/bomber squadron during my service with the U.S. Navy, I have received training in both oberving details, and reporting, as well as being familiar with aircraft.  This object resembled no aircraft I have ever observed flying.  The system administrator, former helicopter pilot, also could not identify it it as a conventional aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  We have requested reports from other witnesses, but they have not arrived yet.

Hopefully weather balloons", "Lights in the sky over Washington StateIt was in the mid-70&apos;s that this siteing happened. I was around 9 or 10 years old. It was a very dark night, with no moon in the sky, so the stars were very clear. I was living in the Eastern part of Washington state, which is largely farm land. I remember being called out of the house to come and see something. What I saw was several lights, about 7 or 8, moving around in the Eastern sky. They looked no different than the stars, except that they were moving. They floated around each other for awhile, then one or two of them would streak off and vanish, only to appear in the opposite direction from where it went. Sometimes the objects would merge, then spread out from each other. This went on for about 15 to 20 minutes, it could have been more. My father, who is a farmer, along with my mother, brother, and sister all saw this.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It perplexed us that the &apos;sun&apos; was much more red than usual and was not that low on the horizon. After looking at it over the fence for about 30 seconds the object started to pulsate back and forth (it is very hard to explain how it did it). It was as if it was pulsing bigger and smaller towards us and then away from us. We both ran away into the house and I remember before I ran indoors I got on another fence to check if what I was seeing was real. I started to cry when I saw it from this view and ran indoors. We told our parents to come out to see it and after about 2 minutes after we had convinced them to come to have a look the red light in the sky had gone and was nowhere to be seen. The object was a dark but vibrant red and was circular. The pulsing it did was eerie and it scared us both in the way it pulsed, it was just unlike anything I had ever seen before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates date of June 31.  June has only 30 days.

I was sitting in the back seat of my brother&apos;s car.  We were driving South on the 15 in laval, when I saw two bright red lights towards the South East.  It was hard to see how high it was.  It seemed to be high enought from the ground, but it was too far away to be able to tell exactly how high.  It was kind of like two plane coming over the horizon far away...  I asked my brother and his girlfriend if they could also see the lights.  They just seemed to float there.  One was a little higher up than the other.  They didn&apos;t see them right away because we were moving and objects like trees and buildings kept getting in the way. Once they did see them they said it looked like fireworks, but wouldn&apos;t fade away.  It was a good description I guess.  You know when a flare goes up in the sky and glows bright red?  Well imagine the same glow, but bigger and brighter.  They just suspended there for about 20 seconds.  We past in front of an object (a bridge or building) and I lost them from view.  I looked for 5 minutes afterwards but I never saw them again.  I guess I can&apos;t rule out that they were flares, but they really didn&apos;t move any closer to the horizion like flares do, and it seemed to high to have been flares.Well that&apos;s what I saw tonight.  I wish I would have had a video camera!!((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM WITNESS))I know it doesn&apos;t make a big difference but I reported seeing two bright red lights in the sky over Laval last night but I believe that I wrote 08/11/02 instead of the actual date that I saw them which was 08/10/02.

It was going in the opposite direction of me just above the tree lines on my right. As I looked up, I saw little rectangular boxes , almost like windows, all around it ( saw all sides since was &quot;spinning&quot; as it moved forward. White lights flickered on and off within these &quot;windows&quot;.", "Very bright red light in the day time.At around 10:00 AM today (8/17/02), I was flying a small RC airplane at about 600 feet when I observed a round bright red object above and north of the model plane.It seemed like the object was much higher in altitude. It may have been up several thousand feet or more.  It appeared to be a round bright red light. The size, relative to arms length was about 0.15 inch in diameter. It was like looking at a really bright LED from 20 feet. The sun was behind me, not obscured by clouds and may have been illuminating the object uniformly, if it was translucent.It seemed to be self-illuminated, it&apos;s red light seemed to be brighter than it should have been from ordinary reflected light. The only thing I can think of that would get the same visual effect, would be a large red tinted mirror reflecting the sun directly to me. The light intensity didn&apos;t vary at all.When I told the other person at the field to look up at the &quot;red light&quot; above my plane, he said &quot;what is that&quot;? Later, he said it must be a &quot;weather balloon&quot;.  The object was in view for about 2 to 3 minutes as it moved SE (the direction of the prevailing wind at ground level).  The object suddenly disappeared as it approached almost over head. The object was sighted at about 50 degrees elevation and went to about 80 degrees before vanishing.Since I was keeping an eye on my RC plane, I&apos;m not sure if the object was moving when I first sighted it. For the first 10 or 15 seconds, it didn&apos;t seem to be moving.I had an instant fear that it was somthing like a very large meteor heading right at us (since it didn&apos;t have a tail).The RC plane is very light and flies very slowly. I was able to orbit the plane between me and the object so I could watch both of them at the same time.If it had not just disappeared, I would be more inclined to believe it was some kind of high visibility weather balloon. We didn&apos;t see anything (like a parachute) falling in the area (Burlington MA).I have 20/15 vision and today the sky was clear enough easily to see hawks flying in thermals at several thousand feet AGL.Does the weather bureau use this kind of bright red translucent balloon? Do they release them on Saturday mornings?", "UFO remains fixed in the sky as commercial jets fly above it.A very bright circle of white/silver light positioned in a stationary position. I was driving on the highway 5 Km north of Swan Hills, Alberta when a bright object in the sky caught my attention. This bright object remained stationary in the sky while directly above it a commercial jet aircraft flew over. I would estimate that the Bright object was halfway between the ground and the flight corridor of the jets. I continued to watch as the jet passed wwhile the &quot;object&quot; remained fixed in the same position in the sky. Many minutes elapsed and another commercial jet aircraft followed on the same flight path with a smaller jet following very closely behind. This in itself seemed very odd as the distances betweeen the two jets was very close. The bright object remained fixed in the sky while the two jets passed overhead and flew out of site.

The sky was clear and given our remote northern location ther was no interference from rural lighting. The object compared to commercial aircraft observed earlier, appeared to be at a higher altitude and was extremely large.  It consisted of three lights in a triangular shape. Not a perfect triangle but with one side shorter that the other. It travelled east to west with no sound. As it went further east the lights suddenly dimmed out and it was no longer visable.

Before I do, you should know that I am a student pilot, an avid aircraft buff, and have been in/around aircraft all my life. I know the subject pretty well.I live in Derry New Hampshire, which is not far from the Massachusettes border. On the morning of August 4th, I was still online at 1:00 am. It was a very clear night.I began to hear a rumbling sound which very quickly graduated to a loud roaring sound, rattling the windows.I sprinted outside to have a look. Traveling east to west, high overhead, was a single bright white light. I would guess its altitude to have been at least thirty thousand feet, if not more. I could discern no standard aviation lighting, but that&apos;s not unusual given the height. What was amazing was the roar! I recently moved back here from Florida&apos;s Brevard County, where the sound of rocket launches was somewhat routine. If I had seen this in Florida, I would have thought they were launching a rocket in the wrong direction. As I said, the sound of this aircraft was so loud it rattled the windows, and sounded EXACTLY like a rocket launch. There was no sound of turbines at all.This sounded extremely powerful. My first impression was that I was looking at a missle coming in from the Atlantic somewhere. The hair stood up on my arms and for a moment I thought...&quot;uh oh&quot;. All I can say was that this was no normal aircraft, if that&apos;s what it was. I do not believe this was a fighter jet with afterburners on. It was not traveling especially fast, and continued at the same speed throughout its trajectory.I would like to know if anyone else in the area heard this that night. It was traveling roughly over the Mass/NH border.The sound actually awoke others in my household, which has never happened before.Thanks for your time, Greg", "Observed unusually bright object moving in conventional orbital pattern but not listed in online satellite resource.Saturday night, August 3rd, I decided to go outside into my backyard and do a little star gazing and see if I could see any satellites passing overhead.  My &apos;window&apos; of observation is rather confined because of large trees in the yard. The back of the house also blocks views to the west, as well.  In addition, clouds were just moving in from the northwest and beginning to obscure the sky.I did, however, have a good clear view of the sky immediately overhead with Vega shining brightly.  I decided to grab my binoculars and folding cot and enjoy the night air for a few minutes.I had just laid down and gotten comfortable when I noticed a &apos;star&apos; of nearly the same magnitude as Vega and just to the southwest of it.  However, this star was moving.  I quickly put the 10x50 binoculars on it, but it still remained just a single bright point of light.  It was moving on roughly a south to north track at about the same speed most satellites move, but the unusual brightness suggested to me that this wasn&apos;t a conventional satellite.  I&apos;ve observed the International Space Station pass overhead and it was comparable in brightness.As I watched the object move further north, it faded out as it moved behind the thickening cloud cover.  I quickly took note of the time and went online to www.heavens-above.com, a web site that provides orbital observation information on hundreds of space objects from the ISS to Russian space junk.  I found no objects that coincided with the time, magnitude [brightness] and track of this object that would have been visible from my location.Whatever the object was, it was unusually bright for a satellite though it certainly exhibited most of the other characteristics of a conventional satellite.", "The 3 connected triangles in the SkyIt was a really clear beautiful day with absolutly no clouds in the sky.

It looked to me as if smoke came from the flash. Then about 5 minutes later as we were trying to figure out what the hell we had seen we noticed what looked like 3 white triangles connected at the base tiliting high up in the sky and it looked like it was flipping on its own axis, was coming from where we had seen the flash of light.  It continued to travel across the sky until it appeared to look like a star and then it vanished. This happened during the day time.

I wanted to kill him for waking me up but just then I heard the notes. It was very similar to the notes and pattern in the movie Close Encounters but had six notes not five. He knew I heard it and gave a sigh of relief. It did it again an couple of seconds later and this time I said, Whoa, it sounds just like the &quot;song&quot; in Close Encounters. My husband was so happy. he said he had been listening to it for about 15 mins and thought he was losing his mind. He had to wake me up to see if it was real or not. He said he purposely said &quot;music&quot; so as not to influence what I said I heard. I then said well the kids must be watching the movie or have a radio on even though it was repeating too often for me to really believe this. We opened our bedroom window and it was much louder and definately coming from outside. My heart was beating about a thousand miles an hour now and we went through the entire house checking every TV, radio, etc. We opened the garage to check the car radios and the hot tub (has a radio).It was storming unbeliveably outside, lightening and thundering like crazy but you could hear it plain as day. Sometimes it would get faster but always the same notes in the pattern. We went back to the bedroom and had the window cracked alittle because it was raining so hard when there was a boom which was similar to a sonic boom, it was that intense of a crack and the entire sky went completely white. This was no thunderbolt. The entire sky was completely white for about 2 or 3 seconds. After that we continued to hear the notes but they were much fainter and sounded much farther away.This was so completely weird and its freaking us out.

As I was talking with a friend I had met on board when she pointed to the sky and sat up saying,&quot;What is that?&quot;  I followed a light about the brightness and size of a star that appeared to be a satellite because of its steady and unvarying course.  Just as I was about to tell her it was a sattelite, the object stopped and made a 90 degree S-turn to the Southwest- We were heading Northwest.  Then the object returned the other direction towards the Northeast and then back to the North until it faded out of view.  The sky was very clear directly above our heads where we observed the object, but I can&apos;t be certain if it just disappeared into the mist of the clouds near the Northern section of sky or just faded by the sudden increase in distance.  In all, my time seeing the object was between 10-12 seconds, but the friend I was with said she observed it moving in a little circle just before she called my attention to it.  The friend I was with holds a Masters degree in Psychology and I myself am a pilot. This created a spectial interest to me because while trying to explain what we experienced, I know it could not have been any aircraft known to the public at this time.  I&apos;ve seen the best of fighter jets and they don&apos;t maneuver with such smooth and sudden turns and with no sound.  As far as I know as well, satellites do not make 90 degree turns in their orbit.  We considered the possibility of a bird, but this object was illuminated, with a white possible slightly red tinted light which was steady until it dissapeared.  I waited another 45 minutes, but nothing was observed a second time.", "Chevron Shaped vehicle with blinking red lightsA massive V shaped pattern of lights in the sky heading south in the vicinity of Kernville, CA.  The lights were red in color and appeared similar to those found on rescue vehicles.  The object appeared to be a single structure.  The body of this aircraft looked as though it was a very dark color.  What really caught my eye was how massive this object was and how preportionally slow it was moving in the sky.  I have never seen anything like this before. but I feel extremely confident that this was not a conventional aircraft.  It was like nothing I have ever seen before.  However, I have heard of sighting of this type of aircraft by climbers around the Mt. Whitney area.((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports.

My wife and I live on the third and top floor of a large two bedroom apartment building in Landover. It was a Thursday night and I was working on three articles I write for a trade publication that was to be laid out the next day. I was in the smaller bedroom, which we have turned into a home office/guest room, on the computer. My wife was in the living room watching wrestling, which came on at 8 p.m. and ran til 10 p.m. I had been writing for what I felt to be about an hour when I just got &quot;the willies&quot; or whatever. Then the computer froze up. I got it going again and recovered all my data, saved it and suddenly felt very tired. I decided to finish my work at work tomorrow and I went out to watch television with my wife. When I sat down the wrestling program, which runs for two hours, was going off. I told my wife that I hadn&apos;t realized I had worked for so long. She said I had! only been working for about an hour and that it was only about 9 p.m. and she didn&apos;t know why wrestling would be going off after only showing three matches, which she named and described in detail. I checked our digital phone and it said 10 p.m. I also checked our clock radio and computer. They all said 10 p.m. I went to a website about the wrestling program and it detailed several matches that night and her descriptions were of the first two matches and the last one. I let it go because she scares easily and we both had a real bad case of the creeps that night and weren&apos;t sure why. We were really, really exhausted however and fell right to sleep, hard. I have read up on &quot;missing time&quot; and this seems to fit all the descriptions. Also, right after the incident I developed a lump under the skin between my left thigh and genital area. I have an appointment to have it looked at  next Monday.

The light became brighter during it&apos;s path, and I figured it was lowering it&apos;s altitude while I watched.  The light then went much dimmer and quickly went out of sight as if it the light just went out.There were no clouds, and I could see all the other star formations around where it vanished.  I thought that was pretty weird, then noticed a second, slightly dimmer light also at high altitude approach the same area from the East, and also vanished in pretty much the same area of sky.  As I said, there were no clouds, and my view was unobstructed.One aircraft had taken off from YYZ in a North then Westernly direction shortly before these events, which is not unusual.I&apos;ll email a diagram and label it as a DTG: ((deleted)).jpg", "Grounded pyramid formation of 3 objects alternating in colour and making a grinding noise holding a slow steady course.My brother and I were walking along a trail through a forested area when we heard a peculiar sound. The sound would have been similar to the sound made by dragging two heavy concrete objects (one on top of the other) in different directions. It was loud enough for us to take notice from some distance off. As we walked the trail we realized the sound was getting louder so we were getting closer. We came to an area in the forest with a small overgrown field and took note of the fact that the sound was coming closer and was on an intercept course with the field. This would give us the opportunity to check out what was making the strange sound. A sort time later three objects emerged. The objects were on the ground. The were in a triangular formation, they looked like pyramids tipped on their sides, they alternated in colour between brown and orange, the colour seemed in radiate at a low intensity from their interiors, they were about 4-5 feet tall and moved a 2-3 mph.

This event was witnessed by my sixteen year old son and my 14 year old daughter as well. I am a retired police officer who is not given to flights of fancy, so it is with careful thought that I bring this event to your attention. We were traveling west on Colorado 36, approximately four miles west of Last Chance, Co. when my son first noticed the object to the north of the hiway above a pasture. At first I thought it must be an aircraft either enroute to or departing Denver International Airport, approximately seventy miles to the west of our position. However, as I began to watch the object I could tell that it was not moving and that the distance between  it and my vehicle was closing as I approached it. In about five minutes I was parallel to the object which was over a pasture approximately three hundred yards from the hiway. I stopped the car on the shoulder of the road to get a better look at the object, still thinking that there was an explanation such as weather balloon, helicopter, etc. It soon became apparent to me that it was not a balloon, as it was absolutely unmoving in a breeze that would have easily moved an inflated object (10 to 15 m.p.h. out of the northeast). It also was not a rotor craft. The object appeared to be slightly oval shape, with a &quot;dull&quot; metallic look to it. I turned the engine of the car off and there was absolutley no sound from the object. This is a very sparse farming and ranching community with very little traffic of noise pollution of any kind. The slight wind was in the direction to have brought any sound toward my vehicle. The object appeared to be 25 to 30 feet in diameter and close to 10 feet thick at it&apos;s midsection. There were cattle grazing in the pasture, not directly under the object, but only 100 yards or so to the east. They seemed to be completly unaware of it&apos;s presence. It was dusk and getting darker as we ! watched the object, still trying to decide what it might be. Another vehicle approached from the east and slowed as it passed us, an elderly couple who were obviously looking at the same thing we were. The vehicle declined to stop, but rather accelerated and proceeded west. My daughter began to get a little upset and asked if we could leave. I could tell she was frightened and when I looked to the back seat, she was looking away, choosing not to even look at it anymore. As I told her we were leaving, the object illuminated, again without a sound. I don&apos;t mean some lights came on around the perimiter or flood lights. I mean the entire object itself &quot;glowed&quot; an orange-red color. Even though there was no sound that I could hear, when the object lit up, the cattle suddenly bolted, all at once, in different directions. I&apos;ve seen cattle shy from noise or threat before and they all turn  to run from the percieved threat. These cattle were running into each other like they had no idea which way to go. At this point, I became concerned for our safety. I don&apos;t know why, the vehicle never moved or did anything of a threatening nature, I simply was afraid for my children and myself. The vehicle started without hesitation and I left heading west again towards Denver. My daughter was now crying and my son&apos;s initial excitement had also been replaced with a quiet uneasiness. I continued to watch the object as best I could as we left, but it was dark enough now to make it hard to see. The illumination had only lasted for maybe 2 or 3 seconds. My son caugh the last glimpse of the object as we crested a hill. It appeared to be in the same place as it had been.After talking with my wife and a few close friends, I decided to keep quiet about the sighting. I now regret that decision because it may have ben easier to find out who else migh have seen this if I had come forward earlier.

My 3 year old daughter said &quot;mommy what is that&quot; as she pointed acrossed the street. It is almost 8 pm and the sun was setting and the Sears building at the Sea-Tac Mall was a bright orange color. I said &quot;silly, it is a building&quot;. She moved her finger to aim higher saying &quot;no that, what are those&quot; she asked adamantly! I was holding her up in my arms and could not answer her as I continued to try and figure it out for myself. I turned to ask someone in the parking lot if there eyes were better than my (20/20 vision). She was just getting out of her car, looked up and said &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot; and walked to the store. I was hoping that they would come up with some brillant insight for this occurrence or at least see something more clear than apparently me. I stood there watching what seemed to be a mixture of possibilities but no one answer; Blue Angels Jets, lost small bundle of balloons, birds or something I can&apos;t identify with....1)Blue Angels, were in town for the hydroplane races for the week of August 6th, but not too likely that they would still be in town. I mention them because when I was watching them at the races sometimes they would go into different pattern and would get so high in the sky that they would almost look like little dots in the sky. After seeing the Blue Angles I could determine that these four things did not fly like the jet, but seemed to be floating or drifting to the SouthWest.2)Lost small bundle of balloons is kind of the best way to discribe their casual movement toward the airplane flight route. They were all the same size... like bally black ovals, but not balloons! Three of these objects danced around, but not in front of one that seemed to have more of a focus. They were higher than the airplanes that where flying by, but for example they seemed like three playful cubs, staying close to their mother as they went for a walk.3)Birds... well there was something in the clear blue sky, but I will difinitely protest to chalk it up to a flock of birds flying south for the winter, especially since it is still summer.4)Something I can&apos;t identify with.... it was the way that these objects moved that intrigued me! Moving slowly at a SW angle, yet almost hopping up and around another. I saw them moving from four high, diamond, almost v-ish to three high and one in front.I kept looking up as I loaded the bags, still trying to think of an answer for my daughter repeated question, but &quot;I don&apos;t know was the best I could do&quot;.

My mother and I were driving from Hunt, TX into Kerrville, TX to buy something at the grocery store one night.  As soon as we came out of the tree-covered road from our house I spotted a gloriously beautiful, long, diamond-shaped craft right outside the car window.  It was on the other side of the treeline from the road, but clearly visible as it couldn&apos;t have been but a few feet from the road.  Instead of sharp angles, it resembled more like two cones with their bases put together.  It was maybe the size of a grain silo in diameter.  It was covered in lights, with seemingly no rhyme or reason to the layout.  The lights were different colors and flashed in a seeming non-pattern.  I turned to tell my mother to look out the window and noticed she was scared to death.  We were driving about 80 or so, as fast as she could get our car to go, and she was froggy.  Her reaction frightened me, and I asked her agian to look.  She told me to ignore it, there was nothing out there, stop looking at it.  Such an odd reply, so I ignored her and looked anyway.  This craft followed us into town, and just before we hit any traffic, it hovered for a few moments then almost winked out of existance.  There was no noise, no odd feelings, no &quot;sense&quot; of being watched.  It was just there, mere yards from us for miles.  My mother briefed me on not telling anyone anything, and that it was my imagination, but she was deathly afraid of something.  To this day she denies it.  We never told anyone.  However, about a week later my brother comes home from night fishing all breathless and excited.  He was about ten at the time.  His story went like this:  He was down on the low water crossing with a friend and they were packing up their fishing supplies.  He states the coolest thing happened next.  I huge craft appeared out of nowhere right above them on the low water crossing.  He described my sighting to the letter, and when he did I looked at my mother a! nd she w ent pale but looked at me to shut me up.  So I did. He then went to say that it hovered there, and he said there was no actual sound, but you could feel a faint buzzing in your body.  It then, he claimed, emitted a very bright, foggy, blue light onto him and his friend and he said it felt warm and tingly.  The best description for me to give you would be like a sonogram treatment after about 30 minutes of continuous treatment.  He said he still heard no sound, doesn&apos;t remember anything actually happeneing other than the tingly light.  Then all of a sudden the light was gone and the craft just vanished into thin air.  We have had a few episodes in Texas as children, together.  But to my knowledge I have seen no unusual craft in my adult life.  No one in the family will admit this now, but all three of us witnessed something interesting.

They dispersed instantly and then I could see several of them individually darting about in rapid straight-line moves, changing direction radically and instantly by 90 degrees or so. One of them appeared to move upward to where the aircraft was moving along slowly, then zipped away again, though these lights could have been much further away. After a few seconds of these highly unusual movements they disappeared.I believe them to have either been some US military test of antigravity vehicles or something like that, or they were UFOs.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))Hi, Peter,Yes, I am sure that the evening of July 18 was when I saw the bizarre phenomena over Mt. Tamalpais here in Marin County, California. I wrote down the basic information the next morning, but the press of other things caused the delay in reporting it to you. (I enjoy hearing you on the Jeff Rense program, and I am really appreciative of the work both of you are doing.)Some additional background information:  The aircraft (assuming it WAS an a/c) that I had cause to look at through binoculars had a (to me) unusual appearance, though possibly explainable. Rather thanthe usual landing lights of airliners approaching the Bay Area from the west or northwest, this a/c had one very large, very bright light in front, and a single flashing light on the tail. It seemed to be movingvery slowly. It might have been a helicopter, but night had fallen and it wasn&apos;t possible to see itsconfiguration. I could not determine how close it was or how close were the multiple ufo&apos;s that then entered the picture.The reason I was ready with binoculars when the aircraft appeared was because I had seen anotherbizarre-looking phenomenon four nights prior to that, on the 14th. The 18th was the first time I had achance to keep my eye on that view of the mountain, since I had had to work late elsewhere the nights of the 15th, 16th, and 17th. On the evening of the 18th I had an intuitive flash to keep an eye on that view, a not unpleasant task, as there was a bright sunset and the mountain was spectacular silhouetted against the sky.Here are my notes about the July 14th phenomenon, written on the 16th:  I did record on tape my immediate impressions of a bizarre phenomenon with a (probable) military aircraft night before last. To try to remember from this distance, as I sit looking out and up at Mount Tamalpais and the western/southwestern sky, the images I saw. There had been an earlier inundation of chemically induced clouds, well-mixed off the coast with available moisture, thus more filled out, less sinewy or webby. It provided for a particularly colorful sunset which in its late stages I was studying through the field glasses for any more tell-tale signs of manmade origin. Just then a silhouetted a/c came into view, seemingly above the eastern flank of the mountain. As it flew over the summit it started emitting illuminations, very flame-like at times [the bluish color of natural gas flame], the likes of which I have never seen nor heard. One of the projections of this luminous material appeared beneath the fuselage. It was very large and had a definite circular shape but it looked three-dimensional, that is, the luminous mass sagged or stretched downward like a huge bubble of light.  Then, after various smaller &quot;flickerings,&quot; perhaps near the engines, a plume of the luminous material emitted from the tail of the plane, starting small and billowing out into a parachute-shaped light. the plane stopped doing any more of this and seemingly at about the same time altered its course (to port) and left the area. It had a small tail boom.Has anyone else reported phenomena around here during that period? I am told that there is a MOA (Military Operations Area) off the coast, but I haven&apos;t had access to an aeronautical chart to see if the orbs I saw on the 18th could have been in that direction.  Thanks for your interest. Let me know if there is anything else I can do.Sincerely,  ((name deleted))((END))((NUFORC Note:  No missile launch from Vandenberg AFB reported for this date.

I can be mistaken only about object&apos;s size and distance of it. Of course I was trying to figure out some more realistic explanations of my sighting. My only guess it could be balloon (dirigible) which I saw once (about 3-4 months ago) in Newark vicinity. That time it was white balloon with blue HORIZON inscription on it.  I believe it was advertising balloon. But, on August 31, the object was 11.30 PM and a balloon&apos;s pilot would be crazy to fly such vehicle at night.  And, theobject which we saw was glaring very brightly and moving much faster than a balloon (but I assume slower than aircraft).  About your supposition about Teterboro Airport, I would say that there is Newark International Airport much closer to our location.  Aircraft frequently cross above our home and especially to east from it preparing for landing.  So I am rather familiar with this stuff. But the object which we saw was flying absolutely quietly and didn&apos;t look like aircraft at all. Regarding your question on object&apos;s location, I can say it was moving to west from us (Ibelieve parallel 280 highway, away from NYC, heading Newark orBloomfield). I think it was crossing Passaic river so it was on open territory for some time thus probably it could be seen very well by many people. At the conclusion I can say that it was one of the weirdest things which I&apos;ve ever seen. This is the only reason why I wanted to report this phenomenon.

I do know that planes as I have seen plenty when banking toward you will look like bright headlights except when they turn they always show red and white lights.The things I described were different because no sound and no light plus all the air traffic seems lower on the horizon .

They crossed the sky in front and above us travelling from our left to right. At this point I thought I was looking at 3 large gliding birds the objects were completely silent. I quickly dismissed the bird thoughts as I looked closer I saw that the aircraft were similar to boomerangs with a bump or pip in the middle of the concave part of the boomerang which would be the back trailing edge.As the 3 craft soared across the sky heading South West I stood up and walked forward to follow their progress, which would soon have been obscured, by neighbouring houses. I saw the formation head steadily along and then the craft to the left of the V formation seemed to flick into a quick shallow bank away from the other two which maintained exactly the same height and course.

I felt it could sense our fascination of the object and the feeling seemed that it was &quot;curious&quot; of our reaction, when most might be horrified. It hovered around thirty feet OR LESS directly above our car and wavered slightly from side to side to give me a few good looks at it.It was definitely triangular without a doubt, with a red, white, and possibly blue lights on the tips (oddly). I thought I saw a light on the top which would make it a pyramid, but my brother saw no such thing. There were no odd car reactions (i.e. car suddenly stopping) and the object simply left when we got to a more populated area. I think a saw a car far behind us in the incident so we may not of been the only witnesses. Threw the whole ordeal the object emitted no sound.

The colors were distinct, and some were indescribable. A significantly smaller round object was flying around the object in a random pattern, sometimes disappearing from view.  It was not star, and definitely a manufactured object.  Observer 2 When looking through the telescope, the colors I observed were indescribable. What I say may not make as much sense as I would like it to. The colors changed within an fraction of a second, and never slowed down pulsating. Each time it changed, it wasn&apos;t one solid color on the object. There were several colors on it, neons, at a time. ~ Observer 3((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star?  We do not know.

We observed that there were aircraft in the sky taking off from a local airport and we noticed that one of the objects began to follow the aircraft and then disappeared.

The light grew closer and smaller lights started to gather in formation around the brighter light. They travelled forward and then would drop so much towards the ground and then level out. This was a continuous manuveur for about 2 hours. As it got closer, I could distinguish the red light on the top of the larger ship and make out seperate individual ships travelling with the red light. I saw approximately 20-25 smaller ships around the red light. The light seemed to change colors as it got closer.They were located in the NE section of the sky and moved to the Western area of the sky. A second grouping was also located in the Eastern section of the sky and I saw a flash of bright light relesed from the first grouping to the second grouping. The first group was in a holding pattern and sent the flash of light to the second group and then the second group formed into a V shape and they held their position as the first group got closer.The first group travelled directly over my house heading West. They were about 20,000 feet over my roof. No wings were apparent and they were silent.

An object appeared to enter the atmosphere at an angle of about 60 to 70 degrees off perpendicular from the east falling down and to the west. The object made 3 or 4 bright streaks in a straight line similar to a dashed line. I counted 1,2,3 then the streaks of light stopped then looked at the time on the car radio. It read 9:39 PM.If I held my hand at arms length each streak was as long as the width of a fingernail and as thick (At least 4 to five times thicker than any meteor I saw during the Leonid meteor showers) as a 9mm lead for a mechanical pencil. The length of the streak and the length of the blackness between the streaks appeared to be approximately equal. The light was very bright with a round shape leading each streak.

We heard the sound for about 30 seconds and got up from our campsite (out from under some trees) to investigate.  The sound was making area coyotes/dogs howl like crazy.  The object had a red light on one side and a green light on the other, and white lights on the front and back.  The red and green lights were about a third of the way between the white lights-- if you connected the lights, it would look like a kite.  So basically, not terribly unlike a plane, but a different shape.However it did not sound like any plane we&apos;d ever heard.  It was traveling relatively slow and low and went directly over us.  As it did, due to the Doppler effect, the sound became lower and the oscillations slower.  We followed it until it disappeared into the horizon.We suspected it might be a B-2, but saw one the flying the next day outside of Alamogordo and it did not sound the same at all.  Based on subsequent Internet research, we&apos;re pretty sure it wasn&apos;t one.

I also thought that perhaps it was a plane, there is an airport about 5 miles from where we were, but it was too high to be in the flight pattern,on an inbound, or just after takeoff. There where no beacon lights so I honestly didn&apos;t believe it to be a plane,  I looked at it for moment and thought to look and see if the sun was coming up and possibly causing some sorta reflection.  The sun was still low in the horizon.  This took took perhaps a split second, when I looked back at the moon again the light was gone.  My husband pulled over to the side of the road to see if it had traveled over the top of the jeep we were riding in.  It was gone.  If it was  a plane, there is no way that it could of landed that quickly from such a high altitude.

All that changed two weeks ago.  On Saturday July 13, 2002 my friend and I was talking to one of our neighbors outside at his trailer park in Davison.  The sky was clear and we could see something moving across the sky.  I thought it was a satellite but then it stopped moving and did a sharp U-turn.  It was so small because it was so far away.  Then it disappeared.  I then noticed another one moving across a star from another angle in the sky.  We sighted a total of 12 UFO&apos;s that night and all of them disappeared.  Sometimes, one would disapper then reappear for a second.  I decided to email you this letter because I want to know if you have noticed any other sitings that are similar around this area.

I was heading towards Troy area when I flipped my visor up to look at the sky and there it was!  The low hovering aircraft was square shaped like a reversed minivan.  It looked blimp sized, but it also looked like a cut out shape in the sky like it shouldn&apos;t even be there!  How am I supposed so to see this object so clearly when the sky is misty!??  The whaleish-gray colored UFO had a light blue glow around it.  When I focused my attention on the sparks of light coming from behind the object,  it disappeared.  It couldn&apos;t have been in the sky for more than 4 seconds.  It was moving eastbound at an extremely fast speed!  I know what a meteor looks like because I witnessed the meteor shower we had over a month ago.  At first, I was trying to convince myself that it was a reflection in my mirror and I just saw a shooting star.  When I read the Flint Journal the next day, I discovered that a similar sighting was seen in Washington.  I am now convinced that I must have seen it too.  This wasn&apos;t a meteor or a shooting star.  It was something else.  The article in the Flint Journal stated that two F-16 jets from Andrews Air Force Base were scrambled early Friday after radar detected a unknown aircraft in the Washington area. The time was 1:00AM when the Air force jet was chasing it but it just left them in the dust at speeding over 6000 miles an hour.  I realized that their is a 3 hour time difference between Michigan (ahead) and Washington. Sounds incredible doesn&apos;t it?

My 36 year old husband who is a printer with an associates degree in advertising and a U.S. Army veteran of Operation Just Cause in Panama, and my 8 year old son who is a bear in Cub Scouts and a third grader this year, were with me as we were coming home from a family reunion. It was quite humid and there were lighting strikes which lit up the sky. As I was driving along , I winessed two flashing lights on an object which was hovering above the patch of road ahead of us. I slowed down even more, and asked my husband and my son if they could see what I was witnessing. They immediately saw the object. My husband said that the green flashing light on the left, and the red flashing light on the right appeared to be about 20 feet apart. The object simply hovered, and was absolutely silent. We had our windows down and our Dodge van is in good repair and is very quiet. We could not hear the soar of a plane or the whirring, buzzing sound of a helicopter.We immediately reported this sighting to the Marcy substation of the New York State police. The dispatcher called our house later to report that upon reporting the sighting to the local police, she was told that there were no other sightings. She agreed with me that the object was unlikely to have been a military maneuver since it was operating over a very densely populated area, and had it been a private craft of some sort , it would have been very foolish to be operating a private plane of some sort, given the lightning strikes we were experiencing. Moreover, had a private craft of some sort been simply been remaining still and silent, it would have in a very short period of time, crashed.My son saw a domed shape above the lights that was illuminated by the lightning behind it to the west.The area in question was in an area to the west of Utica New Yo! rk and s outh of the New York State Thruway.

As I first saw it, it didn&apos;t look like an experianced &quot;driver&quot; was driving it. The reason I say this is because it was kind of out of control for the first few moments I saw it. The only way to describe it is as if you throw a plate (saucer)on the table and it wobbles around before settling, that was what this was doing in the air.The ship was silent didn&apos;t make a sound at all and looked just like they put them on tv, disk shaped, with red, yellow, and blue lights all around and of course the white light. The ship was spinning clock-wise as I looked up at it and the white light was spinning around the ship counter clock-wise. The one thing that I&apos;ve never seen or heard mentioned was the white light, that is tear or dip shape, didn&apos;t touch the ship at all. I always thought that the white light would be on the red, yellow, and blue lights if I were to see one but it wasn&apos;t, it was about two to three feet from the ship itself. I really can&apos;t describe it but the white light wasn&apos;t touching the ship and it seemed independant from the ship yet a part of it because even though the ship wabbled clock-wise with the spinning of the ship, the white light never missed spinning the opposite direction from the ship directly over the colored lights.Since it was dark and I&apos;ve not thought of it much because I was afraid people would think I was a nut I&apos;ll try to describe the ship itself. I remember drawing it the next day and it seemed to be a metalic color and a hole on the bottom part, kind of like an opening maybe. Basically it seemed like two plates put together and a bowl on the top. It did spin out of control for awhile but seemed to have regained control after a few seconds after I was mentally willing it to stop or slow down, so someone else could see it. It wabble still but very slowly. I&apos;m not sure but I personally think because of me willing it to stop and as I did and having it slowly gain control, I believe it is flown mentally and not with control handles or buttons.Even though I saw the ship for two minutes or a minute it wasn&apos;t long enough for me I wanted to see more of it yet there was a tree that was going to block my view and no one to see it with me. What I did was wait until it hit the tree and ran inside to get the nearest person I could see to look at the ship too. I got my brother and he walked out and said &quot;Holy Sh*t a UFO!&quot;. I didn&apos;t wait to watch it leave I ran to call my friend who lived a few blocks south of me, the direction it was moving, and asked him to go outside to get a view. He didn&apos;t see it and my brother said it had quickly taken off. He said it kind of &quot;scanned&quot; the floor and took off, yet I don&apos;t believe him especially since he was young and it didn&apos;t sound like something that would have happened, plus the fact that he said it was a plane he saw two days later yet when he saw it, it was already kind of small as I pointed it out but still looked like what I saw only smaller.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was stunned and ran around the house screaming to my friends to come see it. We all ran back around and we ALL saw it. As soon as i moved a bit closer and came out of the shadow of my house, the beam swung right on to me and locked on to me.

One moment I was standing in the field next to this person looking up at this object. The next thing I remember was being inside what looked like a suergical theatre on a bed or trolley unable to move or react being examined by unfamiliar beings who appeared to be carrying out what looked like surgical or medical procedures.Later I found myself back in another field near the festival site feeling completely disorientated.

The color of the streaking object was bright green, like some sort of flare.  I would like to assume it was a flare, but again I cannot.  Flares do not streak low across the sky with such speed.

It shot past us and we felt no air current off it and we saw no ripple on the ocean from it&apos;s passing.As it was climbing away from us,no noise at all.Nothing, like we were deaf.How&apos;s this possible? We stared up for lights,propulsion,anything.We saw no more,heard no more.I can only say it was like we were seeing it in a dream but we were wide awake and backed each other up what we had just seen only feet away lit up.In my mind I can see it as clear as the night we saw it.My father is now 79 years old and we talk about it every once in a while.We were very lucky to be standing at the right place at the right time.We eventually moved down the beach to the north into darkness and watched the comet&apos;s crash into the horizon of the ocean as the sun rose.It was an eventful night.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

PD))Triangle formations over Washington and Oregon checked against satellite data...OUFOR.Two team members/investigators for Oregon UFO Research, a husband and wife team, were staying at James Gillilands Sattva Sanctuary over the Labor Day weekend as they frequently do to skywatch near the base of Mt Adams in Trout Lake Washington. Steven Greers group (Disclosure Project) was there on their first night of skywatching during their week long stay in the area for their paid conference. Mr. Greer was not there at the time and was to arrive a few days later. The husband and wife were approximately 150 yards east of the Greer group for their skywatch along the driveway from the main road into the house.A few minutes after 11:00 p.m. they heard several people in the Greer group to their left shouting in an excited fashion for several seconds. Wondering what the shouting was about they both searched the sky to see what they were looking at. The wife saw it first and it was a triangle. The form was an uneven elongated triangle with one of the trailing lights ahead of its counterpart. The Brightness was dim but was readily discernible as moving together in formation. The husband hastily got out his camcorder and tried to video the object. He could see it in his camera and, after a few seconds, it made a banking turn and headed back the same direction that it came from. Approximately three seconds after it had made the turn, all three lights faded out together. Throughout the whole sighting the three lights stayed in formation and kept the same brilliance. Here is a computer rendition of that sighting by team member Cameron Johnson in the modeling department...http://www.oregonuforeview.com/MTADAMS.jpg It was headed from north to south and after the turn it headed back the way it came and rapidly went out. The weather was clear and there are no streetlights in the area. The milky way was readily visible. There was no moon. Everyone who was outside skywatching saw the object or formation...over 15 people. There was no object visible within the lights as they were not markers. There was no sound, or visible trails from it. Its size was about half a hand at arms length. Bill and Ferne were facing north when they saw it and it was directly overhead. There were no obstructions and they report having an excellent view.This is a substantial sighting and team members ((three names deleted)) will be getting together with the witnesses soon to fill out a detailed report form and gather any further information available.Friday, September 6th update...We have recieved NOSS Triad Satellite information for the evening of the sighting and, if in fact these times are correct, indicate that this sighting WAS NOT not satellites.However, at 11:30, a half hour later, another report was submitted from Clackamas, Oregon.  The witness writes... &quot;At 11:30 p.m., I observed three objects traveling from the NW to SE at satellite speed. The objects were as bright as the brightest star. They formed a triangle, one flying directly behind the lead object at some distance (close enough to be considered flying together). The third object was about 45 degrees from the tailing object, closer in the formation, that is between the lead object and its&apos; trailer. The objects were observed both with the naked eye and through 10X50 binoculars. Duration of observation was about 20 seconds, then the objects disappeared after flying directly overhead. This may have been a result of the reflection from the sun being out of reflective range.&quot; The same NOSS triad satellite information for the evening of this sighting shows that this may well be NOSS triad satellites.Date Mag Time Alt.

I yelled at my neighbor to look, but by the time she got turned around it had passed on behind the trees.  It was blue in the front with colors of yellowish, green, white mix behind it. I knew this could not be fireworks of any kind, because of the way it was traveling across the sky.  And, I have never witnessed a falling star that looked like that.

We recalled that it was getting close to time for the Perseids. We saw a few meteors, and continued to look for others. The observers were an adult couple, their teenaged daughter, and two adult females, ranging in age from 14 - 53. All adults are college educated, but not scientists. No alcohol or any other potentially conscious-altering substances had been consumed by any of us, the entire day. We pointed out to each other several moving points of light, at different times, that appeared to be satellites (we see quite a few of those out here). Then one of us spotted what he thought was another satellite. We all looked, and at first it appeared similar to the previous satellites we had seen, ie. a small point of light moving at a constant rate of speed, similar to that of a satellite. But then it began to move erratically instead of following a smooth, straight orb. It zigzaged and curved back on its path, and seemed to slow down and speed up, following the type of non-pattern you might walk if you were looking for something you had dropped in the grass, if you weren&apos;t sure where you had dropped it exactly. We discussed it, trying to think of anything that might produce such movement. After meandering about in this fashion for several minutes, the point of light just winked out. Not a gradual trailing off into the distance, but *poof* it was gone, completely. We all saw it... and none of us have never seen anything like it.

I would leave messages for Dr. ((deleted)) to call me.  The calls were never returned.  At one point I finally reached a receptionist.

I left my name and number again.  The call was never returned.  In the mean time I was discussing this with Kenny Young.  He tried to call many times also.  He also got the run around by the same receptionist who, by the way, said they were open every day.  That was not true.

He would not disclose who it was.  He told Kenny that he would pass along Kenny&apos;s name and number to the claimant.  Of course Kenny nor I have heard anything from the claimant. I have concluded that this case was a hoax.  The reasons why I believe this to be so are the following:1. I believe that Mr. ((deleted)) knew we were trying to contact him and he refused to acknowledge our effects.  2. He was evasive in comments made to Kenny when he was finally reached3. When reporting the incident to NUFORC, we were led to believe that this happened to him personally.4. He presented himself as a doctor in the NUFORC contact information and said he was leaving a medical building when this occurred.  He was a medical doctor.  He was not a doctor.5. I believe that if he had been reporting this for someone else he would have stated that in the contact info instead of leading us to believe it was him this happened to.The above reasons are why I had not gotten back to you on this case sooner.

The shape appeared in  silhouette against the sun.  The four lane highway was divided by a median down which stretched the highline towers.  Below the object, at least 20 vehicles were pulled off the road into the median and people were out of the vehicles looking up at the object.

It seemed in no hurry to leave, and kept the distance between itself and the three copters approxamately the one mile distance.

I told her it was an airplane characteristic of the blue and red flashing lights. She then told me my brother also saw it 18 KM away. I said that was impossible. I decided this requires more research. I hauled out my telescope. Spotted the object at 50 power and noticed it was no airplane. Went to 200 power. I then had a clear picture. It was close to the characteristic flying saucer shape. It glowed very intensely. Had a weird rotating sensor beam on the top part of the saucer. It flashed aqua color first and then orange-red second. Much like a rotating spot beam at a 0.5 second rotation. Obviously one beam that could scan orange-red and then aqua. I then took relative size calculations. Today I took bearing calculations at my place and my at my brothers to figure out the distance to the object. I also took an object that looked the same size in the telescope at a distance that i measured to figure out the size. I went over to my brothers who pointed to where he saw it. I used my GPS to get the bearing at his place. Using math I calculated the object was 30 meter diameter at a distace of 200 KM. That puts it over Vancouver Island. The object also moved much like a star in the sky. This indicates that it could not be an object in close orbit. The object must of been under power.

It was a very bright light that at first looked like a comet, coming directly toward me. But as I watched it get brighter for a very short period of time, maybe 4 seconds it then got dimmer, and traveled in a southerly direction and got so dim that it eventually disappeared. However, the odd thing is, there was another that followed and did the exact same thing after this one disappeared, coming out of what I would say was the exact same location, following the exact same path the first one did, and faded in the same location.", "I was sitting on my patio last night with a friend of mine when I suddenly noticed a light in the sky.  It slowly appeared; maybe 2 or 3 seconds.  I told my friend and she noticed it too.  I think the light appeared in the southeast direction at about 65 degrees.  The light was very bright, fairly large (much bigger than a star or shooting star), white, and perfectly round.  At first we thought it was a headlight to a plane that was low but realized there was no sign of a plane (i.e., noise, blinking lights, etc.)  The light seemed to look like a headlight on some aircraft that was flying fairly low.When we were both looking at it, it seemed to peak in brightness - as if the light were shinging very close to us - like a spotlight.  It then dimmed from very bright to nothing in the next 2-3 seconds.  I think the dimming was the light source turning to the right and then away.  When it was turning to the right, we were able to still track the dimming light for about 10 degrees to the right then the light completely disappeared.  We continued to look in that direction for the next 20-30 minutes and never saw anything else other than the usual stars and planes.There was never any noise, any other lights attached to it, and never saw any shape of the object other than the light itself.  The weather was clear and calm.  It was too far away to have been an aircraft to have had had bright of a light shining from it.While we continued to look for any other lights, we discussed what we saw.  We both described the same thing and hopefully my description explains what we saw.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the flare from an Iridium satellite may have been the cause of the sighting.

Three people were talking when one yelled out for the others to look at something. A small spherical object, &quot;absolutely round and shiny&quot; and about the size of a tennis ball was observed at a distance of no more than 10 feet away. The object which moved in a slow straight line down the center of the road, was only about 6 feet off the ground and appeared silent. THe object appeared to be powered as it moved down towards the end of the complex. At one point it zig-zagged to the right, then to the left, and soon went out of sight.

I was heading northwest out of Colfax up to Sprague Lake where I was going to get on I-90.  About midway there I looked up and seen a large airplane traving north. I could not tell if it was a passenger or cargo plane, but it was not a small plane(not a private prop or company yet). It was your typical large airplane, what else can I say. Anyway, there was also a large dark oval or egg shaped &quot;spot&quot; following on the airplanes left flank. It was a very dark object with no distinct characteristics other than it was oval like, very dark and seemed to have no real distinct boundary. Quite small compared to the airplane... not much longer that the width of the wing - I would guess about the size of my pickup truck. I would say it was within 20 feet or so of the fusilage (sp?) of the airplane - traveling parallel with it - following it. I was driving at the time and taking glances up from the road as often as I could and started to slow down. I am thinking, &quot;this has got to be a figment of my imagination&quot;. I pulled over quickly and got out and looked up and the dark object was then directly in front of the plane - both traveling in the same direction and at the same speed. Both still heading north. I was thinking at the time that it had to be a visual anomalie and starting rubbing my eyes, etc and looking around in the skies for similar anomalies. I am out there in the sagebrush desert, no one else on the road, just starring up at this event in amazement. About then I noticed two military jets coming from the east (probably the airbase at Spokane).  I am thinking &quot;if they are coming on behalf of that airliner, man, this is something to be witnessing&quot;. Sure enough. The jets were moving fast and when they got within, say, a mile or so, the dark object just took off. Very, very, very fast is all I can say. There was a &quot;wake&quot; in the blue part of the sky - a dark path almost like a parting of the atmosphere directly in front of! the air liner. The UFO was there one minute and the next minute it was gone. Both military fighers came up and paralleled the airliner for a short distance and then left. And that was it. The airliner was a bit north of me by then. But I still remember that &apos;vapor trail&apos; or dark path through the atmosphere. It slowly &quot;filled in&quot; or otherwise turned the normal sky blue.Another time, I was up in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness near French Ridge. Miles from any highway. At least two mountains between me and I-90 and 9 miles from the dirt road that I drove up. I set up camp near a small creek before Turquoise Lake. Was woken up that night by a humming sound. Never seen anything, but the humming got louder the softer then louder... etc in a cycle that lasted all night.  I am thinking, I am in the heart of a wilderness area at least 8 miles from the road. 4&apos;000 feet of elevation gain by trail and backpack. What the hell could be &apos;humming up here&apos;. Definitely a big machinery like sound. And very large though it seemed to be at least a quarter mile from me.  I could not tell which direction only that it was somewhere in that basin. I was pretty worried camping out there (was backpacking solo on that trip). Got up in the morning and looked around. Not much for trees up there as I was just at or above timerline. I hiked and looked around the basin that morning but could find nothing. This also happened in the mid 80&apos;s.Never mentioned either event before as I certainly have no respect for a government that hides such things. Don&apos;t want anything to do with them or talk with them. I figure it has been long enough now that they wouldn&apos;t bother. Too damn many other folks and sightings and such.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "I saw the same thing on 8/15 and 8/16 in approx. the same area.

I told him it couldn&apos;t be because of that and to hurry up and look again! The longer we looked at it the more we were saying, &quot;what the heck is that!!!&quot; It was flying in a strange manner turning and twisting so we could see all aspects of it. Right before we lost sight of it, it turned in a way that we could see it had reddish-orange lights on it. It didn&apos;t make any noise.

My family are a bunch of pilots and I have been taught by them how to identify aircraft in the sky.Around 8:40pm looking out I noticed a group of birds flying just above the horzion and above a tall tree, so I can imagine the birds were about 80 to 200 feet above.  As soon as I watched the birds fluttering up and down heading from left to right across my window I noticed another object about the same size as the birds from my distance, but it didn&apos;t flutter.  It went really fast, faster than any bird and it kept very straight and steady.  And it seemed to be just above the birds, but as quick as it was I really couln&apos;t tell the distance from the object to the ground.  I would say it lasted between 10 seconds to 20 seconds that I saw it.  By that time the object has disappeared out of my sight and the birds were still just making it barely to the half way point of my vision from my window.  The object passed the whole window, so I can use that as a measuring tool.  The speed astounded me, because it was unreal.  When airplanes approach or fly over, you hear them from inside my house.  There was no noise from the craft. No sonic boom, nothing!  Note airplanes you can make out a shape because they are not that fast to the point that you can&apos;t tell its an airplane.  Everyone knows this.  Of course it could be the airforce, but then there would of been some sonic boom or some noise.  I wonder if anyone else noticed this object.  Lastly, there were planes in the sky above, and they definitly could not compare to the unidentified object that I saw, meaning there was clearly something unusual about what i saw compared to a cesna, 747, 737, 777, or any other commericial and non commerical aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness implies a date of July 30th, 2002.

Within a few minutes I noticed a craft pass directly overhead at an estimated altitude of 200-300 feet.  At the time I was a ((rank deleted)) in USAF working in flight ((deleted--involves flight activities)).  I had been in USAF about ((duration deleted)) years at that time and had worked with aircraft for about 7 years and could identify most of USAF flying inventory at that time.  After the craft passed over I told the girls that I hoped that that EC-121 was not in trouble and did not crash because he was way too low for normal flight.  My first impression was that it was a USAF EC-121 Radar Picket airplane which were stationed at McClellan AFB.  These planes were 1930&apos;s era Lockheed Super Constellations.  As we steped back into the house the program we had been watching had been prempted by a local newsbreak.  An unidentified craft had been reported in the Fair Oaks, Citrus Heights areas.  Upon reflecting on what we had seen I realized that there had been no engine sounds.  An EC-121 at 300 feet, assuming not all engines were out, would have been deafening directly over head.It is my contention that the brain does not immediately misidentify objects which it cannot readily identify; but initially attempts to identify such objects as a known object.  When I ponderd why I initially identified the craft as a 121 a number of clues came forward.  It appeared to be a medium gray color in the bright moon light the 121&apos;s at the base were painted gray.  It appeared to have a wing; however upon reflection I could not recall a fuselage, only a wing.  It appeared to have portholes with light emmanating from them.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))Dear Mr. ((name deleted)), Thank you very much for the excellent report!  Given your credentials as a USAF military officer, the report is particularly interesting to us. If possible, I would like to pin down the date with somewhat greater accuracy.  Is there any way you could reconstruct the date, do you think?  For example, do you remember the program you were watching, by any chance?  Also, do you happen to recall the station you were watching that broadcast the news report?  Do you remember the phase of the Moon, perhaps? Do your daughters remember the incident, by any chance?  If so, would they be willing to submit independent reports of their recollection of the event?  We have observed that different witnesses recall different details about an object, and all those facts help in understanding what was seen. Finally, could you provide us with an illustration of the object you saw?  If your daughters could do the same, we would be happy to post them with your reports.  Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport((RESPONSE))Hello Peter,I would very much like to help pin down the date but all I remember was that I am fairly certain it was in the summer and it was not oppressively hot that night as I recall so I believe it to have been May or June and the moon was full as I recall.  I am fairly sure of the year because we bought the house in summer of 1972 and I resigned my commission in ((month deleted)) 74 and I was working ((location deleted--West Coast)) by Summer of 74.  I put the patio in subsequent to the first summer we were there.  I have not a clue as to program or channel we were watching I am fairly certain it was one of big three ABC, CBS, NBC.  I have talked to my daughters about the incident in the past and they vaguely recall it but primarily because I have brought it up not because in left an impression upon them.  The image in my mind is of a wing with portholes with light emanating from them.  I can sketch such for you and email it.

The object tilted and it appeared to have a cone-like bottom.  It hovered in the NW sky for about 30 minutes and then slowly moved North and West.  I notified the police but by the time the officer arrived, it was out of view.  I called my friend in Hamlin, NY (about 10 miles NW of Rochester) and she and her husband went outside and saw SEVERAL ufo&apos;s in the NW sky.  She spoke with the officer over the phone and reported her sighting.After the officer left, we noticed another ufo in the NE sky over Rochester that was hovering.  They appear as bright colored stars that pulsate and change color, but when looking thru binoculars we could definitely make out saucer shaped objects.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that  twinkling stars may, indeed, have been the cause of the sighting, but that is surmise.  However, if one or more of them moved as described by the witness, they could not have been stars.

The lights were more like shadowy shapes and were grey (sometimes changed to red) in appearance.  What we saw were bird-like in shape with the width (i.e. wing span) varying in width.  They generally moved across the Milky Way in approximately 5-7 seconds.  They started out dim, got brighter as they passed over and then dimmed.  At times they appeared stippled.  They almost moved like a wave in the water.  They moved in different directions across the sky.  Most of the time each shadow moved in a single direction, but rarely some changed direction as they moved.  Most of the time we saw one shadowy shape at a time, but occassionaly we would see two at a time moving in different directions. We saw approximately 50 during the half hour we viewed them.  We were viewing the Percieds at the best time of the year and saw many shooting stars.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witnesses to the event, and they seemed to us to be both sincere and quite credible.

The &quot;object&quot; had an orangish glow not red and the boomerang or v shape broke up completely two or three times to form somewhat of a circle.  I was able to watch them long enough to determine with 99% certainty that what I was seeing was birds.I called two wild bird companies to find out what kind of bird migrates at 10:30 at night or later and could &quot;glow in the dark.&quot;  I was told that the  white faced ibis, for one migrates in v&apos;s, is brownish grey, and has luminescent feathers that will reflect light from the setting sun or possibly street lights.  I was told also that birds migrate at night and in this situation probably from the Great Salt Lake to Utah Lake.  This is one possible explanation for what we saw.

Sometimes they were deviating from each others, and after that they were regrouping, but always distinctly. It was flying together, but independantly too.

As I studied the light, a second one appeared to the lower left which was moving at a moderate pace and fading from very bright, identical to the stationary light, to nothing at all, then back to very bright.

My ex-girlfriend and I were awake, talking as we began to fall asleep.  Then my ex nudged me and asked what the light was on the window shades (which were pulled down half way).  I looked at the shades and noticed a flickering light sort of.  I told it that it was probably heat lightning.  Then a moment later she nudges me again and asked me to go take a look.  Now the bedroom had two windows which were looking right into the back yard.  Also, there were some woods and a pond behind the house as well.  The pond was about 60 yards from the window view.I got up and went to the window on the left, and my ex went to the window on the right.  I looked out the window and saw what looked like someone walking in the woods with a flashlight.  That&apos;s what the flickering must have been.  I told her that either someone was walking in the woods or even might have been fishing in a boat and they were using a flashlight.She then told me to look to the left, that she saw a light on the water.  I looked and saw a light reflecting off the water from a house on the other side of the pond.  But then I leaned forward to look to the far left (which is not where she was looking)just to see if anyone else was out there.What I saw next shocked me.  In fact when I saw it, I couldn&apos;t even move, it&apos;s like I was paralyzed.  There were 4 balls of light, each about 4 or 5 feet in diameter, and each a soft but bright white.  The four balls were rotating around a central point, each spaced equally from the next.  The balls were rotating slowly in a clockwise direction, and as a whole, were also moving away from the house to the left behind some trees.  They were hovering above the water about 3 feet.  Before going out of sight, the balls began to pulsate in intensity.  After a couple seconds, they simultaneously changed color to blue then red, while still pulsing.  I don&apos;t recall which color they went to first, but those were the 2 colors.  All the time they were pulsating, rotating and moving as a unit in an easterly direction over the water. My ex-girlfriend did not see these balls of light, because I was in such an immediate shock  I couldn&apos;t move and I couldn&apos;t tell her.  I was sweatting from every pore of my body.As soon as the balls of light went out of view, another strange thing happened.   We both witnessed this.  From above the trees where the balls of light had gone, a very bright white light began to &quot;scan&quot; the small patch of woods to the left side of the back yard.  My grandmother was living in a small trailer right at the water&apos;s edge at that time and the light had gone systematically left and right and down level by level until it completed...It even &quot;scanned&quot; my gandmother&apos;s trailer.In an instant, the light disappeared then instantly, our backyard had been systematically &quot;scanned&quot; as if the light was directly above our house.

I had a weird feeling I was being watched.  So I looked around and saw (the only way I can really describe it) is like a silver space suit type thing on the side of the house.  But it was only there for one second.  From where I was standing I could see both sides of the house.  One second later it was on the other corner.  Then back again.  I don&apos;t know if there was several or if that one just moved faster than light.  I wasn&apos;t afraid of them.  I was scared because it was unknown to me.  I started shaking and went into the house and never said a word to anyone in my family.  When I walked in the front door I locked it and deadbolted it.  I walked upstairs and saw my family all watching a T.V. show.  I didn&apos;t say anything, because I thought they would think I was crazy.  I went to the big patio door and locked that to.  Then I went to take a shower.  As I was in the shower, the house started to shake and I heard this loud noise.  I hurried up and got out and threw my clothes on and ran into the living room.  My dad was the only one there.  I said &quot;where is everyone&quot;, and he said outside watching a spaceship or something.  I went running outside and my mother and brothers and sisters were watching this thing that they said had come out of our woods and shot to the sky so fast and was making this loud noise.  All I could see was the dot way up in the sky.  They said it shot out of the woods so fast you couldn&apos;t see what it was.  At that time I told my mom my little story.  I don&apos;t think she would have believed me, but she said she did because when they went to run outside they couldn&apos;t get the door open because I had locked all the locks.  About a week later, my mom and dad were home alone and that same noise came back and the house started to shake and they lost electricity.

I do believe there are a lot of hoaxes out there, but I have to believe there is something, because I saw like silver suited, what I think were beings, and they couldn&apos;t have been from this planet, because they moved to fast in second intervals.

The motion of the lights was very unusual, hovering at times then disappearing instantaneously the next minute to another part of the sky.Both myself,my business colleague and the taxi driver were taken back by what we viewed.

Basicly I turned my head, and when I looked back toward the planet/star, it was gone. This gave me a creepy feeling at first but was soon replaced by more wonder. Right there where the planet/star was a minute ago, there were 2 lights, not as bright as the other stars at first and they were moving. They flashed and blinked blue , red and white. They moved very slowly and finaly disappeared behind a mountain. This was to the north of me. I thought that this was extemely odd, then I saw another two lights , possibly the same ones , so I went and got my camcorder. They floated out of sight just like the first two, and as soon as they were gone there would be two more. They seemed to travel in pairs or threes. This pattern repeated. I had probably seen ten or twelve of these lights when I looked over to the east and what looked like a helicopter shining a spotlight was coming right at me. It came within 100 yards and then turned and moved into some trees , I could still see it betwwen the trees and finaly it disappeard. This object made no sound at all. The other lights came and went for about 2 hours and then finaly stopped at about 12:30 AM. None of these objects made any noise and moved very slowly. To the naked eye there seemed to be something coming off of these objects, not like smoke but more like an aura or a haze.  I haven&apos;t been given an explanation for these sightings. I have about an hour of video where you can plainly see how slow they move and that they made no noise. I have the strange spotlight on video as well, the images are shaky because it is a cheap 8mm camera and i couldnt see the lights through the viewfinder so I wasnt sure I was getting them on film. I just got lucky. And when I went to study the tapes , I came to a conclusion that these pairs and threes of lights were most likely not seperate crafts but one larger craft. I foun! d this a fter examining the video and saw how the lights blinked in a rotating sequence. My mother witnessed these events as well. All I can come up with is that they were some sort of balloons. Thats the only aircraft that I can imagine would move so slowly and so close together and in such numbers. The helicopter like light is what confuses me. The only thing that could have manuveured the way this thing did would be a helicopter. Actualy I dont think that a helicopter could have flown through the trees the way this thing did. It seemed to shine a light right down at me the way a helicopter would. And it was probably less than 100 yard away. The odd thing is that it was silent,not even a hum, so I have no clue what it was. At about midnight or just after , a jet flew through the sky right through were these other objects were, but it came from a different direction, the south.It was obviously a jet because it moved fast and made a jetlike noise. After this I only saw 1 more set of lights. My mother and I both concluded that these were not airplanes or helicopters because of the speed and the lack of sound.

The object appeared to be stationary or moving very slowly around the 1-2,000 foot range.  The object was located at 2:00 o&apos;clock in the sky from my path across the bridge onto the island.  I blinked and blinked and blinked again, and the object was visible to me for approximately 5-6 seconds.

The light was still reddish/orange but very small.  This time it seemed to move in a zig-zag pattern but not going in any particular direction.  I lost sight of it after about 15 minutes.

After maybe another 10 or 15 minutes later I look up and there is the light again in the first original position I had seen it - Only this time it was a white speck of light (looked like a star)!

Late one evening, my father was listening to the Arkasas Traveler&apos;s baseball game on a local AM station.  At one point during the game the station broadcast that numerious people were calling in and reporting that a UFO could be seen in the night sky over North Little Rock. Upon hearing this, my father, mother, and one or more of my siblings went outside to observe. On that paticular evening, I was camping out with a friend in his backyard. His house was about a block down the street from my parents house. Not really expecting or looking for anything unusual my friend and I observed an object to the east traveling north.  It moved silently across the sky and and several amber lights that traveled in a circular motion around the exterior of the object as if it were rotating. We were in our early teens and did not really think too much about what we had seen. When I arrived at home the following day, my parents told me what had happened the previous evening and about the radio broadcast.  They too had observed the same object my friend and I had seen.In addition there was an article in the Arkansas Democrat the next day stating that jet aircraft at the Little Rock Air Force base had been scrambled but was unsuccessful in their pursuit of the object.  If anyone else has knowledge of this event and can relate the specific year and day I would appreciate it as I would like to find the article in the Ark Democrat archives.  In addition to this event there was another similar event that occurred in Jacksonville Arkansas in the late 60s where jets from the Little Rock AFB were scrambled to chase an object. This event was also documented in the Arkansas Democrat.((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to obtain the exact date from the newspaper.

We also like to look for satellites and shooting stars.  The evening was about 70 degrees with humidity around 65%.  We were approximately five miles from the nearest village, so light interference was minimal.  The sky was clear.  My wife and friend had gone into an open field ahead of me.  As they were looking into the sky nearly directly overhead, they observed a greenish colored light, slightly bigger than most stars, but at quite a distance.  No sooner had both of them spotted this when three white lights came out of the one green light and headed in different directions moving faster than satellites would and then all four quickly disappeared.  They informed me of this observation upon my arrival only a minute or less later, but I gave it little thought.  We continued watching the stars and saw a few shooting stars when we all turned to look at the north-east sky, not far from directly overhead when we saw a light which I initially labeled landing lights.  Very shortly after saying that, I realized the light was not moving in any direction, but was coming closer and getting brighter.  It had the appearance of a bright car headlight coming at us from a distance.  Just about the time I thought the light was getting close enough and bright enough to almost cast a shadow, it immediately started moving away, but still not moving in any linear fashion.  It became so dull in appearance that it resembled the satellites we&apos;ve observed on numerous occasions.  At that time, it began moving in a south-easterly direction much faster than any satellite until it disappeared.  All three of us stood in awe of this site, not knowing what to think at that time.

Normally when I see an object in the sky that I do not recigonize I look for the marker lights (e.g. the red flasher on the botom side of most aircraft).  I did not see any on these objects.  One time I did notice a faint steady red light in the centre of one object.  What realy makes these stand out is the fact they are going very slow, and they seem to make the same FLAT left hand turn in about the same area.  Most aircraft except for helicopters will bank to make a turn.  These do not they make a flat aproximetly 45 degree angle left hand turn.

Thanks", "Alien crafts-Eastern South Dakota- late summer early fall 1996Sorry this report is a few years late, but I have just decided to bring it out in to the open due to a more &quot;relaxed&quot; attitude people are having with UFO&apos;s.  My self and wife were visiting my parents in their farmhouse in eastern South Dakota.  My daughter was in bed and Me and my wife went to sleep in an upstairs room room facing west.  Typical to east SoDak there were no trees at all obstruction the view of the sky, and the nearest pollution light was 22 miles away in that direction.  She pointed out a light to me she said had just settled in the sky near by.  I was totally used to seeing the occassional plane or helicopter, even though it was farm country, and low level aircraft are extremely rare, cropdusters are even very rare out there, probably due to wind and a below average economy.  What I saw almost knocked me off my feet it was so out of place and obviously &quot;extra-terrestrial&quot;.About 2 and 1/2 miles straight west, and slightly north there was a light hovering still in the sky.  My sife claimed to have seen it arrive there &quot;gliding in very fast&quot; If she hadn&apos;t caught the movement out of the corner of her eye while preparing for bed, I believe neither of us would have seen it and would have gone to bed.  Even though it was fairly close the ships light was not outrageously bright.  I call it a ship, because after watching it for 22 minutes I had no doubt it was an aircraft we were observing.  She said in suprised voice (amused even). What is that?  I saw a fairly bright light to the west.  I could pinpoint its location be cause for some reason the light cast an extremely faint, but discernable glow on the ground below it.  The light was normal white light, it did have what seemed to be a slight bluish tint to it.  I have always had extremely good vision doctors tell me 15/20, this is in my medical reports since very young childhood.  The land this craft hovered over was occupied by the biggest herd of cattle in the area.  I know the farmer personally, and his Black Angus are reknowned.  (Four years before, his hired man, laughed and told me how this rancher was constantly at stress at how his cattle were getting rustled with no tire prints at the the theft scene, see, load a trailer with cattle and it will chew up dirt when you leave, but then again it was one here and one there, who knows I put this together in the weeks following the siting).We watched this light hover out there, we&apos;re both intelligent and discussed opsprey and harrier aircraft. then 12 minutes into the siting the light shifted about 10 meters to the north (right) and 15 or 20 down, so fast it was mind boggling This was the first time I saw it move, and I knew I was watching a machine from another world or galaxy was right in front of me.We talked for another ten minutes and it shot straight upwards into &quot;the heavens&quot; we were speechless.  She is the product of a stoic german midwestern back-ground.  And she admitted that there was no way to explain what we saw except UFO.  6 years later, almost exactly, I figure if it was a US military craft, it was alien technology.On my honor and word, this is not a joke.  I actually wrote because after watching an x-files rerun with a guy wearing a nicap hat in it.  Not a joke.Immediatly after the sighting, myself and my wife could not drop the fact that we had witnessed something that shook our world and our entire belief system.  We were literally in a mild shock.  We lightheartedly said we would watch that weeks x-files.  I don&apos;t know how long, but it wasn&apos;t too long after that sighting that we saw the episode with the plane and the guy with the nicap hat. (by the way, I guessed date, but didn&apos;t want to guess one for fear of lack of credibility).  I know I am close.  Even for six years of memory erosion.One reason I have converted every person I have told this story to, into a UFO believer is that they know the wife.  She is the protestant prude from the wealthy family who wouldn&apos;t believe anything she couldn&apos;t see.  I have to say over the years, that event changed her more than almost anything.  And I have to say for the positive.  Please write if you saw lights in the Dakotas in that time.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))I enclosed a email to you earlier, I forgot a fact.  The light also gave me a perfect lidea of its heighth. About 250 meters.  I remembered also when the ship left, it left a trail of light, but just for a fraction of a second, not sustained.  I just remembered, I can&apos;t accept the phone call due to a person I rent from.  Please write or email I will correspond, and can give affidavits by her or me.

Sometimes, it reversed its direction suddenly.  Then I looked at the other two lights, and they seemed to be wobbling, too.  I kept looking at the total shape of the formation and saw that the triangle did change shape, with the light on the right-hand point of the triangle doing the most movement.

I glanced up (about 60 degrees)and spotted a bright light in the sky.  It was still very much daylight, and I thought to myself that I might be looking at Venus, which is certainly bright enough at times to be visible during the day; I thought this because the object was motionless.  However, upon further consideration I realized that Venus would be much lower in the sky by that time, so I reached inside my sliding glass door and grabbed my binoculars which I keep close by to look at the planes making their final approach to Hartsfield Airport.  It is difficult to say at what altitude the craft was hovering but since I could see no detail with the naked eye I am going to estimate that the craft was at about 10,000 feet) When I centered the object and focused, I saw what looked to be a metallic sphere surrounded (seemingly attached) by three or four smaller spheres which were rotating around the larger, center sphere (imagine a basketball surrounded by three or four bowling balls).  The object drifted slowly to the west, but definitely under control, not at all like a balloon caught in the wind -- it was a very windy day at least at ground level but the object drifted only about two hand lengths during the five minute or so time span that I watched it.  As well as drifting to the west, the object also drifted higher.  The longer I watched it, the less detail I saw.  I finally lost the object after watching it for about five minutes.  At no time did I see any type of contrail or evidence of propulsion.  A bit later (two or three minutes) I did spot a plane which looked to be flying toward where I last saw the object (very high and extremely small) but I could never quite center the plane in my binoculars and soon lost sight -- I was interested in seeing what kind of plane it was.", "UFO Seen Over Atlantic on the same night as major new jersey sighting last year.We were on our way to go fishing out of Sheepshead Bay, NY about one &frac12; hour out into the Atlantic.

They were a bluish white and made out the shape of an oval, as it was dark, I could not make out the shape, I would assume it was some sort of disk, however, the lights only gave me a 2 dimensional feel of the object.

The sky was very clear with a few clouds in the distance.  My female friend stated, &quot;whats that&quot; and pointed to the northwest.

They all watched the object with us for a few minutes and did not reply.  The object hovered over the pool area for 1-2 minutes and then began moving towards the southwest again.

Let me state that I could hear the noise from the traffic on the roadways, and air traffic in the distance (a ! southwes t airlines plane flew by from east to west) - but at no time did I hear any noise from the object.

As we watched it I suddenly said, &quot;Look!  It just got brighter!&quot;  As it moved along in a straight path its diameter increased, it glowed more brightly, from a pinhead size to almost the size of a pea at arm&apos;s length.

When I saw it through my binoculars it had a fuzzy appearance to it and it seemed to have white dots around its perimeter.  I was using a Bushnell 10X50 to view the object).  I then wondered if it had been reflecting light from the sun or if it had actually glowed internally.  Then something amazing happened.  It dimmed to almost nothing. It was now barely visible, and there were no clouds along the entire flight path of this object.  Finally, this is the amazing part, it made a 30 degree (from the horizon) turn to the right and then disappeared, the whole time travelling at the same rate of speed.  It&apos;s color had first been a pale white and had glowed to a very intense white when it&apos;s diameter increased and then had returned to a very dim pale white before it made its turn and disappeared.  It&apos;s travel path, again, was from West to East and travelling down toward the horizon at almost a 45 degree angle.

At 10 p.m., the search for Todd Sees of Northumberland was suspended for the night. Search coordinator Point Township Fire Chief Leon Geise said six teams with K-9 dogs planned to resume the search at 6 a.m. today, with more volunteers beginning a ground and air search at 8 a.m. &quot;It&apos;s not an easy thing to have to leave,&quot; he said of the decision to temporarily call off the search. &quot;We need some closure and we don&apos;t have it.&quot; Sees left his RD2 Northumberland home at about 5 a.m. Sunday to go scouting for deer on a portion of his 80-acre property, according to his brother, Ty Sees. &quot;When he didn&apos;t come back by 12:30 p.m., four of us went out looking for him,&quot; Ty Sees said late Sunday afternoon. &quot;It&apos;s not like him to be gone this long.&quot; Harold &quot;Brub&quot; Sees joined the initial search that yielded no sign of his son. &quot;We covered the area he normally covers,&quot; the elder Sees said. &quot;We hollered constantly, but didn&apos;t see or hear him. &quot;Todd knows this territory like the back of his hand. What bothers me is that he&apos;s been gone too long.&quot; Clad in a white T-shirt soaked with sweat, Brub Sees also worried how his son was coping in the intense heat, which climbed into the 90s by early afternoon. A coordinated search effort began at 2:30 p.m. when Northumberland Borough Fire Chief Josh Newbury received a call from Sue Sees requesting help in finding her husband. Newbury said Todd Sees was planning to go scouting on the ridge with another person who later decided not to go out. Although no one saw Todd Sees leave early Sunday morning, his 18-year-old son, Nick, did find his four-wheeler on the west end of the ridge two miles from their home at about 12:30 p.m., Brub Sees said. Todd Sees is an avid outdoorsman who&apos;s known to &quot;walk for hours,&quot; Northumberland No. 1 Fire Department volunteer Nate Fisher said, but he&apos;s never stayed out for so long without contacting family. &quot;The heat, that&apos;s what scares me,&quot; Fisher said earlier in the day, adding that no one is certain what, if any, provisions Sees took with him. Ty Sees said his brother usually grabs a can of Mountain Dew and dresses in camouflage when he&apos;s gone out on similar excursions. Some volunteers speculated that Sees may have slipped on a rock and is unable to call for help. &quot;It very rough terrain and there&apos;s thick brush,&quot; Geise said. &quot;This is going to be a slow and methodical search.&quot; &quot;Be aware, rattlesnakes are in abundance,&quot; he told the volunteers preparing to head out on the search from the command post at the base of the ridge off Geise Road. However, the group had to wait several hours while three tracking dogs from Northstar Search &amp; Rescue of Selinsgrove and James Shaffer were sent out into the heavily wooded area to try to pick up Todd Sees&apos; scent. By 6 p.m. a state police helicopter from Hazelton had flown over the ridge looking for the missing man and Geise was requesting bloodhounds be brought in to assist the other canines in the search. At about 7:45 p.m., the bloodhound was on the scene and Geise decided he had to send the 25 volunteers out on foot to begin a sweep of a 6-square-mile area. &quot;It&apos;s been fruitless so far,&quot; the chief said an hour later.

Point Township police began investigating the death of Todd Sees after his body was discovered Aug. 5 in a wooded area at the western base of Montour Ridge about 150 yards from his house. An autopsy failed to conclude a cause of death and toxicology tests were ordered. &quot;Right now we&apos;re on hold until we get the test results,&quot; Point Township Police Chief Gary Steffen said Tuesday. The blood tests are expected to take another four or five weeks, he said. &quot;It&apos;s just a waiting game,&quot; Steffen said. &quot;Something certainly caused his death. The answer has to be in the blood.&quot; Sees was reported missing on the afternoon of Aug. 4, hours after he left his home on an ATV to go scouting for deer on Montour Ridge. A family member found the ATV about two miles from his home, but there was no sign of Sees. About 200 volunteers, along with tracking dogs and searchers in helicopters, looked for the missing man for several hours. About 30 hours after he went missing, Sees&apos; relatives stumbled upon his body in a densely wooded area of the ridge about 150 yards from his house. Northumberland County Coroner James Kelley said the autopsy revealed Sees had been dead between 24 hours to 36 hours, but found no signs of trauma or of coronary disease. n E-mail comments to mmoore@dailyitem.com Investigation into man&apos;s death a &apos;waiting game&apos;By Marcia MooreThe Daily ItemNORTHUMBERLAND Investigators are still awaiting toxicology results to determine what killed a 39-year-old Northumberland County man found in the woods near his home last month.

They looked very black to me.  One was circular and the other was an irregular shape which I thought at first was a hangglider or something.  But they were moving so slowly that I couldn&apos;t figure out what I was looking at.  The circular object was closer to me and both objects were slowly moving Southwest away from me.  Soon the irregular one was out of sight and I pulled my video camera out and taped the circular one until it disappeared into the clouds away from me.

At about 8:00pm the walls of my room began to rumble &amp; shake &amp; there was an unbelievably loud sound. I ran upstairs and screamed &quot;are we having an earthquake?&quot; and looked to see my Mom &amp; Dad looking out a high window above our next door neighbor&apos;s house, upwards, and the sound persisted.Then I got to look out the window &amp; I saw a huge--as big as 3 or 4 houses around us (and we lived on a hill)--HUGE-Round Saucer. It had some kind of pulsating lights on the sides &amp; was making this constant rythmic PULSATING-noise.We were all mesmerized by it (a few minutes) and then it just shot up higher thru the neighborhood.I do not remember any discussion among us (parents, self, 8 &amp; 10 yr old sister) or  anything after that until the next afternoon when I read in the Yakima Herald that many people reported seeing some kind of UFO the night before in our part of town.This might be old news to you guys becuse it happened 38 years ago but I remember it clearly.

I was only about 6 years old at the time.  Someone, I can&apos;t recall whichof us, spotted three silver saucer type ufos in the sky, just off to the southwest.  They didn&apos;t appear very far away, and you could easily see them through the treetops (though they may have been much higher in actuality).  There was no sound whatsoever emitted from the space crafts and the view was clear.  To this day we all remember the sighting.  I ran home to tell my parents, but within seconds the saucers vanished.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Afraid I suppose? My windows where down and no sound of a engine where heard.I have always wanted to believe in ufos but could not untill I saw one as for my wife she never did believe,now there is no question.This my first and only sighting and report.This was not a distant light nor any craft capabale of flight known to modern avation as far as I know it.The craft crossed the road again in front of us and we watched it slowly go out of sight.

Three bright lights in a straight line caught my eye as I was about 50 metres to my house. When I got out of the car and stood watching, I was still trying to comprehend what was going on. Three very bright and unusual lights were stationary in the sky, like hovering. They were redish in colour and looked quite far away. One of these started to move a bit. I sat at the car porch and they were there for about 10 minutes. Then they started to fade, as if flying further away. And then they dissapeared. Not planes, helicopters or statelite. They certainly looked very far away, so can&apos;t be lanterns(unless a very powerful lantern, because it&apos;s very high in the sky)", "3 objects in triangular pattern traverse sky with pattern change occuring.Saw 3 golden lights approaching from the SW. Were in a pattern with 2 up front and 1 in the rear ( a long triangle). As they flew past Cygnus they cut across the wing tip. All during the time they were approaching Cygnus, the right front object was gradually decelerating, it did this until it was even with the rear object. The triangle pattern had now reversed. The reversal took the entire time that it took these 3 objects to cover the sky.  They proceeded in the reversed pattern until I could no longer see them. I watched them with 7x50 binoculars, where they looked pretty bright. Without the binoculars they were very visible because of their brightness; they apperaed to be as bright as gamma Aquila. They had no flashing lights, even in the binoculars, and did not &quot;wobble&quot; as satellights sometimes do. They also never appeared to drop in the sky, even as they travelled beyond the binocular range. It took nearly 9 minutes for them to traverse the sky from horizon to horizon! .  I was watching from a small city 10k population site with street lights...", "Three egg-shaped objects drifting over Aventura MallThe date is approximate, but the time is accurate, as the mall we were at was closing.  My wife and I and my infant daughter and 4 year-old son were leaving the Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida, and were loading our packages in the car, when I looked up to see three dark, pewter-colored egg-shaped craft in a tight triangular formation pass silently overhead at a fairly slow pace -- it took them a minute to pass from directly overhead to behind the mall structure which was about a football field away.  I wouls estimate that they were less than 1000 feet in the air -- they were definitely below the cloud layer (the sky was partly cloudy).  The objects were silent as they passed over, like I said, pewter colored, but clearly outlined.  There was some surface light reflected off of the objects.  I called my wife, who did see them, but didn&apos;t have much to say.  She got into the car with my kids, and I watched them for the duration (about two or so minutes).", "in august 2001 my entire family saw two formations of saucer-like objects form &amp; unform over about 30-40 minutesit was just prior to sunset in august, last year. My son and his s.o. were taking me with them to my ex-wife&apos;s home. we were west bound on Euclid Ave. I saw what I thought was a metior; a bright orange trail of light crossing diagonally from high in the north to low in the south above the mountanous horizon. I pointed it out to my son and his girl. As we watched it came to a halt, from nearly, if not, mach speed to hovering. it appeared to be to the right of a mountain, thogh I am sure it was much farther west and highert (perhaps over the Pacific). Other saucer shaped objects came from other directions at a much slower speed. We got to my ex&apos;s, got her, my other two sons and daughter, went to a parking lot where the view was unobstructed, and we all watched as somehere around a dozen similar objects formed into a diamond formation, hovering. at times one or two would leave the formation for short durations then rerturn.another similar formation took shape appearing to the left of the mountain, and some of those objects left and returned from time to time. We were all fascinated by this sight. i commented that i hoped they weren&apos;t cowboy aliens here to round up human cattle for their tables, or aliens that figured they&apos;d best eliminate this warlike speices from the universe before we become a danger to them.then both formations broke off into various directions. I didn&apos;t call the radio station as i was somewhat intoxicated. none of the others were intoxicated. thogh it&apos;s been a about a year this event is still indellibly etched in my memory. i would even suspect myself of toxic halucination if it hadn&apos;t been seen by the entire family.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were in a chevy truck driving with the windows down.  As we were leaving the school, my friend that was sitting to my right noticed a some lights at just above the tree tops across the street approx. fifty yards.  He then asked &quot;When did they build a water tower there?&quot; My friend that was driving respond quickly that, &quot;that is not a water tower!&quot; At that moment this unidentified object took off to the north of where we were about 150 yards above the ground.  We drove down the McNeil road, driving east trying to catch up with the object.  It flew northest and then flew north along I-35, the turned north west. It was then that we lost sight of it.

Within about a minute I saw a triangular group of what I thought was three stars in the northern sky, these were fairly bright compared to others around them. To my surprise, I noticed that all three stars were moving - together. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and looked away. I looked again and realized they were in fact moving and the three &quot;stars&quot; or lights maintained their exact distance and relationship to each other, as they moved. The shape was a very large thin triangle. As far as its size, holding my arm straight out the object looked like it measured about and inch and a half long and a half-inch wide at its base. It moved slowly through the sky in a southeast direction, with the single light at the front and the two other lights toward the direction it was moving from. All three lights were white and looked just like bright stars - there was nothing visible between them or it may have just been black. The triangle appeared to be very high up in the sky, above normal airplane elevation. I ran into the house and told my wife to come outside, she did. By this time, about 5 minutes after I first saw it, the triangle shape had moved toward the southeast and was nearly straight up in the sky. My wife also saw it and after another 30 seconds or so we lost sight of the triangle, as if it faded or the lights went out. There was no sound and the shape moved fairly slow. Facing north the cities of Milwaukee, then Kenosha, then Pleasant Prairie were under the objects path.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting was caused by the three satellites frequently seen flying in formation.  They are thought to be U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; satellites.  Please see other reports from Wisconsin for this date.

I went out and noticed a saucer shaped light, engulfed in gold light,hovering near mountains and over the city of Sedona. I tried to sound calm when I asked my wife to come out to look at this object. When she did, I asked her if &quot;this thing had been here the last few nights.&quot; She said &quot;no.&quot; It was then that I noticed red and blue lights beaming from underneath the object. At that point, I ran to get a camera. When I ran back, my wife told me that the object &quot;just blinked out of sight like someone turned off a light switch.&quot; The next day went on as usual, but the morning AFTER that, my wife and I woke up to five large military helicopters flying over our hotel room and heading right to the spot in which we saw the UFO a day and a half earlier.", "Fast moving ball of light with darker core, changed direction.I first sighted object approx 60 deg above SW horizon. Moving from south due north.I held out my forefinger and little fingers with thumb holding down middle two. AT arms length, the object traveled that distance in about 3-4 seconds which I measure to be 5.5 inches. I ran up into the house and grabbed the binoculars and out the back door, taking about 5 seconds..I relocated the object and had found that it had changed course a few degrees. Now a few degrees west. It was lined up with the end star of the rim of the Big dipper, I then  lost sight of it. The speed with which the object moved was something Im still have trouble with. I know it wasnt a falling star,commet or other naturally occuring Phenom. They dont usually make attitude corrections, nor move that fast. There were no lights of aircraft and no sound. I hope that others saw it,because my coworkers really think Ive lost it NOW.", "Three lights in triangular formationWe saw three lighted objects traveling SSE in a triangular formation that appeared low over the Sierra crest. They remained at about the same overall altitude slightly changing in their formation. The object to the left had a blinking red light on its left side that would stay on for a second and off for a couple of seconds. We looked at the objects through good binoculars and could not see a defined shape, just light. There was no sound.", "Small Strobes that Flare to many times their size &amp; brightnessWe saw 8 - 10 strobes in the distance &amp; assumed they were airplanes.  But we watched because so many were in a relatively small area of the sky.  As we watched, one of them flared up from a very small strobe to about the width of a full moon near the horizon and about 1/4 as thick as wide.  The Flare color was very bright yellow - orange and lasted about 5 - 10 seconds and seemd to be composed of 1 to 3 lights (we saw 5 sets altogether).  I got a pair of 50X binoculars to get a better look &amp; noticed the &quot;Airplanes&quot; were not traveling in straight lines, some reversed direction &amp; followed others, some moved toward each other &amp; then turned together in a different direction. They seemed to be simply milling about.  We saw 5 flares, the first appeared to be 3 or 4 Lights the last 3 were single or double lights. they were about 2 minutes apart. When one of them flared the strobe or &quot;Airplane&quot; vanished.  After the last one flared the &quot;Airplanes&quot; dispersed gradually. Since this was 22:45 and I was looking toward the east, these could not be reflections from the sun.This Morning 08/19/02 at 06:25 My wife &amp; I saw 3 very bright lights with a strobe above the center one traveling very rapidly across the sky. I could see no red or green lights and the body was not visible even though the object appeared quite close. I was an air traffic controler in the Air Force &amp; would estimate these lights at about 2 miles away.  The first ones in this report were 10 or more miles away from the looks of the strobe &amp; assuming they were airplanes.", "UFO  {SAUCER SHAPE} IN THE CLOUDSHi I saw a ufo in the clouds or fog. It was hoovering over the highschool football field. The only reason I could even see it was because of the lights of the football field.

I firmly belive i would not have been able to even see it if not for the stadium lights being on and where i happen to be standing. If the stadium light had not been on and i happen to look over there i might have seen the faint lights in the cloud but would have thought nothing of it. just stars. it was truly awesome it was huge way bigger than the football field and high school. I dont know how high up it was it seemed right ontop of the game. I should have called the cops and let them know about it i guess.

I watched it a little longer before my father mentioned that he had been viewing it for about fifteen minutes, and it hadn&apos;t moved.  I pulled off at a rest area and we both got out.  We sat and watched it, throwing out ideas of what it might be.  My father suggested a helicopter, but it sat so still for so long that I wasn&apos;t convinced.  He then suggested a weather balloon, but I quickly threw that theory out because I knew that weather balloons were metallic and were moved by the wind.  As the sun set his last theory was that it was a blimp.  But by that time it was dark and at least an hour went by and it still had not moved, there were also no lights surrounding the object.

The middle light was bouncing between the other two lights, moving like a pendulum. Soon after that the formation changed into a triangle that was continuously changing shape and dimension. Just as they were reaching Kassiopeia they aligned again and performed a very tight and fast 180 degrees turn without any reduction in speed. Right after the turn, the formation started changing again. For a moment the lights gathered close forming a bright single light but almost immediately it broke again in to the three lights, until it dissapeared in the light cloud generated by the nearby city of Volos (east).The Sky was clear with no clouds.The lights were as bright as a not-so-bright star, but there were fairly easy to spot, mainly because of their highspeed.", "triangle with white lightsMe and my girlfriend were on our way to the Deleware beach when we saw a triangle with white lights on it. i saw it through trees so i assumed that it was a plane or even a kin dof light post but somethign wasnt right about it. later on i found out my step brother saw the same thing. and there is also a report of a similiar sighting apx 2 years ago", "Regular flashing light moving through the sky over the UK like a normal satellite, but clearly flashing on and off 30 times.We were outside to watch the meteor shower on 12th August.

This was not a normal flicker, but a repeated regular pattern, with the light source clearly switching on and off. The light itself was white as with all satellites. The flashing repeated probably 30 times (about half a second on and half a second off) as the object moved across the entire sky, without fading in strength as satellites normally do.

After about 12 miles, I saw up ahead what looked like a small plane making &quot;touch and go&apos; landings.  There were three lights and the craft made what seemed like approaches and barely touched the ground and then arose again into the sky.  It took a bit to realize that there is NOTHING out in the desert there; no habitation and certainly no airport.  As I drew closer, the lights would change from a V formation into one single light, then into another formation or another alignment.  I saw that it would go over the road to the right (north) and then go very low to the ground, swing up and over the road again and hover on the south side then return in the same pattern.  I crossed the road after a sweep and looked out of my window and up about 500&apos; to see the three lights havering at about l0:00 south.  The lights were very white and bright, narrow in focus and appeared to be in a southerly direction and there was no sound at all coming from it.  As I just passed it, the light nearest me started a slow turn in my direction and I kept on going, not frightened or threatened but nervous and with the purposeful message that &quot;they&quot; were working and I should keep on going.  I could not tell if it was one craft that morfed into shapes or if it was a configuration of three different lights.  My instinct says that there were three lights but I have no proof.  i continued on the road but stopped up ahead and the craft(s) continued to go in the same pattern and did so as I then drove off and watched in my rear view mirror.

I thought is was a high altitude aircraft.  I used a 10x70 pair of binoculars to view the object and did not see the usual red and green tail lights.  I then noticed the brightness begin to fade quickly after it travel about 20 degrees in the direction of the North star.  It then disappeared from view. I continued to follow what I perceived to be it&apos;s trajectory, but it did not reappear.  At 10:37 P.M. as I again returned to look toward th Big Dipper again, I observed a similar bright star-like object from the same &quot;bowl&quot; area.

We were traveling on the Atlantic City Expressway headed towards Atlantic City.  We started out about 10pm at the Walt Whitman Bridge, and around 10:25pm or so, we had just passed the Williamstown exit.  The road conditions were excellent, dry. The sky was illuminated with a full moon and a slight haze of clouds behind us in the west, but clear skies north/south and east.  There was no fog, fires or anything else in the sky to obstruct our view.  As we are chatting I notice straight ahead about 2 miles and about 15 degrees off to the right of the highway, a very large object which looked more like a stick since the distance made it impossible to distinguish anything from it in the sky, appears to be 2 football fields wide, no more than 3/4 to a mile up with only three lights apparent, and not bright lights either, a dull yellow/gray.  One on each end and one in the center.  As we were looking at this for about a minute, it starts to bank hard to its&apos; left which is south- the banking of the lights was greater than 90 degrees and it was heading lower as well.  We lost it very quickly in the treeline which lines most of the highway so I reduced my speed from about 65mph to about 40 and headed to the right lane.  As we are waiting for the tree line to break a bit so we can look further south, a full minute goes by and then the trees start to break up.  Within a few seconds, the tree line breaks up for a solid mile and as we look to the south, we see more objects.  This time there are at least two, possible three objects with slightly brighter lights of the yellow gray color, but again only 3 lights per object but we can only clearly see 8 lights.  They are hovering about a mile from the highway in a field, one had a downlight beam of gray/white, the other one or two didn&apos;t.  We still at this point could not make out any shapes, but they were definitely closer, definitely lower to the ground, maybe only 500 feet from the earth.  They seemed to be abou! t half t he size each of the large first object we saw.  There was no noise from the area.  There was no sign of the large object we had seen.  I am slowing the car at this point and am half in the shoulder, only traveling about 20mph now, getting ready to stop the car.  The treeline starts cutting in and out again at this point.  We are still trying to gain more of a glimpse of these objects when we both notice something flying towards us, it was the lights we noticed again first, this time a dark grayish color, about 500-1000 feet up and about 1/4 mile away.  Within a second it is flying over the treeline and looking up as it is about to go over the car and highway we can clearly see what it is.  They are two triangular shaped crafts, with a light on each point.  They are dark gray in color, but clearly visible in a full moon medium blue sky.  They are perfect equilateral triangles and there are two.  They are both flying point first, appear to be only about 1000 feet above us, no noise, the dull lights on, flying neck and neck and appear to be about the size of a Lear jet.  We watch as they cross over the car, and the highway.  They were flying due north towards us, but as they approaced the car seemed to have shifted course every so slightly as if they were flying to Seaside Heights area versus Central New Jersey. They are not flying all that quickly at this point, no faster than a jet in landing mode.  But as they get about 1000 feet away from the highway, they just zip away, leaving no trails, but the three lights virtually disappear in an instant.  This is the biggest thrill of my life.  I am going to head back that way tomorrow since it is only about 45 minutes from my house with a camera to see what happens.  I will keep you posted either way. I did contact two local news stations, neither seemed too interested.  I had to wait to come back home to post this since no puter at the shorehouse.

She and her husband drove back to my house to let us know about it, and my whole family watched it.  My oldest son was on the phone with a friend, who lives about a mile away, and he went outside with the phone and also seen it in the sky.  It was very bright red, almost like a lazer pointer color and brightness.  It would sit stationary for a while, then move slow either east, or north at times.  We watched it for about a half hour, and later that night, I watched the news, and it had been reported on Fox 10 news, they even showed video of it.  The news reported they contacted Williams Gateway Airport, and they said it was a cessna airplane, but no plane could sit stationary like it did. I called the news and told them we witnessed it, and there was no way it was a plane.", "Round green ball-shaped objectIn early autumn 1997, (perhaps in October early.  I don&apos;t recall the date) my friend was driving &amp; we  were going along on a highway parallel &amp; east of I 93 going north.  (I am not from NH and do not recall the highway).  If my memory serves me well,  we were close to Franklin NH. It was late in the evening perhaps around 2300 or so all i remember is it was very dark outside.  We both were talking and looked ahead when a large green or turquoise ball dropped diagonally in the sky, almost as if someone had dropped a softball from high in the sky.  My friend quickly sped up as if to go after it, when we realized that if that ball had hit the earth, or if it was a meteror it would have exploded.  I very ofton think of that night in autumn 1997 wondering what it was we saw.Also, I&apos;ve been wanting to tell someone who might care about what young  old daughter &amp; I saw in approximately 1975 or 1977. (I dont remember the month.)  Again I cant remember the exact year (she was born in 1969 &amp; was either in 1st or 2nd grade at the time. She started 3rd grade in Minneapolis, I think.  I&apos;d need to ask my daughter for sure what grade she might have been in.  Just the other day I asked her if she remembers seeing the object and she does.  We were in St Paul Minnesota and  after crossing the Smith Avenue bridge going towards West St. Paul, we turned right onto a street ( just a block or 2 on other side of bridge close to Cherokee Park).  I drove maybe a half block (it was nighttime- we were going to a friends house on Stevens Avenue), when we saw an object hovering above the tree tops.  I looked out my drivers side window up to my right at the object, which I thought at first might be a helocopter,but it made NO noise.  It had lights on it, and if I remember correctly the lights were different colors:  I believe red and blue stand out most in my memory.I was really amazed at what I saw, it was just over the trees but I only saw part of its side, which i believe was round because what we saw was curved Most of the object was over the the trees where I could not see it. I was amazed &amp; in awe.  I watched it for perhaps 5 minutes.  I cant remember if it was rotating.  I remember the lights and how close the object was to the top of the trees.  The area is a residential area just above the Mississippi River. After watching it for about 5 minutes,  I turned around &amp; headed to our apartment on Stryker &amp; King St, where I called the St Paul Airport (military airport)  I think it was called.  I thought it might be a military object.  They said none were there over by Cherokee park. I also think of that night often over the years wondering what it was I saw.Please, tell me any if one else have seen the two objects I have seen and tried to describe to the best of my ability.  I would really appreciate it.  Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was between 8 - 10pm on a clear, cloudless night. My friends and I were on the hill in the centre of our property in a car, from which we did not alight.One friend first noticed the craft, which was the very similar in shape to a &apos;diamond&apos; shaped craft. I liken it to a &quot;brilliant cut diamond&quot; which had the point removed from the base. The top section of the &apos;diamond&apos;, which was divided by lights, was about 1 third of the size of the bottom section. The was no noise emitting from the craft. I do not recall the colours, but I recall that the lights around the girth of the craft were a different colour to the rest of it.We watched it hovering for about 2 minutes and all of a sudden it excellerated towards us at a great speed and stopped suddenly. I could not tell the distance it travelled but it appeared to &apos;grow&apos; from about the size of a full moon to something 5 times the size, in a true &apos;blink&apos; of the eye. It had travelled directly towards us. We were more amazed than scared. It hovered above us, still slightly to the north and then released from the bottom section (not at the exact base) 3 smaller craft which I liken to Fire Flys due to the way in which they darted in all directions, at great speed. They were the shape of glowing balls. Two were the same colour and one was different, yet I can only recall that one of the colours of the craft were red. I don&apos;t recall if the red were the majority of the craft or not. These craft flitted all over the night sky while the &apos;mother craft&apos; remained hovering near us. This scene continued for such a length of time that one of my friends got bored watching.We then lost sight of the smaller craft and next thing, the mother craft took off in the exact opposite direction it had come at us, at great speed again. It moved a greater distance away than we had seen it the first time, and at such speed that it went from this HUGE thing in the sky to only a point of light, the size of a star. If you had not seen it leave, you could not have distinguished it from the other stars in the sky.My thoughts returned to the 3 craft which had been left behind and were now nowhere to be seen. A few/one (unable to recall exactly) minute later a commercial plane flew across the night sky, with it&apos;s stationary lights flashing in the sky. The Fire Fly craft came back into view, as if following at a distance, yet taunting or showing off to the plane&apos;s lack of ability. They remained a good distance behind the plane, darting around as if to show off their abilities to us (we were very visible as we watched them on the top of the hill). The plane&apos;s appearance is what we used to discuss how big the Fire Fly craft were in comparison to the plane and their ability to turn at great speed in any required direction. It also confirmed that they were not the tail lights of a commercial plane. The mother craft still remained stationary in the outer atmosphere whilst this occurred, still appearing as a star.About five minutes after the plane had flown from view the mother craft returned, again at such speed that it just appeared to &apos;grow&apos; again in size. It did not return as close as the last time nor as far as the first time sighted. It collected the Fire Fly craft very quickly and then took off, at great speed, in the opposite direction again. This time it did not halt in the outer atmosphere but continued on at enormous speed so that the &apos;star&apos; that it turned into appeared to go out like a light bulb that had just blown. It was a like a tiny little flash or blink and then the &apos;star&apos; (craft) was gone.When I arrived at our farmhouse I excitedly told my mother about what we had seen and she commented that the television screen had gone &apos;snowy&apos; for almost half an hour.I have not witnessed another UFO sighting since.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We did, when we got to the bottom, we stood up and just as we were turning around. I noticed a really, really fast light streak towards us from over the trees. You see, I lived in a part of a city that is just on the border of county area. So, behind this hill was a vast forest. Anyway, just as fast as I saw the light, it was over all of us. I cast a extreemly powerfull WHITE light on all of us. I remeber looking around as this was happening and noticing that the light had boundries. It seemed circular and to be just around all us kids. I then remeber everything get REALLY REALLY quiet and then I remeber looking at my friend who was with me. He fell to the ground, perhaps in shock, I don&apos;t know. Then, I started to look up, it felt like slow motion cause I was really nervous. Just I started to look up, he streaked away, very fast. Immediatly, all the kids started screaming and crying and everyone ran down the street to their homes. We were terrified. We told our parrents and they called the police, but nothing ever came about it. Its a pretty tramatic story for a number of those that were there, and some won;t talk about what that saw.

Having grown up in that home from the age of four, I was familiar with all the sounds that would occur in and around the house. On several occasions I thought that I had heard noises, and I would grab an AR-7 22-caliber rifle that my uncle had given me and would pose with it in plain view in the front picture window to scare away anybody who may have been creating a noise by nosing around outside. Not the wisest thing to do, in retrospect, but I was a virtual child and thought that a show of arms might protect me when my family was away or asleep.On this particular occasion, my mother was asleep in her bedroom while I was awake watching television. I heard two distinct bumps on the wall of the house just outside the familyroom. I was so sure that I heard the noises that I not only grabbed my rifle, but cocked it to load a round in the chamber, which primed it for a seven-shot semi-automatic operation. I walked out the garage door and around to the side of the house, thinking that either there was somebody out there or that an animal of some sort was causing the noise. I looked around the corner of the house, and didn&apos;t see anything. Then I looked up...What I saw doesn&apos;t fit into any description of a UFO. The only way I can describe it is that it was a single swirling cloud much larger than my home, rising up into a funnel, which terminated in a brightly lit, white cloud. Inside the funnel there were both whisps of smoke and lightening, which went straight down the sides of the funnel, defying the flow of the clouds.I was so entranced by what I saw, that I hadn&apos;t noticed until minutes later that I had dropped my rifle. I grabbed it and ran inside my home to wake up my mother, who came outside in time to see the last remnants of the swirling cloud.I stayed awake for the remainder of the night, watching the news for any report of a strange weather phenomenon that may have explained what I saw, but no mention of it was ever given by any of the local stations.It&apos;s been over twenty years, and the wonder of that object has never left me.

First off I want to emphasize that the date of the encounter is of to my best recolection, i do not want anyone to downplay my sighting due to the fact that it is similar to the one in washington on the same date and time.As in the second sighting The first sighting occured when i was in the hot tub at my appartment complex. I was not facing directly east but more of a north east direction. Then a intense aqua blue ball came out of no where, traveling at speeds that i have never witnessed. I called into the hotline and the person there suggested that it was a meteor.... I find it impossible to belive This was not a meteor for several reasons. The first reason is that it was traveling on the horizon in a straight trajectory, also it was moving rapidly up and down, similar to a hearbeat on a computer screen only FAST!. Secondly it was a color that simply put does not exist, it was like that of a blue jet flame, only pulsating and mesmorizing,deep and rich yet light at the same time. Another reason i find it hard to belive that it was a meteor or for that matter a shooting star is that it was obviously inside the earths atmosphere, i mean it was like right there, I looked at the stars shortly after the encounter and they seemed extremly far away, compared to the object(s) which was clearly inside our atmosphere. Also one very very very important detail, both of these sightings occured in one peice of the night sky, there are two trees that block out some of the sky to the north and west and there is a strip of sky directly east that you can look out into from the hottub.

It then simply faded into nothing as it shot straight up.  It was then gone!  The whole affair took aprox. seven seconds.  As this was happening I tried to tell my friend to look up, but soon after I realized I was studder and stammering from the excitement.  As I was holding a brief case in one hand and a cane in the other, I could not even point.", "Bright craft followed by 6 police aircraft.I was driving on my way home from work around 9:00 pm, and as I passed the park near my house when something in the sky passed my eye. It was very bright, and naturally, my curiousity got the best of me. I sat there for about 20-30 seconds watching this thing. It started stationary, and after about 3 seconds, I visually lined it up with a tree to track it&apos;s movement, in which there was none that I could notice. It then swiftly moved the right, and then stopped again. 6 aircraft, couldn&apos;t tell if they were helicopters of planes due to distance, appeared. The helicopters appeared to have police type flashing lights on them someplace. Every aircraft had these lights except the craft in question. The craft was very bright, and appeard to change shape and color. It went from a light white, to a dark orange, and the back again. It was after sunset, so it wasn&apos;t a reflection on the craft that accounted for the light. I went home to get my digital camera, came back, and the craft was gone, but the helicopters stayed there for about 2 minutes more, and then flew away in formation.", "We saw multicolored lights in the night sky  in Eidson TN in  fall 1982 that were the shape of a football-field-size parallelogram.Having 5 kids and a small 3-room house, to gain a little peace of mind, my mother would allow me and my brother, the two eldest, play outside after dark on warm nights.  In the fall of 1982, in Eidson, Tennessee, while playing hide and go seek outside in the dark, my brother (11) and I (10) saw a large group of round, multicolored lights in the sky that seemed to hover over a nearby moutain top.  My brother ran inside and told my mother who came outside after him while I &quot;kept an eye&quot; on the strange lights.  The three of us stared up at the lights while my stepfather and other siblings looked out the front door.  My mother decided the three of us would try to get a closer look while my stepfather stayed behind with the younger children.We hurried down the gravel road that ran beside our house to the base of the mountain.  We wanted to get a closer look before the lights should disappear.  At the base of the mountain, we saw two of our neighbors, a boy and his father.  They had spotted the strange lights in the sky, too.  They had flashlights and apparently had the same idea as we had of getting a closer look at the strange lights.  We all hurried together through trees and underbrush full of stickers to the top of the mountain.What we saw straight above our heads was a cluster of multicolored lights that weren&apos;t set in any apparent color pattern.  We were quiet and way out in the country, and the only sound we heard was crickets nearby, no unnatural noise such as an engine or anything else manmade.  We all stared upward, wondering what exactly we seeing.  The lights seemed to be of one craft.  The craft must have been quite a distance up because the flashlights fell on nothing when we shined them in the direction of the lights.  There were no stars or moon out that night; the sky and our surroundings were pitch black, so we saw nothing except the strange lights in the sky and whatever our flashlights illuminated.  The lights seemed to roughly form the shape of a parallelogram.  The craft seemed to be gigantic as the lights extended far across the sky directly above us, maybe as long as a football field.  The lights didn&apos;t move or twinkle.  They were red, yellow, blue, orange and white.  The lights didn&apos;t just form a rough outline of the craft, they were all over it.Since it didn&apos;t move or make any sound, and it was getting late, we all decided to go back to our homes.  Naturally none of us had any film in our cameras, and the nearest store was 30 miles away and probably not open that late anyway.  We peeked at it a few times out our windows before settling into bed and finally falling asleep.  In the morning, of course, the lights were gone.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date of September 15, 1982, so that the report posts to that year.  Location of sighting appears to be Eidson, TN, but may be Edison, TN.  We can find neither in our mapbook.

I saw  no lights and no sound. I was tracking an  osprey with my binoculars when all of a sudden I saw in the clear blue sky a craft, partially hidden on the bottom in a mist or cloud layer.  It seemed to be oval  or round in shape and with the sun hitting it I could see what I can only describe as a skin of &quot;airplane windows&quot;, concave and convex, rectangle in shape,  that were all over  it,  all pure white except for the bright gold-orange of the sun hitting it on the West side and a light to darkish blue on the sides  of the &quot;windows&quot; that were in the shadow.  The entire thing had a dull sheen, like plastic.   I could not tell if it was incredibly large or small, but I assume since I could not see it with the naked eye it was small.  It did not appear to  be moving because I did not have to track it with my binoculars. I said &quot;what it that?&quot;  My young son was there and I took the binoculars away and looked at the sky but saw nothing, nor did my son.  I looked back into the binoculars and saw the craft again and it slowly disappeared behind the mist or cloud. I was about to hand the binoculars to my son when that happened.  All together I observed this for a total of one minute. To give an idea to its size looking through binoculars it would be the same size as a full moon looking through binoculars. I called the police to see if any one else had reported it.  They said no. This was a completely cloudless day overhead except for some low lying clouds over the New Jersey side of the ocean.

The BLT Research website is &lt;www.bltresearch.com&gt;.  PD))A triple-ellipse &quot;thought-bubble&quot; crop formation found in  rural Gardiner, ME, investigated by BLT Research Team Inc.At about 2 am August 4th Witness #1, who had gotten up to get some water, observed a bright white flash of light followed by a small (perhaps flash-light sized) BOL down low over a hayfield across the street from her house.  The BOL bobbed around over the crop for several minutes, then seemed to come closer to her location, then &quot;went straight up in a beam of light&quot; and disappeared.  At approx. the same time a neighbor (Witness #2) whose house is approx. 75 yards away from the hayfield, got up because her dog was barking loudly and repeatedly; she observed that the dog was facing the hayfield as he continued to bark for about 5 minutes. Witnes #3 (the wife of the hayfield&apos;s owner), who lives several hundred yards distant, woke up sometime after 12 midnight and heard a strange &quot;metallic-type&quot; noise which lasted only a few moments:  &quot;I have never heard that kind of noise before.&quot; At about noon on August 4th the hayfield owner&apos;s 16-year-old son went to visit his grandmother whose house is immediately adjacent to the hayfield and discovered the new crop circles.  The boy notified his mother and step-father, who called the local police; the officer who examined the field told the family that he did not think the circles were &quot;man-made&quot; and suggested they notify UFORC  ((National UFO Reporting Center--PD)), which they subsequently did. UFORC then notified the BLT Research Team Inc. of the event.On August 5, 2002, a BLT field-team arrived at the relatively rural location; both team members have investigated crop circles in the U.S. and in Europe, and one has extensive experience in many countries over 10 years.  A thorough examination of the circles and extensive interviews were carried out.The hayfield is on a dead-end street with perhaps 8 houses along it.  The field is about 2 acres in size and goes up-hill into a large, partially open area; the house of Witness #1 is immediately across the street from the field.  Witness #2&apos;s house is about the same distance away, but behind a row of trees which border the field on that side.  Three contiguous, flattened, ellipses were discovered in the lower (2-acre section) of the field, with their edges just touching, creating what crop circle researchers call a &quot;thought-bubble&quot; design. Largest ellipse was 65&apos; at its widest point; middle circle was 35&apos; at its widest point; smallest circle was 25&apos; at its widest point.  The centers of all three ellipses were considerably off-center.  There was a slight curve to the overall design, perhaps 20 degrees.The plants (grasses and fescue with goldenrod, Queen Anne&apos;s Lace, clover and milkweed) were fairly gently laid over, with the thicker-stalked plants such as milkweed clearly showing bending at the base.  No broken stalks were found.  All plants were swirled clockwise and it could not be determined whether the swirls had begun in the centers or ended there.  The initial impression of the crop lay was of fluidity, with a clear undulating character to the flow of downed plants.The majority of the flattened plants were grasses (not the cereal crops most typically involved) and the stem nodes of these plants are so small that no real evaluation in the field can be made of stem-node change (such as elongated apical nodes and/or expulsion cavities in the lower plant stem nodes).  The only visible significant change in any of the flattened plants was the bending at the base of most of the larger-stalk plants, such as milkweed.  No plant or soil samples were taken in this case, largely because of the plant species involved.No compass deviations were noted inside the 3 ellipses and no cell-phone failures or camera malfunctions occurred.  A stop-watch check (where one stop-watch is left outside the formation and the other taken in with the field-team) revealed no time differences.Photographs taken with flash cameras the evening of the 5th in the now 2-day-old event produced multiple &quot;anomalous&quot; light phenomena (recorded on several different cameras) typical of those seen in flash photos taken at other crop circles around the world.The field-team&apos;s evaluation here leans toward this event being &quot;genuine&quot; (not mechanically produced) because of the following factors:  (1) Node-bending at the base of the thicker-stalked plants and no breakage at the base of any plants generally (especially the hay, which was dry and ready for harvest); (2) the fluidity of the overall crop lay, with at least two layers noted in several places; (3) the fact that all three downed areas were markedly elliptical, rather than circular; (4) the fact that all ellipse centers were markedly off-center; (5) the presence of a double-center in one ellipse; (6) the animal disturbance; (7) the eye-witness reports of unexplained light and noise phenomena at the same time during the night the formation occurred; (8) the remoteness of the location and our character-assessment of the people in the near vicinity.  However, without actual in-depth sampling of the plants and soils and subsequent laboratory evaluation, no firm assessment can be offered.", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31625-2002Jul19.html((NUFORC Note:  Article about the radar/visual sightings of anonmalous objects over Washington, D.C., and Maryland in July 1952.

It was an oval shape that was very illuminated. It didn&apos;t have a distinct amount of lights...the whole thing was glowing. We stood there looking at it for a few minutes before reality struck us. Fear spread through our bodies and we ran into the garage to watch from behind a window. We were both in 7th grade so you can understand our fear.

It seems presumptuous to pose the question.What I saw was most likely a meteorite or space junk, but it was the largest and brightest I&apos;ve ever seen.  Unfortunately I did not have a clear view of it. The sky was covered with thin clouds and the moon was visible through holes in the clouds to the southeast.  The object crossed the sky quickly (like a shooting star) over the course of about 5 seconds, moving from South to Southwest at about 40-45 degrees above the horizon. Because of the clouds I could not directly see the object, but through the clouds a bright trail was briefly visible, the width of which was the size of a silver dollar held at arms length.  Its likely the clouds diffused the light somewhat, but that the trail was visible at all with the cloud cover is notable.  It seemed as if the object was either very large or passing close to the ground.We were at a bonfire party and a friend and I both saw it.  Other&apos;s were present, but not looking in the correct direction at the time. Coincidentally, several people present at the part (including myself and my wife) got violently ill the next day.

I&apos;m kind of dissapointed that over the last 2 months I&apos;ve witnessed several bizzare objects in the sky with a witness, but didn&apos;t report them to you and I should have.  I&apos;m a very observant of the skies due to the fact that I&apos;ve seen many of these ojects in my life.Today, on my last coffee break of the day 3:15 P.M., I wondered down 7th Street in New Westminster, B.C., Canada.   This is how my sighting transpired.I noticed in the sky what appeared to be some floating garbage or black balloons of some type which seemed to be liked together like a cluster of balloons with a definate arrow shape to the mass.  This seemed a little odd and puzzling this shape.  The distance of this floating garbage or ballons when I first spotted it was probably 20 stories high compared to the height of a high rise building.   Whatever this was flying up in the air, I just thought, it&apos;s got to be garbage and didn&apos;t think anything much of it, but I did continue to watch this (garbage) float upwards with what I assume was air currents moving it upwards.  As my head was looking up towards the sky in an easterly direction at this floating garbage, I caught sight of a disc shaped grey object moving rapidly skimming the clouds and moving fast and steady from an easterly direction towards a south western direction.  It moved smoothly across the sky from the East and curved on an angle towards a South Westerly direction.  I watched it move across the sky till infinity (I couldn&apos;t see it anymore).  I had a fix on this object for at least 30 seconds crossing the sky.  It wasn&apos;t a bird or small plane.

At the moment that I spotted this second object, there was an airliner in the sky heading towards Vancouver airport.  This object was much higher than the plane, and this 2nd object also was skimming the clouds as well.That&apos;s all I have right now, plain and simple, but I wanted to get this one to you for sure this time.", "Traiangle of lights in the early Ausralian MorningAt the above mentioned time I happened to be in the backyard ((deleted)) having a smoke and looking to the sky as I always do at night as I am mad keen on the stars and aviation.Now where I was living at the time is a small country town of maybe 3-4000 people and I lived right on the outskirts of town where there was very little light polution.When I noticed very high above me travelling from SW to NE a triangular shape of light 7 in total at first I thought it may have have been an airliner ,But tracking that way would not correct ,then I thought maybe a formation of Military jets ,as the lights moved at a very fast pace.I watched and waited for the flashing of the anti collision lights which can be visable up to 15 klms and no flashing I then watched as the lights eventually faded from sight and waited to hear jet noise but nothing .It was still night and earlier on that evening I had tracked by sight and sound .I never thought anymore about it until looking at different sighting that I had seen on this web sight .I wonder if any other Australians have seen to?((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

It seemed every inch was perfectly lit, as if the object itself was glowing.  The color was a pale greenish.  there seemed to be a ring around the disk that was a darker color, perhaps black, though it still was completely visible against the night sky.  The moon was not out, as it was hidden behind the clouds.  The only light source I can imagine was from the UFO itself.  It hovered stationary, it seemed, though we were in a car.  When we pulled into our driveway, the tree line in our neighborhood blocked our view, so we lost sight.  If the UFO was moving, it was doing so very slowly and in a kind of sliding manner.  I am going to go and look for it again.  Hopefully i will have more to add, along with photos, in a short while.  Oh, one more thing.  As soon as we got out of the car, we heard jets roaring.

This star as I call it was, I guess staying basically in one area.  To far up in the sky, to really identify.  Called my husband outside and he confirmed what I was seeing.  I then called my girl friend and her husband up on the phone as they live up on a hill in Bremerton.  Told her what to look for and about where they might see it.  She also confirmed what I was watching.  Now they live close to the Bremerton Naval Station.  To her surprize and ours, three helicopters&apos; took off from the base as we spoke.

The clouds were towards the north east.   We were talking like we usually do when I noticed something in the sky.  I said to my buddy &quot;look up there&quot; and pointed.  I said to him &quot;what the hell is that&quot;.  not in an alarming sense but just curiousity.  I happened to swear a lot at the time.  we botth watched it for about maybe 8 minutes.  then it moved a lot closer and fast. Based on watching  helicopters from the local national guard unit  and also watching airplanes flying to and from the local airport, I had and idea of the relative altitudes those vehicles flew at. and also how long it took to get from one point in the sky to another at their respectful altitudes.   Well  this thing  was flying higher than a helicopter.  but not as high as an airplane.  It was maybe flying at 2 times the height of a typical helicopter flight.

Being that it was so visibly define,  I noticed that it appeared to be rotating. not the very top of it just the middle hull.  I think it  was rotating counter clockwise.  Anyways we watched it for about 2 more minutes.  Then i heard the door at the entrance of the mall. We were standing outside one of the interior corridor doors.  Well i looked over to see who was coming out ( just out of natural human curiousity). After i glanced over I immediately returned my focus to where the o! bject ha d been in the sky.

Our back yard ends about 50-60 feet at the edge of a mostly pine forest.  A light through a small gap in the trees caught my eye.  I got my 16X binoculars and went on the back porch to sit on a couch and brace my hands against a small ledge that runs under the windows to get a steady view.  When I focused on the light, I suddenly gasped at what I saw.  I saw a bright white light with four smaller, dimmer white lights around it that would form a perfect plus sign if an imaginary line were drawn between them through the larger light.  I believe I could barely make out an outline of an isosceles triangle, with the base about 60-70% of the length of the sides.  The corners were rounded.  This light configuration was toward the base of the triangle, centered along the centerline.  There was also another bright light, a little dimmer and smaller, along the centerline toward the point of the triangle.  I also believe I could barely make out a dim red glow in the center of the triangle.  I looked at the moon and it was out of focus.  I adjusted the focus one way and the moon came in.  I refocused on the object, and had to focus the other direction to bring the trees into focus.  This told me it was not a star I was seeing, but something between the trees and moon.  I went out the front door and across the street to see if I could see it above the trees, but I saw nothing.  After a few minutes I went back to the porch and all I could see was a star that was not as bright and in a slightly different location.  About a half mile through the woods in that direction is David L. Rainer Elementary School.  I would estimate the object was about 1000-1500 feet over the school.

They thought we were crazy until they saw it light up too. Then out of nowhere a second light appears to the left of the first one.

I couldn&apos;t help but notice viewing this same object to the south as it was getting closer and seemed to be travelling approximately in the same direction as I.It looked at first like a horizontal line of lights; as a large well lit jumbo jet; I said to myself, &quot;gee,  wouldn&apos;t it be great if that were a UFO&quot;. As I continued on the Cross County Parkway west, I could see it was gaining on me, and our path&apos;s were intersecting.When decending down the hill to where the Cross County joins the Saw Mill Parkway, I was startled as I looked up to see, getting closer and closer from my car window, an object about 1000 feet up that was a flat, black rectangle with six groups of lights configured  in a triangular pattern.The six groups of multi-colored lights were symmetrically placed in rows that were evenly spaced along this football field sized rectanglar object. 2 groups in the front, 2 in the middle, and 2 in the rear; spread out and disernable as groups. Each group of lights was of a slightly different tint or color, mostly whiteish with some being pinkish or reddish.It was generally an overcast night with some low level visibility which explains why I could have seen it so far away at first. I distinctly remember that it was also a moonless night.The large rectangular shape was clearly defined against the muddy low cloud cover as illuminated by the omnipresent static greenish-pink urban glow.This thing was not a group of planes or a blimp. It was a solid rectanular platform, and I descibed it to others as being easily as big as a football field. It also struck me odd that it was completely silent. I estimated that it was travelling at about 60 MPH as I slowed my car to almost a stop  with my head sticking out the window looking up in amazment. There were other cars slowing down and pulling to the shoulder to watch it also.As my route north up the Saw Mill Parkway was heading directly in it&apos;s trail, I watched as it travelled northwest diagonally over Yonkers with it&apos;s distinct 6 red rear lights stretching it&apos;s stern width. I don&apos;t think it was moving much faster than a car, as I visually followed it&apos;s path over the low land valley of Yonkers over the ridge while towards the Hudson River.

We boarded the ferry and went upstairs to a window right away to continue watching the object.  At the speed it was moving, it should have still been there, however, it wasn&apos;t.

I asked  her if they mighet be birds and she said they looked very high and were just little black dots to her. well I do not know  what they were but thought  you might be able to find out from the airport if they had any strange flights high bove the air port  that day. I thought they might be large bird and not thet high but the formation they flew didnt sit  right with me.I am a military brat and spent a tour in the Navy sort of remember how planes fly and grew up duck hunting in Louisiana done quite a bit of watching birds fly also. cant say it wasnt birds but would like to  hear if the air port  says they had anything on their radar", "large red lights hovered above dark field, then in the sky looked like star w/red-twinkling lights, saw space-ship  thru binocularsSaturday 9/7/02 at 8:30pm..

I was struck by a dim moving shape coming from my left (that is from north). Though this is a quite inhabited area, the sky was very bright and the stars quite visible. It was a chevron formed by several dim lights (10 more or less), just like stars, but with a litlle less brilliance, moving together towards south (in between the lights it was plain black). It just moved slowly, and calculating through the angular disposition of the chevron, it was high in the sky, more or less at the same altitude as cruising airline airplanes . Nevertheless it had none of the usual characteristics of an airplane (no red or white flickering lights, which I usually see either in low altitude during landing procedures in the nearby airport, or at high altitude since in Lisbon it appears to exist an important radio reference). I noticed, however, that one of the snmall lights got out of the formation and disapeared. That is to say that I&apos;ve never seen nothing like it. Of course, it hadn&acute;t any specularity. It continued to move slowly towards south (I thought to wake up my wife, but I knew that the shape would soon run out of view).

I was on the roof of my mother&apos;s apartment building, located in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. That&apos;s right, Brooklyn, New York just a few miles outside of the Big Apple itself.If memory serves, I believe I was locked out of our top floor apartment, having misplaced my keys. So I had to wait for my mother to return from having dinner with my father from Chinatown on the roof of my mother&apos;s tenement building. I recall it being a very nice night, kind of on the cool side, with low clouds at approximately 5,000 to 7,000 feet of altitude.Aside from the low, scattered clouds, the night sky was clear as a bell, and much of the stars were highly visible that night. What particularly had my utmost attention that night, was the elevated degree of meteorological activity that was taking place.Okay, so here I go. I witnessed an unusually low-flying &quot;shooting star&quot; decend toward the east, when to my amazement I noticed, just a second (or two) later, a oval-shaped object emitting a soft-white glow behind it as if it were in pursuit. In the next few minutes (perhaps for as much as the next 15-30 minutes or so) there were quite a number more of low-flying meteorites. One was of sufficient size, or perhaps it streaked low enough that I could actually hear it wisking through the atmosphere. The sound was brief, lasting approximately a second or so. From different directions in the night sky, I observed the same unidentified oval-shaped object fly in pursuit of several falling meteorites.By the time much of this increased meteorolgical activity was over, my mother had returned. I called her and told her to come up to the roof quickly. I then told her what I had been seeing, upon which she stayed with me for a while to gain the chance of possibly witnessing what I had seen for herself. Within a few minutes, another meteorite streaked in the distance to the east, after which both my mother and I witnessed the U.F.O. in pursuit.Before the U.F.O. &quot;disappeared&quot; and ended its low altitude airshow, it flew towards both my mom and I on our left as we faced east. (Something makes me recall there being two this time, but I can not recall for sure.) It flew level and then took a 30 to 45 degree ascent into a cloud bank and disappeared for what I thought was for good.Later on that evening, at approximately 00:30 hours, my brother had come up to the roof after having heard what was going on to catch a glimpse and mostly to poke fun. He was with me, when we both witnessed a distant point-of-light, that caught our eyes. From its distance and apparent height, it could have been a plane at high altitude or a star by appearance. Except, this &quot;star&quot; started moving irregularly across the sky and changed its relative position by a great distance. It is my belief that this object was very high up in the sky or possibly even outside our planet&apos;s atmosphere.My brother dismissed what we both saw as OUR eyes playing tricks on us. On some level, I wish I could have done the same. I am glad for my mother having witnessed the U.F.O. flying at low altitude with me, as I needed someone to affirm that I was actually witnessing these crafts, right here, above the metropolis of New York.I wish I could estimate the size of the craft to some degree of accuracy. In the night sky and at a distance, it is a bit difficult to get an idea as to an object&apos;s relative size without some common frame of reference. What I can say is that the U.F.O. conducted manuvuers that only a fighter jet would be capable of performing. Its movements were swift and precise, but not necessarily beyond the means of a fighter jet. However, the U.F.O. performed all of the above flying activity at what appeared to be supersonic speeds. Not only did I not hear a sonic boom, I did not hear the craft produce an audible sound of any kind. Nor did I notice even a neglible loss of speed when it finally made its ascent into the cloud bank from which it did not reappear.", "If was a flashlight wich was following a car for 45 minuts.

I had spent more time out in the woods than I had planned on, and the sun had already set as I made my way back to my Jeep, when I noticed a bright light in the sky moving in my direction.At first I thought it was just an airplane and thought nothing of it. But then it suddenly stopped moving and began to pulsate, getting brighter and then fainter.  I noticed at this time that there appeared to be a slight haze surrounding the object. The pulsating increased in tempo until the object was flickering at a very rapid rate, when suddenly, a bright beam of light shot down from the bottom of the object to the ground below.  This was no searchlight.  Even a well focused searchlight tends to diffuse with distance, but this light was a tight, bright beam from top to bottom.As suddenly as the pulsating began, it stopped, and the beam also turned off.  The object just sat there motionless in the sky.  My Jeep was only about 100 yards away when all this happened, so I ran to it to get my camera.  I took a picture of the object as it hovered, and as I got ready to take another picture the object it began moving around slowly in a tight circle.  I took another picture, but before I could take a third, it suddenly shot straight up in the air at fantastic speed and was gone from sight!

(AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico.The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara.&quot;The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly,&quot; said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara.The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said.Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show.&quot;We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early,&quot; Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets.&quot;Suddenly we&apos;re getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is,&quot; Gabel said.The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile&apos;s accuracy and reliability.((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS))", "Speedy object preceeding by a low murmur flies overhead at night with flashing lights,I got home, parked my car, turned the radio and car off and got out.  It was then I heard a strange noise, it sounded like a generator or the engine of a diesel truck running but a deeper sound and the interverals were not as fast as you would here the revs of an idle engine.  It was loud but I could tell it was from a distance.  I couldn&apos;t pinpoint where it was, so I went in the middle of the cul-de-sac looking down the street thinking that someone had a generator hooked up to thier house or something like that, then I saw some flashing lights in the sky red, white, and I think blue.  I really couldn&apos;t tell exactly how high the object was, maybe a mile or two high.  I would have thought it was a jet except I heard the murmur before I saw the object and it did not sound anything like the sound jets make breaking the sound barrier although I never seen jets go this fast before or this low.  My guess it was an experimental aircraft.This thing was fast, I&apos;m in the suburbs so there isn&apos;t much light in the sky at night and it was very clear, I could see the star constellation Orion the Hunter without a problem what-so-ever.  I never heard that noise before or seen anything fly  by that fast.Once it came over head I didn&apos;t hear the murmur anymore, it made a higher steady pitch sound for a brief moment and then it was out of hearing range.  It was hard to make out the exact shape, however I did see some lines that came together, kind of like a diamond shape but not solid all the way through.  It was really dark and really can&apos;t make out the shape all too well, but all the lights were alternating strobes that flashed approximately twice within in a second, although I didn&apos;t count them.The object was coming from the Southwest (more West) and heading towards the Northeast (more East) in a straight line.I figured it&apos;s probably some test aircraft the Air Force has been working on or something to that nature.I never saw or heard anything like it.

Something caught my friends eye and for the next few minutes our attention was drawn to an increasing number of brown specks in the sky. There were four in total, emerging one by one on the horizon in front of us. They all moved in a straight path towards the opposite horizon, so we had a significant amount of time to observe them. They had an irregular, angular shape though the specifics are vague because they were so far away. Although they  all seemed predominantly brown, there were areas within each aircraft which were of a different colour. These smaller specks seemed to change appearance as the aircraft moved, as if there was something glowing or &apos;bulging&apos; beneath each one. Their colour would shift through different shades of brown and even to black at times, while the basic angular shell of each craft remained completely unchanged. The craft made no sound. At one point, a regular aeroplane passe! d by so that we were able to compare the massive difference between it and the unusual objects we were seeing. The final object to pass seemed to get smaller before it passed from our view.

Black sky with many stars. Crystal clear view of object, that appeared to move smoothly, not fast, to various positions,couldn&apos;t predict what movement it would go. I was making my security rounds and the lights color is what made me look. I observed first stationary-type object but immediately it begun to move. It was easy to see the movementswhen I focused either side of object. This U.F.O. was over ocean water, appeared good distance from coast, approximately 1/2 mile off shore at probably a 90 degree angle, I had to look directly up, looking out at the ocean, to make a visual. I took my flashlight and clicked it of and on slowly and then rapidly. It seems as though the object would move, after the flashing of the light, I sent out to it. It appeared it was observing what I was doing. I originally observed the object for half an hour, then I reported the sighting to local police. A police officer came to my location and immediately saw the object. we walked to a darkened area of the inn and observed the U.F.O. moving and casting the white/reddish colors. He stated he would contact F.A.A. for any air traffic. The only air traffic was a plane I obseved at 3:15a.m. The police officer said he would go to the station for binoculors and try to observe object at a beach a couple miles down, because he said the object looked as if it was closer to that particular beach, in other words a better view.

At some points in flight it seemed to stop and hover for a moment much like a humming bird.  This could not have been a meteor because the pattern of flight was too controlled.

It was just after 9pm. As I stood there, I looked up into the night sky as I often do, admiring the stars. It was a clear sky, and off to the far north-northeast, something caught my eye. It looked like a distant shooting star, but that soon became unlikely to me, as it was moving horizontally in what seemed then to be from north to south, and it did not burn up and disappear as would be expected. About two to three seconds elapsed, and I found my eyes focusing in on a silent, shadowy, blur approaching my location overhead. It was in the shape of what resembled a boomerang, about the size of a hang glider, or even slightly smaller. I was surprised to realize that it was actually at a very low altitude. I felt myself grasping to identify it, and trying hard to decide that it was simply a flock of travelling birds. I believe that what I was trying to call birds were actually 5 or 7 small, dull white lights, and as the object came nearly directly overhead, I could easily see that these lights were on the V-shaped outer edge of a dark gray colored craft. In fact, the craft appeared to be made of a similar material to a B-1 stealth bomber, although it definitely was not a B-1. It was traveling north-northeast to south-southwest, at perhaps 75 feet above the treetops. The craft was moving too quickly for a flock of birds, and yet considerably slower than what would ordinarily be the stall speed of an aircraft, perhaps 45-50 mph. Again, the object was completely silent as it passed nearly directly overhead, very stable and steady in course, at an altitude which I later realized would have been below normal radar detection. My experience was of an object that was only perhaps 8 feet across at best, and this was most puzzling of all. I would not say it was large enough to carry people. I live in a suburban area, and watched it disappear over the neighbors&apos; treetops soon after passing over my! head. T he lights may have changed color, but I am not certain of this.Curiously, I&apos;ve only had one other UFO sighting in my life, when I was an older child laying in the yard looking up at the stars, maybe fifteen or twenty years ago. That object was almost exactly the same as the one I saw recently, and I finally feel vindicated that the sighting I had then was indeed not a flock of birds.", "Large octagon blue lights on rim red center light hovers over downtown Cincinnati thursday October 10.I am reporting this for my friend, the witness, who has no internet at the moment. he says that thursday night, between 8 and 9 pm he was on his way home from work.

He said it was shaped like a stop sign, (octagonal), had a red light in the center and blue lights on the rim.  He said one of the rims was extended off of the object, which he saw move into place, so the object was then symmetrical. He said it was fairly high up in the sky, and he said it seemed there was a haze around it, making the lights &quot;dim&quot;... or not as bright.  He said it was large, the size of a dinner plate in scale to his extended hand.

Height estimate is based on height of constant overhead airplane traffic over Omaha which I would imagine to be at roughly 37,000 feet. The object remained stationary for over 45 minutes when another appeared next to it. Spherical, I believe, but too far up to discern any details at all. It looked like a star. The 2nd object appeared and moved away from the other over the course of 10 minutes. I later heard the news of the &quot;new moon&quot; or &quot;space junk&quot; which had found orbit around Earth.

The area is dominated by residential housing, schools, religious centers and surrounded by farmlands.At roughly 2:45 am I decided to step outside for a breath of fresh air. The night was clear and windless. As I gazed upon the stars a grouping of them began to move. My first thought was that I was having a dizzy spell so I gave my head a shake and refocused my gaze upon the sky. I soon realized that I wasn&rsquo;t dizzy at all when three points of light, forming a triangle made their way from south to north. The triangle of lights moved at a speed similar to satellites but unlike &quot;satellites&quot; this grouping changed directions 30 seconds into the sighting. The triangle began to move east. The object was either very large or very low and appeared to blot out passing stars. The object was completely silent. The lights on each tip were solid white but of very low intensity. There was a distinct impression that this object was doing its best not to be seen as it moved across the star field. As I realized what I was seeing It occurred to me that I should attempt to make record of the sighting. Very quickly I entered the house and grabbed my digital video camera. I returned to the front of the house and began filming the object as it made its way towards the northeast. I soon lost sight of the object behind a neighbor&rsquo;s home and quickly ran to the backyard to resume filming. I was unable to find the object from that point on. Shortly after the object had disappeared a number of dogs in the neighborhood began howling and barking. This was all captured on video but the triangular formation of lights (or any stars for that matter) could not be resolved on film. I am willing to send you the footage in the hopes that you can somehow enhance what is there.Leduc is southeast of the Edmonton International Airport and I can tell you with the authority of living near the strip for over 10 years that this was NOT A PLANE and if it was it was heading in the wrong direction for a landing. The lights did not blink nor did they form any standard aircraft lighting array that I am aware of. The lights were not bright enough to be considered effective or safe landing lights. The bottom line is that the object in question was far too huge to be compared to anything I&apos;ve seen in our local skies. It was more like the corner lights were used to camouflage the object into the surrounding star field. I consulted the &quot;Heavens Above&quot; satellite tracking system for my area (www.heavens-above.com) to attempt to confirm the satellite theory but there was nothing in the sky at that time that would even remotely account for a tight triangular formation I saw.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting may have been caused by the three NOSS satellites, but we do not know if satellites would be visible above Alberta at that time of the morning.

We had become tired as the loop in the neighboorhood was two and one-half miles, and we had circled it several times. We stopped by the neighboorhood poolhouse to get some soft drinks, and take a seat nearby on a picnic table. We were chit chatting, when I had noticed an object in the sky. I called it to their attention, and all of us were in awe. I honestly do not know how large it was, but I speculate it to be quite large, as it was definately higher than the treetops, making it at least 45 feet long in my estimation, more than likely larger. It was a full moon, so the craft had illumination upon it. It was a gunmetal colour, and had two bright lights on either end, and it was shaped like a fat cigar. More like a slug. It is hard to describe, but it was like a cigar that had been overstuffed. In the center of the craft was one light-emitting porthole. The craft moved incredibly fast, and no signs of propulsion were present. No thrust, no propellers, the craft was dead silent except for a rushing of air sound.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

Before getting in my car I stopped to light a cigarette. While I was smoking, movement in the southeast part of the sky caught my attention. I knew it was not a bird, or any conventional aircraft by the way it was moving. Its movement was very erratic, shooting one way and then another, and without slowing was making very sharp turns. It had to be very distant from my position; I can only describe it as a small sphere of intense white light.I called my friend and my brother outside to look at it. The morning was very clear, no clouds or overcast conditions. They saw the same thing as I did. We watched it for about 2 minutes when it was joined by another object of the same nature. The two objects looked to be chasing each other. After 1 minute of that, they headed off to the north/northeast.

I have a major knowledge of aviation so, I can tell the differences between aircraft made in this world, and I know that wasnt something I&apos;ve ever heard of or seen before. I dont know if it was making any noise due to a Cessna flying circles over head.I called the Hillsboro Airport (our local airfield) and they said that they were not tracking anything in that direction, but they said that it was probabally a military jet from the Portland Airbase. Yeah right, the base only has F-15s as their jets, and they wouldnt be flying a jet that could do what this did around here...  This was a UFO.", "A red laser-like light came out of a cloud...I was walking home from a friend&apos;s house at about 9:30 that night.  While I was turning a corner, a very brief (like just a split second) red laser like light went through a small cloud, turning the cloud an erie red color.  The light stopped for about two seconds, then resumed again, but this time it flashed (kind of like morse code) for about five more seconds.  If any of you people out there know morse code, it would have looked somewhat like this on paper ( -....--...---..----. ).  I was down wind from the light, and a small breeze brought kind of a sulfer like smell with it, but I&apos;m not quite sure if that was due to the light.", "Second sighting...Madison, WIThis is my second submission. My first submission concerned a sighting witnessed by myself and several others. This particular sighting was all mine. I awoke just a minute or two before 3:00AM and went to use the facilities. As I was standing at the sink washing my hands, I noticed a light over Lake Mendota. Assuming it was a rescue helicopter bound for the University of WI Hospitals and Clinics ER, I looked away and finished washing up. When I looked again, I noticed the light had become somewhat brighter, and had not moved from the spot where it had been before. Now, having witnessed something like this before, AND having just seen the movie &quot;Signs&quot; several hours before, I wasn&apos;t willing to accept that this was anything unusual. As I watched the light, it began to change color and pulsate. I actually spoke out loud and said: &quot;Oh, not THIS again!&quot; half in jest, and half in earnest. As I said that, a small, red light poppped out and shot away from the larger light. Zip! And it was gone. At that point, I decided I&apos;d seen enough. I spoke again, out loug, and said: &quot;Look, you guys...either take me with you or go away!&quot;. Then I went back to bed. I have no explanations. I neither believe nor disbelieve in UFOs, aliens, or other odd phenomena.

What caught my attention was that these were the two brightest objects in that portion of the sky. It was a very clear night with no clouds.  The moon was very bright about 45 degrees above the horizon in the Eastern sky.  It did not take me long to realize that the lights which at first appeared as bright stars, one in front of the other, were actually moving on a straight course across the sky towards the Southeast.  At first I thought the two lights might have been connected.  I ran into the house and got binoculars.  By the time I came out there was only one light directly overhead.  Through the binoculars I could vaguely see some kind of structure illuminated by the single bright light.  As I was watching through the binoculars the light gradually faded out.  I assume the same thing happened to the other light (object) while I was getting the binoculars.  Although the speed across the sky was constant and similar to that of an airplane, there was no noise and no other lights.  It&apos;s not unusual to see the flashing lights of an airplane and not hear it.  I&apos;m guessing that the objects were about 10 thousand feet elevation.  Could this have been a pair of stealth fighters going into stealth mode?((NUFORC Note:  The Space Shuttle, followed by the Space Station, passed over Savannah at 20:04 hrs. on October 16, 2002.

I believe it was Phoenix.  Anyways the orange lights all appeared in a line across the city.  After the ordeal the military came out with there own statement saying they were flares I believe. The ufo footage was taken by a gentleman from his house.Amazing as it may seem I saw the same colored lights that night in Monterey, CA. It was around 9:30 pm. On my way back home from class I was driving east on Highway 68 near the Monterey Airport.  The night was clear with no moon.  While looking off to the southeast I saw what appeared to be two stars of orange color. However, they were moving together at a fixed speed while I was driving. I lossed them for a few seconds in the trees and then there was only one.  As I drove further passed the airport the orange light kept on a straight path at a moderate speed. It looked like the UFO was flying at the speed of a small plane.  While driving about a mile east of the airport I was right under the UFO. The light did not change course nor was it landing at the Monterey Airport. It kept right on its path going north-northwest of the airport.Now you are wondering why this is interesting and if there is any truth to this. Well one interesting clue about the UFO is the lights. The UFO did not depict the normal aircraft light pattern on an airplane. No wingtip lights were visible or flashing. Nor was there any headlights visible through the entire experience. The object(s) were a round soft orange color. They looked so much like a star at first that you could have easily assumed they were. Another thing when I drove under the object it still was orange all the way around. Still no wingtip lights were visible.  In addition, normally when an aircraft passes you at night it should be dark from the rear since the headlights are pointed in the direction of flight. Anyone think this is not a normal aircraft?", "5-6 red circles, stationary.I saw 5-6 red dots in the sky.  They were very bright and bigger than most visible stars.  A lot bigger.  They weren&apos;t moving, just stationary in that one spot.    To the North.  I first thought they were from the mountins, but they were far too bright and I had never seen them before.  They stayed there all of the night and when I woke up the next morning they were gone.  I saw them against a clear night.((NUFORC Note:  Had they been stars, they should have moved across the sky with the other celestial bodies around them.  We do not know what the witness observed.

It moved first to the north, then very smoothly--no jerkiness at all--it started toward where I was sitting (I was west of it), then again moved in another direction, heading south, and one more time to the north, then it vanished without a sound. I&apos;ve lived next door to our local airport for 49 years, so I know it wasn&apos;t a plane--they&apos;re never soundless, nor do they move so smoothly, and obviously cannot change direction so quickly. I don&apos;t know if anyone saw this; there was a lot of traffic, but all work-bound toward downtown Traverse City.This object was no more than 500 yards away from me, and very low in the sky. Traverse City is sited on Grand Traverse Bay, and it was the bay that I was facing. I got out of my car as soon as I realized this was something unusual so that I could determine whether there was any resemblance to plane engine noise; nothing but car and truck sounds, however. Size of object would have been about the size of a 777 plane, but nothing larger than a DC-10 or a very small jet can land/take off from our small airport, nor does anything fly that low over the bay (my guess would be approximately 500 hundred feet above the surface of the water, no joke)except the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, who are here each summer for a couple of days. Again, there was absolutely NO SOUND AT ALL, NONE WHATSOEVER, TOTAL QUIET as far as any plane engine, and much too smooth of moves and direction changes to have been a plane.", "Meteor like object moving slowly eventually breaking apart leaving a blue streak.This object appeared to be a VERY LARGE meteor but it was wider and moved very slowly in an upward direction.

I had my zoom binoculars (7 - 21 X 50) with me and started to look at the local mountains from the coach parking area.   One mountain which was due south of us (I also had my compass with me) had a particularly pointed shape with left and right slopes of about 45 degrees.   Over this peak I saw a spherical shaped object which I thought  must be some sort of symbol erected on a mast at the peak of the mountain, but after a few seconds observation I realised there was no mast.   The object looked aluminum in color and was illuminated by the sun.   Without the binoculars I had great difficulty in finding the object, but could just about see it with the naked eye.   Over the period of 5 minutes it moved to the right very slowly and eventually disappeared behind another mountain mass.   Another person in our party also had a pair of binoculars and was able to observe the same object.   I later tried to work out the angular diameter of the object and I estimated it to be not more than 3 mins of arc.   Being a stranger to the area I could not tell how far away the mountain was but using estimates of say 4 miles distance this would place the diameter of the object at about 18 feet.", "Streaking white dotsI was sunbathing in the mid-afternoon on the back deck of my family&apos;s home looking straight up into the blue sky.

Within in one to two seconds they had crossed the sky. My first impression were that they were high flying jets. It was hard to comprehend...to cross the sky that high that fast. Then within 30 seconds, the event repeated. White dots streaking across the sky in a straight line, west to east. I continued to see white dots streak across the sky, in the same line of path, every 30 seconds or so.

It was stationary for maybe 10 seconds then it took off very quickly in a straight line heading south eventually dissappearing  into the horizon over downtown LA.  It moved in the direction the wind was blowing so we didn&apos;t think too much of it at first, though it did seem to move much faster &amp; in a much more of a  straight line than would be possible by mere power of the wind.

I looked up and saw and object that at first I thought was a passenger jet. I&apos;ve never seen a UFO in the two years I&apos;ve been here so I thought &quot;eh it&apos;s just a jet&quot;. Jets pass that way all the time. But the thing that caught my eye was this &quot;starish&quot; shine it had. Then after the that faded (in about ten or so seconds), I could see that it was a metallic object and it appeared to be going away from my position (westward), yet it was somehow slower, a lot slower than a jet. It just kinda &quot;hung&quot; there or &quot;drifted&quot; in a strange way. Another thing that stood out was that it appeared to be two pods melded together. If you saw the photos on Jeff&apos;s site of the &quot;four pod&quot; craft  it was similar to that although it was hard to really make out too much detail because it was much further up in the sky . I&apos;d have to say it was a good 7 to 10,000 feet up there.I was still skeptical this was not just a Jet that I wasn&apos;t making out too well when to the diagonal lower left of it (closer in my direction) ANOTHER ONE apparently appeared!! I thought I just didn&apos;t see it and that it emanated from the direction behind me to my line of sight. But the odd thing was, as I was observing the first object I WAS looking elsewhere around in the sky and saw NO OTHER objects 360 degrees around (the skyline is pretty low along in G.J.-especially on this wide avenue) So I&apos;m looking at the second one now and it looks EXACTLY the same as the first one except closer. Now I did begin to think it was a UFO and checked to see if the other one had &quot;blinked out&quot; and that maybe this was the other blinking in somewhere else. The other one was still there but farther away. A couple of times I couldn&apos;t see it and then I saw it.Now I looked closely at the second object: still that weirdness to it that didn&apos;t quite look like a jet with apparently two pods (although the &quot;pods&quot; weren&apos;t as vertically cylindrical-like as the one on Jeff&apos;s site).It was more horizonal-ish but with those two bubbly portions left and right. Think of a shorter and fatter cigar shapes craft hanging horizontally in the sky but with two pods for each side bulging..very odd. It also appeared to be subtley changing shape too as I observed it.  A closer inspection of the object revealed a slight exhaust coming out of the &quot;tail&quot; of it. Very faint spray of fuel exhaust but much lighter than even the lightest jet fuel sprays.O.K. here&apos;s the kicker: So I look for the first one and I still see it -after not seeing it for a moment .....I go &quot;o.k. this is all going to be explainable because that&apos;s  jet fuel exhaust&quot;(still thinking about number two while tracking number one).O.k. then I go back number two and It&apos;s GONE!!!

I was working as a school district police officer and was sitting in the middle of one of the high school campuses, writing on my patrol log. I had the window of my truck down and was using the illumination from a security light on one of the nearby buildings to write by. The sky was clear, stars visible, no moonlight that I recall. Suddenly, the interior of my truck lit up like it was daylight. My first impression was that a truck with off-road lights had pulled up behind me and suddenly turned on all its&apos; lights at once. This startled me quite a bit, as I did not hear anything, even with the window down. I looked up from my writing and into the rear view mirror, only to discover there was nothing there. I considered the possiblity of a police helicopter shining its&apos; spotlight on me, but there was no helicopter noise. Also, the spotlight from a helicopter has a blue-ish tinge to it, and has an oscillating effect due to the vibrations from the rotors. There was no sense that the light source was moving, and it was white light, like daylight. I looked out the window into the sky to try and locate the source. As I looked around, I saw an irregular patch of white light in the sky to the northeast, about 40 degrees above the horizon. The shape was roughly elliptical, but had ragged edges. The patch of light seemed to be closing in on itself, and it disappeared as I watched it. The size of the patch when I first saw it was about 4 or 5 times larger that the full moon, but much brighter. I checked the newspapers for the next several weeks to see if there was any mention of meteors or other events which would explain what I saw, but nothing ever appeared.I grew up near several airports and a military aircraft factory, and am familiar with conventional aircraft. While I am not an amateur astronomer, I like to look at the sky for relaxation, and have seen various types of meteors and bolides.

So the  sound went chuk chuk chuk whishzzzz, it was very mechanical, I thought mabe a helicopter, but the whishzz confirmed negative on the helicopter, so I looked out the second story window to the east from downtown spokane. I first noticed a cat on the front lawn who was uncannily looking up at the sky toward the east, thats when I saw what looked like a planet, solid white light. Then I noticed it moving towards me (westerly) I thought maybe a plane ,until the light made some loops, half moons, figure eight, and right angles, by then I was waking my girlfriend on the couch, saying listen carefully to the freeway, and notice the other noise, she heard it and then I said look at this, and pointed. So I went downstairs to get a better look outside, I sat down for about 20 minutes watching, it then hovered in place (bobbing motion I could slightly detect, I then seen the second obect which was to the southeast of me, or south of the first obective.

My window was facing my back yard, and the craft glided between my home and my neighbors home which was to my left (so if my house was facing north, the craft was gliding south to north -- I never knew the exact direction my house was facing).I remember thinking that something unusual was happening, and I felt as if something was coming.  Then I heard a whorreling sound, and I pictured (in my mind) my father swinging a long thick metal chain, about 20 feet of chain swinging around and around, then I thought of a hellicopter.  I then felt paralized, not out of fear, but something else -- but it wasn&apos;t alarming.  I then realized that this sound couldn&apos;t possibly be made by my father or a hellicopter.  It would have had to be so big, and spinning so fast that no one could make this sound with a chain.  I was surprised that it didn&apos;t wake anyone else.I was then scared, and wanted to stay very still because I knew that this was something that I have never experienced before.  Then I was sweating and couldn&apos;t move or speak.  The whorreling sound got louder and louder to the point where I was so scared that all I could do was wished dearly for the sound to stop.Suddenly, the sound stopped to nothing, and I became curious.  I was then able to get up and investigate what I had heard, but at the same time I knew that if I looked out my window that I would see what was there.And I saw it, I only saw about 3/4 of it.  It was a flat disk, like a freesbe, but had a definit point at it circumfrence an gradually raised to a top that was circular too, that center was about 1/4 of the craft.  It was a very dark &quot;shiny&quot; pewter color.  I remember circular lines like a music record from the rim to the center.  It had lights around the outside of its rim.  I remember thinking that it reminded my of Chirstmas tree lights.  I can&apos;t tell you the colors to be exact, but all I can say is that I saw every color in dots around the circomfrence of the disk -- colors that I would see in Christmas lights.  For example, I am sure I saw blue, green, red, and white, but I can&apos;t picture that in my mind.  I can&apos;t picture those colors in my mind today, as I did the moment after it was gone.It hovered, actually it hovered and glided with out a noise, it was perfectly silent as it slowly passed in between and under both of our roof lines, between our homes, and towards the front of our houses.  I watched it in a noiseless controled motion hovering, but moving in a steady pace, pass between my home and our neighbor&apos;s home.  I was at complete amazement, and awe until it past from my sight.  I also remember thinking that this is something that was special and real to the point where I should say something about it.Then I layed back down, as I was suppose to be sleeping.  I remember thinking that I was looking at something that wasn&apos;t anything I&apos;d ever seen, and thinking that I had just seen something that no one on earth could possibly have created.I then jumped up again with a start because I realized that I could run to the front of the house to see this again.  I hadn&apos;t seen the whole thing, and I was so curious.  But, there was also a weird feeling that made me feel as though it was gone before I could have gotten there to see it.  I still can&apos;t put that feeling in words, but it was just like when I knew something was coming and didn&apos;t get up to see what was coming and making that noise, but this time it was gone.  I still kick myself for that today.I told myself that I would never speak of this because, no one whould believe me, and it was too strange.A few years latter, I realized that I knew how big this craft was, or how big it wasn&apos;t because it passed between our homes.  My experience was small compaired to the things I&apos;ve seen and heard, but my story has a size that I haven&apos;t seen, heard or read before, and I could share that.I&apos;ve been wanting to share this for some time now.  I still can&apos;t explain it, and I am very curious.  I am also curious because after that when our dog had puppies, we found that all the water that pooled up in our fenced back yard was toxic somehow, and the puppies drank that water died.  I don&apos;t remember how the adults figured it out, but I remember thinking a few years later that it was because of what passed through our yard and between my neighbor&apos;s and our home that polluted that water, could be a coincidence -- I don&apos;t know.Another strange thing is that I feel that somehow I brought them here with my thoughts.  I can&apos;t recreate this, as I have tried out of curiosity. But, whatever it was, and however it came, is a mystery that is always there.I&apos;ve watched every show on this I could, and have read every book I can too.  There is just too much garbage to weed through, and I don&apos;t have the patience to keep up with it anymore, and haven&apos;t for years.I want to know what it was, and if that strange time in-between have anything to do with what we (my sister&apos;s) are going through now.I&apos;d appreciate your contacting me if you have any information that will clear this up, or as I&apos;m sure you can&apos;t, maybe let me know that I am not alone in this.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

PD))", "On November 1 2002 I observed four, chevron shaped flying objects in the sky that had an orange glow and were about the size of stars.I was standing on a picnic table while taking the dog out. I was looking up at the stars when out of nowhere appeared one unidentified flying object. At first I thought it was a shooting star, but then two more appeared and at first I thought, &quot;Weill that is odd&quot; and then a fourth appeared. They were all a glowing orange in a chevron shape and about the size of large stars. The first three flew in a V, one in front and two on either side and slightly behind. The fourth flew to the right of the three and just before disappearing fell into formation and the four were a diamond. I don&apos;t think that they were Earthly crafts because of how fast they flew and the odd orage glow they gave off. Not to mention they appeared to be far away and did not appear nor disappear into a horizon. It was a clear night and they just were there, flew over my head and were gone.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other seemingly similar reports from KS and VA for this date.  PD))", "It seemed to hear what we were talking about.we were driving on a country road at night, it was clear and warm out, we had the sunroof open when I noticed a flashing light off in the distants. At first I thought it was just a plane, but noticed it was covering a lot distance in short amount of time. I told my 2 friends, as we talked more about what we were watching we wanted to follow it. As we were talking we noticed that it started to get closer. It came along side us above a corn feild, it had 3 lights in a triangle,they flashed on and off at the same time. They flashed very bright they did not fade they were on then black. We couldn&apos;t see an object just the lights. It followed us along the road 100 yrds away. We slowed down, it slowed down, we sped up it did the same. We stoped it did also. We then shut the lights off and it stoped flashing. We then turned the lights back on and it started flashing again. We then turned the engine off, we could hear no sound of the object, it just flashed on and off with no sound. By now we were scared out of mineds. We decided to go back to town, as we did this the object stoped following us, like it could hear what we were saying. At some point we became brave and decided to go back after it but it seamed to start following the railroad tracks until we couldn&apos;t see it any more. We returned to the same place for a week but never say it again, and we quite telling our story. No one belived us. Even to this day I only tell very close friends. I know what I say!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  A celestial body--a star or a planet--will appear to a person driving that it is &quot;following&quot; his car.  However, unless the object is a twinkling star, or a tumbling rocket booster in orbit, it will not appear to blink.  PD))", "The movement of the three lights was strange first vertical then horizontalI was outside on the patio smoking a cigarette and looking up at the sky when i noticed three extremely bright lights. At first i did&apos;nt pay too much attention i just watched, i live 5 miles from Nasa and very close to an airforce base so it isnt too unusual to see F16s flying around especially when we get so close to a shuttle launch. The movement of the lights was strange, at first they were parallel then vertical, i know there are fantastic aircraft manouvers but this happened within a second and i heard no noise at all. The lights approached me and i just watched in amazement, I wasnt scared at all. The craft was roughly 2000ft above my head and i could see it was no aircraft i had ever seen (i used to be a flight attendant) it was not a perfect chevron but not a perfect triangle either. it had three extremely bright white lights one in the middle and at each side, there was a larger red light in the rear center of the craft the underneath was like a gride or grate, it felt like it was watching me as i was watching it very weird. The craft after hovering over me for at least 50 seconds which seemed like a lifetime excelarated which sounded like a huge vacuum cleaner not an aircraft and then slowly moved over the house. I ran out to the front of the house grabbing the phone to call the police to see if anybody else was reporting seeing the same thing, and watched the craft settle like a star as beams of light danced around it zipping back and forth around the sky.", "A huge orange triangle heads toward Earth!I was about 9 (Im now 12) and I had just come home from school when my mom noticed all the cars pulling over. We asked some people outside their car why everyone was doing this. He pointed to the sky. A orange triangular craft with a circle in the middle of it was hovering in the sky. It was way too high for anyone to make out what it was but we could tell it was huge. It stayed in the same spot for about 15 minutes (since we got there) and it slowly turned into just the round circle in the middle. No one could believe it. The orange triangular craft formed into a circle right in front of our eyes! It starting coming closer to Earth. Still high in the sky but closer. It started moving in circular patterns in the sky. Heading even closer. Then it instantly went back up and vanished.", "not only my daughter and i saw it.  there was no other explantion then a ufoat around 9:30 tuesday night my daughter was driving down south 81 mile marker 195 area when she saw lghts and at the same time another trucker said he say a ufo.  she called me to tell me about it.i was expecting an shippment of birds at the post office in scranton. they came in at about 10:00 pm, which i usually go and pick them up so them up.  i took my 13yr old daughter with me.  knowing that i was going through the same area i keep my eyes open. thinking ya right.when we pasted the Waverly exit about at the 195 mile marker to my left was a oval object with a red row of lights and blue row of lights. we pulled off and sat there looking at it.  all we had to do was look out of the truck window.  it was the wierdest thing we ever saw.  the lights were fading out to almost no lights and then comeing back on bright.when my daughter yelled &quot;oh my God&apos; its moveing.  it was not straight more like moveing in  a circle. the object was not rotating because the lights were very defined.  there were several rows of the lights.it just stayed in the area.  i have never seen anything like it.  there are no airports or mititary base there. it was to big and to high for a prank.  i cant see how anyone could have faked this.  i was really hard to tell how big it was.  i am going back tonight to explain it to myself with a camera.  i will update later.  i thought at first someone was sending up beams of light like they did in ny for the twin towers but there were no lights from the ground up.if still there i will take lots of pics.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be quite credible.  Please see other report from Arkansas.  PD))", "While i was jogging i notice a small brite light in the northern sky, since i was near my home a ran to get my telescope, with my wife with me i brought the object into focus, it was a oval shaped craft with two smaller lights or crafts moving around the larger object or craft, while my wife was watching through the telescope in seem to explode leaving the two smaller lights there. She said that it was the strangest thing she has ever seen. It made a chill come over you. It was a very high, it was out of the airplane routes.", "the craft seemed very large,and had simeltaneous flashing red lights,all in a straight line.about 8:06 pm on sept 17,2002,i got a call from a friend telling me to go outside,she was kind of frantic.She said there was something in the sky to the northwest.as i looked up i saw a long,lighted craft,looking at the distance i was appeared to be about 4-5 inches,there was no sound.as i was on the phone w/her it began to break up and buzz.i called 911,and they gave me the number to the ufo hotline.I explained to the man i was speaking with,that it was oblong(from my veiw)and had a line of flashing red lights,and it was moving in an odd manner(not like a conventional aircraft)rather up and down.i and my daughter watched for about 5 minutes as it moved to the northwest,and dissapeared.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and with her son, and both of them sounded quite credible.  We are awaiting illustrations from both witnesses.  Please see other report from Seattle for this date.  We believe the correct date for the sighting is September 18, 2002, the night they called our Center.  PD))", "It resembles very closely to a delta formation photo on your website.I was sitting with my wife in an open restaurant. I was facing east. The moon was at half-moon stage and at about 45 degrees from the horizon. There were no noticeable clouds in the sky. At exactly 22.00 hrs [local time] I suddenly saw 3 lights travel from south to north in the sky. They were bluish in colour and seemed luminiscient. The light was not flashing but rather glowing. The lights were in a triangular formation with a large one at the front and two smaller ones at the back. They did not move individually but seemed to be in perfect formation. They passed just below the level of the moon. There was no sound at all. They seemed to just glide at a very high speed. The sightinglasted about 12 seconds and I just managed to show it to my wife too. I did not discuss this with anyone except a friend who  believes likewise. This incident was then reported in a local newspaper. It also stated that there were reports from people from a town about 270 km away of having same sighting at exactly same time. The airport of my town has the airstrip aligned in east-westerly direction. So most aircrafts coming in to land come in low from a south-westerly approach. Also the restaurant is about six kilometers away from the airport so the incoming aircraft is low enough to see the sign on its tail. I have never seen a aircraft go from south to north before. Also there are no flights at the specific time. And since I am a fairly regular customer of that restaurant and prefer the same seat I am aware of flights passing in and and out over my head. I 39 years old. My wife is 38. Together we manage a Kindergarten and Primary School.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "About 3:30 p.m. in Taos, New Mexico, my mother called me into the living room to look through the window. There was a Bright &quot;star&quot;. Then we saw it slowly but surely moving to the north. It was in the east. We looked through binoculars and saw red, green, white, yellow and blue lights. it was an oblong or disk shape. It was moving pretty fast. We tried to take pictures. My camera made some weird sounds and shut down after 4 shots. My mother, me, and my stepfather observed it for mare than an hour. We found it was too late and went to bed. But right before we left, we saw it bouncing around through the binoculars. I also thought i saw something bright shoot from the &quot;ufo.&quot; There was a slight haze around the object and it left a tiny trail. At time the object owuld also change light colors. We also saw an airplane race toward it. But then the airplane shifted lower, below the object.", "6 OR 7 BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS - LARGER THAN STARS - IN THE SOUTHERN CROSS FORMATION.  sTAYED STATIONARY FOR 5 MINUTES AND THEN DISPERSED. wHEN DISPERSING WERE VISIBLE AND THTHEN DISAPPEARED.  NO NOISE MADE.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))", "4 rectagler lights 50 foot apart in a streight horizonal line, low huming noiseIt was a overcast nihgt no stars or moon, I was looking to the south west, there was a object with 4 rectangler windowes of white light evenly spaced apart moving north at a verry slow speed about 4 or 500 feet up 1/2 to 3/4 mile away. I called my wife out to see it we figured it was a good 200 feet long going by the spaceing of the lights and the point of our observation. The lights looked like a door way turned side ways there was a small round light a ways behinde it that kind of bobed up and down. We were standind in our drive way when it pased over Lindy Lake Bar we were looking at it through our gate post which is 20 foot wide we were 60 feet from the gate Lindy Lake Bar is a 1/2 mile west of us. Two of the lights just fit inside of the gate post with two outside of the post that is how we figured it was at least 200 feet long. it made a low huming sound not very loud. We live in a wooded area there isn&apos;t much around here but woods. The next day I talkerd to my sister who lives 5 miles south of here and ask her if she seen any thing that night.She said something come over her house about 22:30 headed north and it lit up the woods like it was day time but she couldn&apos;t see any thing else or where the light come from.", "I saw a double V formation of faint green triangular craft.This event happened over three years ago. I recall all the details of the event except the exact date it occured. I was sitting on my porch looking south when I noticed a formation of about 40-50 marks flying in a double V formation. In other words, it looked like a flying(W). The objects were triangular and emmited a faint green hue. Several objects broke formation and moved north for a split second then returned. This was not a flock of birds due to the rate of return of the seperated objects. The entire formation was headed west at about 5000+mph est.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))"]
