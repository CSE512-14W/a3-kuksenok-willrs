["Alum CreekAt about 11:00 pm on the way home I came up on a straight stretch and noticed and something that long and had alot of lights. I tried to get the person that was with me to look but they would not, they kept saying there is nothing there.Getting to the end of the straight stretch, I had noticed that the 20oz soda I had propped between my legs was gone. The straight stretch of road is about a 1/2 mile long and it felt like forever.A little while later I would have dreams of little people with big eyes coming at night. I was unable to move witch made it more scary to me.I remembered someone with a red light overtop of me, and some how I was able to move my hand. When I did the light burned my finger.&quot;Still have the place on my finger&quot;", "Chicago Flash of LightNorth Chicago- Myself and two friends saw a sudden flash of light in the sky. 3 am, clear skies no rain no lightning. Looked very similar to lightning falling from the sky but not in an bolt pattern, more like a ball falling through the air, flashed very bright, then disappeared. As stated no rain or storms in the area, no clouds and no lightning storms. Was not a rocket or firework of any kind. No sound just a brilliant flash.", "I can&apos;t really explain it good enough, but what I saw was just odd.It was around 2 in the morning and I was doing some work on the computer..I got chills down my spine and something told me to look out my window. I jumped on my bed and opened the shades, when I looked out, not two seconds later this bright green light from way up in the sky fell down to somewhere I couldn&apos;t see. I knew it wasn&apos;t some falling star or something like that because it was just..too weird. You know where you just know what you&apos;re seeing is something you just can&apos;t explain for the life of you. Yeah..Anyways, I&apos;ve seen a similar thing in New Jersey with my cousin..only the thing we saw was red and it didn&apos;t fall. But it&apos;s always a light. Sometimes the watches act funny too..My friends and I see odd things a lot..So I&apos;ll be reporting back here when the next event occurs.((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

I told her there was a really bright star in the southern sky to go out in her yard and look. she was about a mile from where we lived. the light was slowly getting closer and was really low to the trees tops , then it went right over my yard , there was no sound I was telling my sister to look toward my house she said she couldn&apos;t see it because of the trees. this thing I tought at first was a stelth but then when it was over me I seen the bottom.It had no real wings just rounded triangle ends and it had a bubble like area on the bottom of it. The end as it passed had red ,yellow/white purple/blue lights across the end or back of it . I watched it leave and then a really fast american military jet was flying behind I think he was trying to catch that thing. he wasn&apos;t keeping up with that thing. I was still on the phone and told my sister the whole thing I just saw, and that I didn&apos;t feel well , I tryed to walk up the back stairs and fell three times and I don&apos;t drink or do any drugs, I called for help and my daughter helped me in the house .

I wrote him earlier this year asking what he recalled about the incident&hellip; b/c I have been coming across more tv specials regarding ufo and crop circle phenomenon. The photo was taken from the spot where we camped.  I had been walking/hunting this area for many years and knew miles of territory around this from many angles.  I&rsquo;ve camped here and close by many times.  I&rsquo;ve never had any previous encounter and have not had any since&hellip;. But what my son and I saw that night was truly different than anything we&rsquo;ve heard, read or seen on tv. The night had a half moon on the opposite side of the sky, which gave some cast on the outlines of the hills even though it was dark &ndash; meaning no city lights were affecting us&hellip;. It was about 9pm.The exact date is not in my recollection but is recorded in my original notes of 12 yrs ago, however it was late June/early July of 1994, we were near Ink-O-Pah California, close to Table Mtn.  I was 42, my son was 16. We were finished with dinner and were shooting fireworks, rifles, pistols and shotguns&hellip; I had gone to the back of my Chevy Blazer to get something when my son said he saw a fire in the distance and thought someone was coming towards us.I turned and saw a light in the distance where there should only be sky&hellip; it looked like a large campfire and it looked to be way out in the distance and the light was flickering.There was a hill about 1/8 mi from us on the right, with another hill about 1/8 mi more on the left, these forming a V.The &lsquo;campfire&rsquo; was off center &hellip; while we looked at it another fire come on to the right but the same level, then after 15 sec another come on off-center of them but lower &ndash; no symmetry&hellip;. They did not start small and become larger, they were big fires immediately and all 3 the same size.I got out my 12x power binoculars and looked at them&hellip;. They were not campfires, instead they were large rectangular windows with yellow light coming from them, the heat of the desert was plainly distorting in the foreground [which gave them the &lsquo;campfire&rsquo; look in the distance] but these windows were just beyond the furthest hill [approx &frac14; mi].We only had a few minutes at these 3 when one went out, then another, then 4 came on &ndash; leaving 3 on one plane and 2 on a lower plane, again no symmetry.  In my binoculars there was enough light from the 5 windows that I clearly saw a horizontal deck under the lower 2 lights &hellip; the openings looked to be about 3&rsquo; x 12&rsquo; and the deck about 5&rsquo; wide.After about 1 min I gave the binoculars to my son and got my rifle out which also had a 12x power scope.  Just then the lights began to go off, then 20 seconds later come on &hellip; in different patterns 3/2, 2/2, 2/3, &frac12;, etc, etc for the next 10+ minutes as we watched.We felt no fear, just curiously watching as the lights went on and off.Then they went to all 5 on&hellip;. and one by one went out.I figure the distance the lights spanned was about 100 yds, left to right, while the lights looked like they were between the peaks, they were behind them a distance that I can only guess at , at least 1/8 mile if not more.We waited to see what happened next &hellip; After approx 2 min a tall white light looking like a pole lit up on the closest hill on the right.  There is a smaller peak formed by large boulder with another boulder below on to it&rsquo;s left which nearly outlined the downhill slope of the hill in the background&hellip;. The light was on top of the lower boulder, it&rsquo;s light illuminating both boulders and yet shedding light on the hill in the background too &hellip;. It looked to be 8&rsquo; or 10&rsquo; tall with quite a glow around it, there was no form other than a long tall pole of a light, I would guess 6&rdquo; wide in comparison/proportion to the height of the pole.After a couple minutes looking at it, it went out.  After about 1 minute it came back on in the same spot and 10 seconds after that a red pole light popped on, to it&rsquo;s right and lower down the rocks &hellip; it looked to be approx 6&rsquo; &ndash; 8&rsquo; tall.  It&rsquo;s glow was bright and we could see the rocks around it, but it was a bright red.These lights went on and off only a couple of times over about a 4-5 min period, then went off &ndash; white being the last one.We looked intently to see if they or something was moving towards us or coming closer to us.After approx 2 min several of the &lsquo;campfire&rsquo; lights came on again, stayed for about 2 min, then all went out at the same time.  We watched and waited and then began to make ourselves busy while talking about everything&hellip;.  nothing ever happened the rest of that night.We stayed up till about 11pm, then went to sleep in the bed of the Blazer with the tail gate open.  Neither of us had any awakenings, encounters, aliens, kidnappings or nothing &hellip; we woke up fine and have never had any dreams or nightmares or anything beyond our mental recollections of what we saw that night.Next Day: We walked to the closest hill and searched all over for any signs of marks, prints, burns, disturbances &hellip; and found nothing.We then walked down to the base of the hill in the background, finding nothing we went back to the Blazer, drove to the other side where I knew of a dirt road coming close to the hill, then walked up to the top of the hill, again searching for any signs of something or someone having been there.  I looked for any fake rocks too, as in the movies they use foam rocks.  We looked for anything moveable, any place that a pole might come out of the ground that could have lights on it, we used our imagination to try to find anything&hellip; but there were only animal marks, prints, etc &ndash; just natural traffic in the dirt.  I returned the next weekend with my camera for the picture I&rsquo;ll attach or send along.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Brilliant reddish-orange object with green tip; hovering then ascending at impossible speedOn the night of February 22, I had just pulled into the parking lot of the Borders books store and was finishing a cellphone conversation with my father. After about 10 minutes or so, I happened to glance out my car window and noticed an intensely bright, self luminous, circular object which had the appearance of being set ablaze with an electrically charged reddish-orange fire. My first impression was that I was looking at the afterburner of an extremely close range F-15 or F-18, but I was confused as to how the object could remain stationary and why the flame didn&apos;t taper to a point. I could hear nothing. It hovered motionlessly for about 3 seconds; during which time small flecks of golden colored light began to appear within it. The red light then pulsated and the object accelerated up and away from my point of observation on a northwestern trajectory. The acceleration occurred in two distinct stages. Stage one was incredibly fast and stretched a band of neon-like red light across the sky. Stage two was even faster as the tip of the object became green and what had previously been small golden flecks of light now also became stretched to form very narrow but sharp edged lines within the larger red band. Finally, as if someone had stretched and let go of a rubber-band, the tail end caught up with the tip as it vanished from sight hooking down slightly at the last moment. The entire event lasted approximately 5 seconds, but it still left me sitting in my car trembling a bit.About a month later, I became so interested in what had happened that I decided to get some detailed maps of the area behind the Borders store front and check out what was back there. I roughly estimated the objects distance and began tracing my line of sight with a pencil. At 3 miles from my point of observation the pencil came to rest on the Stony Brook Nuclear Structure Laboratory. Naturally, this peaked my interest as I had already suspected that whatever I saw was plasma related. I&apos;ve since spoken with a few of the professors who operate that facility and they&apos;ve stated firmly that their equipment couldn&apos;t possibly have produced any energy related phenomenon outside of the building.Having said that, I am now certain of five things that the object was not 1)It was not some ridiculously strange experiment of S.N.S.L. 2)It was not a meteor (it remained motionless for 3 seconds and ascended). 3)It was not a reflection in my car window or a hallucination (I&apos;ve since found an independent NUFORC witness who saw it) 4)It was not a plane (impossible speed and hovering) 5)It was not a naturally occurring plasma phenomenon (perfectly circular shape and rapid acceleration) So what was it? Well, whatever it was, it seemed to express an interest in the Stony Brook Nuclear Structure Laboratory. There remains the possibility of coincidence. But the more I investigate this phenomenon the more I uncover a direct link between these objects and all things nuclear. This suggests definite intent. Whether or not extra-terrestrials are involved is a separate issue, but I now believe that these objects are physical, technological, and intelligently controlled.", "My UFO sighting over the Immigration Rally in Dallas, Tx.It was all in the Immigration Rally in Dallas Texas on April 9th 2006 at around 13:30. Me and one of the people i was marching with saw this strange object changing shapes in the sky. We didnt know what the object was. We just saw it as a ballon or something. I jokingly said, &quot;look, bro , a ufo!&quot; we had a little laugh, not thinking anything of it. But the reason I am bringing it up now is because i was just curiusly looking at ufo pictures on the net (10/06/2006), and it was a ufo that looked exactly like what we saw on that day. I was overwhelmed when I saw the picture, and I immediately thought that some research area might want to know. It was a white cigarrette-like shape, except it moved around, and it seemed to make movements as if it was weightless (thats why we thought it was a balloon at first). It seemed to move like if it had no weight, like if the air was making it move. It was pretty high in the air, probably the elevation that a airplane would fly. The object didnt really seem to move location, it was just like standing still, like if it was just observing how the 300 thousand+ people were marching. At times the object would look like a horizontal cigarrette, and at times it looked like a bomerang like shape. It didnt seem like if it was changing elevation, just the movement of the object. Like I said before, I&apos;ve held this in for about 6 months because i just thought of it as a balloon. The pictures I&apos;m going to send are not from the Immigration Rally, but they&apos;re from some couple in Los Angeles. But the pictures are not of something that somewhat looks like what I saw, but they ARE OF WHAT I SAW, the SAME EXACT THING. In the pictures you can clearly see what im talking about when I said that the object changed shapes. Again these pictures are not mine, they were taken by a couple in Los Angeles.

They said it was around 15 to 20,000 feet up in the sky and it sort of glided through the sky. It was slightly iridescent in color and just bright enough to visibly see it, although the witnesses claimed to be able to see through it. They all said that it was really big, but hard to tell how so because it was so high in the sky.It was definitely triangle shaped.One of the witnesses also claimed to have seen the same unidentified object a few hours prior. I was extremely dissapointed not to have seen it, but my brother, best friends, and a few of their friends all seriously swear that they saw this UFO.", "Unknown lights filmed descending into wooded areaMy sister and I spotted a group of lights descending into the wooded area behind our house.  We grabbed the camcorder and started filming.  We were looking almost directly west, through the tops of the trees.  We could see the lights clearly and having no idea what it was were looking at, zoomed in on one of them. We followed it down, until we lost sight of it in the heavier underbrush near the ground.  It took about 16 minutes from the time we started filming until we lost it.  We waited around for over an hour, to see if it would come back up.  We never saw it leave. Some background - we were filming it from the second floor deck. The camera used was a JVC GR-D270u, mounted on a tripod.  We started filming at 7:15pm and stopped approximately 16 minutes later when we could no longer see it.", "Four tightly packed objects glowing green moving at 150 mph 1/4 mile away spread out  equally spaced within 2 seconds.My wife and I were seated watching the fireplace fire when I saw a moving object thru the  upper edge of the glass doors leading to the deck of our cabin.

After calling attention to her and watching it then thru the cabin window I rushed out to the deck to see it passing behind a large tree. At that time (within the approx. two seconds while changing positions and it being out of my sight) it had changed to four separate pieces spaced equally apart. The distance between each being about 1.5 times the length of the single stick formation. Each piece was about the size of an oil drum; my original impression was that the &quot;stick&quot; was about half the length and diameter of a small aircraft making a landing approach. The group disappeared behind trees and I waited for over 30 seconds to see or hear an impact. Unless they had made a right angle upward turn they had to have collided with the steep terrain within seconds of passing out of sight.

My friend, her boyfriend and i were talking previously about a movie they had just went and seen, just then, my friend looks up into the sky and ask&apos;s me &quot;is that a plane?&quot; i looked up into the sky and i saw a disk shape figure, and it had yellow/orange lights moving from left to right going at a medium speed. i thought to myself that could be a plane, but planes have lights that guide it to where its going. there was no light and there was no movement. it just stayed in one place. and i asked her &quot;is that a u.f.o?&quot; and she kept tellin me she dont know she dont know... so then i looked at it more, i stared at in staying in one place. and i seen the whole shape of it.. it was like a disk with an upside down U on it. i remember i kept staring at it even when the light turned green, i stayed. All of a sudden the shape started lowering, not like it was landing like a plane, because a plane goes to land in strait forward line, this object was hovering in one place with it circleing, and then it started dropping real slow. strait down. my friends boyfriend, in the back seat kept telling us we were lying, but he opened his door and stuck his head out of the car, and saw the u.f.o also. he seen how scared i was and he told me to drop him off where we were, and he got out the car, as i turned the corner out of the gas station, i looked to see if the object was there and it was gone. it dissapeared. i believe this was a u.f.o.

I observed, what I first thought was a shooting star, coming directly at me from space. It was traveling at a extremely fast rate of speed. It was a mild clear star-clustered night with perfect visability of the sky. After a few seconds the shooting star turned into a very bright light that lit up the entire area making it look almost daylight. Just before the bright object struck us it stopped almost instantaneously. Being in the USAF and flying in F105 Jets and working on the same, I know that this was not any type of man made aircraft. I estimated this object to be about 1500 to 2000 feet above us. I could not hear any noise from the object. After stopping at such close proximity to us, I notice that it resembled 2 large bell shaped search lights with tremendous candle power. I could not see what they were attached to, but I assume that these 2 large lights were attached to something. Then the large search lights started to scan the ground traveling in opposite directions and then reversing similtaneously and moving in the other direction. They appeared to be search lights searching for something. After scanning back and forth several times the lights started moving toward the horizon at a slow rate of speed. I observed these 2 lights until they disappeared over the horizon all the time scanning the lights back and forth as if searching for something. My girlfriend cried and begged me to leave. She would not get out of the car we were sitting in. I was curious and frightened at the same time, but I did get out of my car and watched this object until it slowly disappeared over the horizon. I have told this story to all my family members but did not have the means or address to send this sighting to anyone for documentation. I am curious if anyone else has had the same type sighting as I had. Being a Vietnam Veteran in the United States Air Force, I can assure you that our government does not have any type of flying craft that could ! perform in the manner that this object did. This object went from traveling at a speed of approximately 1500 MPH to a complete stop in a matter of a second. I am convienced that this object was guided by intelligence, weather by remote control or by occupancy. This is the first time and the last time in my lifetime that I have observed anything of this nature.

My son and I observed a large greenish fireball arching from east to west, in the northern sky.  The fireball lasted several seconds, before disappearing, but lasted long enough for both of us to get a very good light show. The fireball went from green to white before disappearing. We were standing on the front upper deck of the Washington State Ferry Wenatchee sailing west.  Another couple standing with us also observed the object.

Then it shot straight up into the heavy cloud cover and was gone.Then on Oct 5th I was out on my back deck.. about 11pm, I noticed again a &quot;red light&quot; I called for both my daughter and her friend to come out and see it.  All three of us watched this light over the course of twenty minutes. At one point it dropped something out of it,  looked like sparks, this seemed to fall about a mile west of my house. The light was identical to the earlier observation. The red light very slowly flashed off and on for about twenty minutes. It very slowly scroosed the sky from west to east as we watched. I went in to the house to get a flashlight and blinked the flashlight off and on in a pattern, it seemed to respond the pattern back to us. Then it sharply went up.. till it was  barely seen, then came back down and traced off to the east, where we no longer could see it.

Then all of a sudden it went straight up into the sky and disappeared.  It was not a shooting star nor was it a plane. We all saw it and can&apos;t explain what it could have been.

Ive seen meteors and comets and shoting stars, it was none of those. It just appeared and then zoomed away silently. I immediatly told my friend but he was too late to catch it. We continued to watch the sky, and about 5 minutes later, we BOTH saw a white light appear in the sky, and zoom very fast off to the southeast from the northwest and dissapear before our eyes.

I grabbed by digital SLR and drove to their house.  The object appeared to be a sattelite and eventually disappeared behind some trees.  I couldnt capture the object with my camera. We stayed outside for a while (my mom, dad and myself) talking and observing the sky.  Suddenly, a white light with an orb shape came up from behind the trees.  It wasnt flying straight like an airplane, it was more sporatic (imagine a gnat flying through the air).  It made a sharp turn to the right, and during the turn, the light faded from white to red.  I tried to take a picture, but I couldnt get the camera to focus properly.  The object seemed to slow down a bit.  I lowered my lens, and then the object faded back to white.  Then the object seemed to just dissolve in the sky.  Afterwards, there was a lot of aircraft activity in the sky.  This included a very low flying jet and a low flying single engine plane.

This particular object was due east from my location, at about 25 degrees elevation, just to the left of Mt. Hamilton, a prominent landmark. It shape was a cyllinder with rounded ends, long axis parallel to the horizon--and fixed in the sky during the 5 minutes I watched. The object subtended approx. 1.5 degrees, and in the evening light shone in the same colors seen in nearby stratocumulus; I judged it to have a reflective surface. The atmospheric effects on the object gave the appearance of considerable distance, perhaps even as far distant as the Mt. Hamilton range. While unproven, I had the impression of considerable size. Naturally, when I observe something puzzling, I try to eliminate any conventional possibilities. The only prosaic explanation was a blimp or approaching aircraft, but as there were no visible protuberances, such wings, fuselage, or stabilizers, I&apos;m not satisfied with that explanation. Have observed many blimps before, this distinctly cyllindrical object was quite different from a blimps familiar ellipsoid shape. When traffic cleared, I watched this object until it was lost behind the local skyline of rooftops and trees. Since I was near home, I quickly dropped by and grabbed my binoculars for a closer view, then drove to my previous viewing point. The object could not be seen, and upon driving towards Mt. Hamilton and away from ground obstructions, I could not find this object anywhere in the sky. Since only 5 minutes from my last sighting had elapsed, I do not believe a blimp could have left local airspace during that brief time. Local wind conditions were calm. With those details, and a bit of skepticism I submit this report.((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))The report below was incorrectly entered as &quot;Cupertino, CO&quot;.

Took a break and looked up, saw what looked like an all white sheet of paper traveling at high speed over my head approximate size of a quarter at arms length.  Object was heading almost due west.  Object changed shape to an imperfect boomerang shape as it slowed way down, then it changed to an imperfect triangular shape with rounded corners.  Continued to slow down to a crawl as it got much, much smaller.  I am assuming it was climbing very fast not just getting smaller but it appeared to get smaller. Then it appeared to be a perfect round all white dot from below as it came to almost a complete stop at a very high altitude. It may have been a white sphere but there was no dimension, no shadow. It began to speed up again and went near to the sun (from my vantage point). I covered the sun with my left hand and could still see the white dot quite clearly two to three inches from the sun.  It then got smaller and smaller until it was almost out of sight.  It then appeared as if a dark area was surrounding it in a larger flat circle, but this was very faint, just prior to it climbing out of my sight.  What is odd are the feelings I got when observing this object.  First off, it had no apparent dimension, no shadows against itself as you see with an aircraft, it was like a cartoon cell image in the sky yet it was there, not an illusion or a reflection. Secondly, it was traveling in a manner that it seemed that our atmosphere was neither aiding it nor preventing it from climbing out of sight at an incredible rate, again like watching a cartoon.  It was not following the rules that we have to follow in our atmosphere.  Thirdly, when it did slow down and speed up, it appeared as if it was being pulled from behind to slow it down and again pulled from the front to speed it up. This is just a feeling I got, I cannot expalin it.  It moved in a manner that I have never seen.  I am a commercially rated helo pilot and have been to a lot of air sh! ows and NEVER seen anything move like this.  If we have this kind of craft, why are we still using primitive fighters and bombers?  The whole sighting lasted 30 seconds.

P.D.T.). Object: Possibly a Meteor coming down to Earth, teardrop shaped (round with short pointed tail). Coloration: very bright yellow (with duller yellow blotches). Size: nearly the size of the Moon (which was in the Southern sky), possibly 3/4 to the size of a full Moon. Azimuth: Using North as zero (0&deg;), to South (180&deg;), and therefore East (90&deg;), the object was at first spotted at nearly 100&deg; and by the time it disappeared over the horizon, it was perhaps 95&deg; azimuth (Left to Right, it was just slightly more to our Right from straight ahead). Angle of Elevation: closer to 35&deg; than 30 when first spotted, and dropping to about 25&deg; or 20&deg; behind the horizon. Duration: It was a couple of seconds before I discounted it as not being a reflected glare, and then close to 12 seconds of active watching (while driving, as there was no place to pull over and it was easy to watch while driving as it was so low now and just right of straight ahead). The distance was impossible to tell, but it had the illusion of dropping out toward North Bend or Lake Sammamish. After: As it disappeared from sight, I called a friend who lives on the West shore of Lake Sammamish to see if they were ok, and to see if they had seen it.  They had there back to the east deck window and had seen it get very bright and then turned to see it glowing over the East horizon.  As they went outside, they heard neighbors talking on their docks asking each other, &quot;What the heck was that?&quot;  Reporting: I called information for ideas of who to report this to ... I left a message at a Meteor organization in Kent, and then called and left a message at the University of Washington Astronomy Department in Seattle, and then called and spoke with Jennifer at KIRO Radio (710AM) in Seattle, who suggested I also report the event to the folks here at UFOCenter.com (and thank you for your kind call!) even if it was a meteor or such, as it had not yet been identified as such. POV: My point of view was driving Easterly on the Evergreen Bridge (Hwy 520) from Seattle, Washington toward Lake Sammamish just East of the center of the bridge when I noticed one very large yellow circular shape appearing to drop from the sky slightly to the East-Southeast side of the bridge, but still almost as high as the moon which was in the Southern sky.  I moved my head around a bit to be sure it was not simply a glare on the windshield, but it kept its path in spite of my dramatic movements.

What was fascinating about the color was that the white seemed &quot;clear&quot; in that as bright as it was, it wasn&apos;t blinding at all. I could clearly define the shape of the object immediately. I watched it as it travelled at a VERY high rate of speed and just as suddenly as it appeared it vanished. The amazing thing about its disappearance is that it did exactly that. It didnt suddenly take off to outer space, or drop behind a treeline. Where the object disappeared there IS no treeline, it simply vanished like it flew behind a curtain. Also of note, the object was travelling parallel to the ground, neither gaining or losing altitude. I have no guess (and guessing is all it would be) as to the rate of speed it was travelling, all I can say is it covered miles in a matter of seconds.

PD))", "A craft that appeared as a flashing cloud hiding in the clouds and created it&apos;s own to hide in.I stepped outside onto the deck at the rear of the house to let my dog out at 3:00AM.  Like I always do, I looked up to check out the sky.  It was cloudy directly above me but was only 50% cloudy (cumulous) with big breaks in between clouds. In the breaks between the clouds the sky was clear and I could see the stars very well. When I looked up I saw a round dim-lighted area in the clouds resembling a searchlight hitting the clouds.  Then I noticed it was flashing, at the time it was a consistant flash (one second on, one second off)but was inconsistent at times, too.  I was still wondering why a searchlight would be on so late and then it got to the edge of the cloud and was in the clear.  I was surprised though that it still appeared to be a round flashing cloud (pea-sized at arms length).  It was now in the middle of a clear sky with no clouds coming.  That&apos;s when I decided to get a better look at it.  I stepped inside and grabbed my binoculars that I keep in a cupboard right inside the door.  This took less then 5 seconds and when I stepped back out there were swirls of clouds covering it.  These clouds had a cirrus look but had a defined outer edge (multi-curved)and washed out like a smear toward the flashing cloud.  At this point I had to show someone so I went and woke two family members.  They came out and at this point it had moved to the next cloud blowing by.  The cloud it made was just dissapating but still visible.  My family saw what I had been seeing confirming that I&apos;m not seeing thing&apos;s.  We watched it for another half hour.  It never moved more than six to eight inches (at arms length)never making a sound but continuing to flash.  After the half hour it went behind a cloud and we lost track of it.  Twenty or so seconds passed and I heard a low whooshing sound that lasted about ten seconds.  After a couple of minutes of no sign of it my family went back to bed.  I stayed outside and about 20 minutes later I saw it again.  This time it was not flashing and was hiding! on the edges of the clouds until the cloud moved a distance and then it would meander to the next cloud coming.  I saw this with the naked eye and through the binoculars.  It was still visible because a circle sticks out againt a backdrop of blurry shapes.  Anyway I watched it jump clouds for about five more minutes until it disappeared again.  I continued looking for it and about a minute later I heard the whooshing sound to my left (west).  Looking up I saw what appeared to be typical FAA lights of a plane/jet at about the same altitude as what I was watching but a few miles away.  I looked through my binoculars at the lights and could only see lights, no craft.  Then it either turned off it&apos;s lights or took off because I took down the binoculars and it was nowhere to be seen.I don&apos;t know what I saw but it was definately some sort of craft.  I live about ten-fifteen miles away from Selfridge ANGB and witnessed what I believe to be four Black Manta TR3A&apos;s (another bizarre occurance)back in &apos;94 so I do leave the possibility open to it being a black project.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been observing a star, possible Sirius.

Stationary for about 10 minutes.Gentlemen,  I live in Beresford, New Brunswick, Canada. Our community is on the southern shore of the Bay of Chaleur. This morning, before sunrise (approx. 5:15am), I was on my patio having a cigarette looking east / northeast towards the bay. High in altitude I noticed a blinking light. At first glance, I thought nothing much as a passenger airline corridor is directly overhead (transatlantic fligts). But I soon realized what I saw was not a jet&apos;s navigational beacons. The light would become very bright (I would say 3-5 times the brightness of Venus at dusk/dawn), stay on for approx. 2 seconds and fade out. Intervals would be approx. 5 seconds, then the sequence would start over. What struck me was the fact the light was stationary. Insofar as altitude is concerned, it is somewhat hard to tell. I would venture a guess as being 35000 - 40000 feet and 5-10 kilometers east north-east. After observing this phenomenon for approx. two minutes, I noticed another blinking light, the 1st to my twelve o&apos;clock, the second to my 10:30-11 o&apos;clock. The second light was just as bright, would flash for about the same period of time, however the interval between blinking was closer to 10-15 seconds. These two lights remained stationary, maintaining their respective sequence. These lights were not a reflection, as sunrise is approx 7:00 am. This lasted for about 6-7 minutes (from the time I noticed), then the sequence stopped abruptly. As a matter of confirmation: these were definitely not navigational beacons. We see a good 30-40 flights daily pass overhead. Further, we can clearly hear the jets as they pass through.There was no sound whatsoever from these two lights, and hey were both located in the flight corridor.", "Rectangular object,bright lights in front. fainter ones behind, indicating shape longer thanis was wide, with no noise.I saw a strobing red light above me and assumed it was an aircraft.

We could see its reflection in the river water as well.  It had green red and white lights that appeared to be chasing each other around the perimeter of the sphere.

On Sunday night, Oct. 1, 2006 around 11:00 p.m (probably after) through the sliding glass door of a hill top house in Cuchara Colorado, I noticed around six balls of light which appeared to be traveling horizontally above the town of Cuchara (I believe the direction was some variation of an west to east movement). Due to the darkness of the night I couldn&apos;t tell if they were above or below the mountains on the other side of the valley (I assumed they were slightly above). I did have time to jump up and open the sliding glass door to watch the objects and make sure I was not seeing a reflection of some sort. There was no sound at all. The objects where traveling in a straight line and about the speed that orbiting satellites travel. There appeared to be about six very very bright glowing white ball shaped objects. The next to the last one appeared to have a tail, like it was frizzling out. I have no idea how large they really were, but if one extended their hand and made a fist, that would be about the size they appeared in my view. I had assumed it was some space junk on it&apos;s last leg of re-entry (or weather ballons). I&apos;m glad to know other people saw it, I was beginning to wonder. Once again, I&apos;m sorry I don&apos;t have better info for you. I failed to make good mental notes (I&apos;m not even totally sure the number was six), it was late and I was tired.

On a trip back from Wva to Florida, I was returning from seeing my mom in the hospital in WVa., it was late at night probably around 11pm while driving back through Alabama/Tennessee going south on the interstate highway I-65. What occurred was that an extremely bright light that reminded me of a locomotive train light appeared just behind me about 50yds quite suddenly and it followed me at the same pace I was driving around 60 mph, its movement was so strange because it didn&rsquo;t fluxuate with the contour of the road and I took notice there was no sound as if a helicopter. I wanted to alert my wife who was sleeping beside me in the car but I felt controlled as if in a trance or some hypnotic mind control so I kept my head straight ahead or forced, whatever, I even tried to take my foot off of the accelerator, tried to wake my wife but the only thing I could do was use my eyes to look in the forward direction and glance as well at the rear view mirror from time to time or maybe most of the time to keep track of its movements or was this what I was supposed to do, who knows, last of all I also noticed my palms were sweaty on the steering wheel but I couldn&rsquo;t take them off to wipe them. It seemed like for hours this occurrence was happening or maybe time was standing still or whatever I don&rsquo;t really know. I took notice as well, there were no cars in either direction the total time this was occurring, nothing seemed to be happening until this thing was gone and how did it go away well, Poof the light was gone is the only explanation I can come up with. When I was able to make movements with my body the first thing I did was move my head then wipe my hands off then I stopped the car on the side of the road got out and looked all around including the night sky, this caused my wife to wake and you can only imagine what she thought and said when I told her of this occurrence, finally I noticed life and back to the now time zone cars drove past in both di! rections , so tell me did my time stop or what, now doesn&rsquo;t this event seem strange to you but anyway the years have passed and from time to time I try to take myself back to those memories and ask myself, why me. I have never felt comfortable talking about this subject, even to this day, but it seems like a lot of people are coming forward so why not me. I have had many reoccurring dreams which started from my early teens of flying in some sort of craft and I remember always looking down at the terrain and cities as we were moving and I distinctly remember being asked if I wanted my family to go and I always said no only because either I feared for their safety or maybe I knew it was not my choice to make or maybe I thought I was never going to return again, who knows.", "Saucer shaped object enters river.This is a story that was told to me by my father, who would have been about 50 years old when this occurance happened.

He said that he observed a saucer shaped object come down from the sky at a &quot;moderate&quot; rate of speed, hover just above the water for a few seconds traveling maybe a few hundred yards then dived into the water disapearing from sight. He told me it had lights but i cannot remember what colors he said they were. My father grew up on the river, living in a house boat as a child. He told me that he had seen this sort of thing happen quite often over the years.

Along the top of a ridge which runs north and south of my easterly direction. I saw an object fly over the highway in front of me approximately 200 yards in front of me. It was flying no more that I would guess 20 feet above the ridge which was approximately another 20 feet above where the highway was cut into it to descend into the river bed. The object was traveling approximately 40 to 50 MPH when it passed in front of me traveling Left to right (North to South). The object appeared to be made up of two identical balls, maybe 5 to 6 feet in diameter made out of either metal or glass. Very shiney and definetely solid in appearence.One ball followed the other. The two balls were connected to each other with a metal assembly which ran straight frome the center rear of the front ball, connected to the center front of the rear ball, kind of like this: O--O. The proportions of my example are a little off. The middle connecting assembly appeared to be about 8 feet, giving an overall length of approximately 18 to 20 feet, and definetely solid construction.

The observations that follow took place while I was standing approximately 30 feet above the ground, on the back staircase of my apartment in San Francisco, California. Almost immediately after walking onto the staircase, I noticed what quickly revealed itself to be a large bird, probably a bird of prey, flying from the Northwest to the Southeast, perhaps 100 feet above me. It was an unusual sight; as far as I know, birds are diurnal creatures. I could see the bird clearly and made a mental note that this was probably a result of the city lights reflecting. I watched it pass above my head. Just as the bird had passed directly above me when I was distracted by something in the sky traveling in almost precisely the opposite trajectory as the bird. My most immediate thought was that I was looking at an airplane. The object passed directly over the bird I&rsquo;d been watching, traveling in what looked to be exactly the opposite path. It&rsquo;s difficult to reconstruct the order of my impressions of the object. I will do my best. My first unusual impression was that I couldn&rsquo;t identify the sound.  At the time I thought little of it, but in the way that one tries to identify the sound of an aircraft (&quot;Is it a plane?&quot; vs. &quot;Is it a helicopter?&quot;)  I came up empty. The sound was a mechanical, aeronautical sound that (I am trying not to characterize this retrospectively) that was close to that one would expect from a jet airplace than that of a helicopter, but was not the sound of an airplance nevertheless. It was an industrial, aeronautical sound that I could not decisively identify. I had what I must in fairness describe as a mild sense of confusion driven by the fact that in addition to my inability to precisely identify the sound I was hearing, there was something not familiar about the color and intensity of the lights themselves. Given the volume of the sound (Again, I am describing as best I can thoughts and impressions that occurred in fractions of a second in real time) I had the impression that the aircraft was higher than the bird I&rsquo;d been watching but low enough to make a strong sound--less than 3000 feet for sure. The lights seemed duller (less bright?) than they should have given the other variables. They were a dark red, or a blurry red--it was like a dulled orangeish red. I have made dozens of attempts since the event to draw the distribution of the lights I saw on the object. The best description I can come up with: The representation of 5 on a standard die, with an additional light in between the two rightmost dots.((NUFORC Note:  The formation did not survive the transfer from e-mail to our database.  PD)) &bull;&bull; &bull; &bull; &bull;&bull;    This pattern of lights moved from Southeast to Northwest for roughly 4 seconds.The part of the experience that was truly extraordinary came after the 4 seconds. As I watched with mild interest, the following happened; what I would call the lead light (the light farthest to the side of the direction in which the object was moving) reversed its postion. It took less than 1 second to do so; in that time, the lead light traveled clockwise until it occupied exactly the oppose position it had before. The object now looked like this:  &bull;&bull; &bull;&bull; &bull;&bull;  Then, in a fraction of a second and from my point of view, the object seemed to tilt in such a way that the western or leading edge went upward and the eastern or trailing edge downward. I say this not because it was directly visible as such, but because that was impression in the moment: the leading two lights disappeared from view, but I could still see the rear 4. Almost immediately thereafter (much less than 1 second), the entire object vanishedfrom view. Watching, I did not have the impression of something speeding away. It seemed simply to vanish. That is what I saw tonight. I have never seen anything remotely like it, and I have never before had a disposition one way or another vis a vis UFOs.

I noticed his barking was not usual for this hour and I feared there was an intruder of my household. I went to investigate the commotion to make sure there was no intruder. After noting that the house was safe, I decided to take my dog out on a walk to help calm him down. It was just only after walking 500 yards from my house until my dog started to growl toward the sky in a northeastern direction.  It was then that I noticed three white lights flashing brightly in the sky. After my eyes adjusted to the light I realized that I had not seen anything like this before. My dog continued to bark until the three saucers began to display amazing bright light emissions in multiple colors (yellow, blue, white). The objects continued to hover 300 feet in the air for approx. 4 minutes.  A bright white flash occured next and the objects zoomed back into the night sky, leaving a bright white trail behind them for only 3 seconds. I stood in awe as the objects disappeared back into the midnight sky and my dog quickly became calm again. My location is 8 miles southwest of the junction of highway 80 and interstate 40.

In the sky I noticed 2 lights, that appeared to be stationary, and nearby each other.  They must have been flying at airplane altitute or higher, but were both fairly close to each other to be deemed as airplanes.  Also, there were no white or red lights on them, only a solid orange looking light. By this time I was interested, so I kept looking, and asked my friend whom was driving if he was seeing this.  He looked over and we began talking about what it could be.  The lights seemed very stationary in the air, as we were driving, probobly at about 60-65 miles per hour.  It was all very odd.  I know the place that they were hovering over was farm land, because I&apos;ve driven by there many times during the day time. As we kept driving I was watching, and I could see what seemed like light on the ground directly underneath where the lights in the sky.  The light almost looked like it was orange light that was reflecting in a body of water on the ground, but I know there is no water there. When we got off the freeway on the Richards exit to go to a friends place, I told him to park at Safeway so we could take a look at the lights first.  When we got out of the car, we saw a light flying by, but it was clearly an airplane.  About 2 minutes later we saw another airplane flying by.  We are unsure that these are the same lights, but we were positive that the first lights we saw were not moving, and were very close to each other, and were completely orange.", "Three lights hoovering near Gonzales, CAMy sister was going to work early in the morning, traveling north on highway 101.  She saw three bright balls of light floating on the sky.  She said that these lights were lined up in a horizontal line.  The ball of light in the middle had a blue-ish color to it, and the other two right next to it were lit up white in color.  My sister thought it was probably a set of flares because they had a bit of a streak/trail right behind in the lights.  Strange thing was that my sister said that these lights started hoovering lower and lower to ground, to the point where it was about even to the height of a roof of a single story house.  After this, she said that these lights started rotating from a lined up horizontal pattern, to a three-point triangular pattern.  She said that if you were to &quot;connect the dots&quot; between these three lights, that you&apos;d connect a triangle.  After she arrived at work, her co-worker had arrived just shortly.  Since her co-worker lives around where we live, my sister had asked her if she had seen anything strange on the way to work.  Her co-worker said that she had only seen a horrible car accident nearby a 76 gas station.  This was the same location where my sister had also seen these strange lights.  We thought that maybe this unfortunate person had seen these strange lights as he/she drove, and was not paying attention to the road.  I used to fuel up aircraft at a local airport, and I&apos;ve seen helicopters, jets, big planes, small planes.  I thought that maybe my sister had seen a helicopter or something, so I asked her to describe it for me.  She didnt mention anything like blinking lights, spotlights, noise, dust picking up or anything like that.  Who knows what it was, maybe it was something that is totally explainable.  It was dark, so she couldnt make out anything that was behind this lights.

Let me state that I know this man personally and I can vouch for him that what he saw that night was an experience he will always remember. I really do think this story should be noted online because there where witnesses and just maybe they might see the story and come forward. I really hope you all reconsider your evaluation of this report and post it. Here is the story again:  I have a step father who is almost 70 years old. He has a UFO story that I think needs to be told just incase someone else out there might have been a witness can come forward with more info. He tells this story over and over without any discrepancies in his story. At times he gets excided when he tells it because he relives the experience. He has forgotten the exact time the encounter happened and to the best of his knowledge he thinks it was about Nov. 1978 but is possible could be a few years off. He happened to be working in a cotton gin in a town called Arvana, Texas just NE of Lamesa, Texas.  He remembers being out one evening in the field driving a truck when off to the horizon coming to him drifting over the trees was a spinning disk object with lights around. He got really spooked and took off fast across the field bouncing around until he got to the cotton gin. He jump out of the truck with the truck still rolling and went in and told his boss and others and they all came out and saw the spinning craft drift to the side of the gin across Hwy 87. People where really spooked at this site and some went back inside. Also people in their cars on the hwy stopped and people got out of their cars and where looking at this low spinning disk. It was about 500 Ft high with spinning lights all around...yellow, red, and blue. Then it slowly began to pull up and then a bright beam of light shot down from the center as it moved up. My step father then said the cotton gin&apos;s power and the machinery inside then just died off and shut down. Then the craft pulled up higher and the white beam of light turned off and then it shot upward like a bullet till it was out of sight. The power at the cotton gin then came back on. He tells me of another story that happened around Odessa and Andrews, Texas. He had heard of a farmer who would see this craft on a regular bases follow the power lines toward the mountains from west Texas toward the New Mexico but his memory of the story and the details are almost gone. He had heard one farmer saw this craft and reported it and the police came out. They did not believe this farmer. He said even some military folks where there but they really doubted the farmers story. Just then a rancher driving to his ranch stopped by to see what all the commotion was about. After they told him he said oh yea...he would see the the craft ride above the power lines toward the mountains ( in New Mexico??) all the time. I talked to some other people I personally know and they also claim to have seen a spinning craft follow low and close behind them one evening as they where between Sweetwater and Abilene, Texas on Interstate 20 back in the 80&apos;s so maybe there is or was a craft  that hung around west Texas in the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Myself my good friend ryan and my girlfriend were walking along the beach when we saw a light over the ocean in the distance At first we thought it was a very bright star, but then another smaller light emerged from underneath it and then a second. For about 30 seconds the two smaller lights seemed to be slowly moving in a figure eight pattern then proceeded to move down to what looked like the surface of the ocean. They moved back and forth across the water and the slowly made their way back up to the original ball of light moving in figure eight pattern the whole time then one by one they merged into the original light which then began to slowly rise for maybe 20 seconds and then seemed to shoot up silently into space in the blink of an eye.

A little background information: me and a former friend of mine went to Lincoln to do some work for a few weeks and we stopped by the apartment of a girl I was fooling around with. (She lived a few blocks east of the capital building, a huge art deco skyscraper.)  Come midnight, the lights went down on the Capital and we sat out on her porch gazing up at the sky. I noticed a couple of points of light moving slowly across the sky towards each other (as airplanes would if they aimed for each other) except that the lights approached each other and danced around each other and sped away, like a satellite using gravity as a slingshot. They did this dance for a while, this happened for about ten or fifteen mintues, the lights would fade in intensity and suddenly brighten (although this change in luminosity seemed to be a separate phenomenon from the speed of the &quot;craft.&quot;) For about 15 minutes we observed 2, sometimes three lights (although one light would always be fainter in this case) doing an impossible tango in the sky. My buddy thought it was fighter jets, and my former girl mentioned that the lights were well above the feathery cirrus clouds, and I&apos;m pretty sure commercial aircraft don&apos;t fly that high. One guess of mine is that the lights were caused by craft skimming on the edge of the atmosphere (hte bright bursts of light caused much in the same way as the splashes caused by a water skier bouncing on the surface of the ocean.) Also the lights would travel below the skyline of Lincoln to almost directly overhead within seconds. We could not hear any engines of jets. We debated this for probably 15 minutes before the lights faded off. As we were about to go inside I spotted a light again. (It was moving parallel to the power lines above where we sat.)  Suddenly the light brightened, and forked apart into seven or eight lights which for about two seconds moved in tandem with each other (horizontally?) before they began to swarm around and forward (like the flying machines moving en masse in the Matrix 3 or the meteors at the end of Contact moving in one direction) and shot up into the sky. (I called Lincoln 911 afterwards, feeling rather foolish when the woman who answered laughed at me.)  Even now I can believe what I saw; yet I can&apos;t. I am a skeptic through and through (I do not believe in the spiritual, I trust in science) and for me to see something with my own two eyes that not only defies the current laws of physics (or maybe it doesn&apos;t, not my field of expertise); for me to actually get a fundamental answer to the question of are we alone was something I never expected. I figured I&apos;d die without answers to anything (or at least the big questions.)  Earlier today, a few of my friends and I got to talking UFOs and someone said I should document what I saw so . . .

I was amazed as they passed over head the craft were brightly lit, and the light seemed to move around them in a sign-wave pattern like you might see on a oscilloscope or frequency generator, and they were all at the same frequency. I am a pilot and licensed mechanic with a strong background in engineering and design, I have been viewing aircraft for thirty years  I have never seen anything quite like this I had my camera and was able to get a couple of photos, these craft were faster than normal aircraft I only had time to point and shoot, I think it is very notable that this sighting had taken place on a day with heavy (chem-trail) spraying?

After a period of about a minute or so, it became smaller and smaller until it completely disappeared.

He called for help on the CB, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know where I am.&quot;  His wife responded on the CB that he was out at the back gate in the east pasture.  Again he said he didn&rsquo;t know where he was. Others heard him on the CB and told him to turn on his lights. He did, only now he was in the west pasture a half mile from the gate and where he had seen the lights. How did you get there his wife asked? I dont know, he replied. The two pastures, one east and one west, are separated by a deep tree filled hollow running north to south almost the entire length of the property. According to the witness&rsquo; wife, he could not get from one side of the property to the other without passing the house or going through the hollow. If he had passed the house she would have would have seen and heard him, which she hadn&rsquo;t. And going through the thick tree filled hollow in a truck would be impossible. The CBers who had been hearing this recounted that they had heard him say that the truck was spinning and there was a great deal of intererence on the radio. Concerned, they went to the house to see if they could help. When they arrived the witness had managed to drive back to the house and seemed less disoriented. The CBers drove out to the pasture and found only one set of truck tracks. They then walked the field to see if they could see any broken trees in the hollow which they didn&rsquo;t.  They also examined the witness for head trauma which he did not have. The sheriff was called and a report filed. After the incident the witness reported that his alternator and voltage regulator had stopped working. He also stated that his watch had lost 12 minutes of time.

We stopped the car and viewed it.  No sound was heard. At 10:50PM it is still present in the same location.  This is the second time I have witnessed a triangular vehicle hovering over the Quad Cities region. Two summers ago, at 3:00 AM I witnessed the same shape hovering north of my home over interstate 74 directly over Bettendorf.  This vehicle was much closer to the ground and easily defined as a black triangular object with multiple colored lights and much closer to the ground.  There was no sound. I would guess the size to be about that of a football field.  It is difficult for me to estimate the distance from the ground. I would not say it was fearfully close but close enough that one could distinguish the colors of its lights which were multi colored and discern the triangular shape of the object supporting the lights. With regard to what we are witnessing this evening, given the distance of the sighting I have to state that this object has to be significantly larger than the one viewed two years ago. IF that is possible! It is presently far enough away and high enough in the sky that one cannot determine what supports the lights. The shape is defined by the pattern of the lights only and no difference in color of the lights is able to be distinguished. All lights appear white to my grandson and greenish white to my eyes. At 11:30 PM the object is still in the sky but has changed location moving North West. I would estimate its distance is approximately seven to ten miles south of my home and the height in the sky has to be considerably higher than the sighting two years ago because it is easily seen above heavy timbered hills in front of my home. I did take a video but the image recorded on tape does not represent what both of us view with our eyes which is a triangle.  On the video perhaps due to hand shake (VERY cold here) it appears as a bright white ball that moves and changes shape.  I shot it between the branches of trees in front of my home this is not the first location that we noticed it from however. There will be two sections of video the first is 9:45 then a break in recording followed by the fatal attempt to zoom in on it with night shot. I was freezing cold and the hand shake makes it appear like a white ball bouncing around the screen. I did zoom back and shot through the same trees as the first video so you could see the movement relationship to its location between 9:45 and 11:30. Unfortunately the video does not reflect what we see viewing this object. It is definitely a clearly defined triangle when viewed by the human eye. If you want to see the video I will be happy to mail it to you for what it is worth. Perhaps you may find some value in it. I am disappointed as it does not clearly reference the shape we both concede is a triangle.", " ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of International Space Station.  PD))White light lower than aircraft slowly moving across skyI left messages with 2 different TV meterologists who have not returned my calls. About an hour ago right before it got totally dark, I saw a light go to the southwest from where I am in East Texas. It looked like a spot light from a helicopter or something. But it was too high to be a helicopter. The speed was steady and not too fast. It just caught my eye and I followed it for about a minute before it went over the tree line. I could see planes very high in the air and of course stars. But this was a bright white light. No red lights. No flashing. I was outside by myself and then my girlfriend came out and I was telling her about it. Then within about 10 minutes, we both saw in the same general area, a bright white light. It did not move. And then it faded. I was pretty big. It did not streak. It did not blink. It just went out or if anything, it&apos;s like it went up. I was much lower than the airpalnes flying at night, which I could see them. I don&apos;t know if I believe in UFOs. I always sort of believed in them. But this was not an airplane, helicopter, or anything man made. It was not a meteor. It was kind of like the international space station flying over, but this was pretty low. Any ideas? Did I just see a freaking UFO?((CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))Thanks for the note, ((name deleted)), and thank you for the report!

As i was watching i saw a large object that was shaped like an octagon, but taller than it was wide.  The top and bottom were a dark reddish-orange color and the middle was a wide  rectangle of white light.  The object was quite noticable because it was just over the tops of the trees.  I saw the object move from way back towards the mountain to almost right above me, giving me an excellent look at it.  I took several looks around my apartment to see if it was some kind of reflection.  It was not.  I observed the object for several minutes, getting a breath taking view, when a large flash of lightning lit up the sky behind it.  The sighting lasted only a few more minutes, before the object hovered left some and then right some and was gone.  This sighting made me feel strongly   enough that the next day i had to draw and color what i had seen, so that i could see it again.", "Looked like a satellite moving overhead  but a smaller object shot out from its 6 o clock position.Looked like a traditional satellite moving overhead, around 7:15 pm EST,  but a smaller light was seen shooting out of this.

It happened very fast, and it was even luminous against the very bright bridge lights. It was unmistakable. No one in the area semeed to have seen it, so I forgot about it. That was until I saw that others in NY had seen it too. I think it may have been shooting towards Fort Wadsworth, where there has been UFO sightings before. I feel that whole area under Fort Wadsworth is hollow, going back to the 1700&apos;s; and DoD, Army, Coast Guard etc all have bases there. I think these orbs are energy fields, enabling these crafts to cheat normal physics. I wanted others to know what they saw was real.", "Sighting In FloridaI&apos;ve never told anyone about this, mainly because of the circumstances, and the only other one that knows is the person I was with. Anyway, I was a sophomore in high school and I was with my girlfriend and I obviously didn&apos;t have a car, and we wanted to make out. We lived within a block of one another and two blocks down the street was a small playground, so we would go down there because there were no lights, so it was extremely dark, except when the moon was out, which it wasn&apos;t this night or we wouldn&apos;t have went. there was a small merry-go-round I think it&apos;s called. and we would sit on it and kiss and stuff. We were going at it when all of a sudden there was all this light coming from above us. It looked like this thing was right above the tree tops (there were alot of trees there), and it was weird, because you could see this thing, it was round and had different colored lights going around on the bottom with one big white round light in the middle, but what was weird about it was it was blowing the treetops apart so it could see us, but it didn&apos;t make a sound. You would think the trees would have a rustling sound or something, but there was no noise at all, I&apos;ll never forget it. It scared the hell out of us and we ran. There was a small three hole practice golf course across the road where people took golf lessons and perpendiculur to that a small canal that had a small bridge. We ran for our lives because we were so scared and when we ran, this &quot;thing&quot; followed us so I told my girlfriend to run towards the bridge and I was going to run across the golf course unless it followed her, then I was going to follow her to. Then when we split up this thing stopped, like it was confused and didn&apos;t know which way to go and I was looking over my shoulder and saw this and I stopped and then it just zipped away in the opposite direction like some kind of cartoon or something and I yelled at my girlfriend who was still running and she turned around and stopped and then turned back towards me an! d we reu nited and was walking home not really knowing what to say, but we agreed not to say anything because we figured everyone would think we were nuts, because back then this kind of thing was sort of unheard of, not like today, but most importantly because of what we were doing there, we didn&apos;t want to get in trouble. So, that&apos;s it. One thing I would like to add. I was watching a show about ufos on tv and I saw this story about these police officers chasing a ufo in I think it was Ohio and they showed and gave a description of the ufo that they saw, and I think that was the one where it was round with multi-colored lights. If I have the right one, I really can&apos;t remember (the one on tv), but that is exactly what we saw, exactly. It was eerie watching it, because it happened so long ago it seemed unreal until I saw the ufo special on tv. Anyway, that&apos;s my story, and I&apos;d really rather not name names and stuff cause a.) I don&apos;t want anyone thinking I&apos;m crazy, I don&apos;t really believe in anything, unless there&apos;s some kind of proof and even though I know what I saw, I still don&apos;t know what to think about it, and b.)my girlfriend back then, it&apos;s up to her to tell if she wants, personally I can understand if she doesn&apos;t. There&apos;s a reason I never told anyone about it and it&apos;s because no one would probably believe me.", "Silent low-flying upright symmetrical disc shaped craft rotating like a wheel moved slowly over town of Clarion and continued ENEIn 2001 I was a student at Clarion University in Clarion, PA. As I returned from work late one evening, I saw a UFO as I was standing in the Freshman parking lot. This parking lot is over a hill and out of sight (or shouting distance) from the rest of campus. I was the only person in the vicinity at the time. What follows is my best remembrance of the event. I saw a vertical disc shaped object (symmetrically rounded on both sides). It was smooth and dark colored and had dim lights on the rim. It seemed to be moving by rotating slowly like an upright wheel. It was almost totally silent although there seemed to be a very slight humming noise. It was very low in the air, seemingly only a few hundred yards above my head, and so I could see it&apos;s outline quite clearly although the object itself was very dark and only dimly lit. It appeared quite large to me although I had nothing to judge it&apos;s size against and I could not tell for certain how far above me it was. It came from the direction of the town of Clarion and and it eventually passed out of sight as it continued ENE over the woods (state game lands 74).

The object was above this layer and I attribute its hazy appearance to that fact.  The light moved rapidly from a higher to lower altitude and seemed to follow a trajectory that made an angle of about 30 degrees with the ground.  From my vantage point at approximately 1250 feet in elevation, it appeared that the object was about 5 miles, or so, distant, and located over the Redstone Arsenal.  The object covered a large arc of sky in the very short time in which I viewed it. The object gave the impression it would impact the ground somwhere south of my location.  I can see about 40 miles due to my mountain-top location.  I waited for several minutes for a sign of impact, but saw none.  The Alabama counties in which an impact could have taken place are Morgan and Marshall.  No sound from the object was audible. I had attributed my sighting to a meteor, until a local newspaper ran an article about a similar sounding object that was seen a day later at a much earlier time (11/28/06 at 17:28). Search lights, flares, rockets, missiles, and aitcraft are unlikely explanations for this object.  Humidity in the air would make search light beams visible and the shape of the spot on the clouds would have changed due to the angle of the light source.  The object maintained constant shape.  The apparent altitude and angle of sky covered would likely indicate supersonic velocity and probably a sonic boom, especially if the object had to avaoid collision with the ground.  The sudden appearance and disappearance of the object, and its constant luminance would also help rule out the other possibilities I mentioned.", "Circular disk blinking very brightly with a bluish tint sighted next to I-15 just north of Scipio, UTMy friend and I were traveling North on I-15 somewhere between Scipio and Nephi when we say a very bright blinking light with a bluish tint to it. The light was approximately 50 feet in the air, just to the left of the side of the oncoming traffic, and was stationary. As we approached the object I could see that it was a circular disk and that it had a light running around the circumference of the disk, about halfway between the center and the exterior of the disk. This light in some places had both blue and green colors in different locations. After we passed the object I continued to watch it in my rear view mirror until it was out of sight. As we were approaching and leaving the object it would separate into two and sometimes three objects.  The separated objects would also blink in unison with each other.  After only about a second at the most these separated objects would then instantaneously combine back into one object again. As soon as that one was gone we both sighted another object similar to the last one, only this object was much higher in to sky and we were unable to see much detail.

About a mile after leaving Walnut Grove, I noticed what looked like car headlights hovering above a hill to my left, about a mile away.  i ignored it, thinking it was a rescue chopper or something else that could just hover there.  after a couple of minutes, i looked at the hill again.  the lights were still in the exact same place as before, so curiosity got the better of me and i took the next road to my left and pulled over into a field, which put me a little over a quarter mile away from the hill the craft was hovering over.  I stopped my truck, rolled down the window and sat in the window sill, as my drivers door does not open. i watched the craft move from the hill toward the highway, flying at a height of about 150 feet.  at this point it was 100 yards in front of me.  with my truck off, and my music off, all i heard was cows.  this thing flew 150 feet from the ground and didnt make a sound.  in addition to the &quot;headlights&quot;, which were closer to the &quot;wing&quot; are than the front, there was a red light on top of the thing.   the craft was shaped more like a space shuttle than a jet or stealth bomber or anythin else that i had seen or have seen since trying to find out what it was.  all the lights were stationary, they didnt flash, and didnt move.  after it flew almost to the high way, the craft turned &quot;on a dime&quot; and headed straight for my truck.  i took a picture of it on my phone as it came toward me, unfortunately the video i tried to take got messed up somehow in the excitement.  even as it flew directly above my truck, the craft made no sound.  after it got about another 100 yards away from me in the opposite direction, i hopped back down into the truck and took off again, intending to follow it and find out what it was.  it took me maybe 20 seconds to get back out on the high way, right where it wouldve been flying over, but it had disappeared.  i drove around for 30 minutes looking for it and found ! not a sign.", "Big bright object over winfield had spinning lights sat in one spot for 5 seconds  then  took off faster then anything i have ever seenI am night security in kelowna I work on westside road i look directly across the okanagan lake at winfield which would be just over the hill.It was cloudy out that night so i cant tell you the exact shape but i think it was like a disk it was very bright kind of came out of nowhere stayed in one spot for about 5-6 second then took off to the left so fast it left a white streak like a jet but way faster and from a stand still.

Someone in our group said to look up. I looked up and saw a silver metallic disc in the southwest sky of our location. This object was zigzagging at such a fast rate. It was such an abnormal flight pattern. My first thought was that it was possibly a kite. So I looked down to see if anyone had a string below. After not seeing anyone below, I looked up again and continued to see this object zigzag. The best way I can think of describing what I saw is to compare it to someone holding a mirror or metal object, and then reflecting the sun off of it. The event lasted about 45 seconds. The metallic disc then just took off up and out of sight. There were no lights on it; no bulb; no haze; or any other crafts with it. I went home and expected to see something on the news about it. No such luck. Being that I was a juvenile at the time, I didn&apos;t really give it too much thought. I figured there had to be a rational explanation to what we had all seen. Then I figured, it couldn&apos;t be from outer space because UFO&apos;S were always depicted to hover, have lights and land. Not be visible in Chicago of all places.

It was approximately late morning.  The student who was about 9 years-old noticed it first.  She asked me what that thing was in the sky and I had no clue!  Here it was broad daylight and this object was hurtling through the clear blue sky.  It looked like some sort of cylinder with a sort of handle projecting out from it.  The handle appeared to be rotating.  We both thought it looked like it was jump roping.  That was how the movement would be described.  I don&apos;t remember it having any lights but it was going extremely fast.  It was too high up to get a better idea of the exact shape.  I was just struck by how odd the movement was.

I rolled the can to the curb and started to turn around, when something caught my eye at the top of our street about 50-75 feet away. The object was a small silver ball about the size of a mini basket ball.  It appeared to be hovering about 1 to 2 feet off the ground from the angle I was looking at it. The first thing that came to mind was that I was seeing stuff. As I had just woke up for work about 45 min ago. I just sat there looking at it for about 30-40 seconds or so trying to refocus on it thinking that my eyes were playing tricks on me. Soon I thought what the hell is that, and started walking up the street.  As I was walking up the street I thought that it could be a small Mylar balloon.  But then I thought that a balloon would be moving and this thing was sitting still. As I got about 30 or so feet from it.  It shot strait up so fast that it looked like it was fired out of a gun. It went out of sight with in 1-2 seconds.  It never made any noise, and had no lights; it was just a metallic ball. It really kind a freaked me out. This is the first time that I have ever seen something that I could not explain.  I am still kind of confused. I am dead set that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.

I was laying on our bed in master-bedroom just gazing at the stars as it was a still/quite night.  We have a sliding door from the bedroom and the kitchen area leading out to patio.  I noticed a bright white, round object.  What made me aware/alert that it was not a star was that it was Number 1:  Making itself WINK in and OUT.  2:  It made itself GROW LARGE &amp; then GROW SMALL again repeatedly.  This went on for awhile.  3:  I decided to call a close friend of mine that I had worked with in the Aerospace Industry locally years ago to come over and see what I was witnessing.  So she came over with one of her brothers to see the object.  We went into the Kitchen and started to watch the object from the sliding glass door inside the house in the kitchen area as it was cold outside.  We witnessed the object continue to WINK IN AND OUT and Change Size.  Then we watched it do MANUEVERS at HIGH SPEEDS across the Sky then stop and then REVERT BACK to the original area it first was seen.  We got excited.  We also saw a Small Commerical Airplane in the area and that Airplane took off as fast as it could when it saw the OBJECT we was seeing.  It got the heck out of the area as fast as it could.  We all laughed together because we all thought gee we are glad we ain&apos;t up there with that strange object in the sky.  My friends brother however after awhile he was in denial of what we was seeing so he made excused by saying it had to be someone pointing a flashlight in the sky playing tricks outside.  I never bought into that theory as you would have to be an idiot not to realize the object we saw a flashlight could not perform that kind of manuever nor that high up in the sky as well as blink in and out and disapear from the naked eye and then reappear. The next night I decided to borrow my friends husbands Binoculiars to view the sky and see if the object would reappear.  This time it was ANOTHER object far up into the sky it was Triangle Shape in size with Three round objects underneath on each point of the craft.  It was stationary.  I placed a call this time to Nasa up in Palo Alto/Sunnyvale area in the Bay Area.  A lady got me in touch with a well-known Scientist, book author who studied this type of stuff.  He was a member of Mufon he and his partner came and interviewed, video-taped me.

I had to smoke a cigarette, so I went to the balcony.  It was november in texas, so the wind was blowing pretty hard.  My balcony faces a large open area where the appartment swimming pool is located.  As I was lighting my cigarette, I noticed something coming from over the building on my right.  It was only about three or four feet wide and rectangular, almost a perfect square.  It had a dull red appearance. It moved by me pretty fast only about twenty or so feet in front of me.  It looked like it came from over the building, it dipped down in front of me, and started rising pretty fast.  Normally, on a windy texas night i wouldn&apos;t have thought much about that, but it moved in a straight line, and was definately three dimensional.  As i mentioned before, it was moving pretty fast and flew by me as i was lighting my cig.  I kept watching it and it changed direction and started going skyward, again it was moving in a completly straight line.  Only once it got some altitude and some distance did it start to get a white glow to it, and i was able to follow it in the sky for quite awhile, definatly longer than i should have for an object of that size.  By this time i was trying to figure out what in Heavens name this thing was.  It couldn&apos;t have been paper, since in the wind paper wouldn&apos;t have kept its shape, and plus it was a complete square.  It couldn&apos;t have been a box, since the wind wasn&apos;t THAT strong, and again it would have been knocked around instead of moving in a straight line.  Plus, boxes don&apos;t glow.  As i mentioned before, i followed it for quite awhile, i smoked the majority of my cigarette watching it, and then it just dissappeared.  I noticed a plane was in the sky on an intercept course to the object, and when it dissapeared, the plane changed course.

My camera was set to 10.2mp quality, 1/250 shutter speed. We had just finished lunch and I went to the SW corner of the building to take a few photos of the lake and surrounding mountains. I didn&apos;t notice anything unusual going on at the time I took the photo. It was when I got home while looking at the photos I took earlier in the day that I noticed a spec in sky at the far left edge of the photo in question, which was located just above the water line.

When I push the photo past FULL SCALE 3x, and even though the photo is somewhat pixilated at that scale, the object is very unusual indeed. This may sound strange but to be perfectly honest with you, I think it takes on the characteristics of one of our lunar landing modules. That&apos;s what it reminds me of anyway. Para-sailing (sp?) is a popular sport in SLT, but not in November, and besides, there are no boats below or within in a reasonable distance from the object. There is one moving boat way off to the right of the object but it is going in the wrong direction (looking at the boat water trail) to be pulling that object. I kind of ruled out a helicopter as the photo was taken at 1/250 of a second and there seems to be no rotor blur above the object. Not even the slightest discoloration shadow of rotor can be noticed. And, for sure, this object does not have a fixed wing set. I am absolutely baffled by this object in the sky, no apparent wings and no apparent rotor set and certainly does not appear to be in tow.

I saw that russion satelite enter the atmosphere, back in the late 80&apos;s and this didn&apos;t look like that. it was not a shooting star, for they happen in just a streak and its over. and it appeared that it was not that high up, like in space...more like the altitude of private planes.", "long white line like shooting star but slow and thicker and same shape viewed from kirkcaldy scotlandlook like a long white line almost like airplane drag but kept same shape it was in the sky for 1hr in the same area but it was going from left to right then right to left as if it was circling at quite a slow speed we stopped watching it when the sun got in the way have image on video camera", "Circular spinning objectThree students in a rural area reported seeing an object which was circular in shape with rotating lights around the edge, yellow center with darker color in very center.

I continued to watch the area thinking it was just a plane or possibly the final glint from an Iridium flare, after four or five seconds another flash occurred in exactly the same spot. No other lights were visible near that point of light.

At about the same time as I noticed the jet coming from the South a fuzzy, red pulsating light appeared in the SSW slightly lower in the sky than the first event I described above. After a few seconds it was apparent that this red light was moving in my general direction and that it would pass directly overhead and that it would also intersect the path of the northbound jet, although at a much higher altitude. Careful scrutiny of the silent, rapidly approaching red light revealed absolutely no other lights on this craft. The light itself appeared somewhat fuzzy, with the apparent size of a pea held at arms length, it had a central hotspot that seemed very slightly less red than the overall area of red light. It appeared to pulsate between bright and dim about once a second, never actually going black between pulses.The night was practically silent, no traffic no, ambient noise. The only sounds were the barely discernable engine noise from the faraway jet and the occasional rustling of leaves.As I said the red light was headed in my general direction, moving from the SSW to the NNE and from my perspective it appeared that it was going to pass through the very same spot in the sky as the light flashes noted above. At the point when it did reach that spot, and coincidently high above the northbound jet this red light suddenly changed direction. It&rsquo;s hard to describe, but essentially, one second it&rsquo;s on a path that will bring it directly overhead and the next it&rsquo;s moving parallel to the northbound jet, although higher and to the right of the plane.

I would willingly testify under oath that the following information is true, correct and complete:  At approximately 3am CST, while driving Eastbound on Interstate 70, at approximately milepost 129 (within the jurisdiction of Trego County, Kansas), an object which I can best describe as two spheres about 20 feet or so in diameter, connected to each other by some type of rectangular device, dimensions unknown.  The object had no discernable color, and my high beam headlights seemed to partially become obsorbed by the craft and part of the white headlight field simply illuminated the object. From my very brief encounter, all told about 6 seconds, I could also not visualize any portholes, antennas, doors or other openings or protrusions.  My bearing to the craft I am estimating to be 35 feet AGL (above ground level) and about 35 to 50 feet horizontally from my vehicle.  My angle of view out of the windshild was between 30 and 45 degrees upon initial visual contact and, of course, became markedly closer, as I estimate our closing speed to be around 175 mph...I was driving 75 mph and I believe the craft to be crusing at around 100 mph (this is a purely conjectural guess on my part). Please note that the very first thing I did was to telephone the McConnell AFB Command Post (located in Wichita, KS), and inquire as to any Military air traffic of any kind in this area, such as Medivac flights, other Helos or fixed wing aircraft of any sort in the known military inventory.  The Airman I spoke to at the Command Post also volunteered that no Civilian Air Traffic was aloft at that time, at my location, either.  I also spoke with a Sgt.**** at the Trego County Kansas Sheriff&apos;s department, who checked the comm traffic logs from that time and found no other reports.  He WAS, however, very interested, and did not believe I was anything but honest, truthful and forthcoming. My background is varied.  I worked for one year as a NASA contractor, on the CCMS program (Checkout, Control and Monitoring Subsystems) in the very early 80&apos;s, for the Space Shuttle Mobile Launch Pad, where we designed and tested cutting edge electronics for the Mobile Launch Pad...equipment which handled all data from the Orbiter and Astronauts, and sent that data to both Mission Control and to the Firing Room at the Cape. I assisted in some elementary designs, and built, along with the other Techs in the lab, the initial prototypes of all the equipment for CCMS, and then, working with the design Engineer, debugged the equipment and finally produced wiring and assembly lists of instructions for the production department.  Note that a good deal of our Prototype Equipment went into use  without building other production models.  My last assignment was to completely revise the &quot;Approved Parts List&quot;, actually consisting of two seperate released engineering documments...one containing all mechanical hardware (such as nuts, bolts, etc) and the other containing all electronic parts approved for use in the program.  These docs went to all NASA facilities working with CCMS/Orbiter projects, and finally to other contractors and subcontractors. EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE Note that I have an Electronics background, first as an Electronics Technician,  and then later migrating to Field Service/Engineering for a large electronics firm, working in both the US and Canada. I am also an Amateur (Ham) radio operator and I am an Ordained Minister possessing a Doctor of Divinity Degree. I am also a &quot;backyard&quot; astronomy buff.

My first sighting is dated to 11/01/01 (reported here on this sight) and involved six spheres traveling over our heads in an off-set V formation, heading East (slightly South) direction.  Now these were a visual I cannot get out of my head.  They flew over my house approx. at 10:15pm with 2 witnesses. You could see the moon and clouds reflecting in each one of the spheres as they passed under and toward the (full-ish) moon, which gave off a pinkish/white color.  They had scattered lines all around each of them (like a ball of yarn) and no sounds.  I watched these fly away from us and then vanish as soon as they flew out from under the low cloud formation.  Size and distance I judged with...if you took a quarter and held it up above your head.  Very thought provoking sighting.My second sighting was on Tuesday 10/23/06 where on my same back deck around 8:30 pm, I viewed a light in the sky the was stationary, blinked bright white for three seconds, then went dark for 5 seconds, and then repeated this three times.  On the third time it went dark, it seemed to fade out.  Now I know what I saw wasn&apos;t a plane, or helocopter, star blinking, meteor, flare....etc.  It was interesting enough to watch for it again, but never saw it repeat.Now my third, which happened on Friday night/Saturday morning at 12:40am made my heart jump into my throat, and beat five time faster.  I viewed a single craft of the triangle nature slicing through the low clouds, right over my head. This craft was in what I would call &apos;stealth-mode&apos; because you could not see the craft, but I could see the clouds rolling past the sides, and stearing the clouds behind it.  It traveled from the North, heading South very slowly, then banked toward the West after it passed over. I could not see it after that. Personally, I was frozen with fear for about 20 seconds before I went inside.  It took me 2 hours to fall asleep that night, and I can still see it in my head.  I really believe I live in a &apos;pathway&apos; or &apos;hot-spot&apos; for these things and will keep on watching for them.

She made a joke about the fact that it looked like a jet intercepting some kind of UFO. I brushed her comments off at first, assuming she just saw jets or something typical of the Seattle area. About 10-15 minutes later, after she had arrived, I was looking outside in my backyard and saw the exact same type of objects she saw. There were several of these high altitude objects in the sky over the next 20 minutes or so. Some looked like jets, but a few did not. I&apos;m no expert here, so for all I know these could be extremely high jets or it could just be a NORAD exercise or something, but someone said I should post it here so I did.

It was much lower than a large passenger plane or blimp. No sound was heard. It was low enough that I should have been able to see wings, tail and windows but I saw nothing. The sun was shining directly on the object. It saw it twice in June, each time it was around 7:30 (19:30 hrs). It was in view each time about 30 seconds. The direction of travel was SW to NE. There was no way to tell how big it was except that it appeared to be about a half an inch at arms length. We have one airport, Regional. The runway does not accomodate large planes. Planes traveling across Missouri are always at a higher altitude than this object was. Small 2 or 4 seater planes fly over at a lower altitude and it is always easy to see detail such as wings, tail and registration numbers. The engine noise is audible as well.  I saw this object again on July 4th, 2006. See that report on NUFORC website. I have no idea what I saw nor can I guess. I just offer this report up as another oddity of this haunted planet.

I grew up near an airforce base so I have seen some fast aircraft. (even the stealth bomber when it was still secret).  This seemed to be huge because of the altitude it seemed to be traveling.  Mostly what I saw was an outline, like a shadow moving across the sky.  It was too uniform to be a cloud in a jet stream like one of my friends suggested.  It moved approximately south from one side of the sky to another and dissapeared.

This glow appeared to create the light trail behind. The light trail was more like a whispy mist effect like you see when the suns rays penetrate trees in a forest.

The Object was spotted at 5:00 in the morning from our bedroom window (sliding glass door) when I woke-up and noticed the object was 1st Stationary, 2nd began to slowly descend STRAIGHT DOWN.  I could not longer see it as our Tall backyard Trees caused me to loose view of the Object.  At that moment I noticed the neighbors backyard lights start to FLICKER OFF AND ON.  Then I ran down the hall to the Kitchen to see if I could get a view of the object.  But it was not in view any longer.  However, at that moment I also noticed the other neighbors home from our Kitchen View Window their lights began to FLICKER OFF AND ON.

Hollister Free-Lance Newspaper Small Quake Rattles Hollister-  Thursday, November 30, 2006 Hollister - Hollister residents received a jolt Wednesday afternoon when a mostly harmless 4.0 earthquake struck the county, followed by two smaller quakes. &quot;Of course, in San Benito County you get so many earthquakes,&quot; said Steve Walter, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. &quot;But this one was a little unusual.&quot;  The quake struck at 1:20pm, with its epicenter located near the intersection of Freitas and Mitchell roads, roughly three miles west of Hollister and five miles east of San Juan Bautista. It was ranked as a 4.0 or &quot;light&quot; earthquake on the Richter scale, with a 1.0 being a microquake and a 10 being a quake of awesome force. The quake originated 1.9 miles below the surface of the earth.  This was followed by a microquake ranking 2.8 at 1:38pm. A third, even smaller microquake may have occurred afterward but was not confirmed by the USGS by press time.  Neither the Hollister Police Department or San Benito County Sheriff&apos;s Department received any calls reporting damage.  The quake was unusual for two reasons, said. San Benito County quakes most often originate from the San Andreas Fault area, or the Calaveras Fault. This one took place from a point between the two and cannot be confirmed to have originated from either.   It was the first 4.0 or greater quake to have occurred in the area between the faults since at least 2000, according to the USGS.  Also, most local earthquakes are characterized by horizontal motion, as the earth&apos;s plates move past one another. This quake, however, moved in a vertical fashion.  &quot;There were elements of horizontal motion, but most of it was vertical, and that&apos;s rare (in the area),&quot; said.  The quake could have been felt as far north as Pleasanton and as far south as Monterey, said. One quake report on the USGS Web site came from San Diego, but said it was highly unlikely.  &quot;Sometimes people hear there was an earthquake and think, &apos;Oh, that was what I felt,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;When usually it&apos;s just something like a truck going by.&quot;", "Golden orange quarter moon shaped-object hovers at tree line for ten minutes before developing an orb and disappearing in Sanford, NC.At approximately 10:05 pm my husband and I observed a quarter-moon shaped, golden object at the tree line due west from the front porch of our home. The object was shaped so much like the moon and was so close in size, too, that at first we thought it was just some sort of atmospheric condition causing an odd colored moon. It was sunset colored &quot;golden orange.&quot; Then we realized that not only was the sky perfectly clear (we could see all of the stars; no clouds), but this &quot;moon&quot; was in the wrong position in the sky; it is always above the tree line and to the east at that time of night. We immediately began watching the object, discussing what it could be. Over the course of 2-3 minutes, we both noted that the object began twinkling on the lower side, almost like some object lit with Christmas lights. The thought that it could be some sort of Christmas decoration entered our discussion, but our location is in the country in a wooded, secluded area; we cannot see any other houses from our home, and this object was not in a direction where any houses exist. Over the next few minutes, the entire object began dimming so that it was hard to see through the trees. It was almost as if clouds were passing over it and blocking it from view, even though there were no clouds anywhere; something seemed to be obstructing our view, and the object itself seemed to be changing positions. We changed positions, trying to keep an eye on the object. It developed an orangey-red, fire colored orb over its top center area, and the entire object grew brighter momentarily. We almost called 911. We thought maybe there was a large fire in the woods. However, before we could do anything, the body of the object dimmed again. Over the next few minutes the orb grew smaller and smaller as if moving away from us. Then it just disappeared completely from sight. There was a beeping sound that we noticed as soon as we&rsquo;d gone outdoors, and this sound continued after the object disappeared. The beeping repetition and sound was similar to that of a house fire alarm, but it sounded, then paused for a few seconds, then sounded again, over and over. We&rsquo;d never noticed that sound before the incident, and it stopped after a few hours. We&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s related or not, but since we both heard it, I thought we should mention it.

We also accomplish the engine run-up testing needed. So I hope that does something for establishing a little of credibility for my report. I am still in absolute wonder and amazement at what I saw that afternoon. Around 1630 a pilot made a comment on the radio about a circle or disc shapped object hovering over gate C-17 at the C concourse in Chicago. At frist we laughed to each other and then the same pilot said again on the radio that is was about 700feet agl (above ground level). The day was overcast with the ceiling being reported at 1600 feet if I remember correctly. I was taxing a Boeing 777 from the Intl Terminal to the Company Hanger on the North side of the Airport. As we passed the C Terminal on the Alpha taxiway we observed a dark gray hazy round object hovering over OHare Intl Airport. Is was definately over the C Terminal. It was holding very steady and appeared to be trying to stay close to the cloud cover. The radio irrupted with chatter about the object and the ATC controler that was handling ground traffic made a few smart comments about the alleged UFO siting above the C terminal. We had to contiune moving the aircraft to the hangar. After parking I noticed the craft of no longer there but there was an almost perfect circle in the cloud layer were the craft had been. The hole disappeared a few minutes later. For the rest of the night there were jokes made on the radio about the siting.((NUFORC Note:  This individual was interviewed, at length, by one of the investigators involved in the follow-up investigation.

At about 8:30 pm, appx, I was in the area of US 60 and Jomax Rd. There, there was a racetrack off to the west side of US 60. Above the lights of the facility, though probably a mile or two beyond, I observed &quot;dancing&quot; lights, which seemed to move up and down. This motion resembled lightning initially, though the sky was absolutely clear. Then, at the top of the &quot;dancing&quot; lights, 9 horizontal lights appeared, then 9 more lights appeared just to the right of those. The width of these horizontal lights were about as wide as a full moon. After 30 seconds or so, they disappeared, and I did not think too much about them, just appeared to be something odd, but distant. Then, a few minutes later, and a few miles further up US60, the horizontal lights re-appeared on the west side of the Highway. Again, they seemed fairly far away, probably 1-2 miles. This time, however, the horizontal lights would blink from left to right, in rapid succession (one at a time). After all 9 lights blinked on the left, they would blink on another object about 1/3 mile to the east. It gave the appearance that there was only one object, but that it would simply move instantaniously from one location to the other. I got this impression because the lights would not blink simoultaneously, just one object at a time. This went on for 3 minutes or so, long enough for me and the car in front of me to slow down to a crawl, and watch the events occur. Finally, they disappear again, only to reappear a little further north, just before the Morristown overpass. Here the lights reappeared. This time, though, the object was very close, at least it seemed. Now, it was close enough for me to faintly make out a shape amongst the now solid, non-blinking lights. The object appeared, from my angle, to be oval shaped. But, the once vertical lights were now elevated in the center. This gave me the impression that the object was actually flat on top and bottom, and round around the! edges ( Disk chaped), but I was just slightly underneath it. Otherwords, if you were to look at a plate from the side at an equal altitude, it would appear flat and straight. But, looking at it from directly underneath, it would appear perfectly round. My view was something in between. But, this third and final sighting lasted a couple of minutes, and the lights appeared steady, and not blinking. Again, the object would appear on the left, disappear, then reappear on the right (a little further away), never illuminating at the same time. But, the object was still, and I had plenty of time to now count the lights, and there were no flashing beacon lights! None whatsoever! By now, I was alone on the highway, and the car in front of me had long sped off. This last sighting was frightening, since I was now alone, and in the vicinity of the object. The object appeared large to me, maybe the size of a blimp. But, it is hard to tell, since I could not judge its&apos; distance from myself. Maybe it is much smaller, but was also much closer? Honestly, I tried to make a good judgement of distance, but I simply do not know, so I hate to specualte on the actual size. The size of a blimp is just the impression I got, so I will go with that.", "Just wanted everyone to know that we passed three military Hummers full of men on the way to school the morning after the meteor/spacejunk crash in our area on the 28th of November.

These lights flew in formation for about five minutes then the eastern most light(the one on the left) disappeared, followed shortly(perhaps 30 seconds) by the western light(Right side of formation).It is relatively clear out tonight, by that I mean you can see the outline of the surrounding mountain ranges. These lights were well above the summit of the southwestern ranges.

I fly often and have seen every commercial aircraft as well.  I have witnessed flares used in military training exercises, I have seen reflections of lights off clouds and windows (glass). I was an amateur astronomer and have seen everything from meteorites to the space shuttle in orbit. I have seen hundreds of satellites.  While I have witnessed other very impressive UFO&apos;s with multiple witnesses, this was different from all the rest. I have never officially reported a UFO Sighting until now. I was looking from the 20th floor of the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas towards the direction of Area  51. I was also overlooking the Las Vegas Airport late at night, as I usually do when I visit that city. Suddenly out in the distance, beyond the mountain range a &quot;BLUE ORB&quot; rose into the sky at an unbelievable speed, it did not travel in a straight direction at any time, it continued to fly erratically throughout the hour I stayed awake to watch it. This BLUE ORB would rise to, my guess 50,000 feet, and dive back behind the mountain range within seconds. The speed of this object far exceeded any military plane I have ever seen and could not begin to imagine that it was a manned vehicle. It did appear to fly within a limited range and distance, as it did not approach the city, nor did it seem to fly far into the distance, but rather kept its location above and beyond the Nevada mountain range. Furthermore, as planes could be seen approaching from the distance, this BLUE ORB would disappear behind the mountains. I felt as if &quot;it&quot; was being tested with caution. What I mean is the orb would disappear when a commercial airplane was near and the orb would reappear when the skies were clear of visible traffic. I&apos;m confident the skies above our US testing sights are secure, and air traffic above them is forbidden. This object had no defined shape other than a Blue Ball of Light. It did not flash, it did not change color, it made no noise I could hear, IT DID FLY AT INCREDIBLE SPEEDS. IT MOVED BOTH IN &quot;S&quot; PATTERNS AS WELL AS STRIGHT AND ERRATIC. IT WOULD SOMETIMES STOP SUDDENLY, HOVER AND DIVE, AND SOMETIMES IT JUST DARTED AROUND SOMEWHAT UNCONTROLLABLY. WHILE I WAS FASCINATED, THIS ORB WAS COMING NO CLOSER AND I FELT THAT WHAT I SAW WAS ALL I WOULD SEE. I DID CONTACT HOTEL SECURITY IN THE MORNING AND THEY TOLD ME THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.Of course, I did not have my video camera and I stand alone as an Eye Witness.

We lived on 16th street near where 16th st. intersected Morgan Street and about half a mile from Cole Park on the bay. One day my friend&apos;s cousin had visited him during the afternoon and was going to stay the night. So we decided to spend the rest of the day hanging out and when nightfall approached. We decided to show him our late night hang out spot which was an abandoned house next to my friend&apos;s house. The abandoned house had a 2nd story patio that could be reached by stairs and from there we could easily jump on the roof. We would hang out on the rooftop there late at night since we did not have school and it was okay with our parents. We would look up at the stars and talk about anything. We&apos;ll that night around 1:00am, we decided to go to our hang out spot on the abandoned house rooftop. The rooftop was in the shape of an L and it was not flat but slanted on each side. I was sitting down on the long side of the L shaped roof facing to the North . While my friend and his cousin sat on the short side of the L shaped roof facing West. We were there for about an hour talking about something when all of a sudden I noticed something stranged. As I was looking at my friends I noticed a bright white light appear around us. I was shocked since it was 1:00am and there was no moon visible in the night sky. As I looked up to see the source of this light. I saw a white bright glowing object hovering about 15ft in the air near the end of the of the L shaped roof near my friends and about the size of a small car. This object did not have propellers, wings, or any insignia that may have confirmed it was a commercial or military craft. All of sudden it ceased its hovering position and began to move toward us. Afraid and shocked at what I was seeing I immediatly got up and made a mad dash to the patio and my friends followed suit. As we made our frantic run from the object I looked back at the ob! ject onc e I reached the ground but it was gone. As we reached my friend&apos;s house. We were all shivering from fear and we could not come to a conclusion to what we saw. Since then we have kept the incident to ourselves for about 9 years.  A while back I visited my friend, since we have all moved from our original neighborhood, to finally bring this incident to light for us. He was relunctant and wants to forget the incident but from his viewpoint he agreed to settle the matter. He remembers seeing a scared reaction on my face and when he looked to see what was the matter. He said the object was approaching and instantly he and his cousin ran as fast as they could. While on the patio he turned to see the object. He said he saw the object zig zagging back and forth into the sky then disappearing leaving a metallic streak. A while back I saw the documentary about UFO phenomena with Peter Jennings on the National Geographic Channel and heard about the UFO Center. I felt I should tell the center of my experience and maybe someone else around that area may have reported the same object.", "A  close encounter!Well it was oct 12, 1978  Around 3:30 in the evening the day I will never forget.It was me my parents and two sister going to my grandmothers house for super. When we arrived at her house my parents went in to see my grandmother. There was some neighbor kids wanting me and my two sisters  to play football with them in a field beside my grandmothers house there was 8 of us in all between the ages of 8 and 15.It was a beautiful day the sky was a carolina blue no clouds at all.We all started playing football we had been playing for about 1 hour when suddenly I noticed everyone gazing up toward the sky.  And when I looked up I frooze I could not move or speak neither could anyone eles at this point.There was a dark gray disk shaped object above our heads.It could not have been more the 20 feet off the ground it was so close that my skin started to burn,it was hovering right above us no sound could be heard there was lights around the bottom portion of this object that moved it a circle manner and they were white and green.I was so scared but for some reason we could not move at all.There was two windows at the top of a dome located at the very top of this object and I noticed a human like figure wearing a white looking coat standing at the window looking back at us.I could see a green light on the inside and I could see human like figures moving around inside the object.There was also a beam of light shooting down at the ground and at this point I felt like I could move again so I started running toward my grandmothers house and so did everybody eles as I look back I saw this object move so quickly in between two trees than it sped off so fast it had to been faster than any aircraft I had ever seen before.I dont believe in little green men but this was far more interesting than anything I or any other people that say it that day had ever seen.I was 8 years old at the time and Im 35 now and have never seen anthing as strange as that was.What is weird about this is the fact Im allergic to certain! light h itting my skin.I cant get in tanning beds or anything with ultraviolent light,And as for everybody eles we talk about what we saw every now and than but it was such a weird experience that we all have trouble trying to comperhend what we saw was even real.I really wish we could have taken a picture or a video because it would have been one of the most closes encouters of a UFO ever fimed or video taped.Im really glad I could share my storey you because its really hard living with the fact you saw something like this.", "Red, Green, and White lights flashed.

(funny how the ones with cameras and night time vision sudendly didn&apos;t work, but when they were inside they did...hmmm)  Anyway, we ALL saw something in the sky that was flashing red green and white lights. It was not like an airplane at all because it was staying in the same spot, sometimes moving up or down in weird pusulations, and then they looked like they were doing figure eights, but in the same spot.  It moved in such a  way that i can not describe in words, I know what I saw.  The next night my brother tried to tell me that it was Juipter and blah blah blah.  But when I looked at Juipter, it did not have the same thing going at all as the night before.  i know what I saw, and I have other people that will admit it too.

Then it paused on the right side of the sky, then immediately zipped back across the sky to the right. This time the red light was on the top not the bottom. It was so dark that I could barely see the actual craft, so I am going by the shape and light pattern as to the EXACT shape. It was matte black, not shiny. This was NOT a typical airplane.

I said &quot;Look how orange that star is, I&apos;m going to stop and check it out.&quot;  I was just looking at it with my window down at this point, then it started to move.  It was in the northwest sky and traveled a little south, then stopped, moved again south a little farther, and stopped again.  It just stayed there then moved once again, I told my daughter I was going to follow it because it was moving again.  I was going down a street and I blinked the my lights several times rapidly and the object stopped.  I think that was just coincidence though. I had to turn by that time to go around the block and when I looked for it, it was just gone!   This all happened faster than the telling.  It also moved rather quickly.

I was smoking on my fireescape outside my window when something caught my attention.  A bright ball of light fell through a dense group of clouds.  It was bright white and had a smokey tail.  There was a bright green coloring throughout the tail.  The ball was a little smaller than a quarter and bigger than a nickel when held at arm&apos;s length.

I&apos;ve seen flares dropped from an aircraft before and this definitely wasn&apos;t one of them.  I&apos;ve seen lots of shooting stars overseas and this definitely wasn&apos;t a shooting star.

When I reached our house, I got my step-dad&apos;s binaculars to get a closer look at it. When I got it in focus, I could see blue lights on top, red on the bottom, and a white light in the middle that moved in alternating patterns. The object stayed stationary for half an hour after I noticed it. The lights shut off and I could no longer see it. Not five minutes later, I saw another bright light to the right (south) of the first location. It was the exact same as the first object.  I put down the binaculars and called the sheriffs office.  When I looked at it again, it had changed into three red lights in a triangular shape. The bottom right light shut off, and the bottom left light moved in a horseshoe pattern to join with the top light.  This happened for a half an hour also.

Two seconds later, it came back over the horizon towards our home. It slowed down and descended to the ground. When it was no more than fifty feet off the ground, the light shut off.

One evening my wife witnessed something of what appeared to be at the time white flashes in our bedroom that was coming through our window. These bright white flashes were continual and only appeared in the early hours of morning. After the third day of this going on we had contacted our neighbor and asked him if he had seen any unusual white flashes in the early morning hours and he looked at us like we were insane. My wife including our three children ended up sleeping together until we found out what these white flashes were, only problem is other things started happening. Around two and three in the early morning hours we started hearing a low hum similar to a vibration, so I took my ladder out and climbed up on our roof and seen no cable interruption. In my line of work I work for an electrical company but I will not mention which one out of the fear of possible retaliation. My wife as well as my eldest child felt our home was haunted but something kept telling me differently, for example one evening we heard such a loud noise like a jet blast but throughout the entire sky and to this day I have never heard such a loud noise and hopefully we never will again. These white flashes seemed to subside to only then be replaced by what appeared to be a red laser type of beam. This beam for a better word would spell out threats on our bedroom wall as well as through our house, again emphasizing that my wife said our home was haunted. Then it happened, one evening the threats started getting worse and we started to see a few circular objects in the Southern sky and after contacting more than just a few local officials, for the most part each one felt we had lost our minds. They and by they I am referring to whoever or whatever was using these red beams started writing on our walls information that no one had any access to and it started to cause a very prominent divide in our family. Some of the words that to this day still standout were such words as die, filthy, leave,  you cannot make us leave, Norma [my wife felt maybe a correlation to Marilyn Monroe?], they whoever they are mentioned they still are visiting others who they have talked to before and they wanted me to go public which I refused and that seemed to anger them worse. This red beam went as far as naming each member of our family and each evening it grown worse. The writing started lasting later into the morning and longer, personally I started losing more sleep as each day passed until finally we had enough and we now are staying with friends until we move back to Missouri where my wife has family. When this red beam was writing, it would also make direct contact to my wife on her body including myself and we could feel heat from it. After it started leaving marks on my wife in the form of small burns around her head, neck, ears, and along her legs. That is when we moved to a friends home that I met after moving to Sarpy county. I want to tell anyone who may be reading this that I am an electrician by trade and in no way shape or form have I in my entire life ever have dealt with anything like this and to those others who these things refer to, my family who are dealing with this, our heart goes out to you.

We looked up and all we could see was what I believe now as the bottom of the craft...it was huge! There was one big circle and several small circles around the big circle...it was a circle of rotating colorful lights.  There was no sound. We were afraid and hid behind our neighbors camper. The neighbors had a row of bushes and we looked over to the bushes and from behind the bushes..what I would describe as a laser light was coming over the bush and disappearing before it hit the ground. The laser light looked like little red squares. This was way before I knew anything about laser&apos;s or anything like that.The craft was so big we could not see the sky...all we saw were rotating lights. We eventually took off and ran home. I remember running home crying and my dad made me draw exactly what I had saw. I know that UFO&apos;s exist because I know what I saw when I was a child. I&apos;ve tried to find out if anyone else has seen the laser beam lights.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The sun was bright, the air was somewhat hazy, and while it had been foggy earlier that morning, the sky was fairly clear.My son and I were just getting ready to start working on his book report when I received a phone call.  When the call was finished, my son, who has excellent eye site and is well-known in the family for his ability to spot birds and other wildlife, asked me to identify the flying object that he could see from our outdoor third story balcony which faces southwest towards Belvedere Island.It took me about twenty seconds to see what he was pointing at and, when I did, I could see a black speck that, at first, reminded me of a parachute.  But as I watched the object I noticed that, while it was moving slightly in the sky, it was not losing altitude the way a parachutist naturally would.  We own some fairly high power binoculars so I quickly retrieved them and attempted to fix my gaze on the object in question.  At first it was difficult to see the object because my arms were shaking slightly and the object was moving around in my view.  I then kneeled down on my knees, placed my elbows on the balcony railing so as to provide a stable platform, and then focused the binoculars.  At this point, I could see the object clearly.  It was a perfectly round dark colored disk (flat, no bulges) and it was in constant motion doing gentle and slow &ldquo;figure eights&rdquo; tilting and banking and turning slowly.  There were no markings on the exterior, no exhaust ports, no lines or markings of any type. The flying disc stayed in the same small area of the sky, it was in constant motion slowly turning and banking, thus it was not hovering horizontally over a fixed point.We live near the Golden Gate Bridge and I just checked online and the main tower of the bridge is about 750 feet high.  I estimate that this object was flying about three to four times higher than the main tower of the Golden Gate Bridge, or about 2,250 to 3,000 feet above sea level.  The disc was flying just south of Belvedere Island (I estimate four miles away), and the object appeared to be about 30 to 50 feet wide.  As mentioned, the flying disc was in constant motion and as it turned and banked slowly in the sky, the sun intermittently reflected off its surface with a very bright slightly golden colored reflection. From this, I guess that the object had a metallic exterior surface.  My son and I took turns looking through the binoculars and when I watched the object with my naked eye, it was difficult to see the small dark speck in the distance; however, as it turned and the sun reflected off its surface, the bright flash was quite noticeable to the naked eye.There is a fairy high amount of commercial aviation flights in our area and there is also a sightseeing seaplane that operates out of Sausalito and when these planes fly by, we can hear the noise.  The flying disk made no noise whatsoever that we could hear.  After about five to ten minutes of viewing, I went inside to get my camera, but when I returned, I could no longer see the object.I called my girlfriend to report what we had seen and then my son and I started to work on his book report.  After about 20 minutes or so, we heard the very loud and unmistakable sound of military jets flying in our area.  About three weeks earlier we had viewed the Blue Angles (F-18s) during Fleet Week and the sound was much the same, much louder than commercial planes.  We went out to the balcony and observed two military jets circling the area.  This was just after noon or about 12:15 to 12:30 pm.  We presumed that the jets were investigating what we had just seen but, subsequently, I heard that there was a military fly over for the 49er football game at Candlestick Point, so now I am not so sure.There is no question in my mind that we say a flying disc.  My son and I could both see it clearly.  About twenty years ago I worked for a commuter airline at the Sacramento (SMF) Airport and I believe that I am experienced at identifying airplanes in the air.  What we observed was definitely not an airplane, jet, blimp, ultralight, etc.   Given the time of day, the good visibility, and the location over San Francisco Bay, we figure that somebody else must have seen it as well, although I must admit, if not for excellent eye site of my son, I never would have noticed it myself.", "oval shaped ufo shoots in to air with many colorslast night at 11 pm i was outside coming home from trick or treating and i noticed something weird in the sky is was flashing differnet colors of lights and shot up into the sky.", "object in the big skyits still there not moving from location for the last half hour looks like its spinning yet staying in same spot cant tell the color of the lights.i saw an airplane pass it right up((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We unexpected it and were shocked as it was no more than 75 feet in the air just higher than the electric lines. In our amazement we stayed focused making sure what each other saw was in fact something of not normal. It was white and had curved almost boomerang shaped wings going to a cone or small blimp like center no bigger than a van with continuous lighting all around the craft. After it stayed beside us for about 20 to 25 seconds is shot to the sky in a rediculous speed in an instant it was gone. I never believed in ufo&apos;s and laughed at people for believing. This sighting scared me and in fact this is the first time I have mentioned it since then.

As we pulled out onto the highway, we saw what appeared to be lights from a large cargo plane flying overhead. It was not unusual for cargo planes to be doing test fights at night in this area, so we ignored it for the most part. 5 minutes before we made it to Millington the &quot;plane&quot; was next to us in the sky to the right. We didn&apos;t think much of it until I realized we were going faster than the plane was. It was following along with us then slowed down to a stand still. I thought it might be a helicopter, but this thing was huge with a wide wingspan. It then turned around and headed back towards Munford. Then it again turned around and flew over us. I was shocked. Then I saw it go below the tree line and then looked like it was about to crash into the church that was off the highway. It actually landed then took off again from the field. I was thinking it might be a crop duster helicopter, but it was so late and dark. It wasn&rsquo;t until we got out of are car that I realized it wasn&rsquo;t a helicopter. We were in the Lowes parking lot and the craft was floating over the highway. It was so close to the ground and so large. I was shocked to hear no sound hardly coming from it. I could hear more of the traffic passing than I could hear the craft. I could only make out the lights from the craft and not the actual craft itself. It had two bright white lights in the nose of the craft, then it seem to have wings which held one bright white light each. Behind the nose and the wings was two red lights and one red light seemed to be on top or near the nose. They blinked in sequence one after the other. The craft turned around again and then landed in the field next to Lowes. I walked over to see it and saw it in the field. I was about 350 yards away from it where I watched as it began to take off again. It took off like a normal airplane but with less runway. It wasn&rsquo;t! very lo ud either. It had two sounds coming from it. One was a deep low roar, and then a high pitch jet sound. I&apos;m sure it was some sort of Jet hover craft. Obviously man made. I don&apos;t believe it was alien or anything. It was just mysterious and was out of place. We have many aircraft flying around sometimes. Its not uncommon to see a jet fighter fly over you a close range to the ground at extremely high speeds. But this one was just weird. It hovers in mid air, lands in fields, takes off like a plane but shorter runway, extremely quiet. I am sure thousands of people saw this, I saw many people in the parking lot looking up at the sky at it. It was strange. It continued to fly even after we made it back home. It just kept flying back and forth down the highway from Munford to Millington.", "Silent blimp directly above us. No sound or movement or reason. Middle of nowhere.

As we peaked over the hilly terrain of the highway, we noticed this &quot;black hole&quot; in the sky. As we neared home, we took a side road as a short cut home. We ended up almost directly under the object. It looked like a blimp, except it was not moving and it made no sound. As a tough guy, I picked up a rock and threatened to throw it at the object.  My friend, ((name deleted)), begged me not to and begged me to leave. I knew the object was too high to hit with a rock, plus I was also freaked out. We got back in my car and went home.

Before this sighting I was in a building the base command had given me to set up a Ham Radio station. I was on the air late into the morning till around 2am or so.I had been transmitting and talking to another ham radio station. During the end of the converstion with the other station I noticed a large drop in the power line voltage. It dropped to the point that my ratio equipment would not functin correctly. I then shut down my station and left the building to go back to the building where I lived and go to bed. As I left the building with where my radio station was, I noticed a bight, perfectly round shaped light hovering about 100 feed above the ground close to the runway that was on the Coast Guard base. This distance from me was maybe 300 yards.As I watched the object it moved up to an altitude of about 500 ft and down several times. I continued wo watch it. It then hovered perfectly still and then began moving in strange angles back and forth. It then climbed up to several hundred feet, and suddenly shot away into space like a flash. The acelleration was very rapid and the movement was very erratic....It was gone, I mean gone. I stood there completely stunned for several minutes, shaking in awe. I then went back to the barracks and woke up one of my buddies to tell him the story. At first I thought it might be a light from a hellicpoter, but there was NO sound, and the movements were too sharp and erratic to be any normal aircraft. Was this craft attracted to my radio signals in the moments before I came out of the building? Was it attempting to communicate with me by messing with the power?

It reminded me of the deep sea jellyfish that glow-the outline and tentacles shine with their own light. I also observed it splitting into two separate objects, like watching a cell divide.

He jokingly said &quot;Look, UFO trails.&quot;  As soon as the words came out of his mouth, a faint white light started appearing between the two contrails, looking like it was flickering on kind of like the flicker of a fluorescent bulb.  I thought it was the first star of the evening, but was proved wrong when the light grew steadily brighter.  It grew into a bigger, intensely bright white light and shone like that for about 3 seconds.  Then, the light flickered again and it was gone.  No trace of it.  There were no contrails coming off of it, it was too far away to tell if there was any sound, and there were no blinking lights like on an airplane or helicopter.  It just disappeared.  We were facing East, and I would say that it appeared to be over I-75 or a little farther east of the interstate.

I was looking at one particular star because it was so low down it seemed to be hovering over a smalll estate of houses in the distance but i just asumed that it was a greater distance than the others then something else struck me....was the star moving? I was entranced not to look away, I couldnt decide if it was moving because we were travelling in a car but I suddenly realised it was when it was closer and futher away from the other stars...thats when i realsied it wasn&apos;t a star. I decided it was a plane even though i couldnt see the usual blue and red flashing lights that planes usually have. I still kept watching the star/ball of light and then was it just me or was it gettnig bigger? i watched amoazed, i didnt call my nanna coz i was afraid that when i pionted it out to her that it would disapear. I watched the gettng bigger butit still remained as a ball of light then it began to shrink back down and then disapeard.I was thinking about the strange star and gazing across the field out of the window when about 10 minutes later it happened again, i noticed a star that was lower and i again tried to figure out if it were moving but i realised alot fatser that it was when i watcehd as it began to dance around the sky, it was zig zagging and swirlying around and then got bigger..shrank and disaperaed for about 20 minutes after i was still shocked at what i had just seen but carried on looking out to the sky.

I should eb traveling up in that direction in the next past week or so and this time Im taking a camara of some sort even if its my mobile phone.These moving stars, where no bigger than normal real stars. They couldnt of been a plaen or helicopter as there was no noise, planes and hellicopters dont zig zag and dance around or get bigger and shrink then disapere.

It was not a big straight line but was attached to the ORANGE CIRCULAR object.  I leaped out of bed to get a closer look but it went down fast enough that I lost view of it because our TALL TREES blocked the view.  It looked to be distant enough from our home that it had to be near the outskirts of the Golf Course and near Tres Pinos a really small town that adjoins Hollister.  Further out that way is Pinnacles National  Monument area.  NOTE:  What is odd about it is that I left all the lights out in our house when this occured.

They flickered the lights several times.  Then the house opposite our Kitchen Window that neighbor on that side of the house also had their lights FLICKER on and off.

The size of the airplanes was tiny, and I could still see the sphere, so it could not be a balloon. The sphere was stationary for a minute then it started moving slowly North in a straight line, I told my wife about it and she was able to see it too... she said &quot;The air up there is dragging the balloon&quot;; however, after several seconds, the sphere reversed direction, now going South slowly.

His house is located on the far north east side of Tucson, off of Catalina highway and it is surrounded by moutains. It was over these moutains that I saw an extremely bright light off in the distance that appeared to be rising at an angle in the sky. At first, I assumed it was a police helicopter shining its spot light in our direction but it was moving at an abnormally fast pace and the light never seemed to shine in any other direction. Planes, as well as helicopters, fly over my boyfriend&apos;s house quite frequently and they both have a very distinct sound. The object I witnessed made no noise what so ever. At this point, I called my boyfriend over to look at it and as we both stood watching it, the object appeared to freeze where it was and simply hover in place. The two of us got the feeling that it was watching us and ran inside of the house to wake up my boyfriend&apos;s mother. We were inside of the house for twenty seconds at the most before returning outside. In the short period of time that we were inside of the house, the object had made it&apos;s way all of the way over to the other side of the sky and was now gliding slowly towards the city. It was flying incredibly low and from what I could make out, it appeared to be triangle shaped with a bright red light that protruded slightly from the center with three smaller, but incredibly bright white lights at each rounded point. My boyfriend&apos;s mother, who was a skeptic, described it as looking like a ferris wheel turned on it&apos;s side with the red light representing the axis. The three of us watched it in the distance and as we did, it appeared to go straight up in the air, then down at an angle and hover for a moment, then go straight up again and repeat the zig-zag pattern until we lost sight of it. Another unusual event had occured a few months prior at the location where I first spotted the object in the sky which I feel is worth mentioning. My boyfriend had been out smoking on the patio around four in the morning in early July when we noticed what appeared to be a vapor trail that was surrounded by different, glowing colors (namely red, purple and green) in the north east area of the sky. It hung in the air for atleast an hour with all other colors but red fading away slowly. The red glow and vapor trail remained until sun rise.

Over the next 30 minutes, the &quot;light&quot; moved Westward of Jupiter  ~3 degrees (in addition to Earth rotation of ~7 degrees during that period of time) for a total of ~10 degrees apparent angular motion relative to a fixed point on the earth&apos;s surface. The object appeared to have a similar angular size as Jupiter (38&quot;); it shape was not discernable as being different than circular at 7x.)  The object&apos;s motion was not noticeable to the naked eye, but became noticeable as the Jupiter to object separation increased as viewed through 7x50mm binoculars over this interval of time.  In the final five to ten minutes of observation, the light bagan to moved more rapidly westward, barely noticeble under binocular observation, though still at a very slow rate of apparent angular motion. At ~20:50 EDT, the the object began to dim significantly.  Within 2 minutes it faded out completely, and was no longer visible, even in binoculars.  The fade out time of 2 minutes is consistent with the time it takes for the disk of the sun to set; ergo the fade-out at approx. 20:50 EDT corresponds to the sun setting at the objects&apos;s altitude, and its illumination being reflected sunlight.  IOW, sunset at the object&apos;s altitude was at 20:50 EDT, while local sunset at observing location was at 20:17 EDT (as per planetarium software).  A cursory calculation indicates this diference in sunset time corresponds to the object&apos;s altitute being roughly 250,000 feet ASL. Starting location of object @ ~20:20 was 30 degrees altitude, ~27 degrees W of South azimuth.  Ending location @ ~20:50 EDT was ~27 degrees altitude, ~38 degrees W of South. (Location based on planetarium software data for Jupiter at local time/location)  A cursory analysis of this data, assuming same angular size as Jupiter, is an object that is about 100&apos; wide, at altitude of ~250,000 ft, about 100 miles slant range from point of observation.  Its average speed is about ~10 degrees of angle/30 minutes; this works out to be about 35 mph at the estimated distance, slower at the beginning of the observation, somewhat faster toward the end. Geographically, this object seems to have been located over the Catskills in New York state, based on plotting azimuth angle and estimated distance on an aviation sectional map. I have no idea what &quot;flies&quot; at 250,000&apos; at speeds between 0 to perhaps 100 mph, and is about 100&apos; across, but that what the data says it was.((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar report from Twin Cities, MN, for August 19, 2004.

The object at its southern point had one non-flashing light, in its approx center was another non flashing red light, at its northern point were two lights, one which was white and non blinking and another light very close to the white light and it was red in color and blinking. My wife exited the front door and I yelled at her to grab the binoculars and run out with them. This she complied with, retireved the binoculars and she and ((name deleted)) came out to join me. I brought the binoculars into focus and could see the object, which appeared to be moving fairly slow and continuing North. I could also ascertain that there was a darkened area between the 4 lights and that in fact these were not 3 seperate objects. This horizontal area or structure did not appear to be very high but was flattened and &quot;line&quot; like.  I handed off the binoculars to both ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)).   We continued to watch the object as it continued North.  Approx 3 minutes into the observation the object appeared to make a flight adjustment and it began turning into a North-West flight angle. At this point and through the Binoculars I could now see the rear end of the object. You could now see that it possessed 2 white lights in the rear of the structure.  It looked as though you were watching the rear end of a car that had two white running lights.  The distance between the two rear light would be approx 1 finger held up at arms length.  The 3 other lights (red in the center, white and blinking red up from) were also still visible but at more of an angle. The front flashing red light was still visible.  At all times the lights remained at a fixed distance from each other, the distance never varied as it would if you were watching a string of conventional aircraft stuggling to maintain position relative to each other.  I was able to observe the object from its new flight path for approx another minute to two minutes until it was lost over the horizon. The object appears to have corrected its flight path from when first viewed to the point that it turned NorthWest as I believe I-10 makes the same course adjustments.  I believe the object was certainly following and flying directly above I-10, turning as I-10 turned, but Im not completely sure of this.  I could not estimate its speed, but it was not flying very quickly, but I would guess that if these were in fact helicopters, it would appear to be about the same speed as a helicopter at that distance.  There was no sound. We contacted a nearby neighbor (too late for him to see it), but as we talked in the driveway he related to me that during a ball game this evening, the crowds were witnessing many strange lights in the night skies.......he didnt elaborate. I have made a rough sketch of the object, will enhance the sketch and send it off to you in the morning.((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Sketch of the object received.

Frightened residents rush out of buildings. They are felt in Portland, Oregon, in Port Townsend, in Seattle, at the coal mines at Newcastle, and in the Stuck and Puyallup valleys in south King County. Shortly before the December 12 earthquake, an apparent meteorite is sighted crashing into the Chuckanut Mountains just south of Bellingham. Over the next three months a number of aftershocks follow.December 7th Earthquake  On December 7, 1880 at about 5:45 p.m., the earthquake was felt throughout the Puget Sound region. Seattle, Bainbridge Island, Tacoma, Puyallup, Olympia, and Port Townsend reported shaking. At Seattle, &ldquo;People rushed into the streets from stores, restaurants and saloons&rdquo; (Seattle Post-Intelligencer, December 8, 1880).People in the Chinese district were most frightened and it was one or two hours before they calmed down. A Mr. Atkinson, who was in Newcastle at the time of the quake, came to Seattle a few days after the earthquake that occurred later in the week and reported that the December 7 quake was stronger than the one on December 12. At Seattle the shock waves were felt traveling from the southeast to northwest and at Bainbridge Island they were felt traveling from north to south.December 12th Earthquake  On Sunday December 12, 1880 at about 8:40 p.m., the second Puget Sound earthquake of the week was felt strongly in Seattle. It was more severe than the December 7 quake. A witness of the 1880 earthquake, a Seattle resident, wrote in 1904 to the Seattle Post Intelligencer:   &ldquo;It was so sharp that it caused people who were on the streets to stagger. It was a Sabbath evening and quite a large congregation was at church on Third Avenue &hellip; The shock alarmed the worshippers and they arose en masse. One lady fainted and a panic was narrowly averted by the minister and one cool-headed man who stood near the door&rdquo; (Seattle Post-Intelligencer, March 20, 1904, p. 1).In Seattle, &ldquo;Dogs in the street howled and horses endeavored to escape from their stalls&rdquo; added the December 16, 1880 Port Townsend Democratic Press.The quake caused lamps hung from a 16-foot high ceiling at a house located at the northwest corner of 2nd Avenue and James Street to swing six to eight feet. At another dwelling, a chimney fell. At the south end of King County, residents along the Stuck and Puyallup valleys stated that the quake moved the earth like ocean swells.A Meteorite?  Just before the December 12 earthquake, a Seattle resident reported witnessing what &ldquo;seemed to be two very large balls of fire that appeared in the clear sky a short distance apart and hung as in balance an instant, and then darted down and toward each other until they crashed and disappeared. A moment afterwards came the shock&rdquo; (The Seattle Weekly Post, December 17, 1880). A Whatcom County paper reported witnessing a meteorite that descended into the Chuckanut Mountains.It is unknown whether this strange event was the cause of the quake.The December 12 earthquake was felt from Portland to Port Townsend, where it lasted about 11 seconds. It was not felt at Victoria, British Columbia, or at Neah Bay near Cape Flattery, the northwest point of Washington. During the following three months, a Bainbridge Island resident reported three more aftershocks in December, five aftershocks in January 1881, two aftershocks in February 1881, and a single aftershock on March 14, 1881.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the gentleman who submitted this report, and the information from the Seattle newspapers.

I too have seen an object just as he decribed in April 1991 while sitting here on my front porch, it started up from the horizon and looked at first like a falling star but was falling up, came acroos the sky, directly overhead to the opposite horison in approx 15 seconds. When it was overhead it was about the size of a full moon, circular in shapr with a hint of being oglong, and was glowing all white, there were no lights or markings other than entire thing was a solid white glowing ball of light and was gliding fast across the sky.

I am not crazy, neither is my son, I know what I saw, and while I didnt see what he saw, I did see his face when he ran into the house too tell me and I can tell you this, he was telling me the truth.

I dont see any clouds in the area that could have caused the dimming. The lights were spaced about 1 inch apart at arms length. I could not tell if there was any object connecting the lights together, but they didnt change the distance between. Eventually I couldnt see the lights due to the city lights.

It was so evenly lit I thought it had about 6 portholes evenly light that were reflecting off the water. Before I actually got stoped I got a signal to proceed.

There were no clouds, it was a bright, sunny, blue sky, October afternoon with the sun shining to our right, casting long shadows in the sand. I had sat down on a swing for about 5 minutes, watching my son playing in the sand to my left, when all of a sudden I physically felt an extremely intense, powerful double shock wave that initially seemed strong enough to stop my heart momentarily from beating. When I looked around me, everything was lit up brilliantly in a strange light grey light, and then looked over at my son 7 feet away from me, I could clearly and obviously see that we were being intensely illuminated from directly above. When I looked over at my son, his own shadow below his body was razor sharp around him on the sand, but when I looked straight up in the sky, the two round objects were actually about 3-4 miles over to our right instead, which was confusing because the light they were emitting made it seem as if they were only 100 feet straight above us.  His bright red jacket appeared only grey, there was no color vision at the time of the sighting.  The light seemed brilliant grey, and actually eradicated all of the shadows eminating from the bright sunlight.  They were heading south to north, same speed, same line of movement, second one behind the first one about a mile or two behind, and were the same size each, circular in shape with about 7 concentric non-contacting rows of brilliant but separate and staggered, huge, stationary sparks underneath them, but coming out of the underside of the objects. The sparks were static and appeared photographic due to total non-movement, but with random, smaller bright shards of blue and red in each of the white and also each of the yellow sparks. The first, outer, ring of sparks was white, the second two smaller inner, concentric rings were yellowish in color, the next smaller ring was white and the next two were yellowish ag! ain in c olor, with the final, smallest ring being white sparks. But in the exact center of each object was a huge black circular discharge of downward facing uneven energy, like an enormous jet black spark, as was all of the other sparks, each facing downwards as well.  I could tell the black energy was larger because it was blocking out the few rows of sparks that were behind it.  The second, trailing object then zoomed quite rapidly up to the first one, as they each continued northbound, and then immediately bounced off of without ever hitting it in two or three tiny little loops to the right of it, then instantly approached it again, and once more seemed to be deflected somehow by the first one in 4-5 little swirling looping motions on the left side of the first object.   The first object remained perfectly stationary at both times.  Then the second object went all the way back to its original distance and position and once again approached the first object again, same speed, but this time, apparently making a smoother approach, because it went slowly under the first one, because the first one started disappearing as in a crescent shape above it, and then the top one dissappeared completely, apparently as it overlapped the second one now below it.  Due to their similar size, they now appeared as one object.  Then, after traveling another few miles towards the north, above to my left, they rapidly and suddenly flung apart from each other, the top one seemed to deflect to the right where I could still see the rings of sparks on the bottom of it and then the second one deflected to the left of it flipping almost on its side at an angle towards my direction because I could see the top of it, that it was covered in a greyish brownish material, soft looking, and it had no windows or doors and had a smooth dome shape directly in the middle of its center. When they both instantly flung apart from each other, they also instantly and abruptly stopped at the same exact time completely in mid-air.  At that instant, that ! they bot h stopped in mid-air for perhaps two seconds that I could tell, then they both, at the same precise instant, disappeared from view completely without any indication of speed, flight trails or even any apparent flight direction whatsoever.   I used to work in the financial accounting field, so paying attention to details was very important.  I also did not feel threatened or afraid at any time of the sightings even because of the strange light because they made no movements towards us, they simply seemed to be maneuvering in the sky, and the way they moved so effortlessly, made it seem to me as if they were floating on top of a solid surface, even though they were so high up in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

All of us have prior military service (Navy, Army (2), and Air Force) and are good observers--2 of us were officers).  We had traveled from Colorado Springs, Colorado to visit a work of art in progress (Bishop&apos;s Castle, a very cool hand-made structure all reader&apos;s must visit someday....) on a beautiful Saturday, April 17, 1993.  We drove a Jeef Cherokee to the castle, which is just west of Rye, Colorado off I-25, south of Pueblo taking CO-165 West.  We left the castle to find a 4-wheel drive trail to explore west of there.  We stopped at a large rock formation near a trail, when &quot;D&quot; yelled at the three of us to look at a strange light in the sky.  We were looking to the east/southeast at around 110 degrees or so. The sun was behind the mountains to our west and light was fading quickly.  The three of us looked at this &apos;star&apos; and didn&apos;t see anything, at first.  We actually told &quot;D&quot; he was hallucinating....this got him a bit mad at us.  We were going back to gathering wood for a fire, as it was getting chilly as the sun set.  After about 10 minutes, &quot;D&quot; again yelled at us to check out the light, which we all did.  And sure enough, we ALL saw this very bright, rapidly &apos;twinkling&apos; white light move incredibly fast to a secondary position in the sky....and then back to the original position, all within the blink of an eye!!  This was incredible....we all were quite amazed and spellbound.  The light continued to do these rapid linear displacements (equivalent distance of 2-3 times my thumb length while my arm is held out, base of thumb near the light....). I estimate the light to have been 10-15 miles away, but it was hard to tell as we had no minimal reference points.  There was a ridge in front of us to the east with plenty of pine trees, and the light was well past that.  It was at an angle of about 35 degrees from the horizontal plane from our position, again looking towards the easterly direction.  What was also pronounced was the rapid pulsing of the light! , which was the brightest object in the sky (stars were just beginning to appear as the sun set....around 1800 (MST) or so).  It seemed to have bursts of red and blue, but it just (at first) seemed like a bright, twinkling star. That is, until it shot off in different directions so fast, and then back to the same spot again1! It did this several times....we all saw it.  I finally recalled I had a camera with me, and as a plus I had brought a tripod!  So, I raced to the Jeep and got my camera setup with the longest lense setup I had available (2x teleconverter with a 80-200 zoom lense).  My only film (1 last roll....I&apos;d shot 4 or 5 of the castle!) was a 100asa 24 exposure roll of Kodak.  I loaded it and grabbed the tripod and headed up the hill!  My three friends stayed with the campfire below, continuing to observe the light as it bobbed and moved to various positions, but staying within the general area of just east of our position.  I got my camera setup, despite the steep angle on the hillside and had a pretty clear view of the light (from the campfire, it had been dipping below the treetops in front of us).  I used a cable to activate the shutter, as I did several long exposure shots. I decided on this strategy to capture a picture since the film speed was too slow for such low light exposure.  I had a couple of problems with the cable release, as 2 times it got stuck and allowed a regular high speed 1/1000 exposure.....wasted film, I figured.) After several hours of trying to get pictures, the light disappeared behind clouds that came up from the west. It was then we left the area, just around 2330 or so.  The next day, I took to the film I&apos;d shot to the 1 hour photo shop at the mall.  What I got  back was really not much, at first. Just a bright dot and lines.  But, 2 pictures were unusual. 1 looked like a &apos;tadpole&apos; with a bright head and a tail???  The other...well, I guess some would call it a &apos;1 in a million&apos; shot, and it is.  It clearly shows 3 separate and distinct lights, all at low level intensity. ! Connecti ng the lights are straight lines...it is definitely a triangular shaped craft!!  Now, what I must make clear....none of us (the four witnesses) ever saw a distinct shape, except for a round, bright light. This was quite profound to me, as this told me a LOT.  Whomever controlled this craft was intelligent....and using a camouflage method that sure seemed to work well. Secondly, the other timed exposure pictures revealed another fact:  whomever controlled the craft also was smart enough to use the stars as cover, moving the craft in perfect sidereal time!! It was emulating a star!! (the lengths of the lines created by the star movement = time. The bright light as well as observable background stars in the picture all have parallel light trails of equal lenght!).  This, to me, is a vital clue.  This was a very clever and effective cover....it sure worked on us! But, the camera does not lie....I have the picture (and negative...no digital pix here!). I had it blown up, and this is an amazing picture.)  In any case, we all agreed we had seen the same thing....but, the pictures told a very important story--that there was an intelligence operating whatever type of craft it was....not something I&apos;d ever seen before!  And it made no noise whatsoever.  This is my true story; I was reluctant in the past to tell anyone but close friends, but the picture still amazes those who see it.....maybe these facts will help other researchers.", "I met with a man who spotted a crop circle (ring) while turkey hunting on a farm north of Harrisburg, PA. The crop circle formation was like a donut at the end of a cornfield in a very remote location of rural central Pennsylvania.  It appeared to be about a week or so old. It was a rather large circle with corn stalks left standing in the middle. The diameter of the circle appears to be about 90 feet with the flattened circle part about 30-35 feet wide.  There is a small open area at the end leading into the circle. There were no apparent tire tracks or footprints in the area.The witness said he hunts on the farm every year and has never seen anything like this before in his life. Some samples are being taken as the investigation will continues.  Attached are several pictures. Then witness said that no one, except himself is allowed to hunt in the area.

I pulled quickly in my driveway and ran in the house.  My wife and children saw me in a mad dash as I was grabbing my night vision 70x binoculars. I ran outside and quickly zoomed in on the object.  It was a rectangular shape with a &quot;V,&quot;  just as you see here lit up in yellow underneath it. It moved slowly left and then back to the right.  Sat in place 30 seconds or so then started comming towards our house. It then turned on a very very bright headlite as it started moving to the south.  Almost directly above our home. As it turned we could see it was a light blue craft with white writing on the side.  At this time we could actually hear the craft. I would not call this a ufo; I personaly am more inclined to believe it was some type of military craft.

I was on a country road with no traffice and so I stopped the car and rolled down the window.  As the &quot;aircraft&quot; got closer, I heard no sound of an engine, even though it was flying fairly low.  It was shaped like a triangle, from below it reminded me of a fighter jet, but broader.  It had a blue light on one wing and a red light on the other.  It was going very slowly.  The large light was on top and to the front.  The strangest thing that grabbed my attention, was that as it flew overhead, I could see up into it.  Like it had a glass bottom and I could see light coming from inside, which was sectioned off.  Behind the larger aircraft and slightly above, was another much smaller one which looked like it was following the main one.  Then I guess I got a little scared and left. One other strange thing was that when I tried to use my cell phone a few minutes later, it kept beeping back at me even though I had a good signal and when I talked with a friend, it &quot;froze&quot; and wouldn&apos;t let either of us get out of it! I&apos;ve seen them before, but never this close and so I decided to report this one.  I work at a daily newspaper in Hillsdale, Mich in advertising sales.

Because there were three similar doors along the same wall I decided to see how many were study rooms.   The next door also led to a study room, which was furnished using furniture that seemed identical to the first room; a beautiful new large table and chairs.  Taking a few steps backwards, I looked in the window to the first study room again to see if the furnishings in both rooms were identical.   I also noticed the sign above each of the rooms, &quot;STUDY ROOM.&quot;  The first room was a little smaller though.  I was just about to look in the window to the second study room again, when two people walked into it and at the same time a woman came out of the third door. I then asked her how many study rooms that branch of the library has and, nodding towards the first study room, she answered, &quot;only that one.&quot;  I  had looked up at the sign above the second door and the areas above both of the doors each had an identical notice posted, &quot;Study Room.&quot;   The wall in the second room was bare and that room was larger.  I use the past tense because when the library employee looked at the wall where both doors had been, the door only to the second study room vanished. No spaceship seemed present and there was no unusual noise.    But, from previous my experience,  the second study room at my local library branch has not entirely disappeared, its access is strictly controlled.", "Bright light moving south and dimming out.It was like a bright star moving in a straight line.

I had been sitting for quite a while without a bite so I anchored my pole with rocks and walked up to the top of the dam to stretch my legs and look around. I looked toward the south/southeast over crouch mesa and observed 6 lights that appeared to be hovering a few hundred feet above the mesa approximately 2 to 3 miles away.  The lights were yellow/orange, identical in color to sodium vapor street lights.  They were in a straight line, at the same altitude, and fairly evenly spaced.  The light on the left most side was much larger and brighter than the other 5, which were of the same brightness. At first I thought that they could have been street lights, but I could clearly see the mesa top and the lights were much too high to be street lights.  I also thought that they could be helicopters, but there were no helicopter sounds. As I watched, the large light moved east a short distance and stopped, then the smaller lights moved to catch up with the big light, one at a time. This caterpillar like movement continued for several minutes. The movements were short.  At the distance that they appeared to be from me, I would estimate each movement to be 200 to 300 yards with a 15 to 20 second interval between movements.

In the spring of 2001 I was driving to a service call from St. Catharines were I live on the St. Lawrence Seaway {Welland Canal} to Goderich on the shores of Lake Huron. While traveling I received a phone call that the ship a salt carrier would be delayed so I decided to cut a cross county as it was a beautiful early morning, slight to moderate mist, sun breaking through and the leaves just starting to break out on the trees. I was well below London Ontario traveling along a gravel road. On my right was a hedgerow, with a plowed field after and on my left broken woods. As I looked through the hedgerow into the plowed field I saw what seemed to be a flattened white egg about the size of my Aireostar van about ten feet off the ground.It was pacing me in an undulating motion and slowly traveling as well as forward laterally across the field toward me. As I looked at it I thought I saw Identifying marks as a small number near the rear but as it got closer I realized what I took for a number was actually black dirt mixed with water that had followed the contour of egg with the 40 mile an hour breeze as that was my speed. As it came closer it rose above the hedgerow and was on my blind corner at the right rear but I could see it if I bent my head low and looked out my side window. There was no noise only that of my van and what seemed to be rushing air. The next thing I remember is still traveling down this mud gravel road but whatever this was had passed me and was rising over the hedgerow at the end of the field still a good quarter mile away. How did it get ahead of me without me remembering it pass me.I continued to my service call and repaired the ships radar returning home late that night. I don&apos;t know what I saw but I can still see it in my minds eye. It was heading in the direction of London airport. This was what consoled me somewhat. I really have had no other problems but cant account how this got so far ahead of me as what I took to be so suddenly. I have only told my wife and my Dad now 84.

It was about 7:15pm (19:15) in the evening and the sky was pitch black already as it&apos;s almost winter. I noticed a white light in the sky that was unusual. It was brighter than an airplane. While I was driving it seemed as though I was getting closer to it, and I could see that it was in fact three round, white lights that formed a triangle. It was locked in the sky as though it was stationary, and I wondered if it were a radio tower. As I drove closer I could see it better. The three lights made a triangle where the point of the triangle was the top light, and two lights were below it geometrically. The lights were very close to each other. As I got even nearer, I noticed that while the sky was black, I could make out a darker black in between and around the lights. The lights were definitely attatched to something that was darker than the night sky, although I couldn&apos;t make out that shape. Unexpectedly, the three lights seemed to turn off, or go out, or even turn around.  In their place was a single, smaller red light that was not as bright as the white lights. I could still see the darker black form, and it appeared the red light was attatched to it. At this point, the light started to move away from me.  It was no longer stationary.  All I could see was the red light, and I watched as it flew away, slightly upwards, growing smaller and smaller until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. All of this lasted about 5 minutes.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found her to be exceptionally eloquent, in describing her sighting.  We suspect that she is an exceptionally good witness.  We have corresponded with her, to inquire whether she stopped her car, and was stationary, at any time during her sighting.

Neither of us had ever seen anything like it.  It was triangular in shape (as best as I could tell given the extremily bright lights it had), and was moving in erratic patterns at reasonably high altitude. Given the high speed and erratic movements, we determined it was certainly not a helicopter or any conventional civilian aircraft.  The lights it emmitted were red and white. Didn&apos;t notice and noise or sounds that could be heard over the din of the ocean. I&apos;ve never seen anything move so fast and change directions so abruptly.

At the time were High School students just talking about life. As we were talking we noticed a helicopter object that seemed to be hovering by the Blue Mountain.  We assumed at first it was Life Lion (the local helicopter rescue service) trying to save someone around the mountain.  What surprised us was the amount of time it hovered about the mountain.  I was used to Life Lion rushing to a scene and then rushing back to the hospital.  But it wasn&apos;t the case here.  So I pointed it out in our conversation we were having and then realized the object was coming our direction, which we thought was normal because we were on the way to the hospital. Then things got strange.  The speed of the object increased and it seemed to be upon us in moments.  Now at the time, I was taking flying lessons and I knew nothing could move that fast except a jet, and a very fast jet at that.  It would have to be approaching Mach 1 to be able to move from the mountain to us in mere seconds.  As it quickly approached we saw the object wasn&apos;t a helicopter at all but something quite different.  As it approached we saw that it had 3 points and was shaped like a triagle.  As it got closer we realized that the object was HUGE and very low.  The object was more of a isosceles triangle with the front point the brightest.  The object was about a football field long and 50 yards wide.  When it came upon us we thought it would fly over because it was moving so fast but then slowed to a crawl.  It came right above us at about 200 to 300 feet.  It made very little noise if any noise at all.  I kinda remember a hum though.  At this point we were in shock of the object because it had stopped with its brightest front point right above us.  A few seconds past and then the bright front point of the ship shot a spot light on the street in front of us.  I can only describe it as human made spot light.  Everything about this object seemed completely outstanding except the light.  It just seemed like a spot light.  Needless to say my companions and myself were not going to stay put and test the theory out.  So we ran for cover.  I ran to a basketball pole and by the time I got there I realized that the light stopped.  I looked up and the object was then heading South-East towards Hershey.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I have very good depth perception and can judge altitudes pretty accurately.  This particular incident is the second unexplained sighting I have had in 40 plus years. My 2 children, 12 and 8 years old, and I were sitting on a grassy knoll in a local park watching radio controlled gliders.  I heard an approaching airplane and layed on my back to looked up at the sky to watch the plane begin its&apos; landing approach to the local airport.  As it passed overhead I noticed a small round, very bright, solid white object at a very high altitude, directly above me.  It was slowly moving westward when it stopped.  When this happened, I asked my 12 year old if she could see the object.  She said she did and asked what it was.  I then asked my 8 year old if he could see it.  After 5 seconds or so, he also saw it.  Just as my 8 year old spotted the object, it slowly started to move in a north direction for maybe 10 seconds, then stopped.  Within a few more seconds, it changed direction and moved south east to a spot directly over us again.  The white round object had completed a triangle pattern. After about 3 or 4 minutes, we saw the object seem to tilt down towards the east and it now appeared to have a faint outline of chrome or silver to it.  It stayed like this for only 3 or 4 seconds, then appeared to rotate back up to its&apos; original horizontal (?) position. This day was fairly windy - 10-15 mph surface winds with a much faster high altitude wind due to a cold front system moving in.  The white object never gained altitude or drifted in any direction other than the original 3 directions mentioned.My estimate was that it was at or above 40k feet as there were 2 high altitude jets passing through the area that created vapor trails and the white object appeared at this altitude or higher. My children and I watched this object for over five minutes - I had checked my watch.", "Landed Craft with strobes and bright light near Petrified ForestAs I was headed east on Interstate 40, i noticed an object on the north side of the highway.

After we pass Sells, AZ, we started to see a pair of very bright amber lights and around them 4 white bright intermintent lights that seem to be from airplanes. When we stopped, we were able to hear noise from military jets, then we assumed it came from the white lights.  The amber lights desapeared after two minutes.  The jets appeared to be looking for them but could not find anything; suddenly, in the middle of the jets, three huge amber lights reappeared, and a cat and mouse game between the amber lights and the military jets started, 4 minutes later all lights desappeared. We continued our trip and when we were 20 miles from Why, AZ, the amber lights appeared over a mountain close to Ajo; they were in the for about 5 minutes.  My friend stopped the car and I stepped out of the car to record with a small digital camera; a few minutes later, another light appeared next to the one on the right side.  When the lights were changing direction in the sky they were leaving a gray streak behind them but it&apos;s not appreciated in the video. My friend shut off the car, and the lights started to fade, at that moment the military jets (I suppose) reappeared. Later when we were travelling from Why to Lukeville, we still could notice that the lights were behind the mountains near Ajo; furthermore, when we passed Sonoita, already in the Mexican side and we were travelling to Rocky Point, we could still the lights for 5 more minutes.

It would be best described as silver, cylindrical, shaped like a cigar tube.  No Windows, Wings, Identifyable Marks or Propulsion source.  It was half way between our plane and the ground.  Taking into account the speed our plane was travelling, the object was either hovering or moving very slow in a South West direction along a parallel flight path with the ground.  No erratic movement noted. I was on a Continental Airline flight. The plane departed at 7AM from West Palm Beach, FL, en route to Newark, NJ.  We landed in Newark at about 9:30 AM. I have never witnessed an unusual object such as this before. The sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.  There was not time enough to get the attention of anyone else on the plane. The object appeared to be slightly less than half distance between our plane and the ground.  I understand commercial aircraft generally travel at 35,000 feet, if this is the case, it would be my estimate that the object was located at about 17,000 feet.  Visability was perfectly clear. There were no clouds anywhere. I cannot provide a comparison of the object to the sun, since my line of view was from above the object looking downward. I struggle to comprehend the actual size of the witnessed object.  It was large enough that it was clear and distinct but otherwise small from my point of view.

How much of the sky, in terms of degrees of arc, did the object cover during the 14, or so, seconds you witnessed it, please?Thank you, again, for sharing the information with our Center!

(Same brightness as a full moon)  Not a satellite as I have seen many satellites and the movement of this,  was, in comparison, similar to that of a shooting star in terms of rapidity.  From my field of view the object covered about  half of the horizon from my bedroom window in those few seconds. It  was traveling at an incredible  rate of speed without sound.    I had, in fact, last year reported something very similar on your network, however the size of this was remarkable today.

It was much lower than a large passenger plane or blimp. No sound was heard. It was low enough that I should have been able to see wings, tail and windows but I saw nothing.

The direction of travel was about the same as the previous sighting. I have not seen the object again since July and I have looked. We have one airport and it does not accomodate large planes.  Planes going from St. Louis to KC are at a much higher altitude than what I saw. I have seen plenty of small planes pass over my house before but the wings and tail are always easily visible.

I am not sure about the exact date; but in the housing tract known as Old Orchard One, in Valencia, California, I had been waiting up for my Mother to come home from a late night Bible Study Group. I fell asleep on our exceptionally large sofa. I woke up sometime around 10pm; my Mother had covered me with a comfy blanket and was asleep on the other end of the sofa. I got up from the sofa and went down the hall to the bathroom. I then walked to the kitchen getting myself a glass of water from the sink. Instead of going to my room, I went back to the living room, pulled the covers over me, and curled up on the sofa; I glanced out our large dinning room windows, noticed the street light, and turned towards the wall. Eyes wide open; I remembered cleaning leaves from the neighbor&rsquo;s lawn, and tidying up the garage that summer for spending cash. &quot;There was no street light there.?!&quot; I rolled over and saw a large oval shaped, what looked liked a silver metal color, craft. It had head lights, like those on a big rig, I could see detail, and the lights appeared to be spaced, going all the way around the outer rim of the craft. The lights changed colors; blue, red, green, white. It made no sound that I could hear. It sat about three feet above the neighbor&rsquo;s roof, and covered the entire roof. The neighbor is aprox. one home over and across a street.I thought to myself, &ldquo;no one is going to believe this.&rdquo; I even questioned in my mind, would people even believe my Mother. I knew, my Father being of a logical nature, people would be more likely to believe him. My instinct was to wake my Father, but he was in the back bedroom, down the hall. I slowly moved the covers down and slowly sat up, the craft moved up in the air slightly, so I slowly laid back down, the craft coming  down to its original position. I sat there a moment, starring at the craft and wondering, I repeated the same action, again the craft followed by movements moving upward and returning as I laid back down. Okay, I thought, the craft appears to be mimicking my movement; &ldquo;this thing is watching me.&rdquo; I kept watching the craft and thinking what to do, I did not want to be the only witness. I slowly sat up a third time and again, simultaneously, the craft moved up higher into the air, so I laid back down, the craft returning to a hovering position over the roof. I decided to wake my Mother gently; I kicked her foot several times with mine, until she stirred. My Mother, now slightly awake, responded. I asked her in a whisper, &quot;Mom don&apos;t move, just listen. Are your awake?&quot; My Mother replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; I told my Mother to very slowly roll over and look out the dining room window, but not to make any sudden movements. Well, she rolled over slowly just fine, the scream that followed and the jumping up and running towards the dinning room window wasn&apos;t part of the plan. The craft went straight up into the air, dimmed, went bright, then, I know this sounds strange, but the craft made itself look like a star. Dad came running but didn&apos;t understand why our knees were shaking looking at a star. We called the Sheriff and tried to explain, but it sounded so strange, we just decided to hang up. We watched what looked like a star move with the rest of the stars until dawn. Several nights thereafter, at around 10pm, in the sky, in the same general area, a light would come in dim at first, go extremely brig! ht, and then appear to be just another star. We decided to keep the curtains closed after that.The morning after the incident, I stood in our yard, and looked at the spot where the craft had been and said out loud, &quot;tell my baby I Love them.&quot;  I have no explanation why I said that. Now, I am not a UFO hunter, never will be, don&apos;t want people bothering me, but for the record, so others know, our children had &ldquo;close encounters.&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t discuss the matter much, we just know these incidents did happen. We live our life with all the joy God gave us, and realize what can you do? You can&rsquo;t change it, you can&rsquo;t really talk about it, and you don&rsquo;t want anyone to know, so &ldquo;it&rdquo; just happened,  and we&rsquo;re okay, we don&rsquo;t live in fear and still enjoy looking at a beautiful night sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We couldn&apos;t tell what direction it was moving in. It started moving up and down vertically, in a straight line and then horizontally. We then lost it behind a hill(the island is quite hilly). We drove for around 4/5 minutes before I saw a light on top of another hill and then the other observer saw it as well before it went down behind the hill. Again we drove for a few minutes but I kept getting distracted by a light in my rear view mirror, but no car would come up behind me. The third time I was distracted I saw shadows moving like something was in front of the light. I said to my partner that something was behind us. He looked back and the object was approx. 600ft behind us and 100ft in the air. He got a clear look at it and it was a diamond/cross shape with a slightly longer bottom section. There were golden lights on the two side sections spreading up and down along the vertical section. There was also a red glow on the top and bottom points, slightly spreading up and down along the ends of the vertical section. It followed us for a couple of seconds and then shot off very fast.

It was quite remote at the time, you had to travel down a five mile dirt road to get to it and it was completely secluded.  The guesthouse in which they resided faced a pasture of approximately 100 yards, which ended at the base of a very high, steap canyon wall.  Behind this wall was a drop off into the canyon with a running creek at the bottom.  My mother, one of my aunts, and myself were staying there for a visit.  On this particular night, they along with my grandmother were inside the house talking and my grandad and I were sitting out in the enclosed porch at the front of the house.  He was just beginning to tell me my nightly bedtime story  when we both noticed a yellow light, gradually growing and raising up from behind the far left side of the canyon wall at the end of the pasture.  He said &quot;What the hell is that&quot; and raised from his chair.  I was attracted to the pretty light and went for the door to go toward it.  He yelled at me and grabbed me back inside and at that moment we saw the object itself rise up from the same location.  It was a dark night but we could see that it was disc shaped by the illumination of it&apos;s own light; bright, bright yellow came from each of the large square windows, and apparently that created enough light to cast around the object and allow us to see it.  This next part is embarrassing because it sounds so science fiction, but the object made no sound except for the classic rather high pitched &quot;beep&quot; with approximately 1 second intervals.  It &quot;glided&quot; up slowly; I cannot describe the speed excep t to say that it was like counting &quot;1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 one thousand, etc.  It was traveling slowly, almost like cruising.  It made no darting or quick moves.  My grandad yelled &quot;Oh my God, oh my God!  It&apos;s a UFO!&quot;  Then he started screaming for my grandmother and my mom and my aunt, screaming their names and jumping up and down.  During all of this I was just staring at the object, loving the color and wanting to go toward it.  By the time he managed to stumble into the house the object had been slowly moving over the canyon wall to the right, and before he could get anyone to come out it had descended down behind the wall at the same speed at which it had appeared.  By the time the others got outside there was no sign of it.  For years afterward, Grandad was laughed at by family members; it didn&apos;t help that he was a practical joker.  But one time years later when I was in my early twenties, I was visiting him in his apartment in CA with my mother when someone brought up the UFO subject and I made the casual remark  &quot;like the one that Gramps and I saw&quot; and at that instant the 80 year old man jumped up and went nuts yelling &quot;You remember! YOU REMEMBER!&quot;   After that, nobody laughed at us anymore.  Through the sands of time, the details of the object&apos;s description had faded from my conscious memory.  Then about four years ago, I was in the public library in Show Low AZ; I live nearby.  I was waiting for the person that I&apos;d hitched a ride into town with to finish up and I picked up a book on unsolved mysteries, UFO sightings, etc.  As I was flipping through the book, a page turned and THERE IT WAS, MY UFO!  The reason I know it to be the same one is that the instant I saw the picture, all the breath left my body; I gasped and I fell back onto the wooden reference table and onto a man who was sitting there reading.  I&apos;ve seen lots of UFO pictures before and I&apos;ve never had that experience.  It was the same one; I&apos;d stake my life on it.  It was a black and white photo, and the caption said it had been taken in New Mexico in 1965.  I was just thinking about my favorite color throughout my childhood, it was the &quot;lemon yellow&quot; from the 64 count Crayola box.  I have only recently understood why, it was the same yellow as the lights coming from the craft.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This object was very far away up in the sky and stayed positioned in one spot all evening and until it could not be seen any longer after daybreak.  It changed or emitted colors bluish/green and orangish/red in flashes.  We could not make out the shape as the object was very far away and we were looking through binoculars.  The binoculars brought the colors into focus, otherwise it looked like a bright object.  What caught our attention was the brightness of the object and the fact that the object did not move from the same position and when we looked at it through binoculars we noted the color patterns. Fast forward three weeks until 10/28.  We noticed the same sentinel object in the northeastern sky as night fell.  This time my husband saw it go into position.  Also two other craft lined up in a triangle position and alternatively had a blinking pattern with the colors described above.  One or the other of the three objects would be brighter and exhibiting the colors.  At about the same time 19:30 in the northwestern sky we noticed 4 other bright objects in the sky with three of them making a triangular formation and the 4th object set back from one of the other three objects.  These four objects alternatively blinked brighter with the described colors.  We had dinner about 20:00 and at 20:30 went back outside to discover all but one object remained in the northeastern sky, the sentinel craft, in that one particular location in the northeastern sky that we noticed three weeks prior.

Its diameter appeared to be about that of a pea held at arm&apos;s length. It disappeared behind Mt. Rubidoux, which is just west of my location.

They were somewhat Oval/Egg shape.  I recall that they spun almost oblong looking in other words not perfectly round.  My brother asked me if I was seeing what he was seeing.  He had stopped the Car on the one way road near our mailbox that was near the Apricot/Walnut orchard trees.  I told him yes, what do you think it is ?  He said I believe they are UFO&apos;s and then he told me he was scared.  I did not take my eyes off the orange objects.  I was more frozen then anything out of fear of what we were seeing.  About that time I recall thinking to myself I wonder if anyone else is seeing what we are seeing.  All I saw on the right side in the distance of Hwy 25. was one car going by.  We were all alone on this one way road (McConnell).  About that time my brother asked me what we should do?  I said I don&apos;t know.  He said should we call the cops or should we just go home and tell our mom.  I wanted to keep looking at the objects.  But he started to get more scared of what we were seeing.

It had multiple small yellow lights on its underside that gave it the triangular shape.  There was no noise and the driver of the van did not see it as he was looking to the left.

As before it was much lower than a large passenger plane or blimp. It was around 8:30 this time so it was a little darker and the object seemed a little higher than in June, but I could see that it had no wings and no tail.  The direction of travel was about the same as the June sighting. There was too much crowd noise to be able to hear any sound from the object. I looked around to see if anyone else was looking at it and I could not detect anyone looking up. I tried to get the people I was with to look at the object but everyone was too busy having fun and talking. A simple glance and it would be mistaken for a plane. One would need to really look at it to realize it wasnt ordinary. We have one airport, Regional. The runway does not accomodate larger planes. Planes traveling across Missouri are always at a higher altitude than this object was. Small 2 or 4 seater planes fly over at a lower altitude and it is always easy to see detail such as wings and tail. The engine noise is audible as well.

The trajectory was straight and we were able to see it until it disappeared behind a row of trees.", "Four Check mark shaped lights seen in the night sky over Georgia, traveling west to east.While watching the sky to get a glimpse of the meteor shower caused by the Leonid Meteor, I observed 4 lights travelling from west to east in a set formation.  The lights maintained the same heading and did not break formation or streak like a shooting star.  The lights seemed very far away and were sort of dim, not bright and piercing like plane lights, but more like the glow of a low watt bulb.  Although the lights were travelling at a high altitude, they crossed the sky in seconds.  I did not witness any vapor entrails but it was night and the city lights in the distance did not allow for a good star-watch night. To imagine what the lights look like, make an upside down check mark.  The three points of the check mark would signify a light, but the long side had three lights evenly spaced.", "while driving along a highway i looked up at a cloud formation and saw moving slowly about 200 feet above the trees a gray metallic sphere i could see it as it passed behind a tree and reappeared in the open , i watch as it silently and slowly dematerialized and vanished while i watched. this was my second sighting of a similar object in 2 years((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As it neared at perhaps 5-6 miles per hour, the light was no longer showing on the huge dark oval and it still appeared to be just above ground level, and I realized crickets and other night sounds stopped.  The object drifted to a stop near a large old tree about 400-500 feet east of me along the road. Relating size to the old tree which was perhaps 40 feet tall, the object was easily 3 times taller and at least 10-12 times further across than high...a smooth oval with a flat bottom, too dark to find any detail at all.

PD))This incident occurred about October of 1956 or &lsquo;57.  At the time, I was Assistant station manager for a major airline in Anchorage as well as an experienced pilot. One of my men and I went on a caribou hunting trip between Nelchina and Tazlina, Alaska, several hours drive from Anchorage.  Without going into all of the minor details, we missed our hunting party and caught a ride into the bush with another party, hoping to find our group. We were dropped off and we hunted the next morning and that evening we caught a ride back in a jeep with some other hunters.  The trail we followed was on the top of a ridge about 600 feet above the valley.  At one point the trail zigzagged down the mountain ridge and at the bottom while heading to climb another smaller ridge, we became stuck in a wet swampy area.  A few more hunters came down the trail and we all attempted to get the vehicles out.  They became stuck too.  Failing this, two of the nine guys who were now there walked out to the highway to get a bug swamp buggy to pull us out. As we sat there talking, we saw and heard another jeep coming along the ridge.  They became stuck on the top of the ridge.  We could hear them pushing and pulling but they gave up and two of them walked down the trail to where we were.  The other two stayed with their jeep and meat. When these two were about half way down, we saw another light coming along the top of the ridge toward the stuck jeep.  The vehicle made no sound, no engine noise whatsoever.  The vehicle stopped some distance behind the stuck jeep and sat there for about one minute. All at once this object dropped or sped straight down the mountain ridge in seconds and it stopped instantly about &frac34; of the way from the bottom and began moving on in the same direction it had been going while up on the ridge.  It passed below the two hunters walking down the trail and continued on out of sight.  We could distinctly hear the men talking on the ridge with the jeep and the two who were walking down the trail. Yet we heard no sound from the object. It had a steady reddish orange light which did not blink or pulsate. The moon at the time was full and the sky was covered with a thin overcast and scattered clouds moving below them permitting some light reflecting on the snow.  So it was not completely dark.  We could just see the outline of the jeep against the night sky. None of us could tell the shape of the object which had sped so fast.  The two men on top of the ridge did not see the object at all.The side of the ridge was at about a 45 degree slope.  The terrain was full of scattered alders and there is no way a vehicle could make that vertical decent at that speed through the alders and stop instantly and continue on a horizontal path. None of us heard a sound of any type other than the jeep idling up on top the ridge and the other men talking.  I think all of us had the hair on our necks standing straight out. None of us had any idea of what this object was.  We could not tell if it was on the ground or if it was above the terrain.  And, yes we eventually were pulled out and got safely back to the highway.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They transported me into a huge ship, and escorted me through a hall to an another alien who was much taller, but identical in appearance. I thought the tall one was going to take me into a door on the left, but instead he took me to a glass room at the top of the craft. I saw 2 tall, beautiful, angelic-looking entities, male and female, with long, blondish-white hair, wearing glowing white robes. I asked them what they were doing here on earth. They said they were from a dying planet and took me there. I saw a dark, ancient city at the foot of a huge, craggy mountain, and realized it was built with technology unknown on earth. They explained that earth will one day be their home, and to accomplish this they have to mix their dna with ours in an attempt to fully adapt to earth&apos;s environment. The man told me that &quot;they are us and we are them.&quot; I asked the entities if there was a God. The answer was Yes. I asked them if they knew who God was and if they were connected to God.

He was a U.S. Navy veteran who worked on airplane electronics, so he was generally familiar with aviation technology. I was 12 at the time of the sighting, and my brothers were 9 and 7. I have only a vague recollection of the incident. Some years later, my mother also had an encounter with a UFO - a lighted, spinning disc she saw late at night on the neighbor&apos;s lawn.

The date was March 2, 1977. The kids were watching Grizzly Adams on TV and I just sat down myself, as I had just finished showering. [My wife] was in the bathroom, bathing. We heard a noise, a low roar much as a jet, but it sounded low, too low for a jet. I expected it was a helicopter, actually I believed it was a number of helicopters, because it did not sound like it was high enough to be a jet. The noise slowly became very loud, you could feel the vibrations!  Now I became puzzled, my mind expected certain familiar things to take place, and when they didn&apos;t, I was puzzled. I expected the &quot;slap-slaps&quot; the helicopter rotors make, but there wasn&apos;t any. Now I decided to investigate. The kids also were puzzled and said, &quot;What&rsquo;s that noise?&quot; &quot;Airplanes,&quot; I said. &quot;Stay here, I&apos;m going to see what I can see.&quot; I was sort of afraid of what I might find and didn&apos;t want the kids involved if it was bad. I went outside and saw 3 bright lights moving slowly, from northwest to southeast. They seemed low and close. The noise was very loud. My first impression was that it was 3 airplanes spaced in a triangular formation. They were not directly overhead but past me, and moving very steadily away from me. The lights were bright and they did not change relationship to each other, and I looked for but could not see the expected blinking red and green airplane running lights. This viewing occurred in a very short time span, say 10 or 15 seconds. I had on my eyeglasses, but decided to get my binoculars in the closet just inside the door. I ran in the house and took them out of their case but fumbled with the lens covers and wasted too much time returning outside. By now the lights were well past my observation point but still visible to me. I put the glasses on them and had only a second or two before the lights were obstructed by the branches of a leafless tree. I looked for another few seconds and only could see 3 bright lights. I took down the glasses and was going to move so the tree would not obstruct my view. I looked around and decided no other place gave an unobstructed view and put the glasses back up. I only found one light and just as I did, it went out. I presumed it went behind a tree branch, waited for it to reappear, but it didn&rsquo;t, so I presumed it went over the horizon. During the viewing interval, the noise remained strong for quite some time, even though the lights steadily moved away from me. When I had the binoculars the noise was diminishing, but I don&apos;t remember how it ended, whether it just stopped or droned on out of earshot. [My father added the following notes to his account some time afterward:]  This write-up was done after an interval of weeks after the incident. I wish I had done it the very next day. .. One point that my story doesn&apos;t make very well, the noise was TREMENDOUS!

At the time of this experience I was about 25 years old and I had about 150 hours of flying time. I was at this time also employed with an airline and had been for about two years.I was flying my plane from Minnesota to Anchorage, Alaska. I landed at Edmondton, Alberta and cleared with the Royal Canadian Air Force, getting briefed and permission to fly their airspace via the ALCAN highway. Just after sundown on 12 July, 1956, I was lying under the wing of my plane, half inside a sleeping bag, watching a plane shooting takeoffs and landings. As the plane landed and taxied into the hanger, I saw a blinking light approaching just above the hanger. I thought what is this idiot doing out of the traffic pattern. I sat up in my sleeping bag and watched as it grew closer. It looked so very low and as it got over the hanger I saw that it was round and the lights were not blinking, but the object was wobbling back and forth and this gave the illusion of the lights blinking. There was no sound. When directly over the main hanger, it appeared to be huge. I would say a few hundred feet in diameter. It was impossible to actually judge the size for I could not tell the altitude even though it looked to be no more than 100 feet above the buildings. I shucked out of my sleeping bag and turned on the ignition in my plane to radio the control tower, but the radio was completely dead, not even static. I then took a rough compass bearing and watched and timed the object as it passed over us. It went about due west, blinking all of this time for 20 minutes when it made roughly a 90 degree right turn and accelerated and was out of sight in less than 10 seconds. I tried to call the tower again on my radio, and I was able to get through to them, but then decided I had better not report this information or I might be held up from leaving for Alaska for several days, or maybe even be refused permission to continue my trip.

Instead, my roomate noticed a very distant flickering blue light in the Southern sky.  It was just slightly larger than a star, but moved slowly back and forth across the sky.  We returned to our patio several times throughtout the night to track it&apos;s movement.  It was clearly not a satelite, due to the fact that it moved in several different directions.

We turned south towards Cranberry Flats when I saw two very dark objects speed over us. I ignored them, thought they were birds (maybe they were). Then I started noticing streams of light going over the road, at first they looked like falling stars and kept going from left to right. Then they starting sort of going back and forth, like two of them swirling, but I rationalized it as the reflection of our headlights against power lines. They also kept changing colour, the ones we noticed were purple, green, orange, blue, yellow, and white. I should also say they started out very thin, and slowly swelled up into the size of large ovals. The further we got to Cranberry Flats, the brighter they got, two white ovals slowly circling each other. At this point I was trying to rationalize it as spotlights. Neither my friend or I were saying anything to each other, I didn&apos;t want to say something in case I was totally hallucinating, and I didn&apos;t mind it if I was hallucinating. Anyway, the further out of town we get the brighter it is. Total silence, we miss the turn off to Cranberry Flats and she pulls into a side road to turn around to go back to the Flats. At this point I notice that the lights hovering and swirling in the sky are staying in one place. I think at this point I said to her &quot;What are those?&quot;  &quot;You noticed them too.&quot;  We turn around and start driving back into town, neither of us wants to look back. This time back into town I realize: There are no power lines going across the road. They are all along the side of the road. We&apos;re starting to compare notes and realizing we&apos;ve seen exactly the same thing. Both of us are terrified. Then my friend stops along the roadside to get out and see if they&apos;re still there, and they are, so she freaks out and jumps into the car. We keep driving until the turn off going east, and we look back and they are still there, still glowing white ovals. We&apos;re finally in town, I&apos;m still freaked out, and we go to Diefenbaker to see if we can see them from there. Sure enough, there&apos;s those two swirling lights. She drives me home and then after much debate convinces me to go out there with her again. And so I do, after MUCH reluctance. Anyway, we get back to Diefenbaker by about 11:30 and they&apos;ve changed. They&apos;re still swirling, but this time they&apos;re green and acting somewhat like northern lights, just the way you see energy ripple off them. Some other people in the park seemed to be seeing them too. We drive to a couple other places in the city to see if we can see them from there, nada. Then we get some binoculars and go back out to look at them. This is about three hours after they first appeared, about 1 in the morning. This time, they&apos;re more like green ovally lights, without the nerthern-light type ripple, but they&apos;re moving COMPLETELY differently. Sometimes they swirl, sometimes they flash on and off. Sometimes they just speed past each other. Sometimes they change direction, sometimes they drive bomb, and just as we were driving away I also noticed them leap frogging and chasing each other. Also twice during our sightings they went from just a glow to a solid light. I should mention it was cloudy so they might have been in the clouds.

No sound.  Drawing attached.I noticed a object in the evening sky about 20 degrees above the western horizon.  It seemed to be stationary for quite some time. I gave the object notice because with naked eye it seemed to display a combination of red, blue, and white lights.  I got out my 8x30 binoculars and viewed the object.  I could not determine the distance of the object, but I may guess it to be 4 to 5 miles away. The binoculars were not bringing in the detail so I got out a inexpensive telescope from Costco and focused onto the object.  At first when the object came into focus I thought something was wrong with the telescope and I checked the lens and then turned it onto a star.  The star seemed normal. The object looked like a 3/4 spherical framework.  Almost like the infamous Death Star in the movie Star Wars, except it had no skin just the framework lines and what appeared to be black sky in between the framework. After viewing it for several minutes I asked my wife to take a look.  I didn&apos;t tell her what I saw.  I just asked her to take a look and tell me what she saw.  She saw the same object.  Then I asked my 10 year old daughter to take a look and she saw the same thing. The strangest thing about this object is with the naked eye or field glasses the observer could only see the red, blue, and white lights and viewing the object through the telescope the observer could only see the framework with no colored lights visiable.

Just about a 1/8 to a quarter of a mile up from where I turned onto Route 50 from the road that goes to Walmart&apos;s parking lot, I saw bright lights coming at a high rate of speed directly towards the road I was on and in my direction... (ie- the lights were coming straight to me and the few other surrounding vehicles driving around me). At first sighting, it was about a mile or two away in the sky.  I thought to myself that it was an awfully bright light for a plane, and I started looking for the FAA lights.  I didn&apos;t see any FAA lights on the plane.  I then thought to myself to grab my camera phone and try to snap a shot of what I was seeing.  I came up to the light on route 50 at Thoms Run Road.  It was a red light about to turn green.  This is not more than a 1/8 of a mile from when I made first sight of it.  At that point, the lighted craft was in plain sight, about hundred feet in front of me, and maybe and about three hundred feet to my right.  I&apos;m not sure how high up in the sky it was, as it was moving very quickly, and I&apos;m not very good at determining how high in the sky stuff is.At this point, the craft appeared to be somewhat circular in shape- the front of it facing me looked like a half circle or bananna kind of shape parallel to the horizon), and appeared to have lights surrounding the part of the craft facing me, but not on it&apos;s rear.  These lights, about 7 or 8 ( a guestimation), all seemed to blend into one horizontal light around the front of the craft...and much brighter than any aircraft I have seen before.  Traffic then started moving again, and cars were going very slow, curious about what the object was.  I snapped a picture of it at this point, and as it saved, the craft came very close to my car, directly above it.  At this point, the craft appeared to be triangular in shape, with a very bright light eminating from the center of it.  Then the craft moved in a circle from where it was, went behind my car, and came back around.  I snapped another picture of it when it came back around, moving in  what appeared to be a complete circle...and then it flew out of my sight in a north/north eastern direction- moving very quickly.I got two pictures on my camera cell phone, both show the date and time to be the same.  That should tell you how quickly this was moving.After seeing it, I did notice another airplane as I drove further down route 50, and it was much higher in the sky than the one I could not identify, and I could clearly make out the FAA lights.  It is typical to see low flying planes here in Bridgeville, as we are close to the Pittsburgh Airport (about ten to fifteen miles away).  The craft I could not identify was much lower than anything I have seen here before.When I got home, I decided to take a better look at the pictures with my roommate.  He is a paranormal investigator, and can, most often, disprove a lot of things that people can&apos;t indentify.  After zooming in on the images, neither of us could identify what this object was.My professional background is mostly in mental health, as a program director.  My personal background- I have an interest in the paranormal, and volunteer heavily for a paranormal research and investigation group.", "Five bright blue lights in formation streak across sky without making a soundI was taking my one year old daughter down to the end of our driveway to pick up our empty trash can, when I noticed a seeming change in the darkness around us, as though something was lighting up the night.  There are two houses being built beside us, so I thought that maybe a car or someone at one of the houses had turned on very bright lights.  As I was quickly processing this info, I happened to look up and saw five very bright blue lights absolutely zoom across the night sky, in single file formation, without making a sound.  When I noticed the lights, they were almost directly overhead, perhaps a few thousand feet in the air, and they disappeared after only a few seconds, as they vanished into the distance.  I could not tell whether they simply flew out of view, or actually turned off, but they had obviously been visible before I noticed them overhead, as their light was so bright that, in the few seconds before I looked up, I had felt their light all the way down to ground level. At the same time, a neighbor across the street was out on her porch, calling her dogs in, and after they disappeared from view, I asked her if she had seen the same thing I had just witnessed.  She said that she had.  I asked her what she thought it was, and she had no idea.  About 1 minute after the lights disappeared, a very distant boom could be heard, almost like a sonic boom from miles and miles away, but without any visible signs.  About 5 minutes later, another boom was heard, again without any visual cues to what was going on, and then nothing more happened the rest of the night.", "4 CYLINDER OR CIGAR SHAPED CRAFT WOVE AND DANCED A PATH TO THE SUNSET.WHILE SITTING ON FRONT PORCH AT 4:40 P.M.

PD))Dear Sir,  I have always heard that UFO sightings date back to the end of WWII, but I know about one that was witnessed by my own grandfather and 9-year-old uncle in 1942.The place was Montagny, a small village in the centre of France.  Time of the year:  Autumn, the day before the Allies landed in North Africa.It happened at night.  My grandfather and uncle had gone out to a farm to buy potatoes, in spite of the curfew, imposed by occupying Germany.They were in a hollow ((empty??)) lane, in the dark, when suddenly a thing, saucer-shaped, with a &quot;window-like in a train compartment, started next to them from behind a hedge.The thing hovered there for a moment, then went away at a tremendous speed, without making any noise.  Planes were so noisy then that they made the ground shake, when there were a lot of them at a time.You can imagine their fright!  My grandfather died in 1975, but he still trembled and shook when he told that story.  My uncle died a year ago, and he hated talking about it.It is absolutely out of the question that my grandfather invented that story.  Also, he told the family immediately, well before people started talking of U.F.O.&rsquo;s.He told the story to a distant cousin, who had been a colonel in the French army, but apart from that, the story has never been outside the family.  My grandfather would not have like any publicity about it.As he said, it could not be something immaterial because it made some dead leaves swirl on the ground.It could not be a hallucination because they both saw the same thing.Was it something human-made?... a German spy plane, or something like that?  Maybe, but I have yet to see a saucer-like plane that moves without making a noise.So, what was it?  If you know, I&rsquo;d be glad to know, too.I don&rsquo;t think many people saw that thing, because there weren&rsquo;t many people wandering outside at night in Nazi-occupied France in 1942!  (But if you heard about similar sightings, I&rsquo;d like to know, too)  Yours Sincerely,  ((name deleted))", "Triangular Shaped Craft with a bright light on each tipI was standing outside my house smoking (about 120th &amp; Colorado Blvd) Looking up at the sky and on the far horizon was a craft.

A perfect triangle aircraft with 1 bright light on each tip and a multi color beacon in the middle. The craft was flying below the clouds (low cloud cover because of the cold front so about 5,000 ft) and went from horizon to horizon in about a minute and a half. (From the south to the north parallel to the Rocky Mountains) I got a very good look at the craft and because of the light reflection off the cloud cover I was able to see very good detail.

The part of the road we were on at the time was a couple of miles from the town and was quiet enough apart from the fireworks a couple miles away in the distance. The objects appeared to be travelling int a straight line, one after the other, around 1000 metres from me and were about 3 or 4 hundred metres apart. I would estimate their speed to have been around 150mph and their size around 7-10 metres across. I initially thought they may be fighter craft flying a sortie locally as we have quite a lot of that sort of thing here but there was no engine sound and they were far too slow. I would have had them down as flames from hot air balloons but a) it was dark and b) they were too fast. I stopped the car when I saw the second light and lowered the window &amp; switched off the engine. The third light then flew across my field of vision. As I already stated, there was no engine noise, just the sound of fireworks in the distance, which was strange. Their flight path seemed odd too. They were travelling in a straight line, in single file, yet once they were over the town they elevated by some distance, i would guess perhaps 50 metres and then continued their path north by north east towards the river Humber.

The lower ball would dart in and out of line, from left to right (south to north), then would get back in line.

As it got closer, I could see that it was actually in the shape of a triangle(when viewed from underneath) with rounded edges.  When compared with the size of a large, full moon, it would have been slightly smaller in the sky about 95% of the time we viewed it, except the short time it went almost directly over top of where we were. It didn&apos;t go directly over top of us, however it was very close and as it went over top of us I could see that there was something protruding from the center of the underbelly that had a red light that was in the shape of a sphere. At this point I could tell that it was between eighty five and a hundred and ten feet in the air. The whole time it did not make a sound and the interesting thing that I noticed was that it seemed like every coyotye in ear shot was howling seemingly at whatever we were witnessing. There were other lights around the edges of the craft and they seemed to be a bright white. As we watched it, I saw that it seemed to be going straight up and down five to ten feet in short, quick spurts or jerks similiar to seeing a piece of metal bouncing or being pushed around between two magnets.  After noticing this I was suddenly struck with absolute terror, as it suddenly became clear to me that compared to this, I was nothing more than an ant, to possibly be stepped on at any moment. At this point my girlfriend and I were so frightened and overwhelmed that we ran into the house and after a few panicky moments decided to wake my mother.  Soon the three of us were outside attempting to find this thing in the sky again, and to my surprise, in that short period of time, the object had suddenly switched to the opposite corner of the sky(southwest) though still very visible.  We watched it float towards the southwest for anothr minute or two until all of a sudden it just disappeared as if someone flipped a light switch.  That was the last we saw of the object.", "orb in the cloudsstrange orb in 2nd of 2 pictures taken of the same cloud, many minutes apart.

I&apos;m an amateur astronomer and was out looking for Leonid meteors, when I caught a very faint object approaching from the NW and moving to the SE.  At first I thought it was a very thin and long cloud, but as it came overhead I noticed a more chevron shaped &quot;head&quot; with a long tail...much like a traditional kite.  The really odd thing was there were very faint pinpoint lights (the magnitude of average stars seen from a suburban location) evenly spaced along the entire length.  As it moved from directly overhead I thought it might be a very low flying cargo plane or something, but it made no sound at all and there were no flashing/colored navigation lights.

I thought that it was a balloon, but noticed that it seemed motionless.  I would guess that it was well above 5,000 feet in altitude. The object was whitish/ silver and seemed to be the size of an airliner, but it was difficult to judge, since it was so high up and there was no other reference points in the clear blue sky.  This object stayed in the same location for about 3 minutes. I was distracted briefly by a phone call and when I returned to the sky, I noticed that the object had disappeared.

We got off early (5:00 a.m.) and went for a soak in the hot tub.  Upon watching the beautiful clear sky, i soon thought that i had  spotted a sattelite.  It then proceeded to move, stop, reverse, turn, accelerate, and zig-zag all around but remained within the same basic airspace.  It looked very high (out of the atmospere) and i estimate its position to be about over Denver or Colorado Springs.  The color was that of a yellowish star, the luminosity was about like a medium star, and it looked bigger than the sattelites which began to appear at about first light (approximately 6:00).  The speed at which the object moved and changed course was phenominal and somewhat disturbing to me.  The random motions left me astonished and wondering, &quot;what are they doing up there?&quot;.  Thats no ((one word deleted))t, i promiss...", "The object first appeared in the north sky.  My attention was drawn to what initially appeared to be a shooting star.  The first thing I saw was a flare of light moving at an extremely high rate of speed.  I was essentially facing directly north when I first sighted it.  The object was traveling downward and to my right (east).  As I watched the object it appeared to change course slightly - flaring to a more horizontal trajectory that was now headed generally southeast.  As the object changed course, I could clearly see a dimly lighted boomerang shaped object.  The delta shape was covered with soft, orange colored lights.  The fact that I was on a lighted residential street, along with the speed of the object and relatively soft lights eminating from it, made it hard to distinguish more detail.  While it was not possible to see in great detail, there was no question of its perimeter form.  From the time the object changed course until it vanished from sight was no more than 2 to 3 seconds.  It was traveling at approximately the same speed one might associate with a shooting star - extremely fast.  It was a fairly clear night with gusty winds.  As the object receded out of sight, I listened intently for any indication of noise.  There was none.  Given the incredible speed it was traveling, I would have expected a sonic boom.  There was only silence. I was by myself, walking the dog at the time of the sighting.  While the initial flare of light may have caused others to look up, the remainder of the sight time happened so fast and with such minimal illumination, that it would have taken someone in nearly the same circumstances I was in, to see the same thing.  It happened so fast and was obscure enough that it was one of those instances where you had to be at the right place and right time. This sighting took place approximately 45 miles northwest of Ellsworth Air Force Base near Rapid City, SD.  I am accustomed to seeing both commercial and military air trafiic in the area at all hours of the day and night.  So, it seemed logical that there was a military connection given a flying object and proximity of an air base.  However, to travel across 1/4 of the night sky in 4 to 5 seconds is simply impossible by conventional standards.  The speed at which it left my sight was so great, it&apos;s difficult to effectively describe. The distance away and size of the object are difficult to quantify.  Given that it started out appearing as a shooting star the perception was that it was near the edge of the earth&apos;s atmosphere.  However, as it corrected its course and leveled out, it appeared to be within 3 to 5 miles and roughly the same size, or slightly larger than that of a commercial aircraft. I tried to call the control tower at the air base but was not able to find anyone willing to look into this.  I&apos;m not surprised.  I would guess that UFO sightings are almost always met with a high level of suspicion and doubt.  I have tried to logically explain what I saw and am left with nothing that makes any sense at all. I am a college graduate and active, local businessman.  My practical nature begs for an explanation that meets with some earthly criteria.  While I am intrigued at the prospect of extra terrestial life, I would best be described as an interested skeptic.  Although much of what happened defies explanation, I do know this - I clearly saw an object appear and disappear within 4 to 5 seconds.  During that time, I clearly saw a boomerang or delta shape that was covered with soft glowing orange lights.  What I saw was moving at a speed that so far exceeds what we are familiar with that it simply was not an aircraft as we know it.", "2 BLACK OBJECTS SLOWLY TUMBLING ACROSS SKY PERFECTLY SPACED APARTMYSELF AND A CO-WORKER WERE STANDING ON THE DOCK @ MY JOB LOOKING WEST @ THE SETTING SUN WHEN I NOTICED 2 BLACK OBJECTS AT ABOUT 20,000 FEET SLOWLY MAKING THERE WAY FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST.

He said to look out front. I went outside to see 4 very bright lights to the east. They appeared to be quite some distance away but were as bright as the street lights that were just coming on. 2 of them sat perfectly still while the other 2 darted in and out of some low clouds. The 2 lights appeared to be from the same craft. After a few trips into the clouds, the lights stopped perfectly still. The other 2 lights then took off in a zig zagging pattern. The light streaked behind following the movement pattern. Eventually, all the lights disappeared. The speed of the movement was amazing. During all of this, two of my room mates came home and my neighbors were watching. Everyone saw the same thing.There was an Air Show in San Diego that weekend, but it was to the north west of my house. I attended the air show and nothing there made any movements even remotely similar to what we saw the day before.

So when we got another half mile or so down the road,I was surprised to see what at first looked like a third tower.Actually I assumed it was another tower because of the strobe/beacon that I saw flashing.As we got closer I noticed that the light was flashing much more quickly than the lights on the towers.(and,by the way,flashing about twice the speed of a normal aircraft strobe that can be seen in the sky on any given night.) I said to my wife,&quot;What the hell is that?&quot; She only glanced at the light.(We were returning from the Erie,PA veterens hospital because her dad was there recovering from a collapsed lung...so she was thinking about her dad and not a light flashing along the expressway) As we got closer,still...almost beneath this thing,the strobe was obscured by the &apos;body&apos; of the object.It was a very dark night with no moon.Whatever this thing was,it was as black as the sky.I couldnt really tell how big it was as it was invisible against the dark sky.No outline was visible at all.Now here is the thing that tells me this was not a stationary helicopter or something...and also the part that scared me. As we passed the object I kept looking up at it through my drivers side window. I saw a rectangular opening on the bottom of the object. The opening was about the size of a small car. I could see a grate or screen up inside there through which was visible a pulsing,glowing orange/red light which sort of looked like the pulsing glow of the hot coals at the base of a campfire. I&apos;ve seen lots of helicopters and they all have lights and numbers on the bottom or say police or sheriff and have visible landing wheels or skids on them.I&apos;ve never seen a helicopter a with pulsing,glowing rectangular opening on the bottom.By the way,the object was close up to the road...just over the tree line.The opening was about as high as the top of a 4 or 5 story building.We heard no sound as it was January and we had the car windows rolled up tight...and we were driving around 60 miles an hour.I have to admit that I began to panic a bit on the inside!

As I was coming to the dam, about a half mile away, I saw a red light, probably about 5000 feet up or so (purely a guess).  It was a bright red light, with another red flashing light next to it.  I thought it was an airplane of some sort at first, but this was drifting far slower than airplanes we normally see.  Too, the flashing red light just didn&apos;t look right.  The lights were big, not the small red lights one usually sees on an aircraft.  Too, there were no other lights. Most aircraft usually have a flashing white light, don&apos;t they? Regardless, the lights were vertically overhead when I saw them, and drifted ever so slowly to the south.  As I got to the dam, the lights had only moved a bit to the south, no more so that I was still looking up about 45-50 degrees over the horizon.  It was no where near going behind the horizon or the mountains here.  But, the lights both went out and I could not see any craft, or lights any more.  The night was clear and cold, and there were no clouds for the lights to disappear behind.  I had also opened the window when I first noticed them, but heard no sound of airplane or helicopter engine.", "Crescent-shaped object observedMy wife and I were sitting on our patio at about 11:00 PM on 18 Nov 06 watching the skies for Leonid meteors. I was looking nearly straight up when I saw an object entering my field of view from the north.  My first impression was that it looked like a parafoil, but a second later, it was clear that it was something else entirely and very strange. It was shaped like a deeply-bowed crescent with pointed tips, dimly illuminated by city lights, not obviously metallic, not glowing or showing lights. I called it to my wife&apos;s attention and she saw it as it passed almost directly overhead going south. There was no sound. The heading remained constant and in just a few seconds, it was lost in the darkness. It crossed approximately 45 degrees in about five to ten seconds. There was no way of determining its size or distance, but we both had the impression that it was relatively low, small, and fast. It did not seem to be a flock of birds or a single bird. The shape was constant...no fluttering or wavering. It seemed like an artificial object. It did not resemble any aircraft I&apos;m familiar with.", "UFO IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERTI WAS A TRUCK DRIVER BACK THEN RUNNING WEST COAST TEAMS; MY PARTNER WAS IN THE BUNK SLEEPING AT THE TIME.

Also to note I witnessed my neighbors Lights Flickering Off and On during the Event of the UFO siting.   Earthquakes happen here all the time HOW EVER if you read this article you will read that this one was differant. Free-Lance Newspaper  Small Quake Rattles Hollister, California Thursday, November 30, 2006  Hollister - Hollister residents received a jolt Wednesday afternoon when a mostly harmless 4.0 earthquake struck the county, followed by two smaller quakes. &quot;Of course, in San Benito County you get so many earthquakes,&quot; said Steve Walter, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. &quot;But this one was a little unusual.&quot;  The quake struck at 1:20pm, with its epicenter located near the intersection of Freitas and Mitchell roads, roughly three miles west of Hollister and five miles east of San Juan Bautista. It was ranked as a 4.0 or &quot;light&quot; earthquake on the Richter scale, with a 1.0 being a microquake and a 10 being a quake of awesome force. The quake originated 1.9 miles below the surface of the earth. This was followed by a microquake ranking 2.8 at 1:38pm. A third, even smaller microquake may have occurred afterward but was not confirmed by the USGS by press time. Neither the Hollister Police Department or San Benito County Sheriff&apos;s Department received any calls reporting damage. The quake was unusual for two reasons, Walter said. San Benito County quakes most often originate from the San Andreas Fault area, or the Calaveras Fault. This one took place from a point between the two and cannot be confirmed to have originated from either. It was the first 4.0 or greater quake to have occurred in the area between the faults since at least 2000, according to the USGS. Also, most local earthquakes are characterized by horizontal motion, as the earth&apos;s plates move past one another. This quake, however, moved in a vertical fashion. &quot;There were elements of horizontal motion, but most of it was vertical, and that&apos;s rare (in the area),&quot; Walter said. The quake could have been felt as far north as Pleasanton and as far south as Monterey, Walter said. One quake report on the USGS Web site came from San Diego, but Walter said it was highly unlikely. &quot;Sometimes people hear there was an earthquake and think, &apos;Oh, that was what I felt,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;When usually it&apos;s just something like a truck going by.&quot;", "I was out side at about 7:30 at night with my telescope, when I happened to look up at the sky and saw what I at first thought was a shooting star until I noticed a single red light on it&apos;s side.I took a guess that there must have been a light on the other side to.It was flying at an incredible speed,somewhere around the speed of light.I wasn&apos;t able to see any thing else because before I knew it,it was gone.", "Three bright lights, red, white, and blue.On nov. 29, 2006.

Probably a hoaxed report.  PD))", "Unusual wide ring of flattened field-corn found NW of Harrisburg, PAOn October 28, 2006 a local turkey hunter who was working the edges of a remote farm field stumbled upon a large (90 ft. +/- overall diameter) flattened ring in field corn, which abutted one edge of the field.  The flattened ring was subsequently rough-measured to be approximately 30 ft. wide, with a standing center section of about 30 ft.  The 8-9 ft. tall corn plants were all laid in a counter-clockwise swirl around the center section of standing plants.  The hunter further reports a &quot;path&quot; off one side of the ring which appeared to him to be part of the formation.  From the photos provided it appears that some of the plants were not completely flattened to the ground, and some appear to be broken at the 2nd or 3rd stem node from the ground--in spite of the hunter&apos;s assertion that he observed no cut or broken stems.  The &quot;path&quot; was not photographed clearly enough to determine it&apos;s width or length. The hunter, who hunts this posted land with permission from the owner, estimated that the ring had occurred some 1-2 weeks previously, although this is really a guess.  He reports no high-power electric lines near the field but notes that there is a creek running along one side. We are told that the land-owner does not allow access to his remote farm generally, but a MUFON researcher reported no evidence of radiation on his visit to the site.  No compass work was carried out and there is no information regarding the plant stem nodes.  No samples were taken. From the photos we observe what looks like a fairly typical cropcircle flow to the lay of the plants; we note that a ring in corn is rare (most events in corn are flattened circles) and also point out the relatively large (30 ft.) width of this ring.  These facts, along with the very remote location, suggest that this event is not man-made although, without on-site observation and sampling, it is impossible to be certain.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Nancy Talbott, President of the BLT Research Team, of Cambridge, MA, for her contribution in investigating this case.", "new aircraft in super quiet and slow mode.I was driving north on 65 highway and just cross the missouri river bridge and to the west spotted a object with a large amount of lights flashing on it.

As a matter of fact, that was the first thing I noticed when I turned onto Boyero Road, the moon was really beautiful and the clouds were kind of flowing over it.  As I was coming off my road and heading west on Boyero, I noticed five bright, whitish, orange lights moving from south to north, towards Colorado Springs, Colorado.  They were about the size of big headlights.  I stopped my vehicle right away and got out, as they were coming directly at me.  There was one out in front, two others above and below, and then another behind the two middle ones with 3-4 smaller redish, orange lights directly behind.

What made it really creepy was there was no sound, no sound at all, it was dead silent outside.  The area is very rural and you usually at least hear crickets, but it was dead silent outside, no crickets, no dogs barking, no breeze or wind, absolutely nothing at all.  It was dead still.

But let me start by telling you about myself.I live in Fairfield, CA and  I am 19 years old. The way the sightning began was. I was first driving in my car going home to my apartment around 11:45pm on December 5th 2006 and I saw a red firework go off in the sky toward the Air Base(I actullay have no clue if it was an actual firework; It looked like a regular big red firework alot of red little dots in a circle shape). And then the trees blocked my veiw. I immediatly told my girlfriend. She kinda got excited and wanted to see. So I told her toward to look toward Travis(AFB). We hit a couple corners toward the house and had an open view and no fireworks... So we get into my apartment parking lot and shes still looking back for the fireworks. And I notice a red light in the sky straight infront of us while I was driving toward my parking space. My girlfriend tells me... &quot;Do you see that?&quot; I replyed with a confirmed face and nod. &quot;What is that?&quot; It looked to be a &quot;Red Star&quot; very bright. Like a dot or light. I hit a corner in my parking lot and parked to get out to look. There it is... a weird red star looking thing. So I call a homeboy accross town to instruct him to go outside and look toward my apartments. This is around 11:50pm He does and laughs. &quot;What is that?&quot; No Clue. A red light shining in the sky. Shortly after I called him the red dot started pulsing.. Slowing... But pulsing. Bright and Dim. While I was on the phone with him a white light came from the middle of the red dot and shot BRIGHT real fast and a white line traced down from the bottom. It looked like a white tracer bullet but shot out and only went a very short distance away from the bottom of the red light. I was still on the phone with my homie and he had 3 people with him that all seen it. After the white light shot down, it was once again solid red. I then noticed it was moving down slowly. I got off the phone with my friend and then my girlfriend cal! led her mother. Told her and she had 3 other people with her. We all seen it there are 9 of us in 3 different parts of town. When it dissapered it started moving to the right and then started to pulse faster but still slow.(Maybe  each about 700ms&quot;) and then did the same thing the white tracer line thing did and shot down about an inch in my eyes and dimmed away with a consistant pulse. It all happend for about 10 minutes It stopped about midnight to the minute. What I think happend if it was an alien =P. Is that of course they would be smart and they wouldnt go into lightspeed parallel from us. They would go away from us...

I witnessed several of these coming from all directions, traveling relatively slow and making no sound.  This was not the half of it!!!!  Several craft were to pass over that night such as various orbs that seemed to &quot;spin&quot;, they would appear out of nowhere.  Some traveled across the sky, and some remained stationary.  At one point two red orbs appeared out of the Eastern sky traveling in tandom, this really freaked me out and I called on my wife to come outside and see this.

It traveled very fast and disappeared, moments later in the direction of washington dc,( i was in arlington, i live pretty close to dc.) i saw flashed of light which behind the clouds looked like explosions. and if they were explosions i would have heard about it on the news.also dc as a restricted airzone, so im completely stumped on this one. we were hoping to find more sighting by anyone else, which is why im posting this. the event took place from 12:32-12:33 cant be too sure because we came back in and it was 12:34.", "I almost had a close encounter of the third kind.  Have unique scar on right knee.

We heard nothing.  with that I jumped into the drivers seat and turned the Winnebago around driving out of the forest.  It started moving and I stopped looking in the large trucker mirrors.

I didn&apos;t pay much attention at first because we are near the Richmond Airport but I then noticed that it was not flying in a straight line such as a normal plane would. I slowed down and pulled off the side of the road as my girl-friend screamed at me for doing so but it was flying as if it was circling looking for something. I watched it go from what seemed like about ten miles in about 2 or 3 seconds. It was what looked like over the airport then it was over the field in front of my neighborhood in a flash. It seemed like it was almost checking me out as it passed over I heard a hissing noise and there were blue and green lights on the bottom and side of the triangular shaped craft. It didn&apos;t send out any beams or any type of lights to search around but it seemed like some of the colored lights were flashing more rapidly than the others. The whole time my girlfriend was yelling at me to get into the car and she saw it but didn&apos;t have any interest in it other than to say lets get the heck out of here. This is the first time I have ever seen anything of this nature and I don&apos;t know if it was the same craft everyone else had seen or even if this was some government craft we don&apos;t know about. However being a flight enthusiast myself I know that no known craft could perform the flight characteristics displayed that night. I don&apos;t drink or do drugs and was not on any medication so I know what I saw and nobody can convince me otherwise but I sure would like to know what the heck it was. I can say this much if I had doubts of UFO&apos;s before I have been totally convinced after witnessing this that we are NOT alone after all. I think the government needs to come forward with the information that it has concerning UFO&apos;s and tell the truth because sooner or later one is going to land on the Whitehouse lawn and ! then its all over. I have always believed in this stuff because in being a devout christian I find it hard to believe that GOD would have created such a vast Universe and that we are the only creatures that enhabit the entire Universe. It seems like an aweful waste of space. My girlfriend will not talk much about what happened that night and she doesn&apos;t like to watch shows about stuff of this nature but one thing is for sure what we saw scared the heck out of her and she no doubt is a believer now even though she won&apos;t talk about it to much. I will close with saying thank you for allowing me to talk about this because I didn&apos;t know who to talk to and even if someone would believe me or think I was nuts but I want to thank you for being about to tell my story without being ridiculed. I only wish that I had a camera or something that I could have used to support what I saw because it hung around for what seemed like forever but it was only a couple of minutes but long enough to realize that this craft was not a conventional ship that we know of at this time thats for sure.", "Large rings on dry lake bed visible from the air - photo includedOver the weekend, my partner and I flew a Stearman to Palm Springs.  About halfway there, we discovered a hard packed dry lake bed.  Upon looking closer, we noticed two perfect circles (one inside the other) with a line connecting the two.  These circles are at least 100 yards across (Maybe much larger;  hard to tell).  From the ground we noticed they are not at all visible (we landed to check it out).  There was one set of car tire tracks which could easily be seen from the ground and we could see the tracks left from our landing, but these perfect circles were not visible from the ground - only from the air.  We could think of no &quot;reasonable&quot; or logical explanation for these markings. Also, as the light changed they became harder to see from the air.

Honestly, I&apos;m not really sure of the time of year, but it seems like it was winter, no cloud cover, clear night sky.  I was coming home from work as a bartender..no, I had not been drinking. I&apos;m guessing at the time, somewhere between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. as the bar closed at one, and I was usually out of the building by 1:30-1:45 headed south towards Elk River, which was where I was living at the time. There is a large gravel pit that I passed by each night on my way home, and this night, as I approached I saw, briefly, what looked like along the ridge at the top of the pit, was a line of red lights.  My first thought was that it was a line of semi trucks parked along the ridge. But what I saw was at least the entire length of the ridge of the pit, and I can&apos;t say now if it was one long light, or many lights, but whatever it was was just above the ridge, directly above treeline.  Then, it was gone, the row of lights just went down, below the ridge..at least that&apos;s how it seemed. No one end moved faster than the other, there was no angles..it just droped below the horizon of the ridge and was gone.I drove by a few days later, daylight hours, to get an idea of what the ridge looked like during the day, if there was a road along the ridge, what, exactly was there.There was no road along the ridge where the lights were.  There was a road that led to an area near the ridge, but nothing at the ridge.  To be fair, it was even difficult at the time to estimate the size, or length of what I saw that night, but going back to look at it in the daylight I&apos;d have to say bigger than a football field in length, much bigger.  I didn&apos;t see anything besides the lights..no shadows of any kind, nothing to indicate that there was anything but lights, although I know that&apos;s not likely.  Looking at the &apos;Characteristics of The object&quot; section in this web form, I will select &apos;There were lights in the object&apos; only because that&apos;s all I saw..I didn&apos;t actually see an object..just lights.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

She turned to see the B-2 bomber (Stewart Air Force base is just across the Hudson River from her location, so military planes are not unusual) hovering motionless for at least two minutes.  It was very low (maybe a few hundred feet), had no lights at all, and made a whistling, whooshing sound.  She ran into her house to grab her camera, and when she returned to her yard it could be heard, but not seen.   An hour later she saw it a second time, this time moving unnaturally slowly, but not quite hovering, as it made it&apos;s way east.  She took pictures which are yet to be developed.  Three days later the local newspaper ran a picture of the B-2 supposedly taken over Hyde Park, N.Y. (my sister&apos;s hometown) with a short blurb about the bomber flying over the town.  This is the first I&apos;ve heard of the plane being able to hover.  My sister was absolutely sure of this, as she witnessed the craft at very low altitude, less than quarter mile distant for at least two minutes.The B-2 is exactly the shape as the Hudson Valley U.F.O. from the early 80&apos;s, and is entirely similar to countless reports of boomerang, or chevron shaped sightings.  I believe this is significant.

It was slowly pulsing and traveling at an amazing speed. The speed it was traveling at led me to believe it was at a low altitude.  It was completely silent, except for a faint noise of some kind of engine, barely audible. Then, just as it passed the moon, it vanished, and there was no trace of anything out of the ordinary once again. The street i was on was completely empty, and it was almost pitch black outside.  At first i thought  this was a shooting star or a plane, but everything seemed wrong about it.

I stared at it for a moment to watch it twinkle and noticed it changed colour. It distinctly changed from red to blue to bright yellow and green. I went inside and told my spouse about it and ask him to come see it. They recommended I get the binoculars. So we looked through the binoculars, taking turns and were amazed and baffled by what we saw. It was an object suspended in the air that seemed to have at least three lights on it, maybe more, that I could see. The lights covering this object change colours constantly, from red to blue to bright yellow to green to blue to red again, all in the matter of seconds. This went on for a while so, I took what photos my camera would take and downloaded them. While looking at it with the naked eye I could see no other light near this object, but when I downlaoded the photo, there seemed to be two bright lights in the same vacinity as the one I saw with the binoculars.

This is just a little sighting, and I&apos;m not sure what it was...but maybe their were other witnesses that had a better view. I was driving home (my house is in Wheeling), and was very close...only a few blocks away, when i looked up and saw litle lights in the sky. They caught my attention because they were pretty bright, they may have been orange (it happend over a week ago...so I&apos;m not 100% on this), but I absolutely remember they were NOT blinking. Most airplanes I&apos;ve seen have blinking lights. I could not see a real shape to the craft, it was very dark and the craft was pretty far away - but the lights were in a straight line. I assumed that the lights being in a straight line mean that the craft was like a cylindar or cigar shape...with the lights being placed along the side of the ship, atleast one in the front and one in the back. Based on this assumption I noticed something strange: The craft was flying northwest while going higher in the sky. But the light on the front part of the craft was much lower, almost at a 45% angle to the light at the very the back of the craft. Opposite of what you would assume of an airplane, where the &quot;nose&quot; would be higher than the tail. It moved fairly quickly and i was able to watch it fly pretty far away...but the lights NEVER changed angles.  (I also thought that was wierd, and it made me think it those lights were probably not on the wings if it were an airplane). I was driving and only saw it for a minute or 2. i pulled over for a minute, and drove quickly home (i was only a block away at this point) and ran into the house to get a witness, but ofcourse when i came out it was gone. It really did seem to be pretty close. Around here we have Ohare airport, and a smaller airport for personal and corporate planes called Palwaukee Airport. I often see planes flying near our house, that are pretty low from taking off from either of those locations. This did look like it could have taken off from one of those airports, because it was low to the ground and I see planes flying in that route. But it was absolutely quiet...no sound at all and i did have everything in my car turned off and stopped driving for a minute (like i said). ALso, as i mentioned before, the angle it seemed to be flying was very differnt. Being so close to airports, there were ofcourse airplanes flying...but it looked like they were either flying higher or were farther away. Still there were at least 2-3 other airplanes in the same area of the sky that i saw while watchin this object. The object did not look likeit was following them or in anyway flying differently because of those airplanes. So I have no clue what it was.

As I watched it traveling north and as it approached a dark area of space (no stars readily visible without aid), the object reduced its luminicent value very rapidly as though as only seen here on earth, that someone turns off a household lightbulb and as you watch it, it fades until no light emminates from it.

I was laying on the couch, and out our front window I saw something through the curtain sheers. I went to the window and observed a giant fireball roughly 50 feet in diameter moving very slowly in a horizontal direction. It was roughly 50 feet in my estimation  by comparing it to the 70 foot trailer across the road that it was nearly flying over.I could see all the flames. It was moving at my best guess about 5 mph. It didn&apos;t leave a fire trail, but the flames were vertical, and I could see it was sphere shaped. It moved about 10 feet over the tops of the trees and illuminated the tree tops as it went. I figured that if it had traveled in that same plane without raising or lowering, that it would have been a couple feet at most over our property in the back. We had a hill behind us that lowered to a creek bed in front of our house, that began another slight grade and then the tree line across the road. When I caught site of it, it was just passing over the hill in the front of our house, where it then moved over the trees across the road. I was 20 at the time, and was home alone. I got so scared that I ran upstairs and shut off all the lights. I didn&apos;t know what that thing was. I never even told my dad about it until about ten years later.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Our football field is laid out so that the end zones face north-to-south, and there is a set of bleachers on the west side of the field.  We were marching in a way such that the entire band was facing the west, towards the bleachers.  While we were marching I noticed a bright green spherical light source move from behind the bleachers, form the west or southwest, and move northwards and upwards so that the light source was, from my perspective, north of the bleachers and slightly above them, I&apos;m guessing 1 to 1.5 miles away from the field.  The light source paused for about 4 seconds, not getting any brighter or fainter, which meant it was probably holding its position relative to me.  I stopped marching when I saw the light source appear.  For those 4 seconds a friend of mine who was also marching (he was a few yards away from me in the same formation), took notice of the light source and stopped marching as well.  After about 4 seconds the light source suddenly began moving away from us, towards the southwest, and increasing in altitude.  The source appeared to leave a small trail in the sky, most likely just a blur because of the speed at which it was moving.  Within about a second the light source was out of view.  My friend confirmed that he had also seen the object, and also described the things above.  If I were to estimate, I would say that the light source was about 80-100 feet in diameter.  The light source did nothing when it was hovering, making no known sound, not changing brightness, emitting nothing.  My friend and I seem to be the only people in the marching band that had seen the light source, even though it was plainly visible.  We have asked around, and nobody else claims to have seen it.  We have not done any research to find of anyone in the area had reported the sighting of ! the ligh t source.  This was one year ago; we didn&apos;t report this at the time because nobody else had seen it, so we dismissed the event as just an illusion.  But recently I watched a TV program that reminded me of the event, and I asked my friend if he still remembers the event, which he still does.  We&apos;ve only decided to report it now.

This was in the northwest sky.  As I watched, they grew in intensity and then simultaneously, disappeared...as in, Poof! no longer there.  I have tried repeating the viewing at the same time in the mornings to see if they were there again, but no luck.

They were rotating red, white and green lights and approximately 2 miles apart from each and definitely travelling together.", "At approximately 20:00 on the night of 10/28/06 my girl friend and I observed an object in the sky from our home in Sedona Arizona. The object appeared to be at flight level somewhere between 30,000 AND 50,000 feet, located above a point midway between Kayenta and Flagstaff Arizona. At first we noticed a tight triangle of lights  with one of the lights brighter than the other. At first glance I thought it was an aircraft but then because the lights were not strobing and because it maintained a fixed position I realised it was not a conventional fixed wing aircraft. Then a &quot;V&quot; type of extension of lights began to light up extending upward and back from the central lights. These were amber colored changing to orange and then later almost a bluish color , then the lights receded back to the nucleus. I considered the possibility that this was a blimp and we were seeing it an angle when the craft abruptly gained altitude in a straight verticle motion. No blimp could have executed such a maneuver . It was an almost instantaneouss gain in altitude of what I would estimate to be 500 to 1000 feet. It remained in that fixed position, occassionally gaining and losing altitude in a similar fashion for almost 30 minutes. I got a pair of binoculars and observed that there were indeed three lights in a tight triangle but that around those lights was a kind of glow of an almost milky quality. Then the craft disappeared. I was looking at it through the binnoculars and told my girl friend &quot;I&apos;ve lost it&quot; . Putting the binnoculars down I saw points of light that appeared one after another in a large triangle  pattern progressing to the northwest across the sky in what could only be desctribed as &quot; great leaps&quot;. At first I thought that perhaps these were  four or five air craft with strobes on flying at different altitudes , creating a triangular pattern. However if that had been the case they would have continued across the sky. Instead they vanished. I believe it was the craft we observed making its way ac! ross the sky  and then vanishing from sight.The night sky was completely clear. There was a crescent moon and none of our view of the object, either when it was in a fixed position or when it &quot;leaped&quot; across the sky was obscured by mountains. Sedona is a low light community so the visibility was excellent that night. I am a former private pilot and flew a twin engine Senecca over this part of the country  for several years. The object did not conform to any type of civilian or military aircraft with which I am familiar. If the  lights streaking across the sky in a triangular pattern was indeed this craft then there is nothing currently being flown which can remotely approach the speed at which this craft traversed the sky.", "Brilliant green flash sightedOn a Thursday evening on August 24th, I was laying in bed, observing the late night commute out of my bedroom window (looking at cars at night settles me down before I go to bed).  As I was observing the late night streets (at the time it was about 10:00 pm) i noticed an extremely bright green flash that occupied the entire sky for about a split second, brighter than lightning.  I was slightly horrified and scared by what I had just seen.  I thought it was a mere hallucination, until I told my friend at the bus stop about a week later, and he said that he had seen it as well.  These flashes seem to go on regularly around my area for some strange reason in which I don&apos;t know, but no flash was as bright as I had just seen.((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax from student, we believe.

The sun had set and we were about to wrap things up when I mentioned that because of the clear sky and recent climate change that we might be able to see the Northern Lights if we stuck around a bit longer until it was completely dark outside. I was taking in my line and getting my fly rod ready to put it into its case when, out of the corner of my eye, something caught my attention. There was an odd movement in the sky. I redirected my gaze up to my left (Southwest) to see what appeared to be a star of medium brightness making erratic movements in the sky. The spot of light was moving at quite remarkable speeds in an &apos;S&apos; pattern and then shot off across the night sky at a perfectly straight trajectory from southwest to north at about 11 inches (from my perspective) a second. It then faded into obscurity slowly as it sped into the distance of space above the earth. Then more of these spots began speeding across the sky at breakneck speeds, one after another, back and forth. We must have seem at least a dozen of them. At the height of the activity there were three together in a small portion of the horizon. Two of them almost collided as they crossed paths. One of the spots made an instantaneous 30 degree turn as if it were a billiard ball being banked off of a rail. It was quite curious to be sure. Neither of us could decide what we were actually seeing. The Objects moved far too swift and precisely to be any sort of conventional aircraft or even spacecraft.", "Streak of light appears in picture at dusk near New Iberia, LA.While driving west on US90 in New Iberia,LA we were looking at the sunset just as darkness was settling in.  It was raining lightly as the cloud bank was beginning to clear the area.  My daughter asked if she could take a picture with our digital camera. I told her not to use the flash because the light reflects back at you when it hits the raindrops.  She took several pictures some of which did not comeout for various reasons.  When I downloaded the pictures to my laptop I observed a picture that had a white streak in it that was not there when we took the picture. My daughter, wife and I did not see this object in the air when the picture was taken.  The picture you will see has some streaks in it from the raindrops, but this streak of light jumps off the screen at you. There appears to be another in the distance on the right side of the photo. Object I would say is at appx 30,000 to 35,000 ft in altitude. I do not believe this to be a contrail for several reasons, I would have noticed them being an airline employee, and during this time of year contrails are not usually that visible or bright and would be visible across the pictue.

But, as I was getting closer to the area, I noticed that the helicopter very low and was not making any noise.  I kept looking and now I was in front of the first Condo, having a better look of the object.  I thought it&apos;s not a helicopter it&apos;s a 747 jet, but as soon as that thought came to my mind, I said to myself, wait a minute, jets does not suspend in mid air. The aircraft was suspended about a 100 feet from the top of the Condo, it was huge and iluminated all underneath, it looks like a 747 jet with its wings, more like a cross.

After I convienced him to lay back and relax we began to see a lot of shooting stars and in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoaxed report.  We cannot be certain.  PD))After we were totally relaxed and feeling  that the sky was putting on a &quot;show&quot; for us is when we both realized a small distance object deep in space.

We both knew what we were seeing wasn&apos;t either.It started of slow like a satalite then took off like a jet through the sky, the light fading out then grew more intense, we both came together on the rocks out of fear and amazement.  After traviling its straight path across the sky, faster than anything beyond our imagination, it then stopped on a dime, hovered for a breif second and then fell like a leaf or the golden mean ratio or a DNA pattern, just the most beatiful spiral you can imagine. After witnessing this I sugessted a meditation to open ourselves up to the true possibilities.

Flying north across Lorane Valley (southwest of Eugene - several miles west of I-5). White lights on each tip. One bright searchlight in center. The searchlight scanned the earth (across Lorane Valley and the hills and valleys to the west.) Because it took a long time to fly south to north over the valley (most planes fly it in a few minutes), and it was able to send the light over such a distance east to west, my sense was that the craft was at typical plane altitude or higher. However, it was so enormous that it was hard to tell.It seemed like it was in low gear - flying straight and steady. The searchlight was scanning back and forth (I thought it might be a defense operation practice). Yet, it felt creepy. It scanned my yard, and I moved under a tree so as not to be seen! When I went back into the house, I asked my friend how long I had been gone. I was only half joking. The experience was more than simply visual. It was so big, so quiet, and the searchlight was so bright that I felt like something &quot;special&quot; had happened - although not a pleasant special. I am a skeptic about UFOs - maybe because I don&apos;t want to think about how scary ETs might be. But, I don&apos;t drink, do drugs, and I am a relatively sane, balanced person. I don&apos;t usually get scary feelings; I don&apos;t imagine things. I certainly am not inclined to watch the skies for UFOs. I pushed the experience to the back of my mind, until I heard about a black triangle book, and that others had seen them. Figured I better get my visual on record as well.

We saw four strong lights penetrating the low cloud cover above a mountain north of our position. The lights would pulse on and off at irregular intervals. The sound could best be described as distant rolling thunder but very constant. We watched for many seconds and wondered what it could be. Then the four lights began to drift away to the north (toward Lake Havasu City, AZ) together leading me to believe it was one very large craft as opposed to four separate ones. The sound also diminished in proportion to the lights. When I asked a local resident (I was new to the area then) days later, what that could have been.  He said the Marines were probably performing night manuevers in the desert with helicopters. I&apos;ve been in the military and know the sound of helicopters...this was not that sound.

If 2 miles is about right, then I would guess it&apos;s altitude to be about 1000 ft, and it&apos;s size to be about 100 feet high.  No other clouds were visible anywhere.  The cloud looked flat, was vertically oriented, and had perfectly straight sides, and was diamond shaped.  My first thought was that it was some kind of huge kite.  I  looked at it through a spotting scope, and could tell that it was clearly a cloud.  Then I noticed a round object above the cloud, which my wife could see without the scope, and through the scope it had a frisbee shape, with what looked like a hole in the center. The object looked solid, and had clearly defined edges. It began to move downward, extremely slowly, and changed it&apos;s orientation so that it looked almost edge on to our viewpoint, then went behind some low hills just south of the Superstition Mtns.  This took place over maybe 2-3 minutes, and while this was happening, the cloud kind of disentegrated into a more or less normal cloud looking shape, and drifted slightly north of where we first saw it.  At this time my wife had to leave for work, and I went back in the house, where I continued looking at this cloud through the scope.  Then another cloud appeared very suddenly, in about the same place.  It appeared to be more edge on, and looked more like a slash, but I could see that it had the same square edged appearance as the first one.  As I was looking at it, a small round piece of it slowly bulged out of the side, near the bottom, and began the same slow drifting kind of descent the first one did.  Thia one however didn&apos;t have a definite shape, it just looked like a small piece of cloud, trailing cloud/steam/smoke/? in a very short tail behind it.  It also finally went out of sight behind the hills in about the same place as the first one, and the cloud disentegrated in about the same manner as the first.  Before this second one disappeared, a third cloud appeared, in jus! t about the same place, with the same thing coming out of it.

I saw red and white lights in the sky.  They looked like radio towers or cell towers but they were too high to be either.  At first I thought, &quot;how in the world could they have put up radio or cell towers sudddenly without my noticing it?&quot;  I walked quickly to try to see where they were really located, knowing there were no hills or mountains around where they could be mounted upon.  The morning was foggy and cold, not sure what the temperature was but there was frost on windshields so I&apos;d guess maybe 30 degrees.  I wondered if cold fog could create mirages where objects looked displaced from their actual physical location.  As I walked further east, trying to get a good look at them without bare trees in the way they were always behind the trees, meaning that they moved to the north slightly as I walked.  I can&apos;t remember for sure but it seemed like maybe 3 red lights and one white light with what looked like tower structures below them (beams?).  I headed south trying to get a look at them without bare trees in the way andd as I walked south they were still behind the trees, maybe 10-15 degrees above the horizon.  When I finally got to a point where I should have had a good view of them they disappeared.  As I drove to work I looked to see if there were any mountains or hills in the area where radio/cell towers would have been mounted just to check to make sure.  There were none.  As I said, it was a foggy morning since the Yakima River has fog over it on cold mornings this time of the year.  But the light/towers were well above the the height of the fog.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Follow up on report about red and white lights on what looked like radio towers; they were radio towers.The report I filed yesterday on the red and white lights turned out to actually be radio towers.  The fog must have played tricks with these making them appear much higher in the sky.

We would stomp the wheat down to make square rooms, round and rectangular shaped rooms and we would connect the room together with hall ways. One night I looked out of the kitchen window and saw a White cube that glowed like a light bulb.  It had a red light glowing on the inside of it. The area was north of Great Bend, Kansas. There are or were quite a few radio towers there and one huge TV 2 tower. The cube shaped thing flew around that radio tower like a moth flies around a light bulb of all things, only slower than a moth and it never hit the tower. I ran to the bath room to get my dad but he said don&apos;t brother him.  So I ran back to the kitchen yelling for my two brothers to come here. When I got back to the window it was still flying around the tower.  Just before my brothers got to the window it came across the field towards me in a blink of an eye it was hovering around 75 feet above the ground.  That is when my two brothers made it to the window and started saying what is that, what is that. The thing hovered there but very slowly turned for 20 sec. or so.  Than it spun so fast that it turned into a ball and was gone in a streak almost straight up but a little angle towards the n.w. True true true story. Also, I might add that the red light was fading on an off like the tower light was.  I believe it was trying to communicate with it and that it was surprised when it finally noticed me or us. I also think that it was some type of probe or something. The work you are all doing is good work.  We saw what we saw so because of that I know we are not alone.  Sure makes you wonder why that thing was flying around that radio tower?  I don&apos;t think that making those forts in the wheat had or has anything to do with it but then again you never know like anything there are more questions than answers.

This incident occurred just as I was driving west and approaching an intersection at which I planned to turn south and head toward the city, which lies to the south east of the intersection.  At this time the sky was covered with clouds but it was still light. Just as I came to the red light, I saw what I initially thought was a large plastic garbage bag about 100 feet from my location blowing in the wind about 30 feet over a field west of the intersection.  The reason I took it to be some kind of bag was that it was changing shape as if it were blowing in the wind.  However, it moved in a perfectly straight line, heading north.  It struck me as strange that this object could simultaneously change shape as if being buffeted by wind and yet not change direction at all.  When the light became green, I turned south, but found my eyes still riveted to the object. On an impulse I decided to pull over to the side of the road and get out to have a better look at the object.  However, when I stepped out of the car, there was no object to be seen.  I looked at the field (recently harvested, and so bare) to see if a plastic bag had fallen, but I saw none.  Then I looked in the direction where it had last appeared, and I saw a distant spherical object, close to the clouds.  It either did not move or moved very slowly and steadily.  It did not seem to me to be a plane, jet, helicopter, or a balloon.  It disappeared and reappeared over and over again, in and out of the clouds. I watched this thing for about five minutes.  It was becoming less and less visible, disappearing into the clouds for longer times; and as I was parked in a somewhat unsafe location, I decided to get back in my truck and head towards home.", "Strange Lights Over Small Pennsylvania TownMy 2 children and I saw some type of aircraft over the city where we live.  One craft was larger than the other ones. The larger craft looked as though it was a pulsing light, it went from blue to white to yellow to orange to red. The other other 3 smaller crafts stayed the color red. The smaller ones were quite a distance away from the larger one. 2 were side by side and the other small one was below the other 2. All these crafts stayed in one spot they just seemed to be hovering there and as day break came the smaller ones seemed to disappear, but the larger one stayed visible then it was gone in a blink of an eye.

Recently while looking at the night sky I noticed what appeared to be a star fluctuating between red and blue twinkles.  I am no astronomy buff, but I recognize mars and I can recognize a star generally.  My and my father&apos;s reaction was alike, we both seemed to notice this &apos;star&apos; on the same night, and notice how it did not appear to have the usual colors of a star, plus its &apos;twinkle&apos; was disproportionate to the other stars in the sky that night, as well as other stars I had seen in the past. It was in the Southern sky, at about a 35 degree angle from the ground.  I have noticed a similar object in the eastern sky as well.  Generally these objects tend to be the lowest &apos;star-like&apos; objects in the horizon, which leads me to believe that it IS in fact a star, and that the swirling of the atmosphere appears more intensely upon the starry sky background when it is lower in the horizon, rather than when one looks straight up.  Despite this simple explanation, this object could be easily mistaken for something unusual.  Just thought I&apos;d offer this as a theory in case similar sightings had been reported but not substantiated as having an alien basis. thanks for reading((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of the star, &quot;Sirius.&quot;  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "unblinking bright white light (star looking) moving at incredible speed changing direction instantlyMy cousin and I were 15 at the time and sleeping in a tent in the yard as it was hot and we had no AC in the house. I was trying to sleep and my cousin was laying with his head out the tent door and kept talking about a moving white light. Thinking it was just a satellite, I did not look until told me it was changing directions instantly at high speed. When I looked, at first I could see nothing...but he told me to watch in this one area for a moment. What appeared to be a big, bright star took off instantly and shot across the sky at an unbelievable rate. It then stopped just as suddenly, making it hard to find, as it just blended in with the stars when not moving. Every once in a while, it would move slowly, maybe making small little circles before shooting back across the sky. Sometimes it would zig zag erratically across the sky, even changing directions 180 degrees without slowing down. The object seemed to travel back and forth generally in a line SE to NW. I watched it for about an hour, and finally got tired and went to sleep. My cousin watched for some time after that, and I think it was still visible when he went to sleep as well. When telling my Dad about it, he said that my uncle had seen similar lights, but in greater numbers. He lived about 10 miles away at Iron Mountain,MO and on many summer nights sat on his front porch watching them. One night one of them fell from the sky out of sight behind the treeline, and immediatly all of the other lights converged on that area and hovered for a few minutes before dispersing again. My uncle was not the type to make up stories about UFO&apos;s, and as a matter of fact I don&apos;t think he talked about it much for fear of people thinking he was crazy. I read just a year or two ago about a professer doing research around Van Buren MO on UFO&apos;s in the 70&apos;s (I think). The visual desciption and movement of what he studied sounds as though it was the exact same thing my uncle, cousin,and myself saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Its movement was erratic. It would jump about an inch of the sky at a time and leave a slight trail as it went.  As well when it stopped moving it looked as though it snapped into place.  after second and thrid guessing myself i called for my mother to take a look. She as well saw it and its movement. The light eminating off of it was different than starlight,it had a blueish quality to it, the source of light looked to be rectangular but i cant tell for sure.

The larger circular part was leading the entire ship, as if the round part was a control center. It had red white and blue lights all over the bottom of it that had a glow bright enough for me to see it in daylight, and after those 10 to 15 seconds were over the bottom started to dim, then got REALLY bright and then it was gone, it left behind a blueish fog that disappeared fairly quickly.

And as always I look out to check the sky condition. The window has a csoutherly view and I can easily see the zodiak and I like to check the sky condition and watch the planets traverse across my view. The sky last night was a broken layer of this stratocumulus ans, as usual, the city haize cast an eirie glow on the clouds. Then I seen what I thought was an aircraft loosing aititude in preparation for the final landing approach to the city&apos;s larger passenger airport or so I thought. But the aircraft did not look normal, first of all the city haise illuminated the object as it slowly moved acrost my view. It had a, sort of, saucer appearance, a scetch will be sent in conjunction to this report. The object appeared a grey color similiar to how the clouds looked. I seen what looked like three round windows on the &quot;side.&quot; I will estimate the angular height of about two and a half clemched fists, at arms length, and the widest portion of the object was from a half to one full thumbs width. Next I seen no navigation lights or landing lights which I normally see on aircraft of any size at night. I watch the object for a few minutes and resumed my business as I pordered what I saw. It was then that I decided that what I seen was no airplane but instead it was an artifact that was made here on earth or somewhere else in the cosmos by an intelligence that we cnnot comprehend althought we try. I have been an amateur astronomer for about sixty years now and I typically see lights in the sky that I cannot explain using out technology so I basically ignore them but this time I got a physical outline to study.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded very sincere, and sober-minded, to us.

Tonight I was looking around, and saw a slow moving very bright light in the distance, up in the sky, through the tops of the trees.  Like you can see the moon through the tops of trees sometimes when it is low.  In fact, when I saw it, I thought it was the moon, and tried blow it off.  Then I noticed that it was moving slow, but steady, a little higher into air.  I did the whole blinking thing, and tried to look at it harder, to try to figure out what it was I was seeing.  Now we are about 30 miles from an airport, so planes are around a lot, but this wasn&apos;t a plane.  As a matter of fact, an airplane was flying toward the direction of the triangular object.  The plane was higher than the object, but I was able to see them together, and the plane had the regular blinking light on it, but the object did not!  There were three very bright lights.  Almost the glow of a stadium light.  Not like fire, but like an electric looking white light.  IT sort of glided through the sky, at a fairly low altitude.  I watched it until it was out of sight.  When I told my dad, he though I was crazy, but he asked if the lights were on the front or the back.  That is sort weird when I thought about, because it wasn&apos;t either.  I saw the lights coming and going.  Maybe like they were on the bottom??  Now I must say, that I have never put a whole lot of stock in UFO sightings, or aliens.  Actually I have never really cared, so this is really taking a lot for me to submit this.  I would though like to know if anyone else has seen this before.

When I looked up, it looked like at first it was a small plane duing a 45 degree turn.  We both noticed it was moving to slow to be a plane.  At that time it was difficult to see an exact shape.  It remined me of an old american car.  It moved slow,  and a  very even movement. It went around Downtown Bellevue and stoped. At that time I noticed a light coming from the front , like a spot light. It was at an aproxoite 35-40 degree angle. I looked at the shape, it was flat on the bottom, with a hump in the back and a hump in the front. Like I said an old American car. It just sat there, did not move. I put my window down and did not hear anything except cars. Then it started in what looked like a circular drive around the city, which is only a few blocks in either direction. This time it went around and never came back. I know it was not a plane. It was not a chopper, did not see any moving parts. It was twice as high as the tallest building in Bellevue, which is 44 stories. It seemed quite large like a big rig truck, but much thiner.

One was kind of following the other, but I couldn&apos;t notice at the time whether the second was following exactly, or just very similarly.  At any rate, what struck me was two things - the height and the pattern of flight.  The height struck me because they definitely were above the cloud level.   I&apos;m still trying to figure out what the could level was at that time, but it gave me the impression that if they were as high as they seemed, then they were pretty large. I first saw them going in a straight line, then the first one curved around the left and came back just a bit, then continued left, then forward, then right back to the original path.  It then sort of seemed to wander in that direction until it disappeared over the clouds.  The second was doing basically the same thing, if not exactly the same thing, but about a second or two delayed after the first. I left my car door open and ran towards them to try and get a cleared look, and shouted out, &quot;UFOs! in the north sky!&quot; a few times.  Frustratingly, no one was around until someone parked about 10 seconds after they went over the clouds.  They got out and I told them about it and they immediately got back in their car and headed to a park on the north side of the island to get a better view of the sky.  I also did this, but we didn&apos;t see anything at that point after about a half hour of looking up.  They must have already gone.

It almost seemed like a lighthouse beacon.Approx. 12 seconds later the same flash occurred in the same exact spot.  As clear as it was, no craft could be seen. After the same time interval, there was another flash and at that point I alerted the other two men to direct their attention at that specific point in the sky and just watch.

In addition, the fire chief made a statement to a local news crew (on film) that...&quot;sometimes people see what they think is something and it really is nothing....&quot;  Several large tractor trailers were seen going into the area which had been contained by police.  According to the local press, the witnesses (which are suppose to have been &quot;interviewed&quot; by the local Police on Wednesday the next day) all stated that something &quot;crashed&quot; and it appeared to be a bring, shiny object travelling at high speed.  Interestingly, the police, fire and FAA offical stated on the next day that &quot;neither the local Columbus Metropolitan Airport or Fort Benning Lawson Army Airfield radar had shown NO sign of ANY craft or object on radar at the supposed time of impact.  BUT I spoke to the head weather reporter for a local TV station who told me that his station has thier OWN RADAR and they showed &quot;something&quot; striking the area at the approximate time given.  Further, I and another professional educator (with both hold Phd&apos;s) were travelling next to the Columbus Metro Airport at approximately 1:00 PM on Weds (the next day)   NOTE: THE Airport is LESS than 3 miles from the supposed crash site when both I and the other professor saw a COMPLETELY UNMARKED, White, 727 Jet land at the Columbus Airport.   As the plane taxied by us (we were NO more than 100 feet from the! plane which was slightly above us at an angle moving towards the main compound) my companions vehicle, lost all power, all gauges went dead, power steering, engine, everything and we guilded to a stop.  We both existed the vehicle thinking something mechanically major had gone wrong with his vehicle.  At that moment the plane began to slowly pass us as it was taxing from the main runway.  I picked up my cell phone to call a mechanic and found my cell phone to be dead.  My companions cell phone was also dead. We both watched the plane as it went by us.  Both of us are veterans and have travelled MANY times on 727&apos;s.  Almost at the same moment, we both spoke because we noticed that the plane had NO MARKINGS OF ANY KIND...no tail numbers, nothing.  The plane had a strange finish and almost looked (excuse the obvious pun) whitewashed.  When the plane got approximately 100 feet FROM us, my companions car RESTARTED with no apparent reason, or damage of any kind.   In addition, both my and my companions cell phone came back on.  We are both academic professors and are empiricists.  We have NEVER been involved in ANY such thing before.  I immediatally attempted to call the airport to inquire about the plane. I was connected (I dont know why to this number) the fire/police crash station.  I started to ask the man who answered about the plane.    He ruded cut me off and stated, &quot;that is a private plane, thank you&quot; and hung up.  Approximately 30 minutes later I arrived home and I decided to try and call the local aviation company which sells fuel and such and is next to the main terminal.   I called CSG Aviation.  I young woman answered and I inquired about the plane.  She was obviously very young and most likely, simple desk help.  I asked about the 727 &quot;private plane&quot; at which time she CORRECTED ME and told me &quot;Oh no, that was a GOVERNMENT PLANE&quot; I asked how she knew that and she said that &quot;It had picked up SOMETHING which it loaded into its rear section and it also refueled, a man in a coat and tie came from the plane and PAID for the fuel with a credit card which had US Treasury and an account number on it.&quot;  She said thats how she knew it was a &quot;government plane&quot;.  An additional call to the Airport admin office confused me further.  At that time I was now told that, &quot; I was mistaken, that NO PLANE, much less a 727, had landed or taken off during the time period I gave&quot;.  When my wife got home, I told her of my encounter and SHE INFORMED ME about the &quot;crash&quot; the say before.   I had not been feeling well and  had not read the paper or seen the news.  Needless to say, this revelation absoluted stunned me.  I am trying to get the &quot;witnesses statements&quot; from the police.

We have a huge military base here with its own airport.  Logic states that if this was something military, they would of taken it to Fort Benning.  I was also told that during the same period that &quot;debris&quot; was reported striking areas around Montgomery, Alabama which is appoximately 100 miles from here.  I have NEVER been involved or even interested in anything like this but circumstances has changed that.((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the source of this report, and he impressed us with his sincerity, and with the volume of information he had collected about the incident.

I was seated directly where the wing was and at first I just looked at it for a few seconds not thinking anything peculiar about it, then it just went straight down and disapeared.

I believe this may be an explainable event, however, I do not understand it.  Above you use the word &quot;craft&quot;, which does not apply (that I know, anyway). About 11:30 pm, I was riding my bike on a bike path and saw a blue and green glowing (as on fire, except it was blue green) &quot;patch&quot; or object streak at a low angle.  Let me try to describe it another way.  I would have thought it was a meteor, and in many ways it acted like a meteor, except for the following :  1) The &quot;appearance&quot; or Burn started relatively low in the sky. I do not understand, if it was a meteor why it would be so low before it looked like it began to &quot;burn&quot;.  2) I know it was low in the sky, because the mountains here rise rather abruptly in this area. I was at sea level, and the mountains aer several thousand feet north of where I was - in front of where I was.  I had my bike helmet on, thus further obstructing the amount of overhead sky I could have seen. The object &quot;appeared&quot; - began to &quot;burn&quot; suddenly, as though it was just entering the atmosphere.  I hope this makes sense. However, the thing is, this occurred so low - it didn&apos;t make sense to me.  Also, the color - definitely blue and green.  At first I thought &quot;it must be like I&apos;ve heard of frozen ice falling out of airplans&quot; because this area where I was biking is near the airport and near the flight path.  2) I went back the next night to the same spot to recreate what I would have been able to see from where I was riding, given my helmet, given the mountains, etc. 3) Also, perhaps meteors do this, I don&apos;t know...but it was at almost a horizontal path.  It was on a downward slope, but not a steep one, if this makes sense.  Also it was definitely between me and the mounts, for example. I know this for sure.  It seemed close.  4) Of course, something so unexpected, when time goes by, it&apos;s like you wish you could just rewind time so you could take better notes.   and also 5) it seemed a little too slow to be a meteor, especially one tha! t low.I mean, it happened quickly, in some ways, and yet, given how close it seemed, it seems to me if it was a meteor, it should have been moving faster.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The North side of the island was very undeveloped at the time, so there were few houses nearby, it was mostly jungle or &quot;bush&quot; near our house.My mother was out on the balcony watering potted plants when she called me to come look at something. I came out and saw a saucer like aircraft hovering almost at eye-level to us. Our apartment was aproximatley 500 to 700 feet above sea-level on the side of a mountain. Magen&apos;s Bay was to the left of our view and we looked out at a small hill just opposite of our building, about 400 feet opposite. On the other side of the small hill is now Mahogany Run gold course which, at the time belonged to St. Thomas Dairy and was a pasture.The Atlantic Ocean is beyond.It was a perfectly clear sunny day and the sun was behind us, we were looking due north. The craft was brilliantly shiny, like highly polished chrome and the sun glinted off of it, the rest of it appeared dark because it was in shadow. I was trying to figure out how far away from us it was; I think it was beyond the hill opposite of us, probably about a half mile away, hovering above the pasture, but visible to us over the top of the small hill.Prior to this experience, I thought a spinning saucer shaped ufo was an absurd concept, but this was not spinning, and there it was before my eyes. It appeared disc shaped because of the way the sun was glinting off of it, but we were seeing its edge, from the side. It was like two thin pie plates one inverted on top of an upright one on the bottom. It was sleek and stealth. The lower portion in shadow was more pie plate shaped, with more vertical sides, the top was flatter. It was not mushroom cap shaped. It was not very large, about 15 to twenty feet in diameter. It made no sound. It was a quiet day and all you could hear were the birds singing.The most remarkable thing about it was how it moved. At first it was absolutely still then it moved from left to right with unwavering precision, and back again and up and down a very little. It moved only about 20 to 40 feet to the sides, as if it were focusing or getting a better angle. It moved up and down only about 10 feet or so. Every movement it made was exact, no wobble, and it went from absolute standstill to movement with no acceleration or deceleration. It moved with phenomenal speed, from zero to super fast to zero again without any lurching. It stopped between left and right movements and stayed unmoving for a couple seconds, and I definitely had the impression it was observing my mother and I as we were watching it.It stayed in the same area of the sky, right in front of us for the majority of the time, and then moved further to the left, as if it was checking out something else and stayed there for only a few seconds more and then it abruptly took off in an ascending arc, going north-west from horizontal to about 45 degrees at a phenomenal rate of speed and disappeared from sight into the dark blue zenith of the sky.

I had to be there at 9:00am, so it was somewhere between 8:45 and 8:55. We parked (My Mom) and we were walking towards the entrance when for some reason I looked up and saw this ship right above the hospital just sitting there.  I said &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; and my mom said &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot; It looked like two ships on their sides hooked in the middle, like two dinner plate bottom to bottom, with something in the middle.  We looked at them for a good 5 min. and all these people were walking by and no one would look up, so my mom finally stopped a lady and asked her what it was, she looked and said I don&apos;t know and walked away, it was funny. I was running late, so we went into the hospital.  I was hoping while we were watching it, would zip away or something, but no!

I dismissed it as a plane or helicopter but caught my attention even more when the light traveled in the sky in a southwest direction and met a smaller light. The two lights then began to move together at the same time with an equal distance the whole time toward the Estrella Mountains.  Between the two lights it was completely black and blocked the light from all the stars it passed in the sky making the shape of a very large rectangle.  Eventually the lights faded away and we could not see them anymore.

We were at the front of my friends house next to the Beverly Commons cemetary. It was a clear summer evening and we watched it until we realized we could not explain what it was and we ran. I never brought it up much since, but on recent return trip to Beverly, my cousins neighbor who still lives near the cemetary also saw the object from his porch.

We thought at first it was the moon behing some clouds unitl we realized we don&apos;t have clouds that looked like these vapor cloud things. The other clouds were not like it anyway. There was a brightness in the area surrounding this. We went inside because we were comming home and watched the bright cloud or vapor thing. There were at least 15 in the group. Two at a time they stared to fade. Some just got brighter then were gone and the others turned organgeish white and just shot away. This continued until the 15 were gone. Under the conglomeration was a line of the vapor type clouds it remained even after the others left. I called my neighbor during this time and she and her husband started to watch. I thought it was over and I contacted our local news to see if anyone had reported anything in the sky of course it hadn&apos;t. Then the line that had been there got a huge fireball on top of it and I realized that is also what I had seen in the sky that I thought was the moon. It looked like a sunrise but it was in the west and it exploded and disappeared. It took about 3-5 minutes for this to happen so it was watchable. Not like a split second that was what was so amazing. I was loudly asking my friend on the phone if she saw it and she did. The other little clouds under it did the same thing orangeish reddish explosion. But it really looked like they were taking off and they were so powerful and fast that it created that light. I wonder if the cloudy vapor things were a cover or that the  technology of the ships created the vapors. It was really the most incredible thing I have ever seen. I&apos;m not the type of person who believes things easily and I even brushed it off when I first saw everything. But it was undeniable and fantastic.

Read it and believe it.I was getting into our hot tub out off of our deck. As always I look up and enjoy the stars. I&apos;ve been a star gazer my whole life. I have NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE!  The thing was flying across the sky heading due south and off to the east a bit, not directly overhead.  One red light very dim with two sets of two directly behind. the whole thing was very small which I believe to be actually very high in the sky. -Unbelievably- fast and the real thriller is the ((deleted)) thing slowed to almost a stop and took off in another direction. I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes. I tried to write it off as a helicopter but I heard NO SOUND. My wife and friend came out shortly after and we hung out for a while. I told them what I saw and I don&apos;t think they believe me.  Anyway we soaked in the tub for a while and my wife went in the house. Our friend and I sat for a bit longer and intrigued  I kept watching the sky.  A few meteors throughout about an hour and one thing blew my mind.  It started out like a meteor but in the direct opposite path of the first unexplainable object.  It was a light that appeared and faded out like a meteor but it reappeared and faded and appeared again across the entire sky due north. I of course yelled for our friend to look but she didn&apos;t see it. This too was going incredibly fast. O.k. Now I&apos;m starting to freak out a bit.  I&apos;ve always believed in Carl Sagan about being alone. The real clincher is and this just happened one hour ago is that goddamn red thing went back south again in the exact same path. one red light very dim with two sets of two.  if you weren&apos;t looking you wouldn&apos;t see it at the same speed and damn near the same path.  It wasn&apos;t an aircraft of anything conventional. No disc shapes either. it was too high and way too fast for anything I have ever seen.

I DON&apos;T THINK THE WIND WAS BLOWING VERY HARD AT ALL. I WAS THROWING A BALL UP IN THE AIR AND CATCHING IT IN MY GLOVE. AS I THREW THE BALL UP, I SAW WHAT APPEARED AT FIRST GLANCE TO BE AN AIRPLANE. I ALLOWED THE BALL TO DROP WITHOUT TAKING MY EYES OFF THE &quot;PLANE&quot; BECAUSE I WAS AMAZED AT HOW FAST IT WAS MOVING. AT THE TIME, AND TO THIS DAY, I BELEIVED THE CRAFT TO HAVE BEEN FLYING AT LEAST AS HIGH AS A SMALL AIRPLANE WOULD FLY. WHEN I SAW IT, I WAS FACING ROUGHLY SOUTH. THE CRAFT FLEW WEST TO EAST AND WAS ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD AND AT ABOUT MY 2 O&apos;CLOCK POSITION WHEN I FIRST NOTICED IT. WHEN THE CRAFT REACHED ABOUT MY 11:00 POSITION, IT STOPPED ABRUPTLY, SPUN COMPLETELY AROUND ON IT&apos;S AXIS ONCE, AND FLEW OFF TO THE SOUTH ON PATH WHICH WAS AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE TO IT&apos;S ORIGINAL FLIGHT PATH. I WAS STANDING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YARDS FROM A HILL WITH TALL TREES ON IT. THE CRAFT FLEW FAR ABOVE THOSE TREES. IT DID NOT MAKE ANY SOUND. IT APPEARED TO BE WHITE IN COLOR AND HAD NO MARKING ON IT. I DID NOT SEE ANY LIGHTS. IT DID NOT GLOW OR REFLECT THE SUNLIGHT. THE ONLY WAY I CAN DESCRIBE THE SPEED AT WHICH IT FLEW WOULD BE TO SAY THAT ONLY ONE TO TWO SECONDS ELAPSED BETWEEN THE TIME I FIRST NOTICED IT UNTIL IT WAS OUT OF SITE. WHEN IT STOPPED, IT DID SO WITHOUT SLOWING DOWN. IT JUST STOPPED AS THOUGH IT HAD HIT A WALL. WHEN IT SPUN, IT DID SO RAPIDLY, NOT IN A SLOW DELIBERATE MANNER. THE CRAFT RESEMBLED AN AIRPLANE IN THAT IT HAD A FUSELAGE AND WINGS. THE MAIN WINGS AND THE WINGS AT THE TAIL WERE ALL WHERE THEY WOULD BE ON AN AIRPLANE, ACCEPT THAT THE FUSELAGE CONTINUED SLIGHTLY BEYOND THE TAIL WINGS. THE NOSE, ALL FOUR WINGS, AND THE TAIL WERE SQUARED OFF AT THEIR ENDS. THE MAIN WINGS IN THE CENTER OF THE FUSELAGE WERE SWEPT BACK ABOUT 45 DEGREES. THERE WAS A STEADY, EVEN WIDENING OF THE FUSELAGE FROM THE NOSE TOWARD THE TAIL. I HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRAFT WAS FLAT, NOT ROUNDED AS ON AN AIRPLANE. WHEN I SAW THE CRAFT, I WAS AT MY HOME, WHICH WAS LOCATED ABOUT 30 MILES FROM STEWART AIRFEILD IN NEWBURG, NY.

We were in a low valley facing about northwest when the light came into view from the left. The light passed in and out of the clouds as it flew by, illuminating the clouds with a green glow.  We have a small airport in nearby Andrews, so I&apos;ve seen plenty of small planes with there lights. The light we saw was much brighter and flew at a faster speed.

I&apos;m really not sure of the exact date, but I just found another report on this site dated as 1995 from the same town, and its not a big town, so I think it might well be related. Basically I didnt see a UFO, but one night me and my slightly older sister were upstairs when we heard a noise from the fields at the end of our street.  We went into my parents&apos; bedroom which afforded a view over the fields and we saw a helicopter landing. Now, one of my passions has always been aviation, and even as a kid I could identify most aircraft.  For some reason I distinctly remember being convinced that it was a Mi-8 or Mi-17 transport helicopter of Russian manufacture.  I know that the helicopter was not camoflouged, and I think it was white and blue.  It landed in the field directly at the end of the street.  People definately got out of it, and there was some comotion.  After perhaps 10 minutes the helicopter left. There were no sirens or police cars around and the local police helicopter was very familiar to me, as was the local air ambulance, as they were based just a few miles away at what is now Wolverhamption Business Airport, and I saw them frequently, and it was not either of them.  The only other helicopter I saw regularly around there was a bright orange Bell 206 that was something to do with the National Grid. Anyway, the point is that this helicopter that landed in the field that night was certainly not familiar to me, and was definitely not an Army Lynx or Gazelle, and definately not an RAF Puma, Chinook, or Wessex. Despite not talking of the helicopter in the field for years, recently it cropped up in conversation and my sister (who still lives in the area) confirmed that she clearly remembered that night&apos;s goings on. The next day there were several large crop circles in the field that the helicopter had landed in.  The crop circles were clearly visible from my house, and I remember that me and my friends did our best to investigate the surrounding woods that bordered the fields, but we were too scared to venture into the field.  We found nothing out of the ordinary.  From Sedgley Hall Park (which is on the hill going up to the town of Sedgley)  the circles were clearly visible. It is interesting to note that the fields where the crop circles appeared that night, and where the helicopter landed and the men were seen is near to a reservoir (towards Penn, Wolverhampton); could it be the same reservoir mentioned in the other Sedgley sighting?  There are a couple of reservoirs in the Sedgley area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  Witness does not indicate what the time of the sighting was.

The kids went inside after about 15 minutes and my husband and I were still outside watching. My Husband handed me the binoculars to look at it and when we looked back up it was gone. The event lasted about 20 minutes. The first picture was taken at 6:02 pm and the last at 6:21.

Thank you", "After being alerted to some excitement outside of my com center, I quickly locked my duty room and went outside to see the problem only to see approx 25-38 men all watching the sky out over the flight strip the the left of the control tower. It is belived that the object was some 10k to 15k ft altitude.  It at first sighting just seemed to float in a set area not moving at all then suddenly it moved diagonally at some 30 to 45 degree angle up then stopped momentarily then without even a gradual change in direction is just suddenly moved straight across the sky and eye blinking speed so some 10 miles it was believed. Again it did this same move only in a completely different direction more then just abruptly.  It moved at the speed of light but all moves were done in  absolutely reverse moves. This went on for some 20 minutes, Finally 3 F-86s were dispatched for observation for encountering and they could not even get close to the object.  We all knew that it was a UFO becuase of former warnings not to ever discuss what if ever we should see in the sky.  It was told to us all that there were no such things as flying saucers ant that they were only figments of out imagination.  We all knew better that that.  Most of us had all read or heard of the &quot;Project Blue Book&quot; (Major Keyholes Report, which was printed in 1947.) We had never hoped to see something of this magnitude but after seeing this we all felt sure of what we had seen.  I had went into operation shack and had asked questions as to what they had seen on the Radarr scope and was answered that they could not ID the object because it speed would not be calculated on thier screen but did note that when the F-86s ever got near the objects area, it would move so fast it could not be registered on the scope.  They did say however that they did know it was something but of an unknown craft and that there was not any place on the planed earth that could even possibly have anything like what was seen or acted on their scope.  The whole subject was ordered to be silenced  and not even discussed but of course we did at some risk of violation of orders. This was the most fantastic thing I have ever seen in my life, this thing moved several times this was until then it literally in a flick of an eye shot out of sight just as though it was like a light switch being turned off.  I disappeared as fast as it was believe to appear.  Literally disappered. My theory is that this thing can control magnatism in some way as well as crontrol its stability at will. It definatley was and is being control by some intelligence. I have  tried to make this know before but to those I have expressed, they would look at me as if I was nuts.

I took about 6 pictures at 5 mega pixels and large format but it was pretty dark in the sky so the pics do show the color and in a few it looks as though the object is 2 pieces but you can&apos;t make out a shape.I don&apos;t know much about image construction so all i can really do is increase the size to see the colors but I can&apos;t figure out a shape.

Im going back outside.", "We are not alone,  I swear it before God Almighty.I was thirteen in 1963 and living in Cocoa, Florida.  My three brothers and I were camping in the backyard when one exclaimed &quot;Look!&quot; and he pointed to the southeast quadrant of the sky.  There were three stars, a triangle, and a bright ball of light was going from one to the next, west.  The bright ball of light was equally as bright as each star.  Perhaps fifteen minutes passed when my brother exclaimed again &quot;Look!&quot;   I looked and saw the ball of light leaving the second star and proceeding to the third, south.   We were amazed, but young, and did not realized the significance of what we were seeing.  Again &quot;Look!&quot; rang out and we watched the ball of light return to the star of its origin, north.  The trip took less than one hour.  We will gladly take a lie detector test, truth serum, hypnosis, or whatever.  No sighting such as this has ever been reported.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were just coming out of storm when we had just passed thru Midland. I was driving and the rest of my family was sleeping, when a orange ball of light had come down from the sky and , just before hitting the ground, it blew up. Many small white lights seem to leave in every direction. I woke my wife and told her I had just seen my first fireball lightning. I then noticed a very bright flashing strobe light on side of hill. I showed my wife. It just happened that the highway turned to where it was on the side of the hill. When I got to the top of the hill,it was about 100ft off highway. I pulled up next to it and told my wife I was going to walk over to it. She said no but I said I wanted to know what it was. I got out of my van and walked accross highway,into ditch where it was flashing. I tried to look at it but each time it flashed it blinded me. Halfway there I noticed another to my right. I called back to my wife, who was standing next to our van, look there are two of them. She yelled back &quot;no, thats the same one, it just moved&quot;. I then thought to myself that anything that can move that fast is probally nothing to mess with. My wife was yelling lets get out of here so I went back to van and told my wife to wake up my oldest son. I got in and preceeded down highway, when I noticed it was still beside our van. My wife says speed up and out run it.I was going over 100 and it still was still beside us. About 5 minutes later it seemed to fall back about a mile. I said I think we lost it, just then there it was beside us again. Down the road a ways the highway turns towards Pierre, we made the turn and noticed that the light didn&apos;t follow us in that direction. About 10 miles down that highway we stopped to check our kids. Everything seemed to be OK. Maybe we just imagined this, my wife said. I looked down the highway back in the direction that we came and saw the light in the distance.! No we d idn&apos;t imagine this, I said as I pointed back at it. We both got back in the van and left quickly. We couldn&apos;t get a look at it because it was to bright to look at, it lit up the surrounding area, as if it was day. We had a long nervous ride back to Jamestown that night.", "Giant craft? with random red blinking lights.I had seen something strange in the sky a week earlier.  I saw this ball of light or fire drip a small ball of fire or something.  You can see my report filed on 11-12-06.  Earlier today whole playing baseball I saw an f-15 jet fly pretty low over Long Beach.  I had a feeling something was up.  I had a feeling the last thing I saw was military.  Around 6pm I went out on the balcony to get some fresh air.  I noticed the normal air traffic coming and going near LAX.  I then saw these red lights flashing unlike the other planes.  I called my roommate to take a look and he also agreed that it was not an airplane.  We saw a group of lights moving about the speed of an airplane moving in a NW direction.  It seemed like it was flying along the coastline.  The lights would flash in random intervals. There where no other lights but about 4 red lights.  It could have been one craft, the lights moved as if it where one.  The size would have been huge, maybe miles wide! It was about as wide a 4 finger width, if you put your hand in front of you. We saw this thing continue north and finally disappeared in the horizon.  I went inside for a few minutes.  When I cam back out it had come back a bit like it turned around but was heading in he same direction again.  The lights would flash in random order.  It seems there where two on the outside and two closer to the middle.  The light flash was very bright and precise. These were not normal lights.  I would also guess the craft was in a v shape bcuase of the way the lights moved. I kept looking in the sky after it had gone.  I noticed some flashing lights again but this time it seems like an airplane.  I thought it could have been a military jet because the way the lights flashed where different than the other airplanes.  Later I saw a bright light approaching outside of the normal flight path.  Then the light turned off and I saw the same type of airplane lights that I saw after the red lights passed by.  I really think this was a military jet escorting ! or looki ng fir the craft. This is my second sighting of something strange in the sky within 2 weeks.  I have never seen anything strange before in my life.  I am college educated.  I also have really good eyesight.  I am glad my roommate was there.   I think he finally believed me about the thing I saw earlier in the week.  It seems like there has been a lot of activity going on in the LA area recently. I hope other people saw this thing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It has a fluctuating Green/blue/red/white luminosity and varies in intensity almost like a brightly twinkling star, except that no matter what tie o evening or early morning, it doesn&apos;t traverse the sky like the rest of the planets and stars. I pointed it out to several other people who dismissed it as an approaching plane, however it hasn&apos;t changed position on the night I have noticed it. I did not notic it befoe a week ago. It is positioned over south toward Fort Walton, and westward over the Gulf of Mexico. I thought perhaps it miht be a helicopter, howver it doesn&apos;t move at all, or fade. The lights are flashing, much like an aircraft. I may be wrong, but thought to report it... as everyone else has dismissed it as a star or plane without another thought. I am intrigued by how many people take for granted what is in the sky and aren&apos;t interested in even giving a second glance. Makes me wonder how much we actually are ginorant of and miss above us...very few people I know are willing to entertain the idea there might be something more in the nighht sky.((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Sirius, we suspect, or of some other star.

At first I assumed that it was a plane since I only seen it at a glance and since Ontario Airport is so nearby.  Figured I seen the plane as it was turning and only seen the green and not the red lights to signify port and starboard.  After a brief 1-1.5 seconds the light moved westbound in a quick motion leaving behind a bright green streak of light.  This speed was too fast to be a plane, jet or helicopter.  First assumption than was a shooting star however the fact that it was stationary when first seen and green leads my wife and I to assume it was something else.  Please post any comments if there were other witnesses.  I have seen number shooting stars in the past all were white to a yellowish color this was solid green and the streak left behind was very wide more like a strip.", "Saw 5 lights in the shape of what I first thought was a plane.

At first, it appeared to be a plane, but as it got closer, it was clear that it was shaped like a circle and had lights of different colors around the bottom.  It was completely silent and seemed low to the ground, not as high as an airplace.  It blocked out the stars as it passed very slowly directly above us. My friend freaked out and began shooting at the object with his pellet gun.  Seriously.  He was an unusual fellow.

However what I experienced (if this is the right term) is beyond my imagination. Tonight is Vov 4th (in this country the start f the Fireworks night to commemerate &quot;Guy Fawkes&quot; - what I saw tonight was not a firework. I glanced out of my window at approx 8pm and initial thought the stars were very bright. On closer look there were 3 large red/orange lights in a triangualar formation. The two lights at the back being closer together than than front (I would suggest that ths spacing looked very close to a Star destroyer congiguration that would be seen in star wars (that probable puts pay to any credibility you may think I had). I cam e down the stars and called to my mother to come out into the garden wereby she also confimd what I was seeing. The three lights stayed perfectly aligned and travelled for approc 30 secs very slowly across the sky. At this time I ran back upsatiars to get a further view but the lights had disappeared. In the mean time my mother had come back into the house to call my father to take a look, when she looked out of the window again she too confirmed that the lights had gone. What makes me think this was very odd:  1. We are on the flight path for planes from Heathrow to USA so are used to seeing lights in the sky and am used to determining sizes. 2. We are very close to FAIRFORD Airbase which over this last few weeks has been staging some sort of Nato Exercise. Local paepr stated that we would be seeing many different sorts of planes (we have, this was no plane). 3. Whaen I observed the &quot;Craft&quot; the lights were unusual in that they were reddish/orange slightlt diffused but large. All aircraft that I am familiar with have white strobes and I am used to the sizes. 4. When glancing up at this object although the only visible signs were the 3 orange/red lights the &quot;body&quot; of the craft blanked out all of the cloud making a very black shape against the night sky. 5. When the craft had disappeared the cloud could be seen again, thereby indicating to me that what had been between the 3 lights had infact been a solid object. 6. The configuaration of the lights would suggest to me that this was not 3 helicopters moving slowly in formation (it could not have been an aircraft to be flying so slowly). What more can I say - I am not crazy, I do not believe in UFO&apos;s- Unless the military operating out of FAIRFORD airbase have got a secret vehicle the size of a star destroyer from the star wars films I have to belive that this is an encounter with something from space.", "Midday observation of cylinder type wingless craft with pointed top which flew horizontally.I was approximately 12 years old, it was summer break.  I had been playing a ballgame with Barry F., Scott K., and Denny W.  It was lunch time and those three went to their respective houses to eat lunch.  I usually did not eat lunch so I waited in the open carport of Scott&apos;s house. It was approximately noon, it has been a long time so I am estimating the approximately month, day, and year.  It was near the intersection of Showalter Court and Seabridge Drive in the Laurel Park Subdivision in Orlando, Florida.  Barry&apos;s house was on the southeast corner, Denny&apos;s house was on the northeast corner, and Scott&apos;s house was one house to the east of Barry&apos;s house. I sat in the carport of Scott&apos;s house facing north.  I observed a white or silver in color craft which looked like a rocket sideways, a cylinder with a pointed top.  But the rocket looking craft was not flying upwards like a rocket launch, the craft was flying sideways in a counterclockwise motion from north to the west to the south very slowly.  The craft did not have wings. I lived not too far from what is today the Orlando International Airport, but then it was not an International Airport.  And I had lived near McCoy Airforce Base before that house, so I had seen plenty of airplanes and jets. When I saw the craft I immediately began yelling for the occupants inside Scott&apos;s house to come out.  I was even banging on the door. Finally, Scott&apos;s older sisters which were in high school came out.  But the craft had flown to the west out of sight.  I was very nervous trying to explain to them what I saw, but it was not there when they came out. I then ran home as fast as I could.  I began explaining to my mom and grabbed her by the hand to come outside and look at the strange craft.  But two story apartments were built to the south of our home and the apartments blocked the view of the craft as it flew from the west to the south still in a circular counterclockwise motion. I had not talked about the incident for almost 23 years when I had a great aunt on my maternal side come visit and have dinner.  During the night she mentioned about actual encounters with alien beings which included time loss, implantation of a device (which she states her doctor removed from her abdomen), and several follow up visits by aliens.  I had not said a thing to her when she confronted me about seeing an unidentified craft.  Her words I cannot recall totally were something to the effect of &quot;And you know because you have seen one haven&apos;t you?&quot;  I could only explain this confrontation as strange.  I never said a word to her about the incident. I did not know a sight like this existed.  I am currently a field grade military officer in the Army Reserves.  I am also a sworn law enforcement officer working as a detective.

They were blinking as two different lights one after the other making it look like two helicopters or planes moving together. But the time was 7:00 pm and it was dark as night so i realised there cant be some air show etc. After crossing baranala city and travelling almost 20 km from initial place of sighting. I could see those lights were not only one . So we pulled over near the village of sherpur and came out to see the lights clearly.The lights now were sufficiently apart. And suddenly i realised there was another 2 lights  placed somewhere between those two lights which blinked in a non orderly fashion. As we were watching two passing by persons also stopped to look at what we were pointing at. And also made me notice there was another red light which was further away from both almost in centre . And than another light started to blink which seemed to be on the opposite of the two. Making it look like a triangular shaped thing.I would like to stress as we could see it from far away it was very very high and it should have been no less than a 1km long plane. And when i observed that with moving from one place to another while watching these lights , i clearly saw that the part between these three rectangularly placed lights i couldnt see background stars!! So it was something solid like a plaine.And above all i couldnt believe why i did not stay there to watch it go . We saw for 15 minutes it was standing still. Than we kept on going on the road and from 20 kms i kept on looking behind till i could see them no more. I couldnt believe what i saw and i couldnt believe that how could i move from that place even when it was there.There is a army air divcision in that area and it was almost exactly over that. Still i dont claim to know why it was there. But as i saw it  ibelieve in it. And i will now on keep a camera but i doubt if i will ever get a chance to record it .The sighting lasted for almost 30 minutes.I am waiting for news paper tommorow lets see if we get any news on that i will scan that send you. Thanks! I am now convinced these things are not only in America but in India and perhaps every part of the world. It is so foolish to see that developed countries and its people believe less in them.

I was with two friends and we were discussing the subject of lunch with my mother.  One of us looked up, pointed, and we all looked up over Lake Pocotopaug, into a cloudless sky.  We observed about six silver discs (flying saucers) flying in a loose formation. They were absolutely silent.  There were no obstructions in our view of them.  It was an amazing sight.  At that age, I was not yet exposed to science fiction, and this was all new to me.  The craft floated (for lack of a better word) at a speed of perhaps several hundred miles an hour (relatively slow) towards us, then turned left out of our view.  Afterward we all discussed what we saw, agreed we all saw the same thing, and then my mother, ((name deleted)), told all of us that we should not discuss what we saw.  At that age we obeyed, but I never got to query my Mom about the incident before she died.  It was such an important event in my life that I have always remembered it.  I am 58 years old today, and I want to submit this report today, before my recollection is forever lost.  It also may be substantiated by other viewings.  In respect to the craft themselves, the were saucer like with bubble tops.  It&apos;s almost embarrassing to report this as modern fiction has capitalized on this vision.  The craft were basically silver but with colors of red and blue.  I used to know where all the colors of red and blue were, but I have forgotten. Using my experience at the time, I used to say that the edges of the craft were wavy like the heat coming off a hot summer asphault(sp) road.  I now watch on TV theories of gravitation, etc. and see similar results.  All I can say is that for my craft, they were solid objects with fuzzy edges.

Noticed planes doing flight patterns for Ohare as always at night.  However, between observing planes I noticed a quite large boomerang shaped object with dim/ faint yellowish lights lining the V-shape of the bottom.  Strangely, could only make out the shape against the partly cloudly and starry sky.  The object seemed to blend in well with the night sky as if camouflaged mostly--it moved very slowly southward. Could not hear any sounds from it either.    As I am about 2.5+ miles from the lake, I am guessing it was somewhere between my location and the lake.  Maybe closest to Wrigley Field area--and headed south.

I had my 20X binoculars with me. I saw a very bright light to my right; to the Northwest moving toward the Southeast. I got up from my seat and looked through my binoculars. I saw no strobe lights, or wing lights, nor was there a sound. I figure that the object may have been around 1000 feet or so in altitude. At that altitude sound would have been detectable. The interesting thing about this was the glow around the light --- and I must say, it was very bright. When the object got just about overhead I ran down to the entryway of the building and watched it for a few seconds more. This took about 10 seconds. When the building got in the way again, I ran to the parking lot to the South side of the building to watch it until it disappeared into the high haze in the Southeast.", "Man sees cloaked triangle shaped object slicing through clouds above his head.I had previously sent this report in, and had received a reply email regarding date specifics on this one.

Then a small black oblong item dropped just below the triangle of spheres.These things remained this way for several mins.Then the small objects to the left of thr main object started to slowly move away. At this time the main object started to glow abit brighter.Now heres the kicker... The main object then appeared to blowup (for as far away as this was it looked like a massive explosion, it almost filled up the field of view of the binoculars)But then I noticed that it looked more like steam than smoke. Through this steam cloud I could barely see the main object and it looked like it was seperating within this vapor cloud. In an instant all objects were gone,the cloud acted like a vortex and everything was just gone.Nothing fell from the sky. There were no clouds that day , clear as a bell. I am only about 15 mins from Greensboro International airport,I have not checked with them yet to see if they picked it up on radar.

We were driving our car north/west-bound on Miller Road on our way to dinner.  It was 5:30-6:00 on a sunny day.  There were cars ahead of and behind us, but not what I&apos;d call heavy traffic.  Miller Road is very hilly, and you find yourself either staring into the sky or at the ground as you go up and down the hills.  We were getting some glare on the windshield from the late afternoon sun as we crested the hills. As we reached the top of one hill, a brilliant ball of light appeared for a second or two in front of us and off to the left.  It seemed to hover breifly, and then was gone.  I muttered &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; to no one in particular - my wife and two older children heard this.  I turned to my older daughter (11 at the time) who was sitting in the front passenger seat, and as if on cue she said &quot;I don&apos;t know Dad&quot;.   Iasked her what she saw, and she again said she didn&apos;t know - but added &quot;It looked like a big ball of light&quot;.  My wife, 8 y.o. son and 3 y.o. daughter were all in the back seat,  and didn&apos;t see anything - at least they didn&apos;t make any comment. About this time, a car had caught up with us, and honked at me to go.  I had come to a complete stop in the middle of the road!  None of the other cars I could see gave any indication that they had seen anything - they all just kept driving.  I blew this incident off at the time, and my daughter and I never talked bout it afterwards.  However it never seemed right, and it still bothers me.  I am an engineer by vocation, and can rationalize almost everything.  However this is something I have never been able to explain to myself.  I&apos;d be the first to admit it was glare off the windshield, except what I saw was off to the east side of the road.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

You state that you were driving to the northwest, approximately, and that the flash of light was to your left, would that ot have been in the western sky.  I believe you state that the object would have to have been east of the road.  I am confused by that apparent contradiction.  Is there something I don&apos;t understand about the event?Thanks, again, for the interesting report!  Do you think that you might be able to pin down the precise date of the incident, if you were to think about it for a while?Also, may I pass your report along to some skilled UFO investigators in Missouri?  I think they would like to know about the event.Cordially,Peter Davenport, DirectorNational UFO Reporting Center((RESPONSE))...After the above &quot;wool-gathering&quot;, I still can&apos;t say for sure, but 7/10/98 would appear to be the most likely candidate.

The light to the right and on top seemed to go to the right and circle around the other two.  This one light was moving at a fairly rapid speed.

While I was laying on the hill on my front lawn staring up into the sky at the stars a super bright object that first appeared to be a shooting star shot across the night sky.  This object had no tail trailing it and it stopped on a dime.  It was very bright, larger and alot brighter than the north star.  This object stood out among the stars and seemed to pulse a little bit.  Seconds later two more shot across the sky one behind the other and stopped in the same location as the first light, it appeared to be in a triangular pattern.  After a few seconds these super bright star like lights sstarted shooting across the sky as if the were following one another.  The speed was incredible, they would move from the western portion of the sky to the eastern portion in a spilt second and each would stop on a dime.  After a couple of minutes it appeared as if the came closer to the earth because they increased in size and the bright white light became more intence.  After zipping around for a few minutes each object zipped off towards the eastern skyline following one another and vanished in a split second.  I layed there for a couple of minutes to see if they would come back, they did, as fast as they disappeared that had returned.  They were shooting all over the sky as if they were playing some kind of game, after a few more minutes they seemed to shoot off into space because they did not travel across the night sky the way they had been.

There had been a lot of fireworks being shot off that earlier that night, but there were some &quot;fireworks&quot; in the distance that wouldn&apos;t go away. My friend was the first to point it out, but once he pointed I saw them. There were two green lights hovering stationary above the horizon, about 2-3 miles away (estimated). We thought they were sparks from the fireworks that were falling to the ground, but they never fell and they were very large at the distance we were viewing them. They started to move apart from one another slowly in a horizontal manner.  Then the light on the right moved vertical above the one on the left. At this point my mind was reeling trying to figure out what this was we were watching.  Next, the lower light moved to be even with the light on the right and very quickly after they were even, the light on the right blasted straight up ward at a speed I have never witnessed before, very very fast. After that one was about half way out of sight the other one on the left took off at equal fast speed. These lights never changed colors they stayed bright green the whole time.

They told me that they have known me since I was about 8 years old and was aware of my age at the time of the dream.  It was so vivid that I woke up and looked out the window as the sun was piercing through the window as I had the curtain pulled/drawn back.

I did not see a craft, but certainly heard something. I was attending school at the Naval Training Center (NTC) in San Diego.  I had seen a movie (The Neptune Factor) and was walking back to the barracks.  Passing through a parking lot, I heard a tremendous sound - imagine something the size of a 747 passing 100 feet overhead with its engines shut down.  It was not the wind... I have spent quite a bit of time outdoors and know it was not something like that.  Being a glider pilot, I know the sound that aircraft make when they fly without power - and it was almost like that, but 100x louder than any sailplane. When this happened, I stopped and looked up.  Unfortunately, there were bright lights in the parking lot and I could not see if the stars were obscured. NTC is directly in the flight path of Lindberg Field.

Such was the location of my sighting; an east-west driveway that is bounded by a seven foot wood gate on the east, my house (roof height of 25&apos; to 40&apos; at its peak) along the south side, my neighbors 6&apos; fence, house and 50&apos; tree on the north side boundary, and the west side bounded by a stand of 30 -45&apos; trees. My house sits in the east to west take-off flight path of our airport which is approx. 10 miles due east. Those planes are normally transiting a bit north of, yet parallel with this driveway. As an avid aviation buff since I was very young (my grandfather had a horse farm right across the highway from the now closed Amarillo Air Base which was a SAC installation), I am always checking the sky. On this particular night at 12:35 AM, I had taken my dogs out one last time for the night and I was standing in the driveway area that is darker than any other area around the north or west side of my house, perusing the sky. For whatever reason, I was looking straight to the east when I noticed three pinpoints of light emerging from the tree line of my neighbors house across the street (this would have been at an angle of about 20 degrees). These three points of light increased in size to the point where I could see that they were each delta shaped and were in a tight triangular formation as well. I was stunned that they were perfectly aligned with my driveway! At about 75 degrees I could see that the back edge of each delta shaped light was blurred. When these objects were directly overhead I would say that they were each about 1 1/2 width of a quarter. The formation remained tight until about 120 degrees (the objects were close to entering the west tree line boundary which would obscure my clear view) when the lights suddenly performed a &quot;shuffling&quot; move and regrouped into the same triangular formation. During the entire episode, I would say that each light&apos;s luminosity remained constant, only the relative size of the object/light increased and diminished as would be expected. Absolutely no noise whatsoever. One final kicker - as I was trying to figure the speed/altitude of the overflight and looking straight up from the same position - I saw a meteor streak from southeast to northwest and flame out right over my head! (obviou sly at a very high altitude because the streak was the length of my forearm and unobstructed by the roof line). Because of the manner in which the lights first appeared I was thinking that they could be at a fairly low altitude (5000 - 10,000&apos;?), but at the overhead apex I just could not get a &quot;read&quot;. But I do estimate their speed to be at least 3-5 times faster than an aircraft if they were both at a relative cruising altitude.

Initially I saw this one with the other when I took pictures. I kept watching to see what would happen and kept the binoculars as steady as possible observing that I had to adjust when the craft moved up or to the side which it did quite often. Many colors were visible including blue, red, green, yellow and white. It would move further away from me toward the east then come back and then white lights became more visible within this cloud or mist in which it was travelling. The other craft was similar but smaller and was not as dominant so I paid less attention to it. The land across the Rio Grande is private and there is a road where I sometimes see a car but this UFO was above the mountains. It was larger than any star, much different and had colored lights appearing to me to be circular. Also at times it displayed very erratic movement, zig-zagging across the sky. I kept expecting it to disappear or move off at the speed of light but it did not and the display became quite monotonous.", "Orange lights in the skyI was driving home through the Gila River Indian Reservation (on the southern edge of the Phoenix metro area), when I noticed several dark orange, bright circular lights in the sky (like the color of street lights).  I drove through Maricopa until I was in open land again, and could see a total of four lights about 5 miles to the southwest, several thousand feet up.  There were three lights in a straight line, and a fourth light a little ways off, making an elongated isosceles triangle.  The lights would randomly flicker on and off - sometimes off for 30 seconds and then flicker on in the same location).   I watched for a couple minutes - the total duration from when I first saw them until they totally flickered off was about 20-25 minutes.  I turned around to head home, and as I was driving back in my subdivision, I could see the one light again at the top of the triangle (maybe 10 minutes after I left).  The whole thing was stationary, and didn&apos;t move.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly flares over the Gila Bend Firing Range??

They were moving horizontally from a N to S direction at about 5000 ft.( Our best guess)The distance between us and the lights was maybe 1-2 miles and our viewing was just from the West side of the 15 Fwy looking out towards the East. They were a hazy yellowish or orange color.  Because we live near a private airport, we are used to a lot of air traffic as well as traffic coming and going from March Airforce Base and Miramar.  Also because of the Palomar Observatory, all of our street lights are dim to allow viewing.  So because of this, we also see very clearly on almost every night meteorites coming down. These 2 lights were going so quickly that it startled us. There was also no sound coming from them, and believe me, after spending time my whole life around military bases, nothing can fly at that speed without breaking the sound barrier and causing some kind of noise. The only way to descibe their formation would be to illustrate it.( -_ ) Thats pretty much what they looked like. Took about 5 seconds to across the sky and then just disappeared.", "Bluish White Sphere slightly sporadic in movementI went out to smoke. same as i always do and as i have done in past reports. this time i went to the back of my truck which was parked in my driveway because it blocks out some light so I can see the stars better. I turned west to face my house and looked up. I saw something moving very slowly and it was fairly bright in the North West sky.  I tried to focus on it and see if I could see lights thinking it was a plane. but all I saw was a bluish white glow. and it was moving rather oddly. it changed its path, moving slightly up and down and also in a circular way. This time i wasted no time getting my mom who came ready with the binoculars. she also commented on it&apos;s weird movement. it began heading over a tree which was directly in front of me to the north.  I saw a plane come into view just under the object. and it kind of curved it&apos;s path a little upward as if to avoid the plane&apos;s space. once passed it continued a little more odd movement then began to dim then finally disappear. It was too slow to be a shooting star and left no trail.  It could have been an asteroid but it looked to close in the sky from other asteroids i have observed.

As I looked closer, I noticed that there were many flashing white objects perhaps 8-12.  The Objects appeared to be the size of large stars and were flashing a white lights (much like christmas twinkle lights).  I pulled over to get a better look.  I could not determine a specific shape or formation to the lights, however, as the lights moved, the objects stayed in the same position relative to each other.  There is no way these were normal aircraft, they were too close to each other even though the pattern took up a large portion of the sky above the airport.  I went home to get my camera and head back to the airport.  As I approached the airport from the highway, a truck tore into the main entrance ahead of me at a high rate of speed and sped out to the tower.  When I parked at the airport, I could not find the object, and some low clouds or fog had set in and was covering much of the sky.  I could no longer see the object, and got no pictures.  I noted on &quot;normal aircraft&quot; apparently circling the airport, but that could possibly be a normal training flight.", "When i first saw the object it looked like a satilite, due to the fact that it didn&apos;t flash like a plane, then it faded out after about 15 seconds it reappered and then faded out several times as it headed north, north west and eventualy faded out completly.  this object faded out in regular intervals and it was far too slow for it to be an airplane.", "A disc shaped craft, approximately thirty feet in diameter, hovered silently roof level.My two sons and I stood in awe on our front porch as a disc shaped craft, approximately thirty feet in diameter, hovered silently roof level at the intersection of two cross streets --- just feet from where we stood.

As I looked up and down the street I thought the lack of cars on the road was equally bizarre. The craft then slowly and silently floated down the street parallel to the street.

It was silent and reflecting the lights of the parking lot off of the bottom of it.  There really wasn&apos;t a shape to it...it was just a mass moving across the sky reflecting everything that it flew over from the bottom.  We watched it until we could&apos;nt see it any longer.

However, the light was a constant white color, very comparable to the color of Sirus, but without the splashes of color that I often see in Sirus.  The intensity of the light was the only variable I noticed.As close as I can estimate, the light approached from a bearing of about 250 degrees (true) and departed on a bearing of about 70 degrees (true).  I would further estimate that the light would have passed almost directly over the intersection of routes 100 and 170 at about 19:10.  I could not discern any craft or shape against the sky.

However, I live on the other side of the Bay Area and we saw this extremely huge and brilliant phenomena on the CBS5.com weather cam called &quot;Mt Vaca cam.&quot; We also noticed a projection that seemed to beam above and down from the brilliant light, but not when we first viewed the web cam.  I&apos;m very new to the digital, web cam world so I didn&apos;t know if there was a way to save this viewing on my computer, because I knew it was something out of this world and I was 99% sure I wouldn&apos;t see anything like it on that web cam in the daylight and I was right!  I have a feeling that what was seen was a possible stargate to another dimension because it did not look like any UFO&apos;s I have seen reported and the object did not move from it&apos;s location.  The colors we saw were a grey vertical beam with red and gold shining like a huge bright star, so bright it almost hurt our eyes to look at it continually.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what a &quot;stargate to a new dimension&quot; could be, but we are only amateurs at this job, so we have to be receptive to any new concept, I guess.

He yelled pull over and grab the recorders. I did just that. we recorded and tried to annilize what was going on. At one point there were too many of these white light spots to count.

It got pretty slow so i decided to take a walk and smoke a cigerette. It was very clear outside, you could see planes everywhere. I was standing in the parking lot facing east when i caught sight of a pair of very bright lights in the sky. I stood there looking at them for about 5 mins. I dropped me cigerette and ran back down the road to the main lobby. One of the security staff was sitting at the desk. I told him that i had seen a few bright lights in the sky and that i was going to the top of the 700 wing to get a better view.( that wing has 6 floors and the roof there is the highest part of the building.) I asked if he would come with me up there and he agreed. We took the elevator up then walked the 2 flights of stairs to get to the roof. We stepped out onto the roof and i immediatly saw the 2 lights right away. i pointed them out to the gaurd. We watched both lights for about 5 mins. One of the lights blacked out and was no longer visable but the one that was became even brighter. It began to move across the horizen towards the south. It then stopped and started to pulsate. When this began to happen i noticed there was a plane off behind and below the light. This is how we know that it was just hovering there. After a few more minutes i noticed the light had a black ring around the center of it. I turned to say something to the gaurd and when i turned back the light was gone.

He gave me a jab and was pointing into the sky. The object he was pointing at appeared to be a little larger than a satellite appears and had a slightly fuzzy yellow light to it. I actually thought it was a satellite until it made a sudden jag from its North/Northeast line of travel to a Northern one. Apx. 10 more seconds into its flight it made a sudden Northwestern zig, maintained this for apx. 5-10 seconds and then made a sharp zig back to the North path again. It was completely silent and it was difficult to determine its height and/or size. Our best estimate is that it was at least 10,000 feet up and probably traveling in the 1,000 mph speed range. My brother in law had already observed it zigging from a Northern course to the Northeasterly path it was on when I first saw it.

It was fairly low, maybe 500 feet or less in altitude.  The object appeared to be approximately twice as thick, and 25% longer, than a large passenger jet.  It was rush hour, traffic was very fast and heavy, and throughout the sighting I did not feel it was safe to pull over to the narrow left shoulder of the highway.  I was concentrating on watching the object while intermittently making sure I didn&rsquo;t drive off the road or hit another car.  The object appeared to be hovering in the sky, blimp-like.  The bright morning sun was in the east, and the object was in the west, so it was fully illuminated from my perspective.  Visibility was extremely clear.  An aircraft in that circumstance would appear bright whitish-silver, but this object was dark black.  The edges of the rectangle were fairly sharp and stark, but it is possible that there was some additional dimension at the edges.  After driving for maybe 15-20 seconds, I lost sight of the object behind some trees.  After another 25 seconds or so, I passed the trees and was able to see the object again.  At this point it was maybe two-thirds its original size, and I felt that it was moving to the southwest, perhaps 90 miles an hour or so, roughly keeping pace with me in a southern direction, but moving farther west away from the highway.  It was still starkly black.  I watched it for maybe another 20 seconds, when before my eyes it began to fade.  Within about five seconds, it completely faded out of sight.  My impression was not that it moved rapidly away, although that might be possible.  Rather it seemed to get fuzzy, misty and dimmer, until it just faded out of sight.  Much like a cloaking device was going into effect.  It was an amazing sight.  The highway curved, and I kept looking ou! t in tha t direction.  Maybe 25 seconds later I saw it again, but now it was a whitish color that very much blended in with the sky and made seeing it difficult.  By now it appeared to be even farther southwest, and was maybe half or one-third the size as it was when I first saw it.  After another 10 seconds or so, the highway turned again.  I lost sight of the object and never saw it again.  For comparison, I did observe airplanes in the sky immediately afterward, as they are very common in the area, and they were clearly visible as airplanes, bright silvery-white, not at all black, and very clearly not rectangular.  Living in the Chicago area all my life, I&rsquo;ve seen thousands and thousands and thousands of airplanes, helicopters, blimps, birds and balloons.  This object was certainly none of these.", "a POSSIBLE major ufo sighting in the Swindon area of wiltshire, UKIn regards to an email you recieved last night regarding a possible major ufo sighting, we now have pictures to send and will use the link provided to email them to you electronically. Incase you thought this was a hoax, I will explain the occurence of which happened within the estimated time period we described. The first object we saw travelled from west to east, or south-west to east, it was bright orange to red in colour, travelling at a fairly low speed, it then stopped altitude estimate: 1 1/2 miles, before gradually fading and dissapearing over a time spand of approx 2 minutes. This was then followed on a regular interval on the same track and stopping at exactly the same position in the skyline. Then approx an hour after this started, we then sighted four of the same objects grouped together and converging in the same area before dissapearing. We took the photo(s) on a digital camera - we still have the original images on that camera, and the images I will email to you remain unedited. After we downloaded them onto hard drive, we zoomed in to discover that they appear to be a bank of lights surrounded in an orange haze - also some were diamond formation. We also have video footage captured on camcorder (but sadly the viewing quality is not brilliant due to night-time filming - keeps going out of focus). Being bonfire night we appreciate and are open to possible explanations or sceptism, but we certainly have not seen anything like this before - and the images clearly show that the object was not a firework. According to a relative - their neighbours also sighted this event. Hope you find this interesting and can work out a feasible explanation.

We were looking up and directly underneath the object - from that angle it looked cigar shapped. It was grey/brown in color and had no windows and made no sound. We were trying to figure out what it was. We lived only 10 minutes from Newark International airport and we were very familiar with aircraft since our house was in a flight path. It was not a plane, helicopter of blimp. I ran into the house to get my camera to take a picture but unfortunatley I didn&apos;t have any film. I came back out of the house and the object passed over us and was heading towards the direction of Staten Island NY. It started to climb higher and suddenly with tremendous speed took off and in a few seconds was gone from our sight. There was never any sound upon acceleration of the object. It did have a trail of some type of light shinny dust or light behind it as it vanished. This happened a very long time ago but I can still see the object in my mind as though it happened yesterday.

The part of the sky I was looking at was &quot;framed&quot; by the house structure so when I looked up I only had a brief sighting of the jet but my eye suddenly caught the outline of some other kind of craft that appeared to be much higher than the jet I had just seen.  I looked at it for a second not knowing what it was but trying to identify it.  As I was watching it, it remained stationary but appeared to rotate or move constantly in one place.  As it moved or rotated I could see that it was triangular, in appearance. I asked my son if he saw it and he said yes.  He, at first, thought it was a satellite, star or a planet but after watching it for awhile, we both noticed it wasn&apos;t moving across the sky.  Unfortunately, we didn&apos;t have any binoculars or other means to view it any closer. I asked him how he would describe it and he said it looked either triangular or rectangular. We both looked away for a few minutes to gather some other lights to hang on the house and when we looked up to view the object again, it had vanished.  We could not locate the object again.

As it approached town it seemed more like a helicopter, as it starting descending, al this point you could see others lights of diferent colors rotating, until thier where all sorts of lights. Approximately after crossing Mexican airspace, and entering U.S. airspace the aircraft gained altitude and speed,doing ackward movements. Descebding and then ascending very rapidly with more multicolor lights, still in a very akward way, at my not at all familiar knowledge of aviation, it seemed like the erratic movements where either evasive moves or it had been hit by some friendly fire. This conclusion I draw, considering that at some 30 miles away due northwest of Mexicali, there is a U.S. Air Force Base at Seeley California, as well as at some 40 miles due east there is another U.S. Air Force Base in Yuma, Arizona, that leads me to conjure that after being detected by either Mexicali International Airport or U.S.A.F. at Seeley, Ca. or Yuma, Az. once in U.S. airspace Aircrafts and other measures had being taken.

As it became the total focus of my attention, another light of the same type appeared at its right hand side, and then another, and then finally a fourth, creating a perfect straight line. The four lights were the exact same size, same distance from each other (each void space was equivalent to 5 diameters of one light), and had a delay time of two seconds between new illuminations, and moved in unison, as though attached to each other. At this time, my mind flashed back to images of the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; witnessed a couple years ago. This grouping looked the suspiciously the same. The lights did not illuminate in an &quot;instant on&quot; fashion. They came into view more like high pressure gas lights -- it was a sudden, almost gaseous, burst of light that took a half second or so to evolve to a 100% brightness. The plane of these lights was diagonally tilted with the left hand side lower, and slowly dipped into the clouds as I drove toward it. Because of the cloud&apos;s interference, I couldn&apos;t determine if there was second side suggesting a shaped outline, a la the Phoenix Lights. I figured the only way I was going to see the configuration as a whole was to race past the cloud bank and hope it would still be there. I misjudged. After driving for several minutes, I realized that the clouds were much farther away than I had estimated. The bar of lights eventually moved completely behind them and disappeared. In retrospect, I should have stopped and exited my vehicle for observation. The cloud bank distance made me consider how huge these lights must have been for they seemed so large at my viewing distance. Each was several hundred times larger in diameter than the brightest star in the sky.

All three ufo&apos;s had round, very bright lights at all three points.  They were moving very slowly, and rotated circularly at the same time.  There was no noise being generated, it was completely quiet.  I pulled the car over, got out, walked around the car and into the field.  It was awesome, I was so happy to see them.  I wanted to run out into the field to get a better look, but my wife started panicing, telling me to get back in the car or she was going to leave without me, now I wish I would have.  A few days later we found out that the flight line at McGuire AFB was shut down at the same time we saw the ufo&apos;s, and F-16 fighters were sent out to investigate, freaky!  Talk about an awesome experience, great!  My wife and I both think it is obvious that they were observing what was going on, with the events of 911, and our sudden stop of daily routines.  Keep looking up in the sky, you never when you might see a ufo, awesome!", "4 Bright objects fly in formation over downtown Denver and the Platte River.This sighting occured after my initial sighting of a seperate craft earlier in the night (I reported that sighting separately). The four craft came from the East over downtown Denver. They were flying in an eratic formation at first (but still to fast and to presise to be birds, not to mention the fact that they were luminescent). They then made a sharp turn over the Platte River (now flying in a steady horizontal line with even spacing) and continued that way (West) untill they vanished over my building.", "Myself &amp; 4 children (age 1 - 14) driving at night saw a bright light (looked like a large light with a straight tail moving fast) ahead of us in the sky.   At first, I thought it was Haley&apos;s comet which was due later that year, but quickly realized it was not. We pulled over to the side of the road which is something I would never do because of safety, but this situation was overwhelming.  (No other cars were on this road).This &quot;light&quot; then came directly beside us moving about 5 miles per hour.  It was cigar shaped (looked like an airplane with no wings), as long as a football field, made no sound, had a large light near the front and smaller ones down the side (which is why it looked like a comet with a tail - from a distance.  It was just above the treetops just to our right (It was so close we could have thrown a stone at it).  My son got out of the car and walked down the sidewalk beside it as it slowing traveled by. (I kid him now, that his photo is probably hanging on some martians wall!)  We were sooo amazed.  I kept assuring the children that this had to be some special project the government was working on and that I&apos;m sure others had to have seen it and we would watch the 11:00pm news to hear what it was.  We were not afraid (I didn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s at that time).  We were just amazed.  Anyway, we tried to follow it by going around the block and heading in the direction it was going.  We went to the next street over and pulled over hoping it would fly over us, but it never did.  So, we went home and watched the news.  The news man said they had recieved numerous calls of a UFO, but &quot;all I can say is what they tell me to say - it was falling space junk.  It was spotted entering the atmosphere as a fire ball&quot; (about 10 minutes before we spotted it). &quot;It was sighted from Tampa to Georgia.&quot;  --- What we saw was definitly not falling!!  And at that moment my eyes swelled with tears, because I realized that what we had seen was so rare that very few people would ever get to experience something like this in their lives.In the newspaper the following few days, people that had spotted it came forward describing what we had witnessed, but no one had come as close as we had.  I did not tell anyone except close family members, because my husband was in law enforcement and I didn&apos;t want people to think his family was looney. (Of course, some of my relatives didn&apos;t believe it either, and I don&apos;t blame them - I probably wouldn&apos;t have believed it either.) Needless to say I and my children (who are now grown) definitely believe in UFOs and really feel blessed to have experienced this.  I believe that God created the universe and it only makes sense that there is more life elsewhere.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I saw a bright flash on the horizon like from the ridiculously bright water tower flasher in Seneca Falls.  I figured it was one of those.  Its light was certainly too bright to be an airplane, and it was instant-on, instant-off like an LED, but really bright.  The color was bluish-white much like an LED flashlight.  It was probably as bright as the water tower flasher in Seneca Falls&hellip; but this was no water tower.  The flash was moving westbound above the interstate.  Within a four or five flashes,  probably five seconds (it wasn&rsquo;t flashing quite every second) it was passing over us.  It must have been a bit north of the thruway because I could see it by looking out of the driver&rsquo;s window.  The lights reflected off of some type of metallic silver body of the craft, but I was unable to get a good grasp of shape or size.  My eyes were confused just looking at it.  It seemed to be triangular with two lights at each point of the triangle.  Leaning towards the window and looking straight up, I was hardly watching the road at this point.  Good thing there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of traffic. It was not any passenger airplane, that&rsquo;s for sure.  Those lights were too bright, and there was zero sign of the craft between the flashes.

I first noticed it while observing a large, high flying jet. The jet was flying at an altitude that still allowed its shape to be discernable.  I am not sure if it was a commercial or military jet. The jet was laying out quite a good con-trail, (that&apos;s what caught my attention.) The jet was traveling from east to west/southwest. Then I noticed the object. It appeared to be at the approximate same altitude as the jet, and perhaps within a quarter of a mile from the jet. Its relative position to the jet was rearward and to the left, (from my perspective). I brought it to the attention of the other two people with me. It appeared to be stationary. It was round in shape, metallic. It was very silvery and shiny. It remained stationary, and then after a short time, it began to pace the aircraft.  But, the jet slowly gained distance, as the UFO was traveling at a slower speed.  It remained off to one side and rearward of the aircraft as it moved. I had enough time to gain access to my garage and retrieve a pair of binoculars.  I observed the object through binoculars for perhaps 30 seconds. It was definately round, perhaps &quot;ball-like&quot;.  I was able to definately observe that there were no wings or other protrusions.  On what would appear to be the bottom were two lights.  One was large and white and very bright.  I mean very bright! The other was much smaller and red. The shape was very discernable through the binoculars, and WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE OR JET!,  It was round.  It could have been a disc, but it really seemed to be ball-like orb...at least from my viewing position. Total time viewed was at least two minutes. Then it was no longer in sight.  I cannot describe its departure.  We could just no longer find it in the sky.", "We saw pyramid shaped objects in the sky.We were leaving my friends house after a party, when we looked up and saw some kind of pyramid shaped objects in the sky.

We looked around and one of our group spotted a group of lights headed just slightly away from us.  There were about 8 of them and they seemed to be traveling at an astonishingly fast speed that was steadily moving about one hundred feet above us.  Some of the more timid members of our group got scared and we all ran with them south, and away from the lights.  When we were running we could tell by how our shadows had shifted and moved to in front of us (rather than to the left) that they were following us.  We ran and ran as they stayed aproximatly the same distance behind us when we then hid in a cave that was along the side of the rood.  The next day those of us who lived nearby woke up to go to work and found that we must have walked in our sleep and hurt our noses (our pillows had a little blood on them) which we think must have been a psychological effect from taking in the fearsome sight of the UFO.", "GREEN GLOWING OVAL WITH TAILlOOKING SOUTH OUT MY WINDOW ON THE 26TH FLOOR ONE EVENING IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF 2A I NOTICED A NEON GREEN BLOB WITH  TAIL FLOTING AND HOVERING OVER THE CITY.

I keep hearing a very strange, un-natural noise coming from oustide. When i first hear something, it sounded as if a large, heavy object was bouncing outside on the street. It ceased only a minute later. Shortly after this happened, not even 10 minutes later, i heard something else. This was a very strange noise as well. I can compare it to so few things. I could tell by the sound that it was high in the air, much like you can a jet. But this sound was stationary, possibly 10-15 feet to the side of my house. The best why i can describe it is that of a jet engine, with a waving sound. The almost hovering noise would pulse in and out. It sounded like a jet had stopped moving, and the engine was turning off and on very quickly.. i do not know how to put it. Than while i was hearing this, i heard the bouncing noise again, this time on the side of the house. This stopped quickly again, than the jet like sound trailed off as well. I have not yet went outside.. it is 2:08 am, and i am feeling quite uneasy about this. What ive just said may not seem like a UFO, but it is not the first time i have seen or heard something.

I was younger, and across the street from my house with my brother, and his friend. There is a long drive way leading away from their farm, which we were riding are bikes down. it was very dark, and getting late, possibly 11pm. When the three of us got to the end of the drive way, we all stared at an object hoving over a field, maybe 1/2 a mile away. it was a very large disk/saucer shaped object, with long sides, there were also lights on the sides of it. I remember this very clearly. It may sound like a hoax, or something different from a UFO. But it was very clear for how dark it was. And i know it was not an airplane, helicopter, weather balloon.. nothing like that. We were kind of frightened by th! is so we turned around and rode back to the house.

It was outside the window that overlooks the space between our building and the next, a width of about 5 feet betweein the two buildings.  The day was overcast but it was light outside. No country, or group of countries could have made this object.

There was no aircraft in its vicinity, and it had no noticeable affect on any equipment in my livingroom where I was when I saw it.  I do not have pictures of it.
