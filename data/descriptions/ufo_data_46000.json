["UFO Sighting On January 15, 2008 at 2:30 AM, South Carolina.My friend (24, student) and I (26, job searching) were driving home on January 15, 2008 at around 2:30 in the morning. It was a clear, starry night. I was talking to him, when from the Corner of my eye I saw a round/oval shape of light shooting by. This only lasted for 2 to 3 seconds. We were moving east at the time. It was about the size of a headlight of a car, maybe even bigger and it was radiating a very bright light. I would say the light had a color between yellow and orange. The object radiated those 2 colors intermittently (You can compare it to a star blinking in the sky.) The object was moving downwards choosing a curved path. It looked like it was going to land, but we can&apos;t be sure of this. The object then disappeared behind the tree line. There was no sound whatsoever. I was about to say to him: &ldquo;look a shooting star&rdquo;. But because of the size of the object I don&rsquo;t think it was a shooting star. Then he asked me if I just saw that, I answered yes, and we compared our sightings. We came to the conclusion that we both saw the same thing and that it wasn&rsquo;t a shooting star or a plane.", "oregon coast rectangle football field sized white square lightsMe and a freind where looking out our parked car window at about 9 PM. We both noticed what seemed to be a star moving from north to south.We got out to look it approached very quickly and then slowed to what seemed like a few mph.We saw 2 vertical square white lights approx. 100 feet above us.As the obect passed over us the vertical lights went out of view and we could see a set of horizontal white lights.Then a set of blue square lights swept back at not quite a 45 degree angle.Then another set of white lights.All of the lights where non radiant but bright and solid.As far as i could tell the object was about the size of a football field.It moved from then north to south southeast.As soon as it had passed over us it appeared as a star and quickly moved over the horizon.It made a slight humming noise.The night was very clear and dark stars where extremely visible.I recently talked to someone who gave the same description of an object during the same time period but in broad daylight within a mile of my sighting.The only difference was that he and the person with him heard the obejct.I had never told anyone of my sighting so i was shocked to hear another account.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The lights were just above the ground and appeared to be 5 to 6 miles away. At first we thought it was a fire because of the glow beneath it so my step dad who is a police officer called the dispatch to see if any calls have came in about a fire. The dispatcher said none have come in. We knew it wasn&rsquo;t a fire when the lights came towards the ground and disappeared. Approximately 5 minutes later the light would come back up again into the sky where they would hover for another 15 minutes.  They repeated this process for about an hour. We were positive that they weren&rsquo;t flares, planes, towers, or helicopters. The largest army Base Fort Hood is north of where our house is and the lights were in that direction.  So we might have thought it was some kind of military operation. We have never seen anything like this and what interested us more were the reports that came in a week later on the news.", "comet-like cloud close to M33I just wondered if any of you were out stargazing last evening and can help me identify an object. 6:45 pm  In the vicinity of M33 I discovered a comet-like cloud but too big to be a comet.  It was about the size of the full moon at zenith and quite bright with a white star-like spot at center. It seemed to be moving so I ran inside to get my binoculars and was amazed to discover a lanceolate shape cutting across the &apos;cloud&apos;.  Satelites were cutting through the binocular field of view and it seemed to be about the same elevation. My thought was that something had gone very wrong onboard a sattelite, but it kept moving to the north. Over the next 60 minutes it continued on a northern trajectory until it passed through Cassiopeia, by which time the circular cloud was long gone and the lanceolate shape of its contrail was becoming quite diffuse.The fact that it took an hour to travel that &apos;small&apos; distance makes me wonder what the heck I was looking at!", "The four of us saw a orange light that shifted around the moon.It was a bright object, hovering close to the moon. It stayed in a close proximity, swaying back and forth. It was an orange glowing light. The four of us watched it from 11:07 to 12:07, which is the current time.", "Flying saucer like object with  several yellow lights/blinking red light seen near Braintree,  VTMy friend was out on the deck and saw a bright whitish object streak from s to n, (not a shooting star!) He called me to come out and then he went in.  I watched for a few minutes and all of a sudden out of the blue appeared a flying object over my pole barn; it is hard to say how high it really was. It flew slowly across in front of me; maybe a half mile away.  I ran to the door and called my friend to come out now!  He too saw the object.  It had yellowish lights in a inverted v pattern. Below the middle light there was a blinking red light. It slowly flew toward the ridge in front of my property and then vanished.  I did not hear any sound from the object; it was a calm night.  My friend verified what i saw: several yellow lights/a blinking red light/no sound/and its sudden disappearance.((NUFORC Note:  Hoax??  One of three reports from same source.

I replied that I did not see it, but she was very insistent that she had seen it and I just chuckled and turned on to the on ramp and proceeded towards Mesquite Nevada. When I noticed to my right a ball of light that caught my attention and I told my wife to look. We immeadiately seen it again and it became very bright and then dimmed out.  I pulled the truck over to the right and turned on my emergency light and we sat there and watched.  Sure enough we seen it again and to our astonishment we seen atleast 5 to 6 more light up one at a time in rapid succesion from right to left, one after the other. We were very excited and sat for about ten more minutes trying to see them again but did not. I am reporting this in hopes someone else seen them. I have never seen anything like it before and I hope to see something like that again.

I thought at first it was a helicopter search light, but then there was no sound and it was very quiet and moving too fast to be searching for anything.  It moved like a shooting star, but starting out slow and then accelerating away so fast I didn&apos;t see where it ended up, the light vanished.  I couldn&apos;t see or hear anything and my surroundings where quiet.  It wasn&rsquo;t a plane because it was too low and there were no taillights.  It wasn&rsquo;t a shoot star because again it was too big and there are never shooting stars in England.", "Town and Country Shopping Center, dic shaped craft at about 20feet above the ground...around 4:30PM on a Sunday.For two weeks prior to the sighting, I had experienced telepathic communication with these beings.  I was waiting for the time of their arrival.  I spoke to no one of this at the time, and have only shared my experience witha few extremely close friends since the encounter. I knew I would be called to the site telepathicly when they would arrive in my area.  It wsa Sunday afternoon around 4PM, when I felt drawn to Stevens Creek Blvd.  I  entered Town and Country Shopping Center&apos;s parking lot a &quot;back way&quot; and when I pulled in, there was a group of people standing under the craft, which hovered about 20 feet in the air--- just above the rooftop.  It was close to a Tobacco store.  The man who worked in the store was one of hte witnesses.  I walked closer to the group, and had made the decision NOT to go with the beings prior to this physical encounter. After standing with the  group[ for a ew more minutes---looking up to the bottom of the  craft, the craft raised upward without movement of air, or sound --no heat was felt---nothing.  It increased speed rapidly, and then dissapeared in an instant.  We all looked at each other, and dispersed in silence.  The experience was profound, and even more so because we had witnessed it together. I have been looking in various places to see if any of the other witnesses have reported it, but I have not seen evidence of the sighting.  It affected me so  intensly, Ihad to report it--even though  it occurred all these years ago. No one was abducted to my knowledge.  My comunication with them was indicative of a volulnteer scenario, and I was not willing to participate, but have the connection with them telepathicly.  I had a spiritually uplifitng sense, and was not frightened by the beings in the craft.  I never made visual contact.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Suddenly, I caught sight of an egg shaped object coming at a very fast rate of speed through a grove of pine trees and towards the lake from my left/the south.  It was zigzagging between the trees about 20&rsquo; off of the ground.  It was luminous white in color and at least 4&rsquo; in diameter.    It came to an abrupt stop at about 10&rsquo; above the surface of the lake and only about 30 yards from where I was sitting.  It hovered there for about 3 minutes, I called my son-in-law and it sped away from the same direction from whence it had come with the same zigzag movements between the trees.  He pulled up a chair beside mine and we began to discuss what I&rsquo;d witnessed.  Then from the same direction off to my left/south; five objects identical in appearance to the first that I&rsquo;d seen, came zigzagging through the pines, one after the other.  They came to a halt and hovered in a horizontal line about 40 yards from us at a height about 20&rsquo; above the surface of the lake.  We sat there watching them for at least 10 minutes.  They stayed in the same formation the entire time and then abruptly departed back toward the pines, but this time in a climbing mode above the pines.

My house is on the lake and I have a clear view to the east.  My wife was awake and when I pointed out the light, she said it was probably a planet.  My binoculars are always by the large window and thru them I could see not one light, but a row of lights (5), with the brightest in the middle.  She came and looked and saw exctly what I saw.  The lights were stationary and over the next two hours, moved very slowly up and to the south. This had to be a very large object, because we could see the space between the lights. The sides of the object had a cone of light going out on both sides, so I believe the lights when around the object.", "UFO sighting in Ojai, CA in 1948This is a historical UFO sighting report.  I am writing this down for my mother, who is now elderly.  She is a native of Ojai, California.  In 1948, she was working in the Ojai Valley as a waitress.  Her sister was also working at the same place.  On a summer evening in July, she and my aunt left work after 10 pm.  They drove in their car to a small hill looking in the direction of Los Angeles, towards southeast. They parked the car and looked out at the bright stars and clear sky.  Suddenly, they saw all of these peculiar little white lights, more than a dozen of them, hovering and darting around in the sky.  They couldn&rsquo;t distinguish whether they were small and close, or large and far away.  They watched them for about 15 minutes.  They darted around in every direction, so fast they could barely tell whether it was up or down or which direction.  Then they disappeared, quite suddenly, as if they just blinked out. Three or four days later, mom returned to the same spot, with another friend, and they both observed the lights again, spinning and darting around above the Black Mountain area.  It was still very difficult to tell distance or size.  They appeared to be round, similar in brightness to the stars.  Mom says if they hadn&rsquo;t moved, they would have thought they were stars.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The sky was clear.  Suddenly, a bright green orb with a short white tail flashed across the sky right under the moon.  It was much larger than surrounding stars and visible planets and was much larger than comets I have seen. It was visible for only a second and then vanished without even leaving a trail.  I have witnessed airplanes and meteor showers, but this object was very large, it appeared to be about a tenth of the size of the moon, and did not continue in a straight path for as long as a falling star or airplane would. My sister, who was sitting in the passenger seat at the time, also saw the object.  There were no nearby cars whose headlights could have been mistaken for reflecting the appearance of such an apparition.", "Flying saucer outside of Orlando, Florida summer of 1977I was nine yrs old and on a family vacation outside of Orlando, Fl heading for Disneyworld. It was dark and we were on a highway when my mother asked my father if he saw the thing in the sky. It was definetly a saucer shape. We pulled over by the side of the road. It was hovering next to a big builiding many stories high. It had colored lights on the bottom of it going around the craft. The craft was larger than the circumference of the building. There was a small plane flying around it. The craft made no noise. We had a CB radio in the car and each time it got close to the car the CB radio would get full of static. We watched it for 15 minutes or so and continued to drive.

But, I still go with the story, because coming up with a lie is not my thing. Well, this is how it happened, I went to the back of the house because I wanted to play with my little puppies, when I just looked in the sky and started wondering about that day when I saw the UFO. Well, I don&rsquo;t know how I knew they were there because I saw what looked like a dot!! At first I was like it&rsquo;s got to be a plane but it stayed still, then it stared moving south, very slow, it seemed very high up! And the acqward thing was that airplanes were passing right at the bottom of it! That&rsquo;s when I started thinking that it&rsquo;s got to be a balloon or a bag! And at that moment I called my sisters and my brother because this time I wanted witnesses! They came out side and asked me what&rsquo;s wrong I said you wont believe it remember what I saw on April Fools it there again! They started searching for it and I told them were it is! Then my sister Virginia saw it and she said, &ldquo;What is that&rdquo; I told her you see it? She said yes. Well a couple of minutes later my other sister saw it and my little brother! I was so happy that I had witnesses but that&rsquo;s when another one appeared. I told them oh my god there&rsquo;s another one!!! When I saw the other one I got so scared! Because I started thinking maybe we see them. Well the strangest thing was that the were moving at a very slow speed, at first one would be ahead then the other. But then they&rsquo;d go back and it was just so strange. A couple of minutes past when one of them just took off and headed south and disappeared, but the other on were still there! Just moving slowly.Oh yes and another thing that really creped me out was that one of the object was showing a red light at times and the other one flickered a blue light! That was the weirdest part, it actually creped out my little brother, because how could! it show the light in the middle of the day!!! Well, the saddest part is I didn&rsquo;t have binoculars to get a better look, especially a camera! But the next time I will be ready, because I really want to know exactly what they look like because it was so high up that I couldn&rsquo;t take a good look at it! It just looked like a dot, but you could still see it so it means it was probably large.

It was at least half way through the show so it must have been about 8:15-8:30.  I can&apos;t remember why but for some reason I glanced over toward one of the main stages to the west of where I was.  I saw it about 20 degrees over the horizon and about 30 degrees to the north of the sliver of the moon.  I saw a flashing light and a steady dimmer light.  At first I thought was a helicopter since a police helicopter had flown over the festival several time that night.  If it was a helicopter I would guess it at about 3 or 4 miles away based on the separation and brightness of the lights.  Then it did something that freaked me out.  Suddenly a huge triangular pattern of big bright green lights began flashing very rapidly.  No two lights seemed to flash in sync, it was just wild random flashing of too many lights to count.  The lights were all on the parameter of the triangle pattern with none in the middle.  The weird thing was that if it was a helicopter putting on a light show, then the lighting attachments would have to have been at least the size of a football field or two.  Compared to the distant object I thought I&apos;d seen a second before the triangle light display was enormous.  The light display continued for about 10 seconds as I stared in disbelief trying to figure out what the heck it was.  Just as I started to get the attention of my friend the light show stopped.  I was left explaining to him that the tiny flashing light that he couldn&apos;t hardly make out from the other distant aircraft in the sky had just put on a massive light show as if it was right over the festival.  It continued to fade into the distance until I couldn&apos;t make it out any more.  I&apos;m ready to accept that this was a human aircraft putting on a lighting display.

Out the front window I noticed from the back seat a very bright light just to the left side of the road about 1 mile ahead of us.  I said to my wife as she was driving, &quot;What is that bright light out of your window at your 11:00 O&rsquo;clock position?&quot;  She said that she did not know.  My mother was sitting in the front passenger&rsquo;s seat.  She said that she did not know either, but that there was another light just like it ahead on the right about 2 miles.  Because I was sitting in the back right hand side I did not notice that one at first because I could not see through my mother&rsquo;s head.  I repositioned myself and looked out the front to the right and noticed that object as well. My son was sitting next to me in the back seat and saw the two objects also.The objects were very bright and sparkled like the finest diamond with a thousand bursts of colorful flares inside them.  The closer we got to the one on the left hand side of the car, the further down I had to get my head to the floor so that I could see it.  After a few moments I could not see it anymore and so I asked my son if he could see it out of his side window.  He said it was gone. I asked my wife where the bright light on her side of the van was.  She also said it was gone.  There was quite a bit of traffic on the road moving with us and coming toward us, so she was mostly paying attention to the road, like a good driver.  My mother said that the light on the right side 2 miles ahead was moving away from us.  I stooped down and looked at it as it slowly disappeared to the east.I kept looking into the sky on the rest of our journey home, which took about 25 more minutes after that, hoping to get another look at what I had just seen.  I saw many lights; they were all just small planes having the small red flashing light on them, dim compared to the two we had just witnessed.  It was a full moon, partly cloudy, crystal clear stars above, snow on the ground (which reflected a lot of moonlight around to make it seem no so dark that night), and it was about 20 degrees F.", "Orbs with auras moving north and a triangle shaped object moving over 30 + foot trees.My sister, nephew, and I witnessed multiple orbs with a green aura around the largest one. The aura appeared to be the wash from the rotors of silent helicopters flying north over Deer Isle at an elevation of 10 miles up or more.  We started to view thru a telescope, but quickly realized it was easily seen with the naked eye.  The orb and wash effect moved in various directions only to return to the initiation point. After watching for some 45 minutes a large triangle shaped object passed over our home moving west to east. It was silent as it floated over the 30 + foot trees that ring our summer home.

You couldn&rsquo;t see any space in between the lights at all.  It didn&rsquo;t garner my attention initially since the final approach corridor for San Jose International Airport is over that general area.  But then I started to realize that it was much brighter than aircraft lights and didn&rsquo;t have anti-collision lights, something that I can normally see on planes all the way to San Jose.  As I grew more curious, I realized it was not moving and seemed to be pretty low in the sky.  Ok, a helicopter, I thought.  However, there is a municipal airport about 3 miles away from me and I am familiar with all sorts of helicopters as that is where they normally stage aircraft for fighting the big wildfires up in the hills from me.  Ok, so what is it?  I&rsquo;m officially very curious at this point and do a line-of-sight to see if it is just moving very slowly.  Nope.  Not moving.  The lights were what had my attention, as I&rsquo;m watching I&rsquo;m seeing white lights, a large red one in the center, and occasionally the flickering green or blue.  They were twinkling like starlight, but they were much larger than stars, lower in the sky than stars (fog was coming in over the hills) and so much brighter!  So now I&rsquo;m thinking they must be having some sort of light show on El Toro Mountain, the large cone-shaped hill that most people think Morgan Hill got its name.  But that explanation didn&rsquo;t sit well with me, it was truly very, very bright lights.  Then, as I&rsquo;m watching, the series of lights cut in half, like someone had put up a card in my viewing and cut off the lower half of the object.  So now I&rsquo;m telling myself, yes, it is a show on El Toro and they&rsquo;re making their way to the other side of the hill, where I can no longer see them.  However, at that point, the lights dimmed greatly and it zipped off at a high rate of speed to the north.  Being familiar with the landing approaches of! aircraf t to San Jose, it was not on the flight path and the lights now were far dimmer than normal aircraft and there was still no anti-collision lights.  It was also much faster than any aircraft I&rsquo;ve seen go down the corridor.  I&rsquo;ve been pouring over the internet and newspapers this morning to see if anyone else reported something odd in the sky, because I am certainly curious to know what it was.  I couldn&rsquo;t have been the only person admiring the night sky last night, and the object seemed to be over Morgan Hill and within sight of the 101 highway.

I and my son watched as it continued for what seemed like an extremely long time, which made me realize just how huge it was by how long it apperaed in my view between the mts. miles away.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was coming back home and noticed a bright orange star to the northeast. It was far away with other stars but I thought it curious and I wondered if there ere any other orange stars in the sky. I panned from the orange star in the sky to the left looking down my street. To my absolute astonishment there was a glowing orange ball approximately 100 yards above my neighbor&rsquo;s home just sitting there idle. I thought to myself &quot;there is no way I&apos;m seeing this so I rubbed my eyes and did a double take but the object was still there. It was a glowing bright orange ball just hovering over our neighborhood. When I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t a figment of my imagination I started running down the street dragging my dogs behind me. I have 2 bull dogs and one of them is older and doesn&rsquo;t run very fast. After trying to drag her I finally just threw her leash away and left her in the street while I ran home. My father and daughter were both home and I yelled in the house &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going to believe this but there is a UFO outside.&rdquo; Both of them came into the back yard and witnessed it. While I was running home it moved slowly from above my neighbor&rsquo;s house across the street to the east over our back yards.  We sat there looking at it in awe. It looked kind of like a party balloon as it was circular, but it was glowing orange. So bright in fact that you could see the light from it emanating off the neighboring rooftops. After it hovered over out back yard for about 5 minutes it then started moving south. I new I had to tell more people so I ran over to my neighbors, knocked on their door, the wife answered and I told her she had to come out side and see this UFO. It was starting to get further away moving slowly thought the sky but we both sat there and watched it move southward stopping periodically and hovering for 5 or 10 minutes and then continuing on to the south. This happened in Oceanside California near the intersection of Lake and Ridge. What was reall! y amazin g is that it just hovered over my neighbor&rsquo;s house and then moved eastward. Stopped, hovered again and then moved southward stopping periodically and just hovering. There was no wind out and the light was so bright that it could not have been a balloon with a light inside or on fire because it was visible from at least a mile as it continued southward down Melrose Ave towards the city of Carlsbad. We did get 2 pictures of it and there has to be more people that saw it. It was not necessarily a craft but it was able to maneuver and shone so bright that as it passed the neighboring homes the rooftops glowed orange.", "Lights in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico.I was in the house of one of my aunts ((name deleted)). We were on a family reunion celebrating the nearing Christmas Day. I was sitting in the balcony of the house looking at the sky when a flashing white light appeared. It looked like the strobe of a plane but it had a very dinstinctive motion. Everytime the light flashed the object would appear to be static but in the next flash the object would have moved to a new location in it&apos;s path of travel (like forming a dotted line). When the strobes of a plane flash the motion of the plane is visible on the flash, this was not the case. Also there were no other lights in the object like a plane has. The light object was moving east to west on the south side of the sky. I told my uncle &quot;DS&quot; to look at the light and I told him that it didn&apos;t looked like a normal aircraft because of the strange motion. He replied jokingly that it may be an ufo and we both laughed at the idea. I told him also that I was seeing that same aircraft every night for almost a month travelling on the same course and that it would return back a few minutes later after it dissapears. About 10 minutes later it dissapeared in the western side of the sky. Like I told &quot;DS&quot; 5 minutes after dissapearing it appeared again, this time traveling west to east from it&apos;s last position. &quot;DS&quot; told me that it was really strange that the aircraft was turning back again, then he told me that maybe it was a patrol aircraft guarding the coast for drug boats. Another uncle &quot;DP&quot; told us that maybe it could be a police helicopter patrolling the area, this was possible because there was a narcotics police department in our neighborhood and it had a helicopter landing pad and landings were frequent. But usually the helicopter would have it&apos;s searchlifht on when it was on the area and there was no sign of a searchlight. Again the light object dissapeared, but this time in the eastern sky. Then around ten minutes later, 2 identical lights apeared on the eastern sky traveling on the same course to the west side by side, this time all the people in the balcony was curious about what were those lights. Again the lights dissapeared on the wertern sky. Then about 15 to 20 minutes later both lights reappeared on the western sky going to the east, but this time a third light appeared almost at the same time from the east going west in the same course. When the three lights were next to each other, one of the lights going to the east changed direction and joined the light that was going to the west, the other light remained on it&apos;s east course. After a minute or so suddenly a big light apeared west near the two western going lights, it was like the apparent size of a marble but it&apos;s distance was more than a mile away this light was static unlike the others and wasn&apos;t flashing, it also had a yellow glow instead of the white glow of the little lights, it made a sound I&apos;ve never heard before, the most close relation would be like a metallic cracking sound mixed with  an electric sound. the light remained in the same position in the sky for about half a minute or so. The two small lights moved towards it and dissapeared inside the big light, then the big light dissapeared in the same position. There were 9 people sitting in the balcony watching the event, and everyone was terrified after the big light appeared. There was total silence for almost a minute, and nobody was able to talk because of the shock. My aunt &quot;MI&quot; almost fainted because of the shock. Notes: During one of the times I watched the lights before that day, there was also a plane in the sky. The movement behavior of the light was totally different from the plane, also the &quot;strobe&quot; flashing timing was totally different from the aircraft, the flash duration was longer than in the aircraft and the flash timing was slower than that on the aircraft. Also the aircraft course was different being from the northeast to the soutwest.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I used tree branches as references to measure if it was moving or not, and several times it moved accross the branch and i&apos;d have to move where i was sitting.  The movements were completely sporatic, jerky, and there were longish periods of time where it would stay in the same spot.It seems to me that this &quot;jerkily moving flashing star-looking ufo&quot;  was trying to blend in with the stars, but after watching it for over an hour, it WITH OUT A DOUBT moved several hundreds of miles in the sky (although it only looked like 5 inches of the sky) i also saw what looked to be like an extremely fast red-beam that shot from the object, this only happend once, but i could not stay up all night watching it....it&apos;s still over gwinnet county right now((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??

From my view I saw 3 lights on each side of the fronts underside and a bright glow from the rear. There looked to be a clear glass area on the bottom as well as a lit cockpit area..reminded me of a helicopter.

I was staying at my grandfather&apos;s farm, where I now reside, and playing outside in the late afternoon probably July or August when my step-aunt drove home for the evening from Fargo.  She was excited about something she&apos;d been watching on the drive out and had my grandfather, her mother, herself and I get into my grandfather&apos;s car and drive toward the object she&apos;d been watching.  The object had been hovering over the WDAY tower directly east of the town of Amenia, ND since she had spied it on her drive home or longer.  We drove southwest toward it from the farm and then straight west toward it on the Amenia Township road.   I recall that the object was the same vibrant orange color as the low summer sun, as if it were reflecting or glowing that color.  As the four of us drove closer I noticed other vehicles driving toward the sight also.  We must have been a mile or so from the WDAY tower when it suddenly began to move off in a zig-zag pattern and then shot off to the southeast at a higher altitude and incredible speed and immediately disappeared from sight.I can&apos;t imagine now why we didn&apos;t speak to any of the other people that came to look at this UFO but I would love to find anyone else that saw this spectactle.Years later,(1986??) my grandfather came over to my parent&apos;s house one morning as he often did when I still lived there and had another odd story to tell.  He and his wife had decided to sleep in a different room upstairs that they hoped would be a little cooler.  It is the only room upstairs that has west facing windows.  During the night they were awoke to find all the lights on in the house, however when they tried the switches they found they were already off- the light was coming from an outside source.  Grandpa got the shotgun, although he said later he didn&apos;t know what he would have shot.  I can&apos;t remember how long he said that incident lasted but he had no explanation for it.  It  came and went.Recently, in November of 2006 I was out late at night looking for my Siamese  and checking her usual spots.  One of her favorites is by the far north shelterbelt of the yard, behind some of the outbuildings. I circled around the quonset on this night as I often do when trying to find her, and as I started to return toward the house, I &quot;felt&quot; a large flying object glide over the quonset and cross the yard.  The sound was similar to an airplane gliding, power off.  I even ducked.  I could sense it go over me, but there was nothing I could visibly see.  I am familiar with hawks and owls in my yard and this was nothing like that.  I fly airplanes and this is where I come up with the similarity to an airplane gliding, but there was definitely a feeling of this thing going over, as if the air pressure had changed between me and the object.  I often watch airplanes flying over and I know how you can see them long before you hear them at night or even see their flashing strobes or wing tip lights.  This was entirely different.  It was at the altitude of the trees surrounding the yard and stealthy and invisible.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Too fast and abrupt to be a helicopter or aircraft.It continued south for two or three seconds and then started to fade and disappear. Did not get a chance to observe it with binoculars.Within seconds after the light faded away, an aircraft (identified by flashing red and blue lights and noise) appeared above the tree line due south and passed directly along the same path as the object but heading north. There was no bright white present as with the unidentified object.I was in a hurry to meet my wife and couldn&rsquo;t stay around to check further. I thought the aircraft I observed heading north may have seen the UFO and perhaps was pursuing it???

At first I thought it was a star or satellite but it seemed oddly low and much too bright in an overcast sky. The few stars I could detect were extremely faint in comparison.  I was transfixed by the object which dominated the sky and appeared to be triangular in shape and stood watching it for about 15 minutes. Finally, a neighbor was leaving for work and she also agreed it was an unfamiliar object. I called the FBI but I think they dismissed me as a crackpot. The weird thing is that about 11 hours later a manhole cover exploded on my street and we lost power for a little while. It&apos;s just one of those eerie feelings you sense when something is out of context in the world as we know it.", "2 bright reddish orange lights, moving up and away into the atmosphereI live by the ocean and was coming up the back stairs and while looking at the stars I saw two lights.  On clear nights I can see the lights on the jets coming down from L.A. and at first I assumed that&apos;s what I was looking at but immediately it became apparent something else was occurring.  The lights were reddish orange, very bright, unblinking, at a tremendous height and were going up as well as northerly to southerly.  They were spaced a fair distance from each other and the leading one was higher than the other for it disappeared, fading away as it went up before the other did.  There was no noise, no blinking or strobing, and no flickering to speak of.  I look at the stars and planes and helicpters at night all the time.  I&apos;ve seen satellites and comets.  I have no idea what they were but by definition they were UFO&apos;s.

As i kept driving along, the lights became very bright and were blinking and the object seemed to take up one whole quadrant of the sky. Upon reaching my work , i watched the object from the parking lot. The best explanation i can give is that it looked like a costellation was moving in an easterly direction while flashing its lights all the time. I thought it could be a formation of at least a dozen or more planes or helicopters, but there was no sound, the lights were too bright and it moved to uniformly. there is a national guard air base nearby but i have lived here for 35 years and never seen anythig like this.

Facing south it flew past at about 45 degrees up from the horizon from left to right across my gaze (from east to west). No sound what-so-ever (due to the apparent distance it resembled a firefly or some type of flying animal with a light emitting from it). But being out just under a mile it must have been large and very fast - faster than any jet or rocket. It had but one light that I could describe--going by so quickly there was an apparent light trace (faded fast behind it) bright amber in color.

I was watching a western on tv on 1/19/08. In one scene, an appearant ufo darts into the scene just behind the actors head, at approx. the 11 o&apos;clock position, moving from right to left, stops for a brief moment, and then darts back to the left again, behind the actor&apos;s head. It was in the shape of the typical disk type ufo, and was white in color. It is in the scene for about 2 or 3 seconds and then is gone. The movie is Rio Grande with John Wayne and Maureen O&apos;Hara, and the scene mentioned is the one when he is handing her a Confederate $10 bill.Now I don&apos;t believe I imagined it, of course, and I don&apos;t know if it was just a...well, who knows what!

Friday the 18th I was driving home from skiing and was about a mile from my house when I spotted a white light in the sky.  I followed it for a few minutes and then headed home.  When I arrived home I noticed the light was exactly like a spotlight, but there was no beam coming from the ground, and this light was going in a perfect circle.  After arriving home, I called my dad out to take a look and he was bewildered as well.  It was a bright white light in the sky moving in a perfect circular motion moving towards us.  I might add we live a few miles away from Willow Grove Air Base, but this was not in that direction.  You could also not see the beam, which is very peculair because on such a cloudy night it would have been visible.  It was as if this light was coming from above the clouds shining down.  It lasted for about 20 minutes that I saw and then disappeared a little after midnight.  I kept looking until about 1:00 AM to see if it came back and it never did.  I really don&apos;t know what to make of it.", "A round aircraft with many lights went over our house and seem to vanish after crossing the river.On Monday evening, February 4, 2008 (about 9:00 PM) my 3 children, ages 14, 12, and 9 witnessed a round aircraft go directly over our house. It has many lights on it, And they could clearly see that it was large and circular. It had a strange smelling exhaust-which my husband and I could smell after the craft wasn&rsquo;t in sight.None of the witnesses had ever seen anything like this before.Afterward, I told someone where I work, and she saw it as well-on the same night and described it as round as well.", "Very much like an ordinary star, except that it moved quickly and erratically in the vicinity of a stationary &quot;star&quot;I would like to say that I am 56 years of age, a USAF veteran, and a trained observer, being employed as an inspector for many years. I am very able to observe and report in extreme detail an accurate account of my observeration(s). I currently am still blessed with 20/20 vision in both eyes, but do need a 1.25 diopter lens set to read clearly. When I observed this UFO, I was not under the influence of any vision altering drug, as I am sure Zegerid does not alter my vision and have not observed any problem whatsoever with my &apos;distant&apos; vision. It was moderately snowing, and I was actually in Escadillia Bonita Acres, (spelling) in New Mexico, USA which is just East of the Arizona/New Mexico border and is located in New Mexico. It was dark, and getting colder when I went out to my truck to get my coffee mug. As I turned to return to the trailer where we were staying at night during our elk hunt, I glanced towards where we had Dad&apos;s elk hanging in a tree nearby. As I did, a light in the sky caught my eye. As I looked directly at it, I thought it to be nothing more than a clearing in the coulds, where a star was &quot;shining&quot; through. I thought that this was strange, due to the steady snowfall, but no &quot;big deal&quot;. As I started to turn away, a movement in this &quot;star&quot; made me look again. I was amazed to see this &quot;star&quot; begin to move erratically at a rapid pace, looking very much like someone moving a laser pen light around on a darkened wall, except it was not red, it was white, much like a star. This light was due East towards Springerville, Arizona, USA, and at an approximate 40 degree rise from the surface of the earth. The thought immediately occured to me that I must be &quot;wobbling&quot; and I quickly leaned against the truck to stabilize my body and head and noted that there was another &quot;star&quot; just to the left of the one that was moving erratically, only this &quot;star&quot; was completely immobile. As soon as I realized that this observation was totally out of the ordinary, I yelled quite loudly &quot;Dad, get out here, there is a UFO out here!&quot; He came out immediately, and looked at it as I pointed at it. It was stationary from that point on, and slowly faded away as if the clouds obscured it. The other &quot;star&quot; remained visable, and we watched for a few minutes as it too faded from view, which I attribute to the clouds and snow. In our observation, I was the only one to! see the quick and erratic motion of this light/star like object in the sky. I am quite familiar with aircraft, and this was completely quiet and moved way to fast and strangely for me to think that it was ours unless we have some craft that is not a part of the general public knowlege. It was quite cold, and snowing, so we retired to the warmth of the trailer.", "UFO burns through atmosphere, crashes to the earth and a salvage UFO cleans up the wreckage.I was driving from North Carolina to Indiana to visit my girlfriend.  It was around 3:00 AM in the early summer of 1996 (to my best recollection).  I was driving north on a one lane country highway near the Indiana/Ohio border.  I am not sure of the city or county I was in, having been on the road for 7 hours or so.  At first, I saw what I thought to be the biggest &quot;shooting star&quot; ever witnessed.  If you were to put a drawing of it on my windshield for perspective purposes, it would have been about 3 inches wide and the tail would have been about 3 feet long (almost the entire width of the windshield).  I could see what appeared to be molten metal flying off of this streaking ball of flame as it fell through the atmosphere for several seconds.  I semi-expected to hear or feel a great thud as it hit the earth.  At that time I was just amazed at the size and duration of this &quot;shooting star.&quot;  About 10 minutes later, a very large &quot;hershey kiss&quot; shaped brilliant orange, yellow and red light appeared to my 10 o&apos;clock position.  The light and colors merged and moved together like a fire.  I would guess it to be within 1 mile of my location.  There was a field on my left with a forrest behind it.  The object was just above the tree line by 30-50 feet.  I estimate that the object was about 300 yards wide by 200 yards high.  Of course, not knowing exactly how far away it was, I can not be certain.  I drove for a few minutes further until the object was at my 9 o&apos;clock position.  I knew at that time I was watching a UFO.  I pulled over and told myself, &quot;I am not taking my eye off this thing until it zig-zags into the atmosphere.&quot;  After watching it, motionless, for 10-15 minutes in amazement, it appeared that someone just pulled a curtain in front of it from left to right. I continued my drive with a renewed energy and arrived in Wabash, IN at my girlfriends house around 5:00 AM.  I went to sleep for a few hours and met with the family at the breakfast table.  At first it seemed I had forgotten the entire event.  Then, all of a sudden it hit me and I blurted out, &quot;Oh my God!  You&apos;ll never believe what I saw last night!&quot;  After telling them what I had witnessed, her father set down the local paper and showed me the headline: &quot;Over 300 UFO Sightings in Indiana/Ohio.&quot;  Not that I needed that as confirmation, but it could be helpful in putting an exact date on the event if needed. My best guess as to what I had seen would be that an extra-terrestrial space craft had crashed to the earth (&quot;shooting star&quot;) and a salvage was taking place.  The actual shape of the salvage craft is most accuratley described as: if you took your thumb and index finger of both hands, made right angles with them then connected your thumbs together and your index fingers together.  It makes a point at the top and the bottom with rounded corners on the side. I was just made aware of the National UFO Reporting Center tonight while watching a TV special hosted by Peter Jennings, or I would have submitted this years ago.  I am certain that what I saw was not made on this planet.  It looked like a perfect campfire in the sky.  I hope that this report might help piece together what actually happened that night.  Maybe someone else saw what I saw from another angle.  I would also like to figure out what the exact date was.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

While playing we noticed low flying Air Force planes in the area. Since my brother was in the Air Force I could tell by the markings on the wings, and that&apos;s truely how low they were flying. A few minutes later one of my friends and I walked a block down the street to my house. As we were hanging at the end of my driveway we watched several bright lights coming toward us from the sky heading from the Watchung Mountains. It appeared that the Jets were passing by again. As they got closer and over head we realized they had surrounded a large round saucer like craft. The only way I can describe it is as a big metalic waffle iron. The bottom was glowing orange with blue sparks or flashes here and there. We both just stood there amazed and speechless.  If the craft made any noise we could not hear it over the planes. All the craft passed over us and flew off above the tree line and out of site. I have tried to find others who may have seen this but have had no luck until now.  If the other Piscataway NJ sighter reads this, you are not alone, I saw it too and so did the airforce.", "Object not seen by the naked eye, but captured by digital camera.This picture was taken by my parents last week (Jan. 21st) about 20 minutes outside of Phoenix, AZ, past Apache Junction.

As I got to the far side of the bridge and could note the traffic light, I noted that it was green.  Then I immediately noted another green light/ flash of light beyond and above the traffic light in the far distance.  This light appeared to burn green and streaked downward toward the horizon in a fast streak, changing to yellow as it fell.  This was much more vivid in color than any other meteor/shooting star that I have ever seen, but it did follow the same trajectory.  It was just much lower to the ground than anything that I have ever witnessed, and it was bright enough to be seen against other bright lights from the businesses at the interstate exchange including a convenience store, a closed heavy equipment company with many outside lights and one smaller convenience store as well as headlights from oncoming cars (I think two were coming at the time).  The whole incident could not have lasted more than 1 to 1 &frac12; seconds, but it was vivid enough that I fully expected to hear a boom.  Upon contemplating, however, it was probably very far away.  It was abnormal enough that after getting the kids in the bed, I tried to find out if there were any expected meteor showers or if there was a known plane crash or satellite failure.  I could find no evidence of anything like this on the web or new sites.  I have never reported anything like this before, but I have also never seen anything quite like this before either.  I mainly wanted to post this in case there were any other similar reports.  A reply would be nice if anyone has seen anything similar in the central Georgia sky at about the same time.", "Disk shaped pinkish purple object high in the sky made no sound seen through camera screen. Photographed.After having completed installing our church flag pole I did a trial run of raising the two flags into place.  I knelt down to take a digital photo of this flag installation. I noticed a pinkish purple colored disk shaped object in the LCD view finder screen but after taking the shot did not see it in the sky as it was close to the bright sun and there was no noise at all.

It tumbled approx. two to three hundred feet. It stopped then  took off horizontally to the right. I watched it fly in and out of the clouds until I lost it.

It is white, but looks solid and not quite flat with lights in the front. Another picture is taken that shows it flying horizontally, no fixed wing or jet engine that I can see, at this point it looked flat. Other pictures are when it is too high to see any detail and these pictures were taken before I even noticed it tumbling.  It was only upon enlarging  these photos did I see it above the rainbow. Later in the evening , when it was dark, I was walking home from my parents place next door and saw six or seven lights high in the sky. No formation but  all seemed to be flying the same speed. They were not like the airliners or private planes with blinking/strobe lights. The San Jose Airport path is almost directly over head so I am very familiar with their landing prep.

Upon walking outside I looked up at the sky because I heard a jet.  When I looked up I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing.  There was indeed a jet at a rather high altitude, but it was flying by a very low flying black, triangular craft.  The jet was clearly audible, but the triangle made no sound, and flew way too slow for it to be a commercial jet or anything of the sort. It had a strange array of lights, that outlined the triangular shape, three big lights, two white, one red (the red was in the front).  There were more lights, dim and seemed to pulse that outlined the sides of it that confirmed to me, that it was indeed a solid triangle.  The lights also didn&apos;t seem to illuminate it, which was rather eerie. The jet soon passed it, and there was not a sound to be heard. It at very first seemed to be heading in the direction of the airport, but after moving my car, I noticed it wasn&apos;t heading in any direction in particular.  Rather, it moved in one direction, then seemed to slowly turn, and head in the opposite direction it was originally going. Note, the entire time this happened it had moved so slow, seriously could not believe it was there, I have seen low flying planes before, and this was no way that, I live near an airport, so it&apos;s a common thing for me to see.  I tried to get my friends attention to observe it, but he was in a rush, so only I saw it.

He checked and said that there was now 7 dots in the formation.  I kept following them through the scope.  We kept looking at them and noticed they were metallic.  Every now and then their glare would blind us through the scope.  For some reason, they kept going in a circular path.  We kept passing the gun to each other, then I noticed that there was 6 left.

I told him it was plane, obviously.  He said &ldquo;Not the plane, where did it go?&rdquo;, then exclaimed and pointed &ldquo;That!&rdquo; I leaned forward in the truck to look up into the sky thru the windshield and  at the upper left side I saw a metallic disc shaped object which was brightly reflecting the sun. It was tilted at an angle toward us and didn&rsquo;t seem to be moving at all but staying in one place while it tilted at those various degrees. We couldn&rsquo;t tell if it made any sound or not because our windows were rolled up.

When we got to an area and pulled over it was gone and no where to be seen anywhere in the sky. We stayed there for a while looking for it and hoping it might come back or maybe still be there and show itself again, but nothing.I asked my husband about it and he said the reflection of the suns rays reflecting off of the shiny silver metal caught his eye and he look up  and saw it. At that time it was completely turned on its side so that he could see it was a perfectly shaped round disk. It was so close that it was about an inch in size and we could see the grooves where it had a small bump in the middle of it. As my husband was looking at it and asking me what it was, it turned &ldquo;right&rdquo; side up where he lost it for a second then it became &ldquo;visible&rdquo; again (and when I saw it), when it tilted at an angle and the suns rays reflected off of the metallic body again.The only other ufo that I, personally have seen and video taped was when we lived 30 miles out of Kingman, Arizona which was oval shaped and light in color but was pretty far away and was reported on the news that day to be seen all over Arizona (phoenix, flagstaff, Kingman etc) but it was explained as being a weather balloon. Now that one I would accept a lot more easily as possibly being a weather balloon but this ufo we saw yesterday was so CLEAR, DETAILED and in broad DAYLIGHT on a nice sunny day that we both (my husband and I) know it was real and like nothing we both have EVER seen before that could be logically explained.", "Multiple sightings of a perfect circle of light that is replaced by three dimmer lights in an equilateral triangle.The night before my sighting, my sister told me of a peculiar event of her own. About a week before she had seen strange aircrafts about a half hour apart. She described each of the craft as a perfect circle of light that looked like an over-sized star or planet, which was moving strangely around the night sky. When she paid very close attention to it, trying to figure out what it was, the circle of light disappeared, and was replaced by three smaller, dimmer lights, which formed an equilateral  triangle, as if it were trying to look less bright. The three lights then got dimmer and dimmer, until they disappeared altogether.I was a little skeptical. I believed she saw something, but I thought she must have been mistaken, and that it was really just a helicopter. However, early the next morning, I went outside to go to the bus stop, and in the sky were two circles of light slowly moving in random directions. They were definitely not helicopters, or any other kind of aircraft that I&apos;ve ever seen.One of the crafts disappeared while I had my eye on the second one. I stood staring at it for about a minute, and then I remembered that my sister had said that it seemed to retreat only when she really tried to figure out what it was. So I focused all my attention on it. Then, The craft spun to show a different side, which had three dim lights that formed and equilateral triangle. I was so in awe, that i didn&apos;t think to get out my camera, and all I could do was stare at it.The bus arrived, and so my sighting came to an end. I felt like I had been &quot;visited,&quot; as crazy as it may sound, and I felt like it was because my sister tld me about her sighting.

It was about a half a mile away and i first noticed it coming out from behind a tree that was blocking my sight line.  I watched it for about 5 seconds before I said,  &quot;what the hell is that!&quot;.  The four people with me just looked up and watched the &quot;V&quot; shaped craft fly right over our heads.

I was stopped at the stop light just before the bridge at Mountain View and Boniface Parkway. There were other cars at the light also. I noticed a small aircraft flying from east to west. What caught my eye was it looked to be towing something. This is not unheard of for the Anchorage area, but not all that common either. I thought it was towing a large balloon at first. By comparing it to the plane, I&rsquo;d say it looked to be about  eight feet tall. As I was looking at it, it stopped moving and the plane kept going. At first I thought it broke away from the tow rope or whatever, but as the plane flew further away, I could tell the sphere was actually much further away than I first thought. I think it had just happened to be moving at the same rate as the airplane, making it look like it was being towed. It was very near the Chugach  mountain range, which is east of Anchorage. I could tell it was spinning on it&rsquo;s own axis. It was totally featureless. Just a silver orb now hovering in the sky spinning. Then it just disappeared. It is hard to explain, but it looked as though  it disappeared on itself as it turned. It never made a sound, but it was far enough away that I don&rsquo;t think I could have heard it if it did. When I first noticed it, I was looking through my windshield. I thought it might be some kind of reflection off the windshield, so I rolled down my window and stuck my head out, so I&rsquo;m sure it was actually there. After it had disappeared, I looked around me to see if anybody else in the other cars had seen it. No one seemed to have noticed it. It was only visible for about 15 or 20 seconds. I reported this incident shortly after it happened to your web site. It said it had accepted it, but the report never showed on the site. I just chalked it up to a computer error and forgot about it. I&rsquo;ve only told two people about this incident. My wife and my youngest son. They both laughed at me and thought I was seeing things so I dropped it and never talked about it again. But today, 02/29/08, My oldest adult daughter was visiting with me, and somehow the subject of UFOs came up. Well, it turns out she saw the exact same thing in the same general location about two months ago. So I thought maybe it was important enough to resubmit it. I will leave it to her to decide weather to report her sighting or not. This incident really occurred. It was a real object, and it really disappeared before my eyes. I am not an attention seeker. I am a military retiree, an ex cop and currently work in the federal security field, so this kind of publicity I don&rsquo;t need.

We are from a small town in southwest Alabama.  As we travelled down the road we were talking and shooting the breeze like most teenagers would be doing.  I don&apos;t remember which one of us first noticed the object, but, we observed a shinny object streaking across the sky.  We took the time to decide if it was a plane with the sun reflecting off it or not. We came to the quick conclusion that it was simply a cigar shaped object moving at a very rapid pace across the clear blue sky.  We of course, could not determine the speed or size of the object , however it was quickly making its way out of our view.  Stunned at what we saw, we both decided it must have been a jet of some kind flying extremely lower then we antiscipated and fast, until we noticed a fighter jet on the same plane and general area of flight pattern as the first object. It appeared to be chasing or mirroring the objects movements but obviously not moving as fast as the object had been moving.  But it was evident that they were not the same size and the sun was not reflecting off the jet, so the first object must have been different. Whether or not we were witnesses to a ufo or not, it is a memory that will never leave me.  I would like to believe it was.  It has been a thought of mine for all my life, that we would be a very arrogant planet of people to think in all the universe, that we were the smartest or even alone in the vastness of space. Who are we to think God didn&apos;t experiment with many planets with many Adams and Eves.  And if on one of those other planets, Eve didn&apos;t eat the apple, wouldn&apos;t that society of people, all of like thinking without hate, judgement, and malice, all come together thousands of years ago to learn, invent, and explore the universe quicker than the way our society of warlords and human haters have done it?  Wouldn&apos;t and couldn&apos;t they have come a long way further in a shorter period of time than we did because we were greedy and self absorbed in ourselves rather then working together for the common good?  Our world is too busy tending to each others business and building technology to destroy each other, rather than building a united world toward the betterment of mankind. They would be so far more advanced then we will ever make it. I personally believe  all this is very possible.  If we developed in a world of togetherness, just what could we have invented or produced to this point?  Anyone who says we are alone in the universe, is a fool.  As much as anyone who says there is no God is one.  Athiest are the dumbest people around.  Smart wisdom would say that you should believe in God and the afterlife and other life.  After all, the atheist has nothing to live for after they die, but if they are wrong, they will be sorry.  Smart money says take the Christian way , just in case, we are right , and you are wrong.  You have nothing to lose doing it the Chirstian way, because your way just ends either way..  Why take the chance?  The same way of believing in ufo&apos;s.  If we don&apos;t believe as a society, then we lose the wonder of it.  If they do exist, then we have much to learn about how we treat each other.  If they do exist, then hopefully someone will prove it one day, and our world of greedy selfabsorbed people, might, just might, grow the hell up and work together. Enough said....

Each oval turned off and then back on at least three times during the time period we were driving down the street and watching them at the stoplights.

As I walked along I looked again and it not only had moved ahead but had gotten bigger which I began thinking was unusual. Walking along about 100 feet further I looked again and it had moved farther ahead and became much bigger. At this point I was nearing the end of the block and started to watch it continually. It started moving closer and became much bigger. The last time I looked I had crossed to the next block and it was hovering almost directly above me.

It then happened a second time less than a minute later, so I began to run toward where I might have a better vantage point, during which time the phenomenon occurred a third time, then did not reappear for approximately fifteen minutes. By this time I was standing between two fields and I could clearly see the horizon in the direction the objects appeared.Unfortunately, the objects began appearing much farther away, no more than ten degrees above the horizon NNW of my location in Palmyra. The lights would appear as if from a single source, then divide, forming a horizontal line of two to five distinct lights then descending a few degrees and vanishing. They were candle-flame in color, and appeared in this manner at least fourteen times in eight minutes, randomly covering an horizontal area of five or ten degrees.  I was able to take a camera phone picture of thirteen of these incidents. There was a lot of air traffic at the time, and there is a small airport nearby, but these were not planes for obvious reasons. I was thinking perhaps they were come kind of emergency flare, however flares don&apos;t split like that, at least to my knowledge, and I should have seen the lights of the aircraft dropping them if they were flares. Also, as I said, the lights did not emerge from the sky in such a pattern indicating that they were being dropped by an aircraft; they would appear randomly within at most ten degrees of horizon. If they were being dropped, it would have been, in my opinion, a very fast moving aircraft following an erratic flight pattern at exceptionally high speed.

My windows were rolled up, however the military has jets flying over this area very often and if they are low enough to the ground you can hear them with the windows rolled up.  Also, later that day, while traveling with a coworker in his suv truck, I observed a jet flying overhead and noticed how loud it was and how small in comparison it looked to the lights in the sky I observed that morning, and the jet was flying pretty low.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was in the southeastern part of the sky in Orange County California.  It was traveling from east to south, parallel to the horizon.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))", "Strange sighting in Stafford, Va.Opened my front door, and to my surprise, hovering just above the trees I saw something that was very wide, 2 lights in the middle, and one light on each end of the wings. Large lights. NO SOUND AT ALL. I closed the door, and had my daughter come to the door and check to make sure that I wan&apos;t a nut, and she saw the same thing. Very scary. We closed the door and went back to the patio door, just in time to see this object leaving. Very wide, and one large light in the back middle portion of this thing. Still heard no noise. This thing was just above the top of the trees, so it was very close. Was low enough to shine the lights into house.", "I was driving home at night and saw two lighted crafts flying faster than anything normal.It was 20:00 hours and I was driving home from my Mother&apos;s house. I live out away from the city and right before I reached my street I saw a light flying through the night sky and dismissed it as a helicopter since it seemed to have a spotlight. Then I realized that it was flying much too fast to be a helicopter. It flew in a giant loop from parallel to the main street, then made a right turn and flew across to where there is a lit up cross on a hill. At this point another flying object which had three lights and also flew much faster than anything I have ever seen appeared and was following the first craft. They both turned right, finishing the loop, and as far as I could see...disappeared. I don&apos;t know if these were military craft being tested or what, but they definitely were nothing normal to our area. We do have an airport down the road but the planes going/ coming there NEVER come out this far and do not fly as fast as what I saw.", "3 objects hanging above St. GeorgeNoticed a slow moving object above St. George.  I was on the south end of town and watched the object move south above the town, then it turned west once it passed the airport (heading for Santa Clara) and slowly gained altitude until it was no longer visible.  The entire event took about 20 minutes.  There were 3 objects which all seemed to be attached to each other vertically.  At first I thought it was a helicopter with fire buckets, or someone on a parachute.  The topmost was a white sphere; the bottom object was dark and triangular.  It had no lights and made no sound.  As soon as I lost sight of the object, I saw a helicopter which circled the airport in the opposite pattern of the 3 objects, then headed in the same general direction.  The noise from the helicopter was very noticeable and it flew much faster than the previous object.", "the object went from left to right in matter of three seconds.Fireball shape-like coming down but then disappearing. the color was white and blue and as it was going it left a blue streak in air.", "many craft almost every night since November, 2007 including et. sightings.I probably have the strangest story to tell. I know that more and more people are going to think that my whole family has lost their mind.Since November, 2007 I have become obsessed with what is happening in our tiny town. I am not sure where to go with it. We have lost a lot of sleep since November of 2007. On November... I believe 29th of 2007,  I was driving home from town. The hwy. we travel is very long and dark, with little or no traffic and no street lamps.  I had my daughter and her boyfriend with me. It was a perfectly clear night between 6:30 pm and 7pm. Suddenly there was a fog that came up around us in which we all started talking about because it was so odd. Then, a very bright bluish light lit up around us which really startled us. At that very moment a bright white light shot from the sky at low altitude and could have hit the ground in front of us, but not so that we could see. We were very startled, and nervously chatted along the drive. We drove aways and there were very bright, what appeared to be red and orange lights in front of us.  They probably could have more than stretched from one side of the highway to the other.  It looked as though I might run right into them and I began to come to a stop. As I got closer it appeared as though they zipped sideways and disappeared. When I thought I had passed the spot where this occurred I wanted to turn around and look for the lights but my passengers were too frightened so we continued home.Since this occurred, the whole month of December has been somewhat like a nightmare that won&apos;t end. I have made a journal of what has happened and continues to happen. My story is probably too much to believe even for your sight. I have video tape and photographs unlike anything I have seen on the internet. I have seen more things going on around our two closed down mines than anyone can believe. I have made many comments on Youtube about what has been happening simply because of some of the idiotic comments people have made about what people are reporting they have seen, and it makes me angry that people don&apos;t believe them. I also reported the first part of my journal to Brian Vike from hbcc, who was supposed to come out and watch these things with me, but turned out ill. He hasn&apos;t contacted me since and I suggest we don&apos;t just let this go.So, I wonder if someone hasn&apos;t picked up on this and is either checking out what is going on here, or are they actually ufo&apos;s mistaken for aircraft, or has our military been sent to this area to make people believe that is what I have been seeing because suddenly, just as of this week, we have possibly been having fighter jet type planes in our area. Now I cannot confirm this but I have been told they are being seen, which is totally unheard of in this area.I know the difference and I know what I have seen here almost nightly since November 29th.This includes a craft the size of a football field and much more. I know you are going to find what I have to tell you very crazy, but I swear on my life and on my family it is all true. I definately don&apos;t trust this in the hands of police, (even though two of them witnessed one above our mine a few years ago). Neither do I trust the military or any government official to look into this. In fact I believe they already know. I have not shown my photos or video to anyone and will not send them out over the net. Among others we have excellent clear footage of a saucer carrying below it what looks like a pod type thing or capsule. The capsule has flames. We have had orbs everywhere. I am not going to go on about everything but just when I thought they may have left us, I saw another the night before last hovering over the mine again like a strobe light of red and white. Believe it or not we have major ufo&rsquo;s or George Bush is flying around in his &quot;Black Craft&quot; stealing our resources, looking like Mr. Burns of the Simpsons counting his money.Please let me know if you would like a much clearer description such as the journal I have been keeping.", "Saw 2 cigar shaped aircraft with 2 bright lights on one side and one red light on the other side. I have been seeing these craft in the woods next to my home for several weeks. It started 1-28-08. They fly over my home above the tree line. Then they seem to turn sideways and hover then go down in the trees. My daughter and I have also experiences strange occurrences around our home. A dead bird on our porch that looked like it and a branch fell of a tree , but in was under our awning. Also a bright flash of light in our kitchen, it came in thru a crack in the curtains. Dimming of the lights in our home at night. I also caught on tape lights on the side of our neighbors house. One red light in the trees, a purple/blue light on the ground next to their house and other phenomena. It has increased in intensity over the weeks. Started with me seeing blinking lights in the sky.", "we where looking at the moon on our deck when you go out our door turn left and you have full look then we saw 5 hell/cop. go by and turn aroung near the tower we looked around the sky for stars and the right of our deck we saw flashing lights two of them one on top of the other by eye distance maybe  2 1/2 inc or a little more they stayed that way for at least 3 mins and we did ck to see if the hell/copp  were moving but they had turned around going toward moody again.. and then they went behind the pine tree next door  right after that a plane was flying toward that area and into that space", "Illuminated objects flying in formation.It was dusk, just getting dark outside. There were about 15-20 objects flying in formation, like birds fly. However I&apos;m very certain they weren&apos;t birds. They looked like folded paper that was illuminated from the inside. They were glowing kind of dull, not very bright a white/light blue color. There was the main group that maintained in the formation, then two of them trailing behind as if they were trying to catch up to the group. I refer to them as &quot;bird-like&quot; because I&apos;ve never seen anything else fly in that sort of formation. But the objects themselves didn&apos;t have wings and weren&apos;t saucer shapped either. The best way to describe them is to imagine an oragami bird illuminated from the inside. I know it sounds weird, but it&apos;s hard to relate to something I&apos;ve never seen before. It&apos;s difficult to say the size. They seemed small, ( in respect to things I usually see in the sky like planes) but I&apos;m not really sure. They were flying below the clouds, and above the tree lines. But it was still hard to judge their distance away. The whole thing lasted about 7-10 seconds. It made no sounds like a plane or birds, just complete silence. Then then formation continued to fly into the distance until it was no longer visible. Before my friend and I walked outside and saw this formation, the same pattern appeared on his computer screen. The pattern floated across the screen, from left to right until it was off the screen. We thought that somthing was messed up with the power, so thats why we went outside. Only to find the exact same thing flying in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Possible hoax, we wonder.  PD))", "1963 - Round hovering, soundless, rotating object over northeast Portland, OregonI was at my cousin&apos;s house for the weekend.  She lived with her mom and sister in northeast Portland. My cousin&apos;s sister suddenly called out to us that she saw a flying saucer across the street, hovering over the park.  We, of course, didn&apos;t believe her - it was just too coincidental that we were watching Science Fiction Theatre at the same time!  Then, her mom, my aunt, said it was true, come and see it!  We flew up the stairs and went out the front door of the house.  By the time we got up stairs, the object seemed to be hovering over the &quot;Hollywood&quot; district in east Portland, about a mile south of where we were.  As it hovered, we could see a bank of greenish lights, followed by a bank of whiteish lights (about the same color as regular light bulbs).  From the rotation of the lights, we could see that the object was hovering, while turning clockwise. After about 10 minutes, it moved to the east and then to the north, where we guessed it was near the Portland Airport.  We called the airport to find out if anyone in the tower could see it on their radar.  The answer we received was that it was a &quot;plane, flying a banner behind it&quot;. This obviously did not make sense, since it was 11:00 pm.  In addition my cousin&apos;s sister called her mother-in-law to be when she guessed it was over her mother-in-law&apos;s house and the report was that the object was &quot;as big as a house&quot;, round, and didn&apos;t make any noise whatsoever.  The only sound was a &quot;whoosh&quot; as it sped by. This has always stuck in my mind, since our technology did not extend, specifically, to soundless, round objects that could hover.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Borden Carleton is just over the Confederation Bridge.  I was looking out the window of my work place and I spotted a large light in the sky.  The light was a yellow light.  The light started to flash slowly in and out.  Then the light went out and 2 amber lights came on.  They flashed for 20 seconds then the big yellow light came back on.  This figure was moving very slow in the sky.  Now its a very clear night with a full moon and absolutely no wind.  I ruled out that its not a plane because of how slowly its moving.  I figured it might be the coast guard or some sort of helicopter. The figure is over the water and moving in land.  I seen it move alittle to the right, then move back on its track.  I was on the phone with my girlfriend and telling her what I was seeing.  I told her to hang on a second.  I decided to go outside to see if I could hear what kind of craft it was.  When I went outside, I didn&apos;t hear a thing.  So that yold me it not a plane or a helicopter.  So, its a full moon so I waited until it passed over the moons light, and noticed that it was the same size as a jet but there was no sound at all.  Also it was moving really slow!!  Theres no way it could be a jet.  It was kinda like a diamond shape.  Skinny looking front that got really wide.  It was flying extremely low.  My question is, Why was this figure flying so low, was very well lit up, and why didn&apos;t it make any noise??  I mentioned it to drivers in the area approximately the same time period, and they didn&apos;t see a thing.  It was the weirdest thing I&apos;ve ever seen!  Seeing it didn&apos;t really scare me.  It was the fact it was so low and didn&apos;t make any noise at all!! Anybody help me out with this??", "Pretty large, very bright, white ball with flames coming out, caused power to go out in friend&apos;s house.I heard all the dogs in my neighborhood start to bark a lot, so I went outside to see what had happened. There was a big white ball, very bright. There was what looked like flares of fire coming out of it. The object was smaller than the moon, but bigger than a planet. I don&rsquo;t really know how to describe the size. It lit up the whole sky. There was a very slight flashing to the light. I called my friend (who lives about 10 minutes away) and began telling him about it. About 30 seconds into the call, the UFO disappeared. At that moment, my friend&rsquo;s lights flickered and all his electronics stopped working. However, everything in my house was fine.", "Point of light travelling across the sky in an erratic pattern41 years ago in 1967, I was a boarder at Gormanston College, County Meath, Ireland (53 deg.; 38&rsquo; N, 6 deg.; 14&rsquo;W). We slept in a long dormitory which had 4 rows of cubicles, my cubicle faced a window which faced due South, more or less. For a period of about a month in 1967, (possibly April/May) every night after &ldquo;Lights Out&rdquo; (22:00) I witnessed an unusual phenomenon in the night sky through the window. An object, a point of light like a satellite was moving steadily through the stars, but not in a straight line as a normal orbiting satellite would describe.  The diagram below &lt;e-mailed separately&gt; describes the path of the object, which it repeated every night for the duration of the time I saw it. The time it took to traverse my limited field of vision was mo more than 30 seconds so it struck me that the object would have been moving at great velocity but it came to a dead stop, just for a moment, each time before changing direction.  I now live in South Africa, I have seen many satellites in the night skies since 1967 but never have I seen one that behaved in this manner. There may be a completely rational explanation, but I do not believe that the technology existed on earth to perform these types of manoeuvres at the time.  Certainly, the forces required to stop and change direction like that would not be tolerable for a human being. I have often wondered what it was that I saw.  Perhaps someone else has seen something similar or knows what it was?((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I thought it was a plane at first going west to east.  Then it changed direction and started coming toward me in a southerly direction.  I did not see any banking as plane or jet would do.  This surprised me.  I watched as it approached to see if it might be a helicopter.  As it approached, I could see that it was taking on a disk shape with  a bubble on top.  I do not know what distance I was from it as I had no  reference point for size other than trees.  There were no clouds near it although it was a partially  cloudy day.

They separated where you can see sky between them.

It was a clear winter night, and while gazing upward we spotted what at first we thought was a satellite.It was a little brighter than the surrounding stars, and was moving at about the same speed as a satellite at first. We then noticed another, and another. Total there were at least three and possibly as many as six.For about 15-30 minutes we watched as these lights came together in a group, lined up beside each other, branched from one another and then came together again. (I&rsquo;ve forgotten the exact sequence in which this happened.) At one point three of the lights aligned in triangle formation, and moved around as a group. They took turns branching off from the triangle and then coming back.They all moved in straight lines, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be much, if any, curve to their movement.When the disappeared, it was fast, and almost like they were being sucked back into the black of the sky. It reminded us of &ldquo;warp speed&rdquo; from Star Trek.The three of us all saw the same thing, and being the open minded people we are, didn&rsquo;t take long to come to the conclusion that whatever we saw were some sort of space crafts, possessing technology way beyond human capability.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We had done this hundreds of times before, just like all the kids did, but this time we had become frightened while passing through the first woods because of an orange glow which seemed to be illumunating behind some trees in the compound. It was a dry humid summer night, but it smelled strange, like rain or some wierd sweet odor.We started to sing the Beatle&apos;s song:&quot;Octopus&apos;Garden&quot; over &amp; over again as we entered the second section of the dark wooded area. Brushing sounds of branches made us so nervous!  Soon we were at the clearing around the pond and could see the open sky.  We sang a bit louder and tried our best to ignore the orangey glow behind the trees.  I remember that the moon was hanging low and to keep our spirits light we slowly walked along the path toward it and kept on singing.  An object seemed to fly out from inside the Remington Arms compound and we noticed the strange odor in the air again. That wierd sweet odor, but even creepier was the way the tree tops were swaying, especially because there was no wind!  When we had first entered the pond area it felt as if something had been following us from behind the other side of the fence.  My friend was scared and I was too, but acted a bit braver and told her to keep singing and so our voices got louder with nervousness.  As we got closer to the shore of the pond we could see the sky better across the open water. Suddenly we noticed that it was a triangular shaped ship which appeared without any sound, except for the movement of tree branches brushing together as it emerged from behind some tree tops. The dark triangle cruised directly towards us. It had some bright orange lights and made everything look like a negative film, with that orangey, brown tone. We kept singing, but softer as we couln&apos;t believe our eyes. Was this truly a UFO? Time seemed to stand still and must have slipped away because when we finally were able to move away and go down the path, skipping rocks in the strange glow which illuminated our way out of the woods and into the streets, the moon had risen and looked smaller.We hurried to her house as fast as we could and upon arrival everyone was worried. We were three hours late. It was after 11:00 pm and we started out from my house at around 8:00 pm. It was less than a thirty minute walk even with our dilly-dallying!  No-one believed our story and said we each shared an over active imagination. We cried and begged to be believed. &quot;Call the authorities! We&apos;re telling the truth.&quot; and continued to insist that our experience was real! Then the next day my friend&apos;s Dad said, &quot;Maybe, girls, what you witnessed was only a new aircraft of sometype that the government was testing out. Make sure you both keep away from that area because you&apos;ll be caught and convicted of tresspassing!&quot; Of course, we didn&apos;t heed him and went back the next day afterschool. We sang until our lungs turned blue, but no UFO appeared. Later, after supper at my friends house, she decided to only walk me halfway home, the pond would be the &quot;good-bye&quot; point. So we sat on rocks in the clearing and began singing Octopus&apos; Garden again. Sure enough, the orangey glow hoovered over the moving tree branches and the UFO softly floated above the water once again, not making any sound. This time we were both frozen with fear and disbelief. Again time slipped by, my friend wore a watch, but when we checked it later, it had stopped. She admitted that maybe she forgot to wind it or push the pin in tight enough after setting it. Whatever happened we&apos;ll never know? We ran down the path not even skipping the rocks properly. With soaking sneakers and drenched bell-botttoms, we reached the streetlights and fell to our knees in the middle of the road and began to pray! The older kids in the neighborhood started to make fun of us when we told our tale, so we stopped sharing it! One boy who had a tree house  and lived near the pond told everyone that it was true and that he saw the same UFO! We sorta felt better and became closer than ever before. Eventually,though, we kinda stopped talking about it altogether. Soon we became more interested in teenage things, like love, Rock N Roll, and our developing figures. I was always on the skinny side, butd suddenly started to loose a lot of weight. The boy and my best friend fell in love. Soon after my parents moved to the country, I was hospitalized. The Doctors diagnosed me with Hodgekin&apos;s Lymphoma. But the pathology report said some nodes had bizarre changes in them which couldn&apos;t be identified! Radiation &amp; Chemotherapy took over my young life. I was just turning sixteen. I lost touch with ALL my childhood friends. The last time we got together was in 1984 after our dear friend, who said he also saw the UFO, committed suicide. My best friend was newly engaged to be married, but suspected that she was barren inside, maybe because of our experience. I haven&apos;t seen or spoke to her since.However,I was able to give birth to twin girls in 1986 and in March of 96 or 1997 during the visit of Hale-Bopp Comet, I had bizarre dreams of being abducted and woke up with tiny needle marks on the veins in my right hand. My daughters both had nightmares! One of them saw me on a table in a white room. I couldn&apos;t beleve it when she told me that these aliens took her arm off and she saw them doing painful things to her twin sister. I told them that I had a visit too and showed them my hand. I had two tiny unexplainable scabs directly on my veins. I chose not to tell them until later in adulthood that I saw them in the white lights too, and in my dream I also saw that same daughter laying on a table without her arm. God&apos;s honest truth! To this day the twins become uncomfortable talking about it. They don&apos;t like to remember the bad experience and say that I am making up my admissions just to scare them. I wonder...can generations become targets of study?((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "I saw this sighting tonight as I looked up at the moon. It was is in the northeastern sky. Left and lower than the moon. I noticed that it was not moving and did not look like a plane. I got out my binoculars for a better look. I was fascinated, so, I had my former husband look at this and his daughter. They saw it more clearly than I did.  At his first glance he said that, it looked like a satellite. I asked him to take a closer look with the binoculars. All of us looked at it through them. Out consensus was that it looked most like a saucer. They also thought that it look&apos;s like Saturn with the ring around it. All I could see was an extra light. I just checked the sky it is still there. I will probably watch it for a long time tonight if it stay&apos;s. It still has not moved. I tried to make a call to you, however, there is no toll free number for you. We have thought of calling the police. I don&apos;t quite know what to do to insure that other&apos;s see this right now that have not yet. Therefore, I may risk being thought of as a nut and call the local police anyway. It seems a small thing to have happen if other&apos;s may witness this. I have always wanted to see one. I hope that this is the real thing. I also hope that somehow I will discover if other&apos;s have seen it as well.I have just called two friends to go and look at it too.

It was around 2 AM and as I slowly walked closer to it I noticed it looked like a huge hawk or eagle that was as big as a man. It was hovering w/ it&apos;s wings closed. I heard a low mechanicle sound coming from it. I also heard some tones like you would hear on a computer or telephone. I picked up a rock and threw it at the object. I saw the rock deflect off of it and when the rock hit it, it sounded like it was hitting metal. The object spreaded it&apos;s wings in mid air, I briefly saw tiny green and red lights flash on it, and then it made a sound like a hawk or eagle as it began to fly towards the south. I would guess this thing was 5 to 6 ft in height, and had a 15 to 20 ft wing spand. Afterwards I read this one story online that a college kid from Colorado went to Mexico with a couple of his classmates that were from that country. They were hiking near the US-Mexico border outside of Texas in the late 1990s. They were resting between two hills behind some large trees near an isolated road. A military type vehicle drove up and stopped. The college hikers were out of it&apos;s view about 30 yards away. Four men got out of the vehicle, three of them appeared to be Chinese and one a Mexican National. The three men that appeared to be Chinese seemed to be speaking in an oriental language. About two minutes later the college hikers saw this huge bird fly up and landed 20 yards from the four men. They went and got the huge bird and carried it and placed it in the back of their vehicle, then drove away. I thought this story might have some connection to what I witnessed in July 2006.  My guess is that this bird type object could be some sort of spying flying object that an Asian country such as China is conducting on the U.S.  I&apos;ve heard of several large bird sightings in the Southwestern USA for years.  I just find all this to be interesting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was very very dark, little traffic and the sky was clear with lots of stars. My friend and I decided, out of boredom to watch the sky for shooting stars (meteorites).  We saw an occasional plane or airliner with their blinking lights traveling across the sky. At one point I was watching one of these &quot;planes&quot; (no blinking lights) when all of a sudden it took off like a shooting star . So that got my attention.  But it never went out of sight.  Instead it stopped  &quot;shooting&quot; and continued at a regular speed like a plane.  At this point, I called everyone&rsquo;s attention to it. Then it shot across the sky again then stopped  and did it again. It was moving in irregular patterns one way then another. We were all just amazed and could not take our eyes off of it, just watching it zig zag around at different speeds.  It seemed like it went on for such a long time. My dad was having a hard time keeping his eyes on the road and on the object too but he didn&rsquo;t stop, he just slowed down. We were all trying to guess what the heck it could be because we knew it was not a shooting star or a plane. We do have a lot of military Air Force bases down in the Keys but I don&rsquo;t even think the stealth bomber was in existence or even being tested at that time. I don&rsquo;t think there was any aircraft at that time that was capable of this kind of movement. We continued to watch it as its movements seemed to take up the whole sky, when suddenly it stopped and just slowly faded out. It looked as if it went straight out into space at a very very high rate of speed until it was just gone from sight.

The weather conditions at the time were ideal, clear skies and warm temperatures. As stated, the object had no clear definable shape. However, travelling just slightly ahead were two very shiney spheres, one on top of the other and considerably smaller than the main &quot;craft&quot;, perhaps even connected. It was quite clear however the object was not a fixed wing or rotary aircraft. I made visual contact with the object after observing an elderly couple looking skyward.

It was of a teardrop shape with the lights (bluish in color) along the lower body panel and were all the way around it. From the point where the light was moving from my left to right was maybe a distance of around 2 miles away from me.

I don&apos;t know the constellation name but in the NNE sky I could see the triangle - 3 stars - and noticed a fourth and was surprised to see a fourth star?!  At about 10-15 degrees my daughter and I spotted an object that seemed closer to us than the stars. I would say perspectively it looked like it was about 15 miles from us. We looked around to see the airplane flight paths and watched that for about 2 minutes and decided it was not the same as an airplane.   We did not see this object move in any direction but we did see red flashing lights going around it in pattern almost.  The lights spinning around this object would speed up and then slow down.  We watched this thing for about 8-10 minutes and after the last cycle of flashing around this object it rapidly strobed may 6 or so times and it was gone. About 30 seconds later we saw a dull white streak across the sky in a northerly direction and spotted another object in the North sky but it was glowing bluish somewhat hazy.  Just as the first object, it just disappeared after watching it for nearly 5 minutes.  About 2 or 3 minutes later, we spotted what looked like a military fighter jet flying in the direction we witnessed the first object - we could tell it was not a commercial jet because of it&apos;s profile.  It was flying fairly low - at least low enough for us to see the shape of the aircraft.  It is not common for military jets to fly over our house though there are several bases around us. My daughter did attempt taking pictures of this second object, however, I&apos;m not sure if that is what was captured. I can forward upon request.

I continued to ignore it.  About 5 minutes later I decided to go to my window, pull the curtains and look.  What I saw was a black round craft hovering between my house and my neighbours&apos; house.  I could see the craft clearly.  It seemed to be hovering right above the roofline of the two houses.  From my perspective I could see the bottom of the craft,  which had 3 distinct bright yet muted lights shaped in a triangle formation.

At first it was just one or two, then more and more of them, moving small distances then moving at accelerated rates and large distances. I tried to discern a pattern or patterns and none came to mind however they seemed to move in some grid like patter, very fast and I would estimate a mile or two at a time. They move a distance then settle down into the trees, then rise up above the trees and race off to the next destination, and go down below the trees. Watching all of them move over this hilly terrain was most unusual and I haven&apos;t seen anything like it since. Occasionally I&apos;ll see some mention of these red &apos;Globes&apos; on some UFO show or report and think about what my First Officer and I witnessed. I don&apos;t believe it was man made, but something else. The patterns or grids they were moving would, or at least to me, seemed almost in retrospect, computer generated and not some natural cause.

The event grew louder and louder as it approached our house and I jumped out of the Hot tub to see if there was an aircraft that was going to crash nearby. The only thing I could assume was that it was a jet airliner, but it was getting way to loud and way to close. The sound was also somehow wrong and a lower tone than a jumbo jet, and it sounded like an electrical transformer hum, but at a deeper and yet sharper tonality with a bit of a throb to it. The craft flew nearly over our ranch and was nothing but a dark spot (or lack of cloud reflection) in the sky against the clouds. No lights at all.

At around 5:20 AM MST (give or take a few minutes) I looked up in the clear sky and saw a very brite &ldquo;star&rdquo;.  At first I thought it was Venus, but immediately realized it was in the northern sky, and could not be Venus.  Besides, it appeared brighter than Venus.  I immediately assumed it was an airplane and looked down as I continued walking. After a few steps, I looked up again.  Instead of an airplane, I saw what appeared to be a star where I had seen the &ldquo;airplane&rdquo;.  Not a bright star, just an average star.  I then watched it as it quickly faded away, in a matter of 10 seconds or so, until nothing was there.  It did not appear to be moving, just fading away.  In complete silence. I have never seen an airplane look like that.  First of all, when an airplane is that bright, it is coming toward you.  Second of all, it takes longer to fade out of sight when it is flying away.  And you usually see a flashing strobe light or the red and green wing lights.  But this just looked like a normal star that was fading away. Rather than a UFO, I&rsquo;d say this looked more like a star had just blown up and disappeared.

It was a beautiful clear spring day in Southern California.  I got to the park but there wasn&apos;t anyone to play with.  So, I started hitting the ball up against the wall and waited until someone showed up to play.  I threw the ball up in the air to practice some serves and something directly above me caught my eye.  I thought it was a plane at first, but the thing wasn&apos;t moving.  I&apos;ve always been into planes since I was a kid, so it struck me odd that this &quot;plane&quot; wasn&apos;t moving.  It had to be at an altitude of about 1 to 2 miles up and nothing that I knew of could hover at that altitude.  I was very much dumbstruck and at the same time extremely curious.  Why wasn&apos;t this thing moving.  I looked around to call to someone to witness this, I didn&apos;t care if it was a stranger or not.  But, there was no one around within 100 yards of me.  I was very confused about this.  I laid down on the court on my back so that I could better examine what it was, because it was directly above me.  It had the shape similar to that of space shuttle turned upside down with it&apos;s bay doors open.  I remember wishing that I had a pair of binoculars so that I could see it better.  I remember it was highly polished like stainless steel and the sun was reflecting off from it brightly.  I had to have laid there for 5 to 10 minutes.  It just stuck there.  I almost got the feeling that it was looking at me looking at it.  I went to get up and took my eye off from it for a split second and it was gone.

This happened approximately three more times in a span of about 4 minutes. (While this was happening, I was lucky enough to have my camera with me, so I started snapping a few pictures.) Then it finally vanished from plain view for about five minutes. Then I noticed a jet-fighter flying high in the sky, moving west to east over the trees on the right side of the highway. As I began thinking this could somehow be related to the UFO I had just seen, I noticed it was actually pursuing a UFO of the same description.  I witnessed this happen for about fifteen seconds when a second UFO appeared behind and slightly below the jet-fighter. Seconds later both UFOs vanished before my eyes and the jet-fighter was left alone in the sky.

There are no suburban neighborhoods in that direction.", "Seeing the sparks coming three to five feet above the ocean and all around the boatIt was approximately late spring of 1983, somewhere between Cordova and Valdez, Alaska on Prince William Sound, while we were fishing (gill-netting).  We were on our 40&apos; boat.  I was outside on the stern, one early morning, when I noticed our dog on the edge of the boat and looking down at the ocean rather nervously.  I went to him right away and saw what&apos;s best described as intermittent sparks three to five feet above the ocean.  They were coming out of the ocean.  I looked around our boat and it was on all sides of us.  (We were in the middle of it)  As we were moving (I believe it lasted about five mintues) I put my fingers in it with no reaction.  However, my fingers were not wet!  This really spooked me.  Nothing else happened.  We passed on through it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

So it was some time between that.I was feeling fine, but all of a sudden I felt weird, like an electric charge like when you rub a balloon on ur hair you can feel the static, like that but all over my body and I was lying back and wouldn&apos;t move and I was getting this massive headache but it wasn&apos;t exactly a headache, I just heard this kind of quiet sound like somethings hovering above my house then it got louder, like I didn&apos;t hear it I felt it in my head, It wasn&apos;t literally loud but it was loud to me. And I could just hear it as if I was in a little room with a radio turned on loud.It just sounded like something was hover around.It was so weird, I wanted to look out the window but I just couldn&apos;t get up, I don&apos;t know if it was my mind that just was scared to find out what it was or if it was something else. All I could remember is that Loud sound but at the same time it was silent..I don&apos;t know how to explain it and there was a white light that&apos;d go pass my window, I had blinds so I couldn&apos;t see out it.This was going on for about 30-45 mins.I was thiking it was just a car but that sound couldn&apos;t possibly come from a car, I&apos;ve never heard it before and what about the light, it just sounded like it was hovering around really fast then just staying in one spot. Anyways I don&apos;t really remember much or how but I ended up falling asleep.. Then likean hour later it happened again, That sound ringing in my head just woke me up this time I woke up scared, not cause the sound being loud in my head I don&apos;t know what it was, but I woke up and just sat there listening to that sound hover away.It was weeks later maybe a month I was hearing it again. Weird my dad had just got up to pee(it was night time),I told my dad about my weird headache and how it sounded like something was outside my window! , I&apos;m su re a UFO that I&apos;ve never heard before such a sound like that staying in one spot, I was telling him maybe I need to see a doctor cause that headache was just, not normal. Then we got into some other conversation completely off subject then all of a sudden I started hearing that sound again. I interrupted my dad and told him to shh and listen, but he kept talkin and went to whispering then shut up by that time it went away.

The intense white light was what initially caught my attention then the fact that they seemed to be motionless. As I drove forward I began to see that it was a metallic neutral tan color with lights blinking on either end.  I turned off the radio and opened the windows as I slowly drove under it and I heard no sound. It was shaped like a triangle with rounded corners.

No pattern at all to the lights.Okay, I&apos;m standing out on the patio, smoking a cigarette and up in the sky I see these lights. Here&apos;s as best a description I can give:It appeared in the southern sky. the lights looked like twinkling stars almost or like plane lights but they would get bright for just a second and then disappear completely (normal planes do not do that you can still see the plane). There would be like 4 or 5 of them going off but not in any sort of order. The area they covered was pretty big, like the area of 5 or 6 planes but there wasn&apos;t a distinguishable shape like a circle etc. Really you could not see anything behind the lights it was the lights themselves that let you know something was there.It could not have been different planes either because of the way the lights were moving the plane would have to have the ability to zig up and down and back and forward at a rate of nano seconds. The whole thing was moving west at a pretty rapid clip. I called my husband out, who was annoyed I took him away from a show but as soon as he saw it he also commented, &quot;What the hell is that?&quot; I was speaking to a friend on the phone who lives a few blocks away. I asked her to go outside and look at the sky. She and her son went outside,her son said it looked like asteroid dust. He is 13. We had to run out to the parking lot to see past the building in front of us but by the time we got to the parking lot it was gone. We live near an air force base so we are used to seeing planes in the sky all the time.

However, upon examining this streak more closely as driving and stopped at a traffic light, I could then clearly tell that the trail was dark black, like smoke from something burning, and also, this object, whatever it was, was falling from the sky, not flying.  The contrail was arching downward toward the ground like a rainbow at a very steep descent.  The direction was West to East.  Not sure if anyone else saw this or would notice it...I could not see any fire or tell what type of object was creating the contrail...but something was falling fast, so it appeared!", "Three lights in a triangular formation.I am a 38 year old female.  When I was 16-17 years old I saw something unlike anything I have ever seen. It was very late at night and my parents where sleeping. I was in the living room watching television.  I decided to look out the window at the stars. The view from our window was unblocked and the sky was full of stars that night. I had only been looking for a few seconds when I suddenly saw what I believe was a UFO. Three lights in a triangular pattern appeared in the sky. At the top of the triangle shape was a red light. At the bottom in each corner was a white/yellowish color light. The two lights in the bottom corner left there position at a rapid rate of speed. The light in the left corner moved to the left and the right light moved to the right in the same formation at the same time. Both lights went out away from the red light. The two lights suddenly returned to their exact positions as before and the whole thing disappeared as if someone just turned it off. All I saw was lights in the form of a triangle. If it was a ship of some kind it had no other lights on it except the three that I described. I have never seen anything like this before or after that night. Considering my age reporting what I saw at the time was of no importance to me. Now that I am older I feel it is important that someone knows of what I saw. If it was a UFO or not maybe the information I have to offer could be of some kind of help or assistance to our world or country. I reported my sighting as one or possibly  three sightings because the two lights separated from there position as if they where separate from it but had a connection to the red light at the top somehow. From what I saw I believe it to be one main ship with others that detach . Thank you for time reading this and I hope I wrote it where you can understand what I saw.

My attention had been on the Moon, so I didn&apos;t see it coming until it was noticeably passing just to the South of the Moon.  There had been no loud &quot;jet plane&quot; sound to signal it&apos;s appearance. This was without a doubt the brightest object in the sky.  It was a brilliant golden color and had a &quot;flutter&quot; or wobble as it moved.  There were occasional flashes of red or white that I couldn&apos;t tell whether they were onboard lights or reflections because of the wobble.  Within a few seconds it had disappeared over the horizon. It moved pretty well due East at a pretty good clip.  Within a minute, I could hear that a plane (jet?) was coming.  It followed the same basic path as the first object.  It&apos;s running lights were nowhere near as bright as the object before it.

We were on the Southside of Birmingham and were driving up Arlington Avenue South to cut through to Montclair Road via Carlisle Road.  We live in the Crestwood/Irondale area of Birmingham.   The weather was in the low 60&apos;s and overcast and a bit gusty and there was rain in the forecast.  Not really unusual for the south but for some reason it just felt odd almost the way it feels before a thunderstorm or even a tornado. When we turned onto Montclair from Carlisle, we drove just a short distance approximately a quarter of a mile to where the Pilgrim Church is and we noticed through the trees and up to the left a flash of a very bright blueish light that lasted maybe a second.  We both expected to hear thunder or a boom from a transformer but we heard nothing.  As we continued on maybe another quarter of a mile, we were approaching a red light and intersection.  It should be noted that there is a ridge to the left that runs parallel to Montclair and at the intersection there is a post office to the left and just up from there is another building that houses the Orthopedic Specialists.   This ridge is mostly residential. As we were about to pass under the red light (speed limit is 25)  to our surprise the brilliant blue light reappeared on the ridge just behind the Orthopedic Specialists building. We were maybe 500 feet from it so you could see it very clearly.  What we saw was truly amazing and we have never ever seen anything like it.   The light was a brilliant plasma blue. It seemed to pulse, it was bright but not blinding.  The cylinder was very large, approximately about 50 - 60 feet across and about 100-120 feet tall.  There seemed to be a cylinder within a cylinder.  The outermost cylinder had a very 3D appearance and the best way to describe it...a Hexagon.  It was slowly rotating counterclockwise.  The innermost cylinder was smooth but it didn&apos;t really seem to rotate. You could pretty much see through the cylinder but because of the light it definately had a hazy glow to it.   The cylinder extended up towards what appeared to be a circular stack of levels starting with the lowest level closest to the cylinder, which was made up of rectangle shaped lights arranged around the perimeter of possibly the bottom of a craft.  It too was rotating in a counterclockwise direction.  The next  3 levels stepped up and out and disappeared into a very dense low hanging cloud.  You absolutely could not see what was up in the clouds and I have to say that the cloud was unusually low and very dense and despite how windy it was seemed to just hang there.  The craft just hovered there and it lasted approximately 5 seconds.    Then just like a light switch it turned off.  There was no way to tell if the craft disappeared or if the light just turned off. We continued traveling down Montclair and trying to put our minds around what we saw.  We had probably travelled less than a quarter of a mile and that took less than a minute when just like before it appeared again.  It seemed to be travelling very slowly along the top of the ridge.  When the light appeared it just seemed to hover over the houses along the top part of the ridge. Again, concealed in the cloud. This time we pulled over and rolled down the window.  There was no noise, no whir, no sound at all.  All of a sudden all of the lights to the left of Montclair Road where the craft was hovering all went out.  The entire neighborhood was cast into darkness.  Of course, curiosity getting the best of us, we decided to turn up into the neighborhood towards the area that the craft might be to see if by some chance we might catch a closer glimpse.  All of the houses were dark, no street lights....very eery but it was obviously gone.   As we made a U turn to go back down towards Montclair there was a very clear view of another ridge that is a few miles away and we could see transformers blowing one after another, maybe 5 in all .The saddest part is I actually had my camera in the backseat, why o why didn&apos;t I pull myself together enough to get out my camera and record the event.  At any rate, this was absolutely the most amazing thing that either of us have seen or experienced.    I have to say I have always been a skeptic but I just have no idea what this could have been but it definately seemed to have some purpose or intention in what it was doing.  What would that be?  I have no idea.", "Orange lights and triangles over field south of Half Moon Bay.On the day of this incident, a friend and I went to explore a field and empty reservoir in this field. We wanted to come back to it that night, and enjoy the moon and conversation away from town life. We came back with another person that night. We walked to the end of the field for no reason in particular, and noticed 2 orange lights over the trees. They were moving quite slow, sometimes not moving at all. They appeared small, as if they were planes. They would head east away from the ocean. They would circle around and disappear behind the hills. They usually appeared in twos, separated by quite a distance. They would always appear from behind hills or trees. They sometimes appeared from nothingness. They would sometimes turn off the lights, and then appear with light configuration like jet planes. They had up to 7 lights, most commonly 2 headlights with &ldquo;wing&rdquo; lights and up to 3 lights in the back. But they were too low and too fast and silent, and were not jet planes. At times we could see up to 6 in the air. We called our friend and he came with his girlfriend. We watched the triangle and squares and diamond crafts fly around, like bees. They would often change path, and were just observing. It seemed that other crafts would appear in the paths of other crafts. We had a flashlight, and when I flashed patterns on the field one turned its headlight toward us and changed course to fly directly above us. They were triangular in shape when we saw them from below. From the sides, they appeared oblong and very large. They appeared very bright, and I do not think jets or prop planes have these bright of headlights. Our observations were mildly disturbing, and 4 of us were convinced they were UFO&rsquo;s, but the only girl with us was still skeptical. This was about to change. Over a hedgerow cypress forest, 2 lights, dime sized to us only 1,500 feet away, hovered for maybe 2 minutes. There was a faint glowing aura in the trees below. They moved slowly around, and we could see one turn away and he! ad for t he ocean. The other continued closer to us, within 600 feet, following a drainage ditch it seemed like. It hovered to the highway, and looked at the traffic from about 700 feet up. It then went over the hills and disappeared. We could see it with binoculars, and it had a bright halogen like head light, and a green light on the back with a red light above it. On the back were 2 white lights, with a red light underneath each one. It looked like an observer. The red light blinked very faintly. After this one had left, we didn&rsquo;t see anymore that night. We left to pick up some food.", "Cloaked UFO making noises and pink flashing lights on february 18th.Ok every day, once a day, at random times, I hear a noise that sounds like a hovercraft or something that is hovering above my house me and my brother both hear it I hear it more often though because I never really have any music on. Anyways the reason I think this might be a ufo is because one night Febraury 18th 2008 at aproximatly 1:30 am at night it was storming out and because of the storm I think the cloak (yes I do beleive that it is cloaked) was disrupted causeing my power to go out. Me and my brother both seen pink flashing lights him being on the left side of the house me being on the right. There were no cars around and everyone was sleeping. After it left the electric went back on and we had no communication with anyone so we couldn&apos;t find out if it happened to anyone else. The next day, February 19th, 2008 at aproximatly 10 am we got our communication back and I went online and asked people who lived near me if they had lost power or seen anything like what we saw and everyone I asked said no.

We are going back into the wood to check it out as soon as someone with a 4-wheel drive arrives, (there is a huge pond back there).", "Spherical cloud-like object with conical trailing bottom and a some light or brightness about it.I was just walking down my street on early Thursday(January 17th 2008)between 1:00 and 1:30 am and as I turned the corner heading East I noticed something that appeared like a cloud but strangely concentrated with a part that trailed away from the bottom of it&apos;s sort of diffused spherical shape! It was not moving when I first looked at it. It was hovering pretty low for a &apos;cloud&apos; (as the actual clouds were at a higher altitude) at the corner of my street. It was low enough to feel it could get to me pretty quickly if it needed to! When it actually started moving East the bottom part was trailing in the opposite direction that the object was going and was somewhat conical. The object was white and had a brightness to it like a little light from within but not super bright as I have seen a brighter object in the past, and this object pales in comparison. It was brighter than the actual clouds that it drifted past and appeared to be about the same size as a regular sized (when not too close to earth in it&apos;s orbit) full moon in diameter. So I get a few feet away from the corner and as I am still eyeing what I thought at first was a strange looking cloud. I notice this thing has moved with me, it&apos;s kept pace with me give or take a few steps, as it really began to appear to be following me fairly closely. I was heading for my local coffee shop to get out and get some fresh air and some decaf and instead I get stalked by some mysterious cloud like object! Well I picked up the pace to confirm that it was following and to see if it could keep up and I can walk very fast, so this was a good test! Sure enough it was keeping up with me up until I get to the tunnel/underpass which I had to turn into to get to my destination. So to see if I could lose the object at this opportune moment of quick cover I picked up the pace a little more to get into the tunnel and into my destination without it seeing where I went to. I get to the other side of the tunnel (approx. 40 feet in length) and look up to see nothing hovering anywhere. It would seem like I had lost the object, as I kept watching and I walked approaching my destination. I took one last look before I entered the drive to the local coffee shop and saw no object. It probably only took me 13 minutes to walk to my destination.So I am in the coffee shop for about 20 to 30 minutes or so and decide it&apos;s time to head back home. While I was in the coffee shop I thought to myself I will walk back home a different way just in case this thing is still hanging around or hiding out somewhere near where I was walking before. So I walk out of the coffee shop and start heading toward the tunnel and there is the object but at a distance not as close as it was before when it followed me. It seemed it was in the part of the sky back near where it started following me near my home but on the opposite side of the highway from where it was originally. It was on the South side of the hIghway when it started following and now it was on the North side but back in the West from where I started walking.So I walked South in another way to go back home instead of going the quicker way back, the way I came, to see if it would still follow me. For the first little while it did not seem to catch up but then in no time it was right behind me when I was about halfway home taking the side streets in a western direction after I had walked a little ways south. Since it seemed determined to follow me and since it seemed as if it had been waiting for me practically outside my door (thinking it may know exactly where I live, or it will because it&apos;s following me home now) I might as well slow down my pace to make sure it follows me home and I don&apos;t lose it temporarily again . I decided that because I would like to try and snap a couple of quick pictures of the &apos;stalker&apos; if I got back intact and inside to get my camera, but to no avail! As I felt a little threatened by it following me home I warned whatever it was that I was protected so don&apos;t mess with me. I also had the thought in my mind that as soon as I get to my door I&apos;m going to race inside and get my camera, beca use someone needs to see this! Seconds after this about three quarters of the way home I could no longer see the object, maybe my warning or threat of be caught on camera made it leave or something else did that I could not see!", "UFO at Rockaway Beach,New YorkI was walking on the beach with my girlfriend and son on sun Feb 16th 2008 at 3:35pm. My girlfriend and I both had cameras with us taking cute photos of one another and my son. I noticed how clear the sky was and how the moon looked clear visable.

I was going from Dearborn to Plymouth.  I was told not to use Hines Drive because it is deserted and if I had car problems I would be in trouble.  Hines Drive was the shortest way.  I took a chance and went down Hines Drive.  It was very dark and deserted.  Although, I had choosen the route, I became to regret it.  All of a sudden I saw a large shiney object on the right side of the road.  Round shaped with bright blinking lights.  I would have never pulled over, but, there was one other car with a women already stopped, in front of me.  She was out of her car.  I pulled off the road behind her and got out of the car. I said to her, &quot;Do you see what I see&quot; and she said &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;I think so&quot;.  It was like seeing something and not believing what you are seeing.  I wish I had taken her number or she had taken mine.  I said it must be some kind of publicity stunt for an upcoming movie or a radio station promotion or something like that.  We stood there and stared in fascination and amazement shaking our heads.  We both got back into our cars and I preceeded to go to the shower.  Although, I had left early, took the shortest route, I arrived at the shower very late.  I kept saying, you just wonuldn&apos;t believe what just happened to me.  We all agreed it had to be a radio thing.  The next day a called several popular radio statations and the newspapers and they weren&apos;t aware of anything of that nature taking place.  I really never thought about it for a long time until I saw a story on TV about a couple that had been abducted.  I still have never mentioned it to anyone since that incident.  I developed skin cancer of my back which they claimed was from the sun.  I never exposed my body, (the middle of my back) to the sun.  I have been sick in one way or other every since.  I often wonder it something happened and I just don&apos;t remember it.  I would be willing to take a lie detector test or sodium petathal or hypnosis.  I swear on my life this happene! d.

Then, it dropped quite fast on a 90 degree angle. At first, I thought it was might have been fireworks but the light was traveling straight and then dipped extremely fast (and it looked very controlled).

I was taking a shortcut home. As I was driving, I believe I saw something. This something was hovering, about 20-30 feet above ground. It was just off the road maybe only 50 ft or so. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was, due to the fact, I have never seen anything like this in my life. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, whether I should stop what I was doing and try to get a better look at this object, or if I should&rsquo;ve fled away being afraid of what could possibly happen. I was somewhat scared, because it was abnormal and it was so close to me. This object was so close to me, that I could have thrown a rock at it and I would&rsquo;ve definitely hit it. Being so afraid and uncertain of what I was seeing, I just kept driving, but only faster. I didn&rsquo;t tell anybody because I didn&rsquo;t want people to think I was hallucinating or something.Now to describe this object. I saw a cluster of lights. The lights were not in a row or any formation. They were not in a sequence or in any pattern to form a shape of the object. They were spread out. They changed color. All of the lights changed color at the same time. At first the lights were a whitish color. Then they changed to a blue-grean or teal color. Next they appeared in a reddish or red-orange color. They flashed or should I say switched position. One light would go out and another one would light up. They switched from light to light extremely fast and again, not in any pattern or sequence. This flashing of lights made it hard to identify its shape. I could not make out the body of the object because of the scrambling lights. When the lights changed from light to light, it was like there was a streak of light following behind it,  kind of like a tracer. This object didn&rsquo;t appear to be on the ground, but very close to it. And it wasn&rsquo;t moving, and if it was it was cruising very slowly.After seeing this, I was not sure of what to do. I was so astonished, I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I had just seen. I thought there was some kind of mistake or I was just seeing things. I never really put too much thought into this sighting. I never really believed in these sightings that others reported. I was just online at MSN.COM and I saw an article about a recent sighting in Texas. There was a video of the witness talking to the news crew. He was describing what he had seen. The way he described the object was a very accurate description of what I saw. I should have made this report a lot sooner. But me seeing this video of the witness and him describing the sighting, pushed me to make a report. Maybe my info could help you all out in some way.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I have not made a digital copy I can upload of the object with the low southern star as a reference, hope to get a better shot.On Sunday September 30 2008 I was watching TV when a loud rumble like a jet at full throttle came over my house. I ran out to the field before looking back and up. I could not believe it it was a giant triangular craft with large globes of amber on the points, ahead of it appeared to be a giant stealth delta wing craft and across the rear was 4 sets of red lights like an old Thunderbird. The triangle with the lights was following so close it was as if it were towing the triangle which was very close. They flew over and I could see them shrink before disappearing over the horizon, leading me to believe it was actually much larger and flying much higher than they looked as it flew over. I figured it was bigger than a football field if that was 500 feet. After seeing it so long makes me think it was much higher which means it was really big! Although I am 50 mi. east of  Dublin the flight path I have been observing heads straight to Dublin. They seem to like swamps.

These helicopters were travelling at around 100-120mph but slowly came to a complete stop and went another 200 feet up. About 10 seconds after this I noticed lots of small shapeless bright dots emerge from a cloud.  It looked very similar to the debris you get when rockets explode.  As more emerged from the cloud I realised it was not debris as they seemed to be &apos;falling&apos; in a series of different single file rows.  As they approached the helicopters they were only 1/2 mile away and I got a scale and I quessed that these objects were about 5 by 5 feet big and looked as though they were wrapped in aluminium foil. When they all completely got out the clouds they were all loosing altitude and travelling at about 80mph. I want to make it clear that the movements of the objects were very jurky which was very strange, as if they would fly 20 feet, then stop for a fraction of a second, a bit like watching a video which was not fully buffered. As the objects approached the ground they got within 100 feet of the ground but then accelerated upwards at a 90 degree angle back into the clouds at a speed of 400mph.  Both my inlaws witnessed this and so do two elderly women who stopped their car at the end of our street.  About 5 minutes after this 1 helicopter left in a south easterly direction.10 minutes after this both remaining helicopters left steight south.  These two helicopters flew about 600 ft over some housing and US ARMY could clearly be seen on the side of the Helicopters. One thing I did notice about them which I thought was strange was that there seemed to be a lampshade like object hanging from the bottom of these helicopters which omitted a yellow light every 4-5 seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as a medical professional.

The reason for this is because there is a municipal airport runway behind our building that is used for sky jumping. So as we where looking for jumpers we saw an object that the first witness thought was a balloon. The object was moving horizontal in a westerly direction, too fast and straight for a balloon, then slowed down to a complete stop where the other two witnesses noticed that it was spinning (this is how we could see the shape was oval because it looked like and egg spinning on the counter). Then it just slowly ascended into the sky where it vanished from view.

Upon loading pictures into laptop, picture frame number 2389 revealed six spherical objects in a definite formation: 2-white spheres (one brightly lit sphere above a dimmer sphere) - 1 red sphere, 2-white spheres, then 1 red sphere.  All were perfectly aligned and distanced. Reviewing the enlarged image, the red spheres appear to have 2 red objects or lights attached. The 2-white spheres bypassed the other spheres, taking the lead.  All spheres and flight paths were captured in the image.  Photo frames 2388 and 2390 did not contain the spheres which means they had to appear/disappear within 2 minutes. Since on the Eastern U.S. at 22:35, the spheres unlikely to have been related to the Pacific shooting down of the spy satellite -- spheres traveling in opposite  direction -- satellite was shot down at 22:30 Pacific time, not Eastern. Only one missile used -- 6 spheres shown.  One speculation it could be satellite remnants re-entering atmosphere but unlikely due to the exact alignment, precision of distance between objects, and mere number of objects. Other possibility would be meteors but precisioning of objects and containing white as well as red spheres may rule that out.

It seemed to have been in close proximity above my house (based on the sound).  The sound which woke me from sleep was VERY loud and VERY deep...it was nearly deafening!  Once I had been woken, it lasted for probably 8 to 10 seconds.  I can&apos;t say how long it had been there since I had previously been asleep.  But then, it departed FAST!  It was so fast that within a second, all noise was completely gone!  The sound changed and you could tell it became very distant VERY fast (and sounded almost as if it had sucked the atmosphere as it departed, if that makes sense). Whatever it was, was way faster than any plane I had ever heard!  I was afraid to go outside at first (this thing was seriously loud, it had shaken me up!), but after a few minutes (after having heard it depart at such an astronomical speed) I went out to look in the sky and saw nothing and no trace.  There was a full cover of very white clouds in the sky though (which was weird being it was at night, and that they were so bright) but none of them seemed to be disturbed. There is supposed to be a military facility that deals in top secret aircraft outside of Rockwall Texas (away from Mesquite).  My guess is, it was probably a very VERY fast military craft (faster than ANYTHING made public).  I guess that the sightings in Stephensville, TX may also be accounted for by whatever inventions are going on outside of Rockwall. I just thought I&apos;d share this.

The object(s) went from East to West at a high rate of speed. There did seem to be a smoke trail from each of the lights. As the lights flew off into the western horizon they both disappeared. I have tried rationalizing what I saw, but with no results other than it was very high up, and if it was one object with two lights then it must have been massive. Too big to be a jet due to its altitude and size that I observed.

One light seemed to travel ahead of the other light, then all of the sudden they seemed to be traveling together, then one light would lag behind and the other would travel up and then down quickly.  I can see the planes turning near the mountain preserves on approach to Sky Harbor, and I judged that the lights were approximately at an altitude of 8000 feet and about 20 miles from where I live.  The strange thing about the sighting was the irrational travel of the lights, and the speed at which they were traveling.  At times, it was as if they were not moving at all.", "circular UFO( bell hat shape ) seen on hwy 580 castro valley, CA  8:10 pm in front of full moon.Last night was a full moon rising over castro valley east bay, CA, the sky was clear of clouds around the moon, driving up on hwy 580 , as you drive down the 580 from castro valley into livermoore valley was an incredible view.

My backyard was high, faced east and had an unobstructed 180 degree view being forty feet higher than the rooftops to the east.  Thunder storms were developing and cumulous clouds were building. As I enjoyed the view, I noticed a dark spot in the sky over the south end of &quot;Sunrise&quot; Mountain to the NE of Henderson.  Facing east, the object appeared to be at 11 o&rsquo;clock.  It was against blue sky in a large break between the clouds and it was stationary.  It was roughly above the flight path along Charleston Street that helicopters use for McCarran Airport.  They travel a a couple thousand feet.  This was much higher than that. To the naked eye it appeared to be large and round.  My first thought was that it might be a helium balloon, but logic told me it was in the wrong place for that, the wrong time of day, and the wrong sort of weather.  The south end of Sunrise Mountain is about five or six miles from my house.  I estimated the altitude of the thing to about 10,000 feet more or less. I stepped into the house and retrieved binoculars.  The object had not moved.  When I focused on the object I saw it was actually three round shapes fairly close together.  A large round plate was partially hiding another slightly smaller plate behind it at about one o&rsquo;clock to the first, and a third round plate, appearing smaller yet, at about 2 o&rsquo;clock to the biggest one.  The relative sizes gave the impression of three objects each at a slightly increasing distances and slightly different altitudes.  They appeared to be dull metallic silver. There were no lights on the objects. I watched for about a minute, maybe less, and then, through the binoculars I saw all three objects &ldquo;keel over&rdquo; in unison by about 90 degrees at which point they appeared thin and flat. I called my wife and son and, with a second pair of binoculars, tried to help them spot the objects.  However, they wear glasses, are not used to spotting small objects, etc and they never saw them.  In between trying to help my family to see them too, I watched for another couple of minutes.  Finally, the clouds intervened and hid whatever they were from further view. My house was about as half mile South of the flight path into McCarran Airport. Commercial aircraft continued to land during this time, basically following Sunset Rd into the airport with landing lights on below about three thousand feet.  They and are a common sight.  This was not a helicopter or an airplane or a harrier jump jet, etc.  All three objects were clearly visible and I have no explanation for what they could have been.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At about 1:30 am an object came into view.  If I hadn&apos;t been looking straight up, I never would have seen it.  It blocked out the stars as it flew overhead, but it was not lit up.  It made absolutely no sound.  I&apos;m not sure just how large it was because I don&apos;t know how high it was flying but I could see it well enough to see detail on it. It was as big as a plane would be if it were flying quite low, as if it were going to land soon. I could tell it was metallic because it was reflecting the lights from the city. It was a perfect triangle with rounded corners. It had a circle on each corner as if they were lights, but as I said it was not lit up when I saw it. There was also a circle directly in the middle of the triangle. I froze when I saw it. I watched it fly from east to west until it was no longer in sight. It did not fly very fast, about the same as an airplane, but it was no airplane I&apos;ve ever seen before. I guess it could have been a secret government craft, but I know it was not like the Stealth or anything like that. It was obvious that it didn&apos;t want to be seen.

Passenger side of the car was facing our house and drivers side facing across the street toward the neighbors. I exited the car on the driver&rsquo;s side and something caught my eye at almost star level, very high in the sky. I saw three extrememly bright amber lights,first in a straight line formation, stacked on top of each other. The objects hovered around each other, moving as I describe in &ldquo;slow motion&rdquo;. They 3 lights floated out of the stacked line formation and made a circle type formation, then back into a slightly curved line. There was no noise coming from the objects at all. This was nothing like I had ever seen before. The objects or object didn&rsquo;t move like any airplanes or helicopter that I have seen. The silence and &ldquo;slow motion&rdquo; movement  looked extremely fluid and bizarre. The objects were completely stationary in between these intervals of formation for seconds at a time.

She instantly was taken aback by the strange lights and told me to run in inside and grab the video camera. The objects were seen by us for about a minute or two before I got the camera and returned. There is where the video begins. The lights were stationary ,extremely bright and slowly went back into a straight line or up and down formation.

I even called a friend on the phone who lives a few doors down, but he didn&apos;t hear anything because of the volume of his TV. I have heard something exactly like this several times before over the years in the Santa Clara Valley, and surmised that it could have been the NASA Ames wind tunnel that was producing it. That&apos;s what I had read in the newspaper and saw reported on TV previously when I had heard this same kind of sound in years past. Also, there is/was? a rocket motor test facility south of San Jose that could also be capable of producing this same kind of noise.

The light quickly disappeared, and then came back shining even brighter with two, albeit much dimmer lights above it,  altogether forming a triangle of three white lights. It was incredibly foggy out and almost impossible to see anything clearly 20 feet ahead of you, so it could not be determined if the lights were on the body of a ship or craft. The lights stayed in our vision hovering over the water for almost ten minutes, at a time appearing to move closer to us. The reflection of the lights could be seen in the water, so it was apparently very close to the lake. The lights began to slowly fade, and then came back bright for an instant. Immediately afterwards right by the white lights two smaller bright red lights flashed, out of no where, disappeared, and then everything was gone. Also the whole incident was completely silent and no noise from the craft or anywhere else for that matter could be heard.

One of the pieces was flaming and going to the ground and looked so close you were almost expecting to see some sort of impact secondary explosion of some sort. The rest of the pieces almost seemed to disappear before going below the telephone lines and houses across the street and out of view. My son spotted this on 1-28-08 in the evening sky almost dark at 6:00 to 6:15 PM. He ran inside telling me to look at these huge strange lights in the sky so I slipped my shoes on and immediately went out to see it and called my wife out to see it and we were all stunned. The event lasted for approximately 4 or 5 minutes. We immediately turned on the news and flipped through the local channels looking for something but nothing on the news. We turned on the news radio expecting to hear something but there was nothing. I called 911 and reported it to the local police who said they had 1 call preceding mine and that 2 of their officers were on the radio reporting having seen the same thing. We wanted to make sure it was not the Shuttle but looked up on line and it appears the shuttle is still on earth. We searched all local and other news on the web and found nothing. Continued to watch our news and nothing but reports of the dead spy satellite that was due to crash into earth in the next month. That story broke exactly 2 hours before we saw this. The next day nothing in the news or the papers nothing on the web. This seems odd to me. I am guessing it was a satellite breaking up and maybe these were large solar panels but they must have been huge. I am not sure if anyone reading this can estimate size and distance but they appeared to be about an inch or so long in a photograph when entering the atmosphere above telephone lines across the street from my house so looking up about 50 feet in the south west sky.  I estimate they must have been much larger than a jumbo jet. They were so large all I could think of was the international space station having some problem.

I pulled my car over immediately and excitedly scanned the sky for the object and noticed an aircraft coming from the east traveling directly towards the place in the sky the ufo was.It appeared to be large jumbo jet type of craft and it was very dark colored (black, or possibly camoflage), which is unusual because every jumbo jet I&apos;ve seen in the sky has apperead to be silver or white.This jet slowly proceeded to the area of sky were the object was , I watched for a few minutes then continued to work.I grew up in a city with an airport and have plenty experience watching the skies and am very familar with the appearance of conventional craft in flight.", "SAW SPHERE OF GOLDEN LIGHT FLOATING  SILENTLY FROM EAST TO WESTFriday night I got up at 1:30am to let the dogs out. The snow is pretty deep and I was facing the woods. I see a sphere of light floating about 6 feet off the ground, about 32 yards away floating smoothly east to west without bobbing and in a straight line. It was silent. I could clearly see there was no person there, only this golden light. If someone was there with a light I would&apos;ve seen him or her that close in the bright snow. There was no traffic or reflection, it was glowing a golden color and a little smaller than a basketball size. It was a little bright than a truck headlight. It moved faster than a person could walk. I walked to the exact spot where it was and there was no tracks at all in the snow. There was a very strong odor in the air, like a natural gas well was left uncapped, but the nearest gas well was capped and buried years ago and I never smelled a gas odor since it was capped. We don&apos;t have any natural gas for heat, only electric. It was so strong I lost my breath and had to go back inside quickly. The dogs had no reaction whatsoever, they did their business and came back in without barking. The next day the gas odor was gone and there still were no tracks in the snow where I saw the light. The woods are too dense in that area for a person to walk through so only rabbits and birds can go through it.

They were traveling to my best observation much lower than what you would see during the day when trails can be seen by an airplane and much faster.They were not blinking and moving very fast. Observation  from beginning to end would be approximately 7 to 8 seconds. There was no noise whatsoever, and the lights were not one right behind the other. They were at a distance of approximately 5 degrees and one behind the lead light was to the right offset to about 2 degrees.I immediately went online and called to give report and was instructed to give details here.I am 35 years old and an avid sky watcher for years and this is the first time in my life that I was prompted to call because I truly did not recognize this from anything I have ever witnessed before.Thank You..", "large formation of lightsIt is been long since i saw it as a kid right now I am in USA. during hot summer months, I along with my family used to sleep on the building roof top (In India houses or built of concrete)to escape the heat we were arranging bedding on the roof top.that day the weather was cloudy and windy, at first I saw a small group of lights the size of a football and shape of a American football came out through the clouds moved slowly in circle and disappeared, I just did not care  and continued doing what I was doing then after sometime this same object became bigger than before made a circle and disappeared after sometime it became much much bigger almost covering my house and this time went over my house and went straight after it passed my house, it appeared as if it is going to land then suddenly wanished ,I waited the whole night but it didn&apos;t come again i asked other neighbours if they had seen it and they said they too saw it but some reason no one cared about it.  I could see the space between the lights all the lights were equally spaced they looked like the lit windows on a airplane and they are arranged in two rows there are no lights on the belly only on the sides.

Thinking it was a storm that had blown in I looked outside as tornados were known to strike the Ohio valley. The time was twilight and early fall in the year 1958. The leaves were still on the trees. I looked out the back window which afforded a view from 90 degrees up to 30 degrees to the next hill which was 600 feet away. The trees were being blown downward. Our house was located just over a hill on Ray street in Ashland, Kentucky. A sustained downdraft was something that I had never seen. Prior to this event the air had been still. It wasn&apos;t cold enough for a fire. Looking up I saw the leading edge of a near object. By near I mean that there was no way to determine just how high except that it was close to the ground. As a minimum it had to be higher than the average terrain. Three hundred feet might be a good estimate. The direction of motion was north to south. The leading edge was a wide curve, the left edge did not block the horizon. It was only lit from above since it was twilight so the details on the underside could not be seen. Being a child at the time I yelled for my mother. She saw the receding edge of the object. It simply passed over at a constant speed. The axis of motion was east by at least 500 feet. The trailing edge going out of sight It had a thickness but that was seen only for an instant as the viewing angle decreased. Wind was not blowing in my face as I did not have to squint nor was wind blowing into the window. So how could you have a noise of wind without me being in the blast? On the passage of the object all wind effects ceased. Here is what was missing, no turbine whine, no motor noise, no fuel smell, no nothing. Silent and dark except for the trees being lashed downward. However the force downward was not sufficient to break off the limbs which sets the maximum force to less than that necessary to break off mature poplar tree limbs. That was about the weakest trees there other than apple perhaps. So from ! the heig ht and transit information and a good guess that it was 300 yards across you should be able to decide on a weight of the object since it was balanced by a constant downward force. I didn&apos;t notice any change in the downward force from edge to edge. Normal force from propulsion is concentrated at the center falling off to the edges. Or it is high at the edge and still in the center riding on a bubble o higher air pressure.I feel like someone who has seen something but can only say canoe in the sky. Not enough information. An object like that was part of the air force experiments at that time and Wright Patterson AFB is nearby. However circular aircraft were not that big. It is not possible to move that much air and not have some kind of audible infrasound. That was fifty years ago. My mothers story changed with time. My brother and his friends said they saw three moving back and forth over the Ohio river moving east. I really didn&apos;t believe him at the time. He didn&apos;t mention his experience until we told the beginning of ours. My memory is accurate from that time. What has faded a little are the visual memories. Conclusions? You can&apos;t say what it was. Only that it was. You can&apos;t extrapolate the origin. Consider a bright flash in the sky that rivals the sun. What could it be? An exploding meteor, a collapsing magnetic star, an unknown massive high energy particle, a tiny black hole, something we might not understand for hundreds of years, a blood vessel pressing on nerves in the eye. It is not always an explanation that fits our experience. What did we see in 1958? An object that changed position with time. An object that was opaque and had mass. An object that balanced its mass with a uniform downward force. The downward force ended rapidly with the passage of the object and that the ending of the downward force was not abrupt. The object was close enough that the entire object was never seen in its entirity. The front edge had passed from view before the back passed from view. I wish there was more. It is only by comparison with future discoveries that might give meaning to the event.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I thought it was a small airplane with its landing light on. I would estimate it was 1000-2000 feet in the air and the light was bright orange like that of a city street light. I thought the color was a bit odd for an airplane and I watched it come closer listening for the sound of its engine. I did not hear any sound and it seemed to gain a little altitude. It then slowed to a stop almost overhead and then I thought this can&rsquo;t be a normal aircraft. I watched it not wanting to miss anything that it might do but I also wanted to film it. I ran to the house to get my video camera and filmed it from our deck. About that time it started to head due south and was the size of a large star.

It had a &quot;tail&quot; of flame trailing it. As she was watching it, another &quot;object&quot; appeared directly behind it, looking identical to the first. While watching them, she said they both suddenly disappeared, then within seconds reappeared, disappeared again, and then reappeared.

I walked back down the street and glanced back up at the sky at the base of the driveway. Still, only those few stars and the moon were out. I walked about 5 steps up my driveway, taking about 6 seconds to do so, and I happened to glance back up. Out of nowhere, a jet stream-like cloud (?) had appeared and the sky had opened up to reveal 20-30 more stars, including the full constellation of Orion. The whole sky had seemingly opened up with light from the moon (which seemed much brighter for some reason). The line passed across the sky horizontally, slightly curved and bended in some places, but tightly packed and not dispersing. I quickly realized that it was moving to the left, and it was moving quite quickly. I saw that the band of cloud was below Orion&rsquo;s belt and moving slightly upwards as it continued to move to the left.  Within another minute or so, it was directly on the belt, and not more than a minute or two later, it was above the entire constellation, and still moving fast, not at all like anything I&rsquo;d ever seen before. On the right, I could see the end of it clearly now, which was dispersing slightly. Looking to the left, I could see that it went on for some while in a solid line, bending here and there, but remaining entirely and completely tight and not spreading out or fading away like a normal jet stream would. I continued to watch it for another minute and tried to get a picture, but it didn&rsquo;t come out, even with the use of a very strong flash. I saw that the line was starting to look a bit fuzzier than when I&rsquo;d first glimpsed it, and the end of the line had passed over the house now, leaving all those bright glittering stars as the only things in the sky directly above my house. I walked out into the street for a better view and saw in the distance that the line was very fuzzy now, but somehow still remaining in a distinct squiggly fas! hion, li ke it&rsquo;d only been blurred, not smudged or erased. I ran inside and tried to look out the back balcony and see if the cloud (or whatever it was) was still moving in the same direction.

I do not specifically recall the year, I know within a 3 year range, but could not possibly ever recall the exact date because neither my friend nor I made a record of the observation. My friend and I were contemplating leave the tent because the air was getting cold as the evening progressed. We unzipped tent entrance which faced to the East. I poked my head out and immediately noticed the apparent lights which couldn&apos;t have been anything produced by human beings. Without moving, I told my friend to poke his head out to observe the site and he saw the exact same thing as I did. We noticed lights in a &quot;V&quot; shape with the point being closest to us. Since this at night, it&apos;s impossible to judge both the distance above the ground and distance of the lights/craft but they &quot;appeared&quot; to be within 2 miles of the surface and over 1/2 of a mile in length. These lights were blue in color. I believe there were either 7 or 9 lights, I do not recall, but they were in a perfect &quot;V&quot; shape. The lights were shining down towards the surface, with the closest one almost directly above us, but they didn&apos;t light up whatever they were attached to. These could have been separate crafts in a perfect &quot;V&quot; shape or just one craft with all the lights on them, but you couldn&apos;t see above the lights. The front of the &quot;V&quot; was pointing towards the North. The rear of the lights stretched far away from the front. The lights appeared to be perfectly spaced out from one another with thousands of feet in between them. Thousands of feet is more-than-likely an understatement, but again it would be impossible to tell in the dark, especially with it being up in the sky at an undermined altitude. There was absolutely no sound coming from the light sources and no movement either. They appeared to hover in place throughout the entire duration of the siting. We were both afraid we had been spotted and didn&apos;t know if it were possible for us to be harmed so we didn&apos;t run, move, or anything except quietly whisper on infrequent occasion. I believe 10 minutes had passed before we felt safe enough to duck inside the tent. We discussed what we had seen to make sure our stories were identical and not fictitious. We both agreed going into my parents&apos; house was the best decision because staying in the tent wouldn&apos;t give us the safety we felt we needed. At this time, we were unsure if we were going to be abducted, left alone, or have any other insane experience because seeing the UFO was astonishing, so at this point, we felt anything was now a possibility. After 5 minutes of discussion, we grabbed our pillows and looked out again prior to making a dash for the house. We slowly poked our heads out and were both amazed to notice the lights were not there, or not on, one of two cases. I didn&apos;t think they could have been off, my assumption was they had vanished, but I suppose they could have just been off. The thought never entered my mind until typing this recount of the events. No sound was ever heard and the massive array of lights were not seen again. We ran into the house and told my parents about it. They didn&apos;t doubt we believed what we saw, however, they had never seen anything like what we described and didn&apos;t know if any possible explanation was possible other than a UFO.

Last night while on my porch just after midnight I noticed an object that was more spherical than a plane would appear and significantly larger -- I would estimate about 5 to 6 times greater in size than an airplane would be at that distance.  I watched it for about five minutes and it did not move, nor did it become larger or smaller as a plane would have had it been moving.  It was spherical, gradually changed from white to yellow (much unlike the flashing of airplane lights) and emitted and aura and lights in hues of red, yellow-orange, white and occasionally blue around its periphery.  It appeared to emit an occasional small beam of white light, though not in any discernible pattern or consistent direction.  The best way to explain the emitting colors would be to compare it to a child&apos;s sparkler on the fourth of July.  This craft/light was silent, which again is quite unlike any airplane I am accustomed to seeing, particularly on nights as quiet and still as last night was.  After approximately five minutes, possibly a bit less, the light simply went out and I was unable to see it.  There was nothing obstructing my view of it so it is impossible that its view was obscured by a tree or structure.  The sky was clear and nearly cloudless (I could see many stars) so it&apos;s not possible that it went behind a cloud, either.  I came out several more times over the next two hours, camera in hand, but it did not reappear.  Unfortunately my husband was already sleeping so did not witness it with me.  I am quite curious to see if anyone else has reported seeing similar stationary lights in Portland recently.", "Several round orange-yellow glowing objects over western end of Panama City, FL beachMy family and I were vacationing at the western-most end of Panama City the night of July 21, 2007.  It was around 9:00 pm and we had just finished having dinner on the balcony of our 15th floor condo.  My husband took our two kids (ages 9 &amp; 14) to walk on the beach.  I remained on the balcony, speaking to my mother on the telephone. I sat on the balcony looking directly out at the ocean and sky.  It was dark, but the surface of the water and the sky were very discernable.  It was easy to make out where one ended and the other began.  As I looked out, I noticed a large, round. orange-yellow glowing object appear in the sky.  Over the next few minutes, four others just like it also appeared.  The objects would glow and disappear on and off for several minutes to follow.  Three other objects, exactly the same size and shape as the original five, appeared off to the right in a triangle pattern shortly after.  In a span of approximately thirty minutes, several objects appeared in the sky and never moved.  The only change in their appearance or position was that they glowed on and off at different intervals. As this was happening, I told my mother that I thought I was seeing UFOs.  She laughed until I told her that I was absolutely serious.  At that time my husband and kids came rushing back into the condo asking if I had seen the strange light in the sky.  We watched the sky for many hours that night, and every night for the remainder of our vacation.  We saw nothing more of the strange lights. Until the night of July 21st, I absolutely did NOT believe in UFOs.  I thought anyone who claimed to believe in such things was a nut.  I still don&rsquo;t believe that there are little green men flying around our atmosphere, but I do know that my family and I saw something that cannot be explained by anything we have ever seen before.  They were not planes &ndash; they never moved.  They were not helicopters -- they were much larger and perfectly round.  They were not fireworks.  They glowed on and off in the sky and then vanished. Two other strange events happened in connection with our sighting.  First, when we awoke the next morning, we immediately searched the news stations for reports of the strange light, because we were certain that someone else HAD to have seen what we saw.  We could find nothing on television, so I checked the Internet.  On The Drudge Report there was a story about a UFO sighting in England &ndash; with pictures.  The photos were exactly what we had seen several hours later in Panama City, FL. After I had read all of the articles that I could find regarding the strange event in England, I came upon this site and one other where I could post information regarding our sighting.  I filled out the required information and uploaded my account.

However the image in my mind is as clear now as I saw it then.  There was a orange ball (quarter the size of moon and colour of a orange street lamp) at the northern sky, a little above pole star, moving from the western to eastern sky.I assume it must have come from western side of the sky, though we spotted only from its mid point, that is from the pole star position. Its movement towards the east was steady and it took a minute to move to the end of the horizon from the pole star position.It must have be around at a height of a high flying aircraft. Also seen by my mom, dad and brother and few friends, I felt (as well as other said) that it did not look like an aeroplane, helicopter, distant satelites or any of the heavenly / man made objects.It was definitely not a shooting star either since the movement was too slow to be one. Our thoughts on UFO were reconfirmed when we saw a news beoing reported on quote a lot of people having spotted an UFO in the newspaper &quot;Nagpur Times&quot;, the next day. Even until today, I am unable to relate what I saw to any man made or heavenly object in the sky despite my continous attempts to identify it with one.((NUFORC Note:  I have assigned an artificial date above.

I first saw it and thought it was made by my friend moving his trailer around in the back yard. As I paid closer attention I noticed that it was a perfect circle (it appeared to me) and not only one circle indentation in the ground but several smaller circles inside of it. My father in law brought his big diesel truck in the back yard and did not leave any tracks or impressions that lasted as long as this circular pattern has. It is about 80 to 100 feet across and I have documented it on video because it is so weird how it got there and there are no tracks that leave the pattern. I am not a ufo freak but this is not something that you see every day. I am contacting you guys because  the pattern is still there even after the rain and me cutting the grass over it.

I was a skeptic of UFO&rsquo;s and extra terrestrials for a long time. Then around 10 pm on December 21 2007 I saw something and experienced something that would change my beliefs forever. I was sitting on my couch talking to my boyfriend and petting my cat when the hair on the back of my neck stood up and my cat suddenly flipped out. Then something suddenly told me to look up and out the window. I looked and I saw a large triangle shaped object with red lights on it.  I saw it for what seemed like only a few seconds and then it disappeared right in front of my eyes as if it had disappeared into another dimension.  The red lights around the object where bright but the big red light in the center was as bright as a star. It was unlike anything I have ever seen and I know that it was not of this world.  I told my boyfriend who is a big UFO believer what had happened and what I had felt.  He knew that I did not know anything about UFO sightings and he said I described exactly what others had felt. I am now a believer and I am convinced that what I saw was a UFO.  I some how felt that they wanted me to see them because they knew I was such a skeptic.

This was around 1978 or 1979. I had walked home every day since the 2nd grade. It was between 2:30 and 3pm. I was walking on the sidewalk against the traffic. It was a 4-lane with a median. I was one block from my home when I looked across the street ahead of me and saw a strange small object hovering above that sidewalk about 15-20 feet up. From that point on I did not take my eyes off of it but I did try to see if there was a string on it or if it was being controlled from someone on the ground. This was a residential neighborhood and there was little to no traffic at this time. Or if there was, I do not remember, I was so fixated by this object. I continued to watch it, walking slowly as it just hovered there.  Suddenly it seemed to &quot;notice&quot; me and it made a direct bee-line across the street toward me. As I write this I am getting chills upon chills just recalling this. It didn&rsquo;t move fast nor slow but just steadily in a very straight line at the same altitude. Soon it was right over my head maybe 10 feet above me and following me exactly as a continued to walk. I was not afraid but extremely intrigued. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what it was! It was a small very colorful disk. It was slightly tilted, with a small cylindrical &quot;handle&quot; going through the center.  If I can remember, I believe the handle was red.  It looked kind of like a toy but it baffled me because it was spinning and it was silent and there was nothing attached to it. I couldn&rsquo;t understand how it could be suspended up there, and at that time, I was not aware of any remote controls like THIS.  It hovered over me spinning quietly until I reached the end of the block and stepped off into the street, then it immediately went back across the street.  I still continued to watch it, looking back until I got to my house.  AT that point, I felt afraid and went into the house, locked the doors and called my mom at work as a watched out the kitchen windo w trying to spot it.  I didn&rsquo;t have a good view.  I never saw it again.I was not particularly aware of UFOs. Our family was not into that. So it didn&rsquo;t occur to me that this could be a UFO.  I drew a picture of it for my mom and dad and my mom wrote down what I said and we kept that.  But I have never forgotten anyway. From that day on, I always tried to find an explanation for such an object.  I looked at kites and remote controls or whatever I could find to explain it.  I never could.  Then when I saw a toy or colorful kite that reminded me of it, I would feel a sense of panic. To this day I still have not found a plausible explanation for it. There were no other witnesses.This is the first time I have reported it.  I am 40 years old.  Watching a UFO special on Discovery Channel this afternoon prompted me to report this finally!

Object caught my attention due to it&apos;s lack of motion. I assumed it was a tethered balloon, but given the variable wind conditions along the coast, from the west around 7 to 12 knots, I would have expected some wobbling or  other motion from a tethered balloon. I was facing west and the object was about 80&deg; up from my vantage point. I observed it for about 5 to 10 minutes. I never saw any buffeting you&apos;d expect with having a tethered balloon and variable wind conditions. Size was about a pea at arms distance. Having a tethered object of any kind in that area would be at the very least reckless as it&apos;s common for low flying air craft such as helicopters and ad banner planes to fly through the area. That location is about 2 miles WNW up the coast from the very busy Santa Monica airport and it&apos;s common for aircraft to traverse at or below 500 feet going up or down the coast over the ocean to pass the western part of the airport departure route (typically runway 21). I ran out of time and had to leave the area. Always been a curiosity. Haven&apos;t seen any thing similar at that location, but I did see a similar object about 2 months ago, 2 miles inland. I observed it through my 10x80 binoculars. It was partially obscured by some clouds. Probably less than 20 seconds of observation time.

My mother, grandmother, brother and myself were going to go shopping at Zody&apos;s in the Canoga Park area of CA. Zody&apos;s is no longer around but the location at that time was at the corner of Topanga Canyon Blvd and Roscoe Blvd. The sun was setting so it was still fairly light but getting dark quickly. After we parked and were heading to the entrance of Zody&apos;s, my brother and I were lagging behind my mother and grandmother. I then realized that my brother was not beside me and so I thought he stopped to tie his shoe so I stopped and turned around and that is when I saw the lights flashing. My brother was looking at it too. The craft was a disk shape, appeared to be made of metal and had white lights around the perimeter that flashed in sequence and gave it the illusion that it was spinning but it was close enough and still light enough outside to see the underside of the craft and I could tell that it was not spinning. It hovered completely still and made no noise at all. I watched it for about 10 seconds and then realized that mom and grandma may have already gone in the store and I didn&apos;t want them to miss out on seeing this. I turned and looked towards the entrance to the store and saw that mom and grandma were also watching the craft as were a bunch of people who were either on their way into the store or had just come out. I don&apos;t know the size of the craft because I don&apos;t know how close it was and I don&apos;t know the altitude because I don&apos;t know it&apos;s size. From my perspective it was the size of a dinner plate held at arms length. After watching the craft for about a minute it suddenly began to move to the right without changing altitude. Then it slowed to a stop and just as it came to a stop it suddenly shot straight up and was gone in only about 2-3 seconds. The entire experience lasted approximately one minute. By the time it took off it was dark enough to see the stars. We stayed there and watc! hed the sky for a little while thinking it might come back but it didn&apos;t, at least not while we were out there. My family acted different after that. They were more quiet than usual and I kept wanting to talk about it and I&apos;d say, &quot;Wasn&apos;t that strange? What was it that we saw?&quot; but nobody said anything. It seemed like we should have had more time to shop but it didn&rsquo;t feel like we were in the store very long when they were announcing they were closing and that we&rsquo;d have to bring our purchases to the front. I don&rsquo;t know if this was an indication of missing time or not. After we did our shopping, on the way home I still couldn&apos;t get anyone to say anything. It was as though my family were in a trans-like state, except me. It wasn&apos;t until we got home and we were getting our purchases out of the back of the car that my mother started saying, &quot;What was that thing we saw? Wasn&apos;t that strange?&quot; There were many witnesses but I don&apos;t know if any of them reported it at that time or since then. We didn&apos;t report it at that time..((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There was a large fenced pasture behind and adjacent to our property, with a tree-lined driveway leading toward and then turning to parallel this pasture. I went out of my front door and rounded the corner of the house facing the pasture and didn&apos;t see anything.  I saw the dogs sitting side by side and barking in the direction of the pasture.  I walked closer and past the dogs (who did not move forward with me).  I thought it odd that the dogs did not come with me to investigate.  When I had moved a few steps closer to the pasture, I saw a large orange light that seemed to be slowly rotating the circumference of an object.  The object itself, I could not see againt the night sky.  The light seemed to move from right to left, disappear momentarily as if on the back side of the object, and re-emerge on the right again.  I also noticed that the object itself seemed to be silently moving in a forward, downward and zig-zagging motion (closer to my property).  I ran back into the house and locked the doors.  I called my husband who was bowling with friends, and he scoffed as I explained what I had seen.  I was terrified, and realizing he wasn&apos;t going to come home immediately as I had hoped, I instead called a friend long distance, and stayed on the phone with her for well over an hour until he did arrive home.  I did not report the sighting to any authorities for fear of ridicule.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Landing of a 3 lighted fairly large craft with pulsing red to amber lights. No sound at all.I wasn&apos;t going to report this until I saw that someone else from this exact same city experienced something similar just two months ago. So, I decided to also write a report since there must obviously be something going on here that is unexplained and I would like answers. Earlier this morning (Sunday Jan. 20th, 2008) at approximately 5:58 AM I decided to look out of my front door to see if the ground was covered with ice (we had a lot of rain last evening and freezing temperatures overnight), and as I was looking out the front door I noticed something completely strange to my left. It was floating above the tree line across from a field approximately 1/2 mile from my front door. The lights were pulsating from red to orange (similar to flames from a forest fire) as this thing or craft was slowly receding behind the tree line behing the open field. It seemed to have three large lights from the side I was seeing. And judging from the neighbors house down the road and the distance this craft was from their home and ours, it had to be atleast the size 4 or 5 homes combined, possibly even larger. A truly amazing site and a camera was the last thing on my mind. Anyway, I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing, so I went to wake my wife up to verify what I was seeing. She quickly awoke when I told her that she had to see something that was going to blow her mind. I was hoping this thing wouldn&apos;t be gone before we made it back to the front door. When we both got to the front door it was still there and was now half way down behind the tree line. My wife said &quot; oh my God, what is that?&quot;. We both looked at it in awe as it descended behind the trees and seemed to have landed.The area it seemed to have landed in is near a creek in a swampy area. In a place people wouldn&apos;t normally go or have good access to. All I could think is why would someone or something be landing there. My wife and I stared in the direction for nearly an hour to see if it was going to fly away. She described it as being similar to the sun going down behind the trees due to the brightness it displayed and the red and orange colors, But this definitely wasn&apos;t the sun, it was only 5:58 AM and was in the north west during the dark of night. She was only able to see the top half of the object and the lights as it was already landing as I awoke her. We both couldn&apos;t believe what we had just seen. This definitely was like nothing I had ever seen, especially this close to our own home. I must mention that I am prior military (U.S. Army Veteran) and I am very observant and have an IQ of 138. This definitely didn&apos;t seem like any modern day aircraft that our military would have and even if it were, why would they land in the middle of the swampy creek area here at 5:58 AM on a Sunday morning?  As far as the shape of the craft, it seemed to be an oval shape and had no sound at all as we stepped out of the front door to listen as it was landing. Another thing that was real odd was that this is in a suburban neighborhood with lots of yard animals and none of the dogs were barking at all and the air was dead silent. As big as the object was and as bright as the lights were, we were expecting to at least hear the neighborhood dogs barking, but none were. After waiting on the front porch of our home for close to an hour with blankets to keep warm, we finaly decided to go back into the house. We were hoping this craft would come back up from the wooded area and would show itself once again while leaving, but it never did. And no, I don&apos;t plan on going in that area of the woods and swamp to see it close up either. I will be keeping a guarded eye on that area for the next few nights and even months to see if anything else happens there. All I can say about all this is that we&apos;re definitely not alone and these things are making themselves known. I&apos;m just wondering why they aren&apos;t trying to communicate more clearly if they are superior life forces. It almost feels as though we are like the ants living in the ant farm and they just observe us when they want to. A little food for thought there. Anyway, thanks for allowing me to vent about this here, because I surely can&apos;t tell me friends about this. I&apos;m not sure how they would take it.", "Large quiet craft,  moving at a very low altitude, heading east over Suffolk County, New York.During the fall of 1975, for some reason I can&apos;t remember the exact date, my daughter was coming home on the late bus from basketball practice so I went out on my front porch to watch her walk home from the bus stop. Our home was across the street from a cul-de-sac and this very large circular object approached our home from that direction.  My husband and son joined me and all witnessed this enormous, silent, craft with many lights on it&apos;s underside, slowly drift over us and proceed eastward. We didn&apos;t live far from the Islip McArthur Airport so after the craft passed over us I ran inside and called the F.A.A. and reported the sighting.

All the stories tallied.Captain Wood, 42, said he and the Tri-star crew made sighting reports when they arrived at London&rsquo;s Heathrow airport but kept it all a secret for fear of being ridiculed.  Captain Wood has come forward in the hope that Britain&rsquo;s ufo experts will turn a serious eye to this particular sighting.&quot;Suggestions that the three objects were balloons, stars or satellites, strange clouds or reflections are quite unacceptable to us,&quot; he said.  &quot;As I looked to the west we saw this very bright headlamp in the sky.

I went out side and noticed what looked to be a slow blinking light and assumed it was a radio tower. Then I realized  there was no radio towers in the direction I was looking,  I also realized the object was way to high for a radio tower.  It had the brightness of a white strobe, with the exception that it blinked on and off at a much slower rate, more of a fast fadeing glow on and off, at it&apos;s full size it was the size of a large house.The time was late afternoon, but still clear enough to see that there was nothing visible at all when the white light blinked or glowed off. It was staying in the same spot so I decided to run as close as I cloud to see it better, after about a mile I cloud see that there was a large grey cloud it was sitting in and as the object pulsed off and on I noticed a strange purple static energy that seemed to be directly around the object. Now things get interesting.....  As I&apos;m standing there I hear a loud roar and I look up and I&apos;m astonished to see a US Coast Guard Falcon jet flying as fast as It can right over my head and I mean right over me VERY low and hauling tail toward the object. I jumped and yelled &quot;yeah! go get&apos;em!&quot;  as astonished and excited as anyone cloud imagine. As the Falcon reached the object, the glowing object rapidly went out and was gone, the Falcon jet made a number of slower circles around where the object had been and then left the area in the opposite direction that it came from originally. If you didn&apos;t know the Coast Guard Falcon is more of a recon aircraft, it has no weapons, I&apos;m sure it was there to try and identify the object and attempt to get it to land if possible. Again this took place during the time period where there were no civilian aircraft flying due to the 9/11 no-flying restriction.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When it went back up it seemed to look like an egg with wings like that ball thing they play with on Harry Potter movies. I have seen many meteor showers. I have never seen one  return up!

Exhibited non-ballistic motion.I was working third shift at a machine shop in Jeffersonville, Indiana.  Being the supervisor, I had plenty of free time.  I would often step outside and have a cigarette, especially in the summer.   All the machines were running well, and the operators had settled in for another long night.  I walked outside and lit up a smoke, watching the U.P.S jets line up for approach into Louisville International Airport.  There were several jets in line for their approach, as well as a few others orbiting, waiting for their turn.  I can&rsquo;t remember the exact number, but I would estimate at least 10.I watched this for a few minutes, and lost interest.  I walked around the parking lot for a few minutes enjoying the night air.  When I noticed that all the jets were gone.  I know they didn&rsquo;t all have time to land.  I thought this was quite strange, and began scanning the skies.  I noticed a very bright, deep red colored, pulsating light.  This light was so bright, that it appeared to ray, like the bright landing lights on aircraft.  The only difference being the color.  And I say it pulsated not blinked, because it only dimmed, it never blinked off and on.  When I first saw it, it was in the sky to the northwest.  The color got my attention, but the erratic movement kept me interested.  It&rsquo;s the strangest thing I have ever seen.  As the object brightened it would move forward or backward, and as it dimmed it became stationary.  The timing between pulses was approximately 1 second.After watching this for at least a minute, it was slowly making it&rsquo;s way in my direction.  I had to get a second opinion on this, so I ran inside the shop and yelled for someone to come outside and see this light in the sky.  I ran back outside thinking it would be gone for sure, but it was still there.  And it was a lot closer than when I left.My brother, who was working for me at the time, came outside wondering what the hell I was talking about.  I didn&rsquo;t even have to point, he immediately saw the object and made a remark along the lines of, ((deleted)).  I asked him if he could hear anything, to which he replied that he couldn&rsquo;t.  This thing was nearly overhead and didn&rsquo;t make a sound.  He also noticed the way it would move as it pulsed brighter, and stop as it dimmed.  We both watched this thing for several more minutes, and I wanted to see if my father was awake.  He had a pretty good digital camera, and I hoped he could get a picture, so I ran back inside a second time to call him.  I finally got an answer, and I know I sounded a little excited over the phone.  Explaining what I had just witnessed took another minute or two.  On the way back outside this time, I was positive that this thing would not be there.  But, when I got to the parking lot, it was still there.  There were no other aircraft in the sky this entire time.  The light slowly made it&rsquo;s way almost directly over the building, when it suddenly released a round object from it&rsquo;s underside.  We both gasped at seeing this, it was unbelievable!  The round object that was released had no light, but the main object&rsquo;s bright light reflecting from it betrayed it&rsquo;s presence.  At this very instant both objects disappeared.  And no longer than 10 seconds after that, a military jet, (an F-4 Phantom I would guess by the twin engines) flew right through the same spot this object had just occupied.  It was loud, and he was definitely looking for the object, because he dipped his wings left and right.  The jet turned around and left in the same direction he came from.  We both watched the skies for 15 minutes, and noticed the jetliners starting to line up again.  I didn&rsquo;t know who to report this to, and I am convinced that, air traffic controllers caught this object on radar.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

There  was  approximately  15  to  20  of  them.   They  were  flying  easterly  and  were  almost  straight  overhead.    As  they  passed  by  i  noticed  that  the  sound  i  was  hearing  was  from  them.   The  sound  tracked  their  path.    After  they  passed  over,   they  all  of  a  sudden  made  a  right  turn  and  accelerated  straight  south  out  over the  ocean and  they  got  louder  as  they  left.    While  they  were  passing  overhead,  we  noticed  that  the  background  stars  went  right  through  them  without  blinking  off  and  on.    That&apos;s  how  i  knew  they  were  individual  objects.    When  i  say  they  made  a  right  turn,  what  i  mean  is,  they  made  a  right angle  or  square  turn  with  out  slowing  down.   In  fact,  they  immediately  accelerated  as  they  made  the  turn.    We  then  continued  on  our  way  to  the  phones  and  looked  up  the  Air  Force  in  the  phone  book.

I was standing on a train platform in San Jose California, I had just checked my radio controlled Casio wristwatch watch, it was 1:38 pm, when my coworker our engineer said hey look there, he was pointing up in the sky towards the east by south east. I looked where he was pointing, the sky was very clear there were a lot of clouds as we were having rain showers that day, which made the sky very clear and free of dust and pollutants. What I saw, at first glance, I and my coworker thought to be a weather balloon moving from east by south east towards north by north west in a straight line, moving at a high rate of speed. However, I quickly realized it was moving against the prevailing winds which were pushing the clouds in a northeasterly direction. The object I believe to be small about the size of a midsized compact car. The object appeared to have a shape similar to a light bulb. The front was round and it tapered to a small almost pointed tail. The object was brightly polished gold metallic in color as the front bulbous area reflected the sun as it moved away from us. The object was well above the clouds, its speed did not vary, and the object did not tumble or roll or vary its direction.We are just about one mile from the San Jose International Air Port. The jet planes that were crossing over at this time were moving much slower than the object. The object did not leave a trail behind it, neither was there a flame coming out its tail end, it did not have wings, and it did not have a tail that would control its movement. As the object was moving directly over us its bottoms color seemed to very in intensity like waves in a darker shade that moved from the front to the rear.

I  was just looking over your response (once again) to my photos taken on that August 7, 2004 night again and quite simply I disagree with your opinion/response as to your opinion of the source of these objects!  Please once again, closely examine for example pictures 4 &amp; 5. By the way my brother was looking through his binoculars while I was taking pictures, and my brother counted 7-9 object that we saw that were continuously changing orientation that evening.First notice there 5 lights in picture #5 (note you clearly state that the Aerostat aircraft has 3 strobes. Also notice throughout all the pictures that the objects vary dramatically in orientation from each other . . . not what your Aerostat aircraft is even capable of creating those formations of objects with the just 3 strobes onboard.Next closely examine #7 picture and the objects in that picture  below (zoomed in) &hellip;does that look like Aerostat strobes???   The lights formations (that constantly changed formation that evening) throughout the 15 minutes my brother watched them, were at a 12 o&rsquo;clock position straight up over the top of your Marfa concrete circular landing area that was lit up with your landing area lights that evening. Your Aerostat aircraft is simply not capable of creating the formations of objects in these photos (attached) documenting what my brother and I witnessed. Please respond with what you now think based on this eye witness account and please do not tell me (as you did before in your previous email) &ldquo;The Aerostat is equipped with three (3) high intensity Aircraft Strobes to warn General Aviation Aircraft in the vicinity, so that is what you most likely saw that morning.&rdquo;  (Ken) The numbers (of objects) and logic simply &ldquo;does not compute&rdquo;.Next you stated in your email that did not see any other objects or unusual lights around the Aerostat . . . . 1st  were you outside looking straight up at midnight that night?2nd there was a strong breeze that evening and even if the Aerostat was launched, you and I know that the Aerostat aircraft would have been down wind hundreds of yards not straight up over head in that strong breeze . . .right?

They moved very quickly, much faster than any conventional aircraft as they went from the edge of the eastern horizon to the western skyline in about one minute. The objects flew in formation, but were constantly moving around one another in erratic sideways and diagonal movements that conventional aircraft are incapable of.

I&apos;ve ruled out planes, satellites, comets and meteors, and even! halluci nations as i was accompanied by a friend. this leaves only the things of &quot;fiction&quot;, either something man made that has been kept out of public knowledge or something made from an older, more intelligent species, who are probably here to try and stop us from killing ourselves and our beautiful planet. this has been a memory that will always remain at the front of my brain, i still think about it almost every day.  in fact it effectively changed me from a hopeful skeptic to a full fledged believer. in less then a second.", "1 large light  center, 3 lights on either side  1 additional light off to right side, width of 5 c-5 aircrafts side by side.At 5:00am on January 8, 2008 I stepped outside to get a.m. newspaper and looked up when I heard a low droning noise above.  Sound was much lower than typical aircraft that pass over, and not as loud as jets or c-5 aircraft that I am familiar with hearing. The morning sky was crystal clear as was evident when a shooting star passed directly under the object I saw and was very bright, and there were many stars out. An object was approaching from the west and moving toward south east. The object above looked to be approximately the width of five C-5 aircraft and was moving very slowly.  I saw one large central light, that appeared to have more than one color and on either side of the center light there were 4 smaller lights, spaced out at regular intervals of perhaps 200 ft  between and 1 light off the right side set back and apart from the rest.  All moved at the same uniform speed while approaching me and moving over me.  The lights were dim, as if behind a cloud, although there appeared to be no clouds in the area.  I assumed it was very high in the sky.  I cannot estimate height, but from where I stood it appeared to be the width above mentioned.  I was unable to see a distinct form of airplane(s), only the light formations.  I initially though that perhaps this was a large aircraft with jets flying on the sides in formation, however, the object remained in the same configuration while it passed over me, and after passing directly over the 8 lights on either side of the main central light started to change configuration in that they circled around each other, but remained at the same speed as the object.   I then thought that there were no way these were jets flying in formation because the lights could not have circled around each other.

Years have past and I have only now decided to report what I saw so the date and time maybe not accurate, but have recently decided to see if anyone else had reported on your web site what I had seen and to my surprise other people have reported the same thing around the same time and place.  This is what happened. I left a friends house in the down town part of Santa Barbara , I think sometime between 9pm and 11pm on Thanksgiving to drive back to my house in Ventura.  The parking lot directly behind his house was surrounded by trees, 2 and 1 story houses.  I walked to my car and just gave a glance up to look at the stars as I normally do on a beautiful Santa Barbara,CA nights when I noticed that there were no stars, but just a very odd light that was dull orange in color, it was bright, but gave off no hue as bright lights do.  I then took in a wider perspective and noticed that there was not 1, but 3 of these strange orange lights.  They were aprox. a 100 yards between each light forming a perfect or near perfect triangle.  One single light at the front and  the other 2 light were at the back.  On the outside of the triangle lights I could see the stars, house and street lights, etc., but between the orange lights it was black, therefore the triangle was solid.  The triangle &quot;UFO&quot; moved south to north aprox. 20 to 30mph and was aprox. 100-150 ft. above me.  What really struck me was that a moving flying craft that large and that low with orange lights that I still have not seen since, made no noise as it went overhead, It was completely silent.  As soon I lost sight of it, I got in my car and tried to find it again, but could not.

After they all together disappeared, a couple of the rig hands came down off the rig and I walked over and talked to them. This is where it gets even more interesting.

Sky conditions were dark, clear and starry.  No cloud cover.  I did not notice any wind. My wife pointed to a point above my neighbor&apos;s house, one to the north of ours, and said something like &quot;look at that.&quot;  There, at some height was a pale, whitish object, with two distinct lights hanging down a distance greater than the length of the object&apos;s body, and a third light right at the object&apos;s tail end. The object&apos;s body was about the same apparent field-of-view as the length of my finger held up at arms length.  The object made no discernible noise, yet moved in a forward sense, and turned slowly, such that the &quot;tail light&quot; was always to the rear.  At this time I took three photos with my digital camera (that I had been wearing on a hip pouch, therefore was immediately at hand), with flash disabled so as not to wash out the picture.  The object seemed to be above the tree-line of a eucalyptus grove behind our house, so it was probably between 100 ~ 400 feet above us. 10 X Nikon Binoculars were at hand within our family vehicle and I grabbed those, and saw the object clearly and in some detail.  The body looked to me like a sack or bag, and I could see texture to the bag&apos;s surface, like the material had some kind of &quot;lay&quot; to it as if it had been made from layers.  It got weird when I saw the two front lights up close--though there was no apparent swinging motion of the lights at all, the lights themselves were actually swivelling independently and looked like miniature searchlights, scanning the area beneath the object.  The lights were intense as they projected from their mount position, such that I could clearly make out the narrow &quot;light cones&quot; just beyond their source.  My recollection is the light had an orange-ish hue to them, and when the object had moved directly overhead I could see the light &quot;flare&quot; as it passed directly over me, and then one light seemed to train on me directly for a few seconds (evidently as I was looking at it, it looked at me looking up at it).  But the light was not blindingly bright as it did not even leave a &quot;blind spot&quot; of persistence of vision when I looked away, though I had been watching through binoculars. At this time I ran inside and grabbed my videocamera and came outside.  My wife pointed to where the object had moved, which was now a few houses down to the south, apparently along the same course that the houses on our side of the street took.  I then shot twenty seconds of video of it as it made a 180 degree turn, allowing me to make out the shape of the craft, seeing it from below and to the side, and as it turned head-on.  A striking feature to me was that in as much as it was always moving around up there, it followed a pretty much straight-line course that took it over our houses.  My understanding is that that is an exceptional engineering feat to get any kind of balloon or blimp to manuever like that and keep to a course.", "2nd appearance ofTriangular craft moving very slowly, approx .350 ft up .will have camera ready -now on.5:29 am , I was getting ready for work and my wife came running in the kitchen yelling &quot;it&apos;s back again&quot; she said right after I left the bedroom that whole end of the house lit up outside.

This occurred to me to be unusual and I continued to look at the object thinking at first that it might be some type of comet, or a really slow shooting star trailing debris.  It looked like some points in the string were brighter than other points. As I continued to observe the object for several minutes it changed shape and appeared to condense into a sphere shape.  I am unsure if it was a single object or several smaller objects.  There was a very bright star in the background, and a tree in the foreground.  I noticed the object moving  from side to side (in an east west manner) relative to both of these objects.  I do not recall it moving above the star though. I walked south a bit more to get out of the lights of my complex and try to get a better look, by that time the object was smaller and dimmer and I can&rsquo;t be certain if it was my eyes playing tricks on me or not, but it looked like the object (it looked singular at this point) had dimmed and was moving back and forth in a very small area very rapidly.  It was at this point I discontinued my observation after several minutes had passed.  The object, in addition to changing direction several times, appeared to brighten and dim several times. If I had to draw my own conclusion I would say it was some type of balloon, or a group of balloons strung together that was released from the ground.  Why someone would release balloons at 9pm I cannot say, but that still doesn&rsquo;t explain why it initially appeared so bright.  reflection from the lights below can only explain so much and at this time of evening it is pretty dark outside and the lights of La Mesa not that bright unless they were all foil type balloons.  My other thought is that the bright star I observed may have been a satellite, and it could have been damaged and trailing debris in the atmosphere, I am uncertain and I have reported the incident as best I could.  With two possible conclusions.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was dark out.  We were driving down Green Hill Road in Gainesville towards Ledan Road and right up in front of us just above the trees was a large group of white lights.  They were very bright and  very still.  They were lined up all in a row horizontally very close to each other.  I remember there being about 5 or 6 of them, my son says there were 5. There was a plane flying around them to the right.  The thing that was so striking was how still they were.  They just totally didn&rsquo;t move for the minute or so that we came down the road.  The plane flying around them was moving all around but the objects just hovered there.  I am not good at all with size or distance, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what it looked like from where I was.  It was about 6 inches long, only about 6-12 inches above the tree line and appeared to be less than a mile from me. I am a 35 year old stay at home mom of 2.  I am not sure that I have ever really believed in U. F. O. s before, but I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I immediately called my husband at work as soon as I turned onto another road and could not view them anymore and told him all about it. On our way home from picking up my daughter, we looked in the same exact area and nothing was there.  I have been racking my brain trying to figure out what they could have been.  I came right home from picking up my daughter to search the internet to see if anyone else in my area saw something strange in the sky tonight. My 6 year old son was also a witness and he was amazed by the sight too.  He counted the lights and remembered there were 5.", "3 boys see 3 UFOS.Well my friends and i on a late sunday night were chilling out on the back deck when we noticed a light in the back near the town race track. we talked for a bit about &quot;what if&quot; that was an U.F.O. when we noticed there was another ufo moving southeast. we watched and talked for about 10 - 11 mins gazing at the ufo when we noticed a second one going west we wated it for another 4 minutes before it was gone. then we decided to head inside. after going inside one of us went home and later that night when one of us came out side the first light we seen that we thought could have been a ufo was now gone. the light is still not yet seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It didn&apos;t have anyway of seeing, there was only a small little white light on what looked to be the bottom.  When it passed through, I heard it when it was only about 50 f.t. away.  It passed over me so fast that i couldn&apos;t get a good look at it.  I went around my barn in the direction it was coming from and it was almost 2 miles away.  Then when it went over the mountains the was a very bright light coming from were it had went above the mountain.

Thinking that they were meteorites, I continued walking, until I noticed that they both were not flying in a set path, but were instead moving rather rapidly, I continued watching, occasionally the light would die down to a small, almost pinpoint light that flashed about every second, but eventually the fire would flare back up and the objects would continue to fly, one even discharged what I thought was a ember that quickly died out and vanished. While I was alone on the ground, I noticed an airplane with two headlights and a large wingspan flying above me, observing the UFOs, they eventually went over the horizon, and while I lost my visualization, the plane did not, and continued to follow them for as long as I was in the area and even after I left, I would assume after leaving Fullerton, the objects flew over Brea, and eventually the City of Industry, but that is left up to speculation based on their flight path at the time of the sighting.", "Christmas night, Cut Off,  Louisiana had a extra special christmas gift that night.While on our way home on Christmas night my mother and I seen some very bright lights hovering above a wooded area moving slowing south.

As we talked I was glancing down the alley and up into the sky and thinking about what a nice day it was when I noticed object in the sky about 45 degrees up from the horizon. It was something I have never seen before or since with my own eyes. I mentioned to my friend the object and he saw it and then noticed a second similar object almost directly above us. The one above us appeared to be closer so we focused on that. I immediately got my binoculars out to have a closer look. The object was metallic and appeared to be circular, or an orb. I would have to say the object was a bit larger than a BB if you held one an arms length away. The objects did not drift or move. They were stationary in their positions for at least two minutes then they just vanished.", "1995 Phoenix SE Valley &quot;shooting star&quot; turns 90&deg; and crosses sky in couple of seconds.I stepped out onto my patio around 10 pm because I&apos;d heard there was to be a bit of a meteor shower and I wondered if I could see any of it from my somewhat rural location.  The sky was full of stars but I wasn&apos;t seeing much in the way of shooting stars, so after a few minutes I was ready to give up and go inside.That&apos;s when I noticed a star moving very fast from east to west across the sky. By my estimation it could have crossed the entire sky in 5 or 10 seconds. At first I thought maybe it was a satellite.  I&apos;ve never seen one before but it just popped into my head that must be what this is, and I remember feeling a bit proud of myself for figuring it out.  At least that seemed like a pretty good guess until it got about 75% across the sky moving due west when it suddenly turned north and just took off so fast it was across the sky in a couple of seconds and gone.I don&apos;t know much about space but I don&apos;t think satellites can turn or move like that, so for me - this was a UFO.  It was flying and I couldn&apos;t identify it, put it that way.  Like probably millions of people, I never told anyone about it.  It&apos;s not dramatic or exciting but sometimes I wonder how different the world view would be if everyone who&apos;s seen a UFO would submit a report and I couldn&apos;t keep refusing to report my sighting with that thought in my mind.

I noticed a triangular formation of three white lights off to the right side of the highway that seemed quite close.  The object was partly obscured by the trees along the highway, and for a few seconds it was completely hidden by them.  After a few seconds we could see it again because of a break in the trees, and it was much further away than it had been when first sighted.  My boyfriend was in the passenger seat, and we both agreed it was traveling faster than a plane would.  From inside the car with the windows up, we heard no noise.  The strangest thing about the lights was the formation.  It was as if they were on a flat surface facing us directly.  To better explain, if this had been a plane, it would have been as if  the plane&apos;s nose was pointing directly upward from the ground and we were looking at the bottom/top of the plane.  Even after it had gotten farther away, the lights were still in this perfect triangular shape.  The lights were not blinking, they were bright white and did not seem to give off a surrounding glow or beam.

I turned onto another road, and followed the craft east.I saw nothing for about 4 or 5 minutes, then out of nowhere the craft floated above my vehicle. I pulled my car over, and watched as the craft slightly descended and glided over me. At this moment I determined that this could not be an airplane, as I could clearly see the entire outline of the craft. Upon reaching south Powers Boulevard, a second craft appeared, identical to the one previous. This craft again descended and glided over me.I became panicked as the craft continued to move in my direction. I turned my car around and began to travel west, towards my home.

We were there for my brother&rsquo;s funeral. I am unsure of the exact time but it happened just a few hours before the funeral which was scheduled for 2pm so I estimate that it was around 10am but it could have been 10:30am. My mother may remember what time it happened. My husband and I had a room on third floor on the north side of the building and my mother, grandmother and a friend had a room on third floor on the south side of the building. We were over in my mother&apos;s and grandmother&apos;s room visiting when my mother said she needed to get something out of her rental car and wanted me to go out with her because she wanted to tell me something. The car she rented was parked in the parking lot on the north side of the building right near the entrance. In the late morning this side is in the shadow of the hotel. The lobby had entrances on both sides of the building. So we took the elevator down and then my mother told me what she wanted to tell me. Then she proceeded to look in the car for something. She didn&rsquo;t find it in the trunk so she opened the front passenger side door and was leaning into the car looking through a bag of stuff. I stood next to the car with my back to the building looking north. As I stood there, motion to my right caught my attention and I turned to look and saw what looked like a bubble, like the bubbles kids blow from a soap solution. It was traveling from the direction of the freeway towards the back of the building. It came down the aisle the way a car would have except that it was floating about 6 ft above the ground. As it got closer I realized it wasn&rsquo;t a kids bubble but then I remembered that rubbery kind that the kids blow through a tube but as it got closer yet then I knew it wasn&rsquo;t that either. It just glided along and then just as it passed the back of my mother&rsquo;s rental car and up to the sidewalk leading into the hotel, it suddenly turned to the left like it was go! ing towa rds the entrance to the hotel but then it turned again and headed right for me but just as it got near me it also increased in altitude a few inches. So I was just standing there trying to figure out what it was and I finally said to my mother, &ldquo;Look at this&rdquo; and she backed away from the car and stood up and looked and she didn&rsquo;t see it approach us and so her perception was off and she thought it was larger but further away and said, &ldquo;Oh, a kids balloon&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s closer&rdquo; and she said, &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right&rdquo; and then she started talking up a storm about what it might be. We both sensed an intelligence about it and felt as though it were looking at us. As we stood there staring at it I sort of heard in my head the name of my brother. It was like the orb communicated telepathically. The hair stood up on the back of my neck at that point because it scared me but I then discounted it and thought, &lsquo;how could this be my brother and what would would an orb have to do with my brother.&rsquo; Then I remembered something my husband had watched just a couple weeks or so before about spirit orbs near battle grounds. The orb was about the size of a softball or slightly larger and it was pearly white with a little discoloration on the bottom just to the left (from my viewing perspective). After hovering there for a while then it reversed the original flight path until it got to the back of the car and then it floated along the drivers side of the car back towards the hotel and then went up and over the top of the hotel. We lost sight of it after that and so my mother hurried up and shut the car door and we raced through the lobby of the hotel to go out the other door on the south side to see if we could see it again. We did see it again. It seemed to light up or catch the sunlight differently sometimes because sometimes we could see it very well as though it were a light and other times we couldn&rsquo;t. Then finally we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore. It was heading sort of southwest towards some mountains off in the distance! while g aining quite a bit of altitude. When we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore we headed back upstairs and as we stepped off the elevator on third floor, my husband was standing there. He didn&rsquo;t know what was taking me and my mother so long and was about to come down and look for us to find out. So we told him what we had seen and right away he said that it was my brother. I don&rsquo;t know what I saw except that it showed intelligence and watched us and knew the name of my brother. I want to know what that was and why it happened just before my brother&apos;s funeral and how it knew we would be there and how it knew my brother&apos;s name. It is creepy when anyone knows stuff about you when they shouldn&apos;t.", "I observed orange lights off of the coast.I was on vacation in Myrtle Beach this week and I had stepped out of my hotel room which faced the beach. It was a nice night, a bit windy and cool with a full moon with increasing cloud cover. From the balcony on the fifth floor room, I observed as the clouds began to obscure the moon a orange spherical light appeared from the cloud cover drifting against the wind to the east. A second one appeared as the first one blinked out. The second one stayed in place and faded out. Another light appeared still drifting to the east and blinked out.  Finally three lights blinked on simulatneously in a staggered line formation and a fourth one appeared to the left of the formation before &quot;zooming&quot; into line with the others. The formation tightened up and I left the balcony to get my wife outside to see this. When we both came back out, there were no lights. We waited for 15 minutes but nothing else appeared.", "South Texas non illuminating ball of fireWhen I was a young boy I lived in a very small town in South Texas, Tilden, TX.  I as well as two other immediate family members have very clear memories of an event that occurred one night.  I don&apos;t remember the exact date but I know, as well as I know my own name, that it was the night the very last episode of M.A.S.H. aired I think it was 1983-84 something like that.We moved to Tilden from San Antonio because my mother was the personal assistant for a Texas oil man.  He had some 2000 acres just outside Tilden and wanted to get out of the city.  He built three houses all on virgin land on his ranch.  The houses were about 40 -50 yards apart one was for his parents, one for the pilot, and the other for our family.  My dad was in the air force and stationed in Korea at the time so being the typical air force brat I had a fascination with all aircraft.  The pilot, always kept the jet ranger close by the three houses incase one of us kids were to get struck by a snake.  My mothers boss had 3 kids, the pilot had 2, and my mother had 2 and being virgin South Texas land it was not uncommon to wakeup with Rattle Snakes on the door steps keeping warm on the concrete. The night I am referring to my mother&apos;s boss and the pilot had been using the Bell to help herd some cattle that day and had not come home when Mash started.  Just as Mash was ending my German Sheppard, Joy, started howling and crying like I&apos;ve never heard a dog do before or since.  She ran wildly around the living room and would run to the back door then back to the couch.  Joy would normally get upset when the bramas would come close to the house or when an illegal would come up to the house looking for work.  However this was different she literally went crazy.  She stopped running around and went to the sliding glass door and bared her teeth starring out the door snarling like she was possessed.  Did I mention that she was a puppy maybe 8 months old.  She had never done this before and was disturbing us so I went to the door to get her and calm her down when I saw what she was going on about  The scrub brush had been cleared probably 200 yards in any direction around the houses when they were built and directly behind ours was a ball of fire.  That is the only way I can describe it.  It was difficult to register the dimensions of the thing but I am sure it had to be at least 60 yards in diameter it looked huge.  It was perfectly round and appeared to be on fire.  NO windows or little green men coming out, it was simply hovering a few feet off the ground.  What was strange, as if that was not strange in its self, it was very bright and had red, yellow, and orange colors to it and pulsated but it cast NO light.  What I mean is it did not cast shadows or light up the area around it.  You could only barely make out the ground just below it.  I stood there for 2 or 3 minutes trying to get my mother and sister to come look at this thing and when my mother saw it she started to panic and rushed us in to the back bedroom and forced Joy to come as well.  We probably stayed in the bedroom for 20 minutes when we heard the pilot coming in with the Jet Ranger.  The next day I told the pilot what we had seen and asked if he saw anything, of course I was met with a disbelieving attitude and he said he did not see a thing.  No one saw it but us, not the pilot&rsquo;s family nor my mothers bosses. I am a college educated professional businessman, in fact I minored in philosophy and consider myself a very rational person.  I know what I saw and gave up a very long time ago on trying to get people to believe this story no matter how very true it is.  I am not a UFO buff but I know there is something unexplained out there and it does fly.  I have however never heard of any sighting that can be described as a huge ball of fire and was wondering if you have.  I have heard of the Marfa lights and always thought maybe this was one. Curious,((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Lights appear out of the woods and chase vehicle.I am writing about something that happened when I was 19 years old.   It occurred on Wednesday, October 17, 1973, on the outskirts of Montgomery, Alabama.    I have always wanted to report it, but I never realized there was a National Reporting Center until now.         When I was 19 I kept a diary and I wrote about this incident in my diary.  But even if I hadn&rsquo;t written about it at that time, the occurrence and the terror we felt, will always be clear in my memory.     This is my account of what happened:  It was approximately 11:30 p.m. on Oct 17 1973.  My boyfriend (who was a sergeant in the air force) and I (a college student and worked full time) had driven out to the country.  We wanted to find a quiet, romantic place to park and spend some time alone together.      We went to an area where some new roads had been cut through the woods.  An area that was being prepared to build new homes, but no homes had been started to be built yet. Only the roads had been cleared.  The woods around the roads were still thick with trees and undergrowth.   We drove a good distance down the first new road until we came to a small cul-de-sac road that was cut back deep into the wooded area.  We drove to the end of the cul-de-sac and parked the car, facing up hill to the main road.We sat and talked for a while before we noticed a bright light moving slowly across the tops of the trees in the distance...it was across the main road a distance away.  We both watched this light for approximately ten minutes.  At first we thought it was a helicopter because it would move slowly across the trees and then stop in mid air, hover for a minute then continue slowly down the tree line. Once or twice it disappeared down behind the trees but it would reappear a few seconds later.    We rolled our windows down to see if we could hear the whirring of helicopter blades - but there was no sound at all.   Total quiet.We kept speculating what it could be as we were perplexed that it made no sound.   It finally moved on out of our vision so we shrugged our shoulders and changed the subject. I&rsquo;m not sure how much time passed...maybe 5 minutes but not more than 15 minutes when a bright light, like a huge spot light, flashed across our vehicle.  It didn&rsquo;t stop and shine on the vehicle, it only flashed across our vehicle.    We both jumped and said, &quot;What was THAT?&quot;  My heart started pounding.  We looked all around us and didn&rsquo;t see anything that would have caused a bright light like that to flash on the car.  We looked at each other, both of us frightened, said not a word but my boyfriend cranked up the car to get out of there.As soon as we cranked the car, a bright light - about the size of a basket ball - came floating out of the woods - about 5 to 6 feet off the ground - quickly towards our car. I say floating because it wasn&rsquo;t bobbing up and down like it would if someone had a big spot light and was running with it....it wasn&rsquo;t making any sound at all so it wasn&rsquo;t a motorized vehicle, no bicycle could come through those thick woods like this light was...it was floating out of the woods at a very fast speed directly towards the car.We sped up the hill to turn off of the cul-de-sac onto the main road that lead out of that area.  As we approached the main road, a second light appeared  from the other side of the cul-de-sac and  began pursuit of our car at an even faster rate of speed.   My boyfriend floored the accelerator as we turned onto the main road.    The two lights did not follow the road behind us&hellip;..they took a short cut across the woods  between the cul-de-sac and the main road &hellip;. I mean straight through those thick woods&hellip;never slowed down, never veered or bobbed around&hellip;.never making a sound&hellip;just floated straight across and through the heavy woods and out onto the main road  directly behind our vehicle.     I was panic stricken and screaming to go faster, go faster.     The lights stayed right behind us and my boyfriend was driving as fast as he could on that back country road.As we approached the exit out of that area onto the county road where there was other traffic, the lights vanished.During this incident, all we saw were the lights&hellip;.we could see nothing of what was behind them.   We heard not a sound.The few people I told about this story,  said it was quite interesting but had the &ldquo;weirdo liar&ldquo; looks on their faces.   But I know what happened and my boyfriend knew what happened and there was no explanation to what happened to us.", "BRIGHT LIGHT MOVES ACROSS THE SKY WITH OUT A SOUNDOn or around September 22, 2007 I was sitting at a table with my wife and our friends I was facing the street and they were looking toward the pool. I noticed a round bright white light coming across from the left side, and it was moving very slow. I thought to my self that plane is too low. But that is when the round light stopped moving and that is when I figured that the object was flying straight in my direction, at this time the light was right over the house across the street. This is when I noticed the object was not making a sound, and it started to move side ways again. It was about ten to fifteen feet above the house, and the house  was about forty-five feet across the street. As I started to point in the direction, the thing stopped agin, at this time it started to go up and out away from us. At the time of my hand being in the up Poisson, I could not cover the light with my hand, so I guess the circle was about eight to ten feet in diameter I don`t know. But with out a sound the circle started to move outward at fast pace it only took about three or four seconds for it to be the size of a pinhead and then gone.I can not tell you for sure that it was a UFO, but I do know this. 1-   the round bright light moved from one side of the sky to the other with out making a sound. 2-   it stopped in mid flight, and not once did the brightness ever change to dull or brighter. 3-   it was just above the telephone wires across the street and I could not see any sign of windows and the light did not hurt my eyes, not like a light bulb from a lamp, I could have looked at it all night with having to blink, like I said, I can`t tell you it was a UFO, but as far as what I think it was, yes I am a be leaver.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Late one evening, I was outside on the patio of the home in which I was living with roommates. I was startled by the sound of jets flying very low overhead, coming from East to West from the Atlantic Ocean. Like anyone would, I looked up instantly to see two military jets, with a spherical object between and slightly behind the (2) aircraft. My first impression was that the object was attached and was being towed by the jets. At this point I called a roommate and his mother outside to witness this as well. One of the jets turned South, and the other turned North. The object moved further behind the northbound aircraft and followed it out of site(toward Patrick airforce base). Seconds later a third military jet flew over and continued west, until out of site. Here is a description of the object. It was about twice the height of the tail fins on the aircraft. The object was perfectly spherical, transparent, and emanating a blue light. We were clearly able to see what I could best describe as blue plasma, or thick blue and white smoke roiling inside a transparent sphere. It was like looking at a flying crystal ball. I make no assumption as to what it was, however I know beyond doubt what we saw, and that the military is aware of it. Regardless of its origin, it was very much out of place. I would love to talk to someone who has had a similar experience; it really is almost impossible to believe unless you experience it for yourself.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The object was round and very bright moving at a speed of several thousand miles per hour.  I could compare jet traffic at altitude moving along J29 high altitude airway over the Memphis area. This object was the probably the size of the Superdome or bigger viewing it from that distance.  The object was not trailing debris, and was maintaining level flight (not following the curvature of the earth) through out the sighting. The light was incredibly bright and did not dim as its azmith turned in passing. I have seen many satillites reflecting sunlight and this was much bigger and brighter than anything man made.

This occurred on a beautiful day in daylight hours with clear skys. All children concurred that they heard a loud roar and what also sounded as a sonic boom.  Approximately a minute latter they witnessed seven military jets possibly from the Portland Oregon Air Base, traveling in the direction from the north to south. The jets suddenly made an abrupt turn to the west in the direction of travel they last saw the craft traveling.  The children all concure that the craft was very large and as described by my son as at least as large as two houses.  They also said the craft had four green lights on the underside or belly of the craft. I tried to determine altitude by asking the children if it was traveling at a height were commercial jets fly. Their answer was about half the distance of were you would expect a commercial jet liner to fly.

I like looking at the moon, so occasionally I would look at it again. One time I looked at it there was a bright light just to the right of the moon. I assumed it was Venus or a bright star, although I&apos;ve never seen one so close to such a bright full moon. I looked again about 10 minutes later, and now the same light was to the LEFT of the moon. That didn&apos;t seem right to me. Someone told me they thought it was probably Mars. Two problems with that: it didn&apos;t have the usual reddish tint and was brighter than it would be EVEN IF it was AWAY FROM a full moon--it should have appeared even dimmer to me because of the brightness of the full moon so close to it; and how did it move over to the other side of the moon?

One day while heading home from work, I was near the back entrance/exit to the base and I saw an object that was round and silver orbiting in and out of the clouds over a near by mountain range.  It was aproximately 5 miles away over the mountains. The only way to describe the object would be orb like. It was circling in and out of the clouds like a planet moving around the sun.

I watched it until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.I could also see an airplanes flashing lights comming in from the south the whole time I was watching this.The airplane seemed to be at a higher altitude than the object I was watching.Did anyone else in Pa. see anything similar on Feb,21,2008", "It was about 12:30 in the morning my mom and I where about to leave the house when we saw some weird shape flying over our house. We thougth it was a plane of some sort.((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))", "I took my dog out and saw a lit up saucer shaped space craft for about 1 min in the sky and then it just turned off like a lightbulbI am going to be brief. I just spoke with you (Peter Davenport) on the phone and you you seemed very busy and asked me to report what I saw online. So here is what happened.I live on the 1st floor of a 2 story house. I was in my bedroom with my girlfriend and my dog at around 3:45-4:00 a.m watching t.v. I am always up late . I was lying in bed with my girlfriend and my dog was acting really weird making all sorts of noise and barking and she is always very quiet at night. I figured she had to go outside to go to the bathroom. So, I took my dog outside my front door with my girlfriend to have a cigarette and let my dog out . My dog is very well trained like I said and was acting sort of strange and as soon as I opened the door my dog ran into my neighbor&rsquo;s yard which is very unlike her. She usually stays in our yard and does her business in our yard. So, I ran off the porch to go get my dog and when I got her I noticed a light above my head about 2 streets down. When I looked up I saw a saucer shaped craft in the sky. It looked like it was about a football field and a half to two football fields high up in the sky. At first I thought it was a meteor coming down  until it just came to a complete stop. Also, how low it was to the ground it just seemed strange to me. Also, it was a strange color. Almost a color I have never seen before just lit up in the sky like a strange colored saucer lightbulb. I would describe the color as purplish orangish yellowish green, I know that sounds strange but it was glowing of all those colors and that&rsquo;s the only way I can describe it . Anyway, as I said I thought it was a meteror until I really looked at it. It was very low to the earth and it was traveling in a strait line and then it just stoped and hovered in the sky . That&rsquo;s when I got a very bad feeling and called my girlfriend over. This disk in the sky was going in a straight line and then it just stopped for like 10 seconds and hovered. Then it moved in a way I have never seen a plane or anything of that matter on this earth. After the craft went in the strait line then stopped it was moving almost at like 90 degree angles. It would move one way and then turn and go another way and th! en turn and go another way like it was on a street taking turns or something. for example it would turn right then move up in the sky and then turn left then move down. I have never seen any kind of plane or helicopter do this so i removed that explanation immeditly. So from the beginning, the craft went in a straight line like it was a meteor and then it just came to a complete stop, it hovered for around 10 seconds and then starting moving again in a hovering fashion and was hovering and taking strange turns. The craft  looked like it was one big light switching to different illuminating colors and after about 1 minute of watching it the light just turned off like it had a switch to appear and disappear and then it never re-appeared. It didn&rsquo;t take off real fast like in the movies or anything or as one would think; it just turned off like a lightbulb. I went back into my house with my girlfriend and my dog and just had the creepiest strangest feeling. I was so creeped out I woke my roommate up but of corse just like my mother he didn&rsquo;t believe me, even though he could see me and my girlfriend were so worked up. I wasn&rsquo;t on any drugs or anything and I know I wasn&rsquo;t hallucinating because my girlfriend saw it to along with my dog.  I have never believed in anything like this until I saw the craft this one night. I have not shared this and did not report it to the police because I didn&rsquo;t want anyone to think I was crazy. Then I saw your show and saw all those other people with cases like mine and it jsut made me want you to know what i saw and know more about it. I  decided to call you and when you called me back I knew this was serious and thought i would write you a description of this &quot;craft&quot;. I know there is something out there. Can you share with me what you think this is. I dont live close to any airports and i just know it was something not of this world.", "Hovering still curved boxy  20x25 ft. solid dark object over Atlanta freeway.In full bright daylight I observed a curved boxy matte black solid object floating stationary in mid air 50 feet above the freeway in midtown Atlanta, GA from my 5th floor window. It was slightly above my eye level, 200 - 400 yards distant.The object was still. It just appeared and then disappeared without apparent motion 2-3 seconds later.The object was a fluted boxy cylinder, the side I observed had a matte black or very dark grey finish, with 4 vertically aligned portholes 1/3 down from the slightly curved dome at the top.The sides were parallel with fluted curved sections each with a shadowed porthole, matte black and indented. Each of the curved panels was 5-6 feet wide, each porthole 3ft wide by 4 ft high.The object had horizontal ovals 2 by 5 foot at the bottom of each fluted panel, which extended slightly below the bottom plane of the boxy thing, all the way around. Its overall height was about 20 ft. from top to bottom.", "Huge triangle craft hovering silently 40 ft. above highway 19-E. 6 witnesses, craft seemed to be aware of our presence.Myself and 5 friends were headed home from a regional Fair in Grey TN. The Fair is about an hours drive from my home. It was just before midnight. The area in which we live is rural, and situated in the Blue Ridge Mountains. There is a stretch of Highway 19-E between Hampton, TN and the TN-NC state line that winds through an area with very few homes, no homes or businesses at all in some places. The road is a narrow, 2 lane in most places with no street lights.I was driving, my Aunt was in the passenger seat, and three of my friends were in the back seat, 6 of us total were in the car. The evening had been one of too much cotton candy, corn dogs, and oversized stuffed animals won at overpriced games of &quot;skill&quot;! We were driving along,everyone was laughing and talking at the same time, the radio was playing. Each person, trying to outshout the other. There was basically no traffic at all on the road as it was getting late, at least for most people in this area.We were only about 7 minutes from my house when we rounded a curve and saw what appeared to be a highly illuminated area in the road ahead, I was the first to notice, and it took a few seconds to put together what was happening. I slowed and realized that the road was illuminated...from above. I looked up and could not believe my eyes, by this time everyone had fallen silent and I came to a complete stop in the middle of the road.Hovering about 40-50 feet above and in front of us was what I would describe as a &quot;textbook&quot; UFO. For anyone who has never seen a UFO, it is almost impossible to describe the feelings/emotions that you experience. Your logical mind says impossible, you&apos;re dreaming, hallucinating, whatever, but it can&apos;t be real, and yet there it is. It&apos;s overwhelming. Above us was a HUGE, black, triangle shaped craft with slightly rounded corners. On each of the three points it had very bright hallogen type lights shining straight down, and the front light seemed to have the ability to aim it&apos;s beam somewhat. There may have been a few very small lights of other colors (a couple of my friends said they saw them, I cannot say that I saw anything but the three large white lights). The craft was hovering, and was completely silent. There was no sign of air displacement or means of flight whatsoever. The craft swayed and bobbed slightly like a mylar balloon in a still quiet room, just very slight movement.I put the car in park and looked around to see everyone in the car stretching to the nearest window for a view with their mouths hanging open, and a look of astonishment on their faces. What stands out the most in my mind in how utterly silent everything had become.As if by instinct, I turned to open the door to get out and my Aunt grabbed my arm and said &quot;NO SIR...you&apos;re not getting out of this car!! What is that thing? You could get killed!&quot; I told her it was fine, and when everyone saw that I was getting out, they too decided to do the same. Carefully, as if we were sneaking up on something, we opened the doors of the car (all but my Aunt),and we stepped out of the car. There was not a single cloud in the sky, nor any sign of traffic, wind or sound....it was eerily silent.Time stood still for us at that point. Whether the craft was truly observing us, or if it just appeared to be, we stood there looking up at this thing drifting ever so slowly towards us, looking back, it must have looked like an Old West standoff! Several minutes passed of staring up at the enormous otherworldy machine, and then glancing at each other. Not a single word was spoken by any of us, except the occasional plea from my Aunt to &quot;get my A-- back in the car and lock the door!&quot; After some time, I suddenly had the thought to reach inside and toot the car horn. The very SECOND I did so...the craft rose straight up about 15-20 ft. and shot straight back over us and disappeared over the tree tops. We all jumped back in the car and did a sharp U-turn and drove as fast as I could in the direction of the craft. We were able to follow it probably 7 miles or so before it picked up speed and disappeared over the hilltop.The rest of the drive home was a mix of emotions... from disbelief, to laughter, to &quot;what should we do?...who should we tell?&quot; To this day, none of us can explain what we saw, nor have we ever witnessed anything else that compares. I have a couple of times since seen things that made me wonder, and mysterious lights that seemed to have abilities beyond human technology, but NOTHING to hold a candle to what happened to us that night. I have always said how glad I am that I was not alone that night. Having 5 other witnesses makes it so much more solid.I understand the people who disbelieve, or have reservations on this subject. Looking back over what I have written tonight, it sounds so unreal. It WAS unreal, believe me. There are certainly a lot of hoaxes and misinformation out there, sad to say. I can assure you however, if you ever have an experience like we had that August night, your world will change.If there is one thing that I can say with the deepest, most sincere conviction of my heart...my friends and I saw something that is not a part of this world and time as we know it. Spacecraft from another planet? Time travelers? Beings from another dimension? I wouldn&apos;t even begin to speculate, but let me assure you of this one thing, without ANY reservations or hesitation, WE ARE NOT ALONE AND ARE BEING VISITED AROUND THIS PLANET EVERY DAY. That, my friend, is an absolute certainty.", "Lights over rt. 78I was traveling home from school the other night and I observed a strange light over RT. 78 in Clinton, NJ.

The light traveled southwest towards the walmart shopping center then made a 90 degree turn and continued at a very high speed towards spruce run resevior.", "Sightings of object in Bay City, TexasWe were at our deer camp and we heard a noise and I just said that it was a jet. But it was loud. My husband went outside and said come here and look. It was way lower than an airplane would fly, but dark where we could only see the lights, Was very very wide. It moved kind of slow. The next day we tried to call the B.C. Airport to see what it might have been or if they knew anything about it.  No one answered.  So we blew it off. Now that everyone is seeing things like what we have seen sort of, I decided to inform you.  I don&apos;t think it is a UFO, I seem to think this is a govenment thing.  I guess we will never know. The lights were white. We have been puzzled ever since and wondering.  We left alone, because we did not want people to think we were crazy...", "Bright Turquoise light moving in the sky then completely disapearedWe had just exited the car when arriving home at my parent&rsquo;s house. My mother stated look up in the sky, my father and I looked up and we saw a bright turquoise colored light, it at first looked as if like a missile going up at an angle into the sky very slowly, but then appeared quickly to be horizontal. It appeared as if 2 sets of lights one on top of the other, the light/ object moved to the right and then quickly back to the left and then again to the right. The light faded on one side and then completely disappeared. The sky was partly cloudy and the movement appeared as if behind a cloud part of the time, but you could still see the bright light.", "While on Greenhill Road in Madison, Connecticut, coming from Killingworth, Connecticut, at approximately 7:40 P.M. last night, on Friday, January 18, 2008, I saw a round light fall from the sky.  The light was not colored.  It did not blink or make any noise. If the sun were a basketball, this object was the size of a baseball. My first thought was the object was a shooting star.  But the sky was dark last night. And, I honestly do not know what a shooting star is.  My second thought was that I saw a meteor or some debris from an airplane Then, as I watched the trajectory of the object, the object moved northward, toward North Madison. I watched this object move for about ten to fifteen seconds. What bothered me was that the object did not fall straight downward.    The arc created was at least 1000 arms in length &ndash; perhaps even some several thousand arms in length.  (I am a terrible judge of distance). I pulled my car over to the side of the road and waited for a crash:  the object just disappeared out of my sight. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it.   The object was not an airplane or helicopter.  It was moving way too fast to be either.  Nor was the light source originating from the ground:  there was no light beneath it.  More specifically, if someone had beamed a flashlight or advertising light into the air, there would have been traces of light underneath this beam.  There were none. I probably would have just shrugged the entire incident off as being a shooting star or meteor &ndash; and it&rsquo;s entirely possible that&rsquo;s what I saw.  However, when I turned on the TV at 9:00 PM EST, to the Larry King Live episode regarding the sightings in Texas, I figured at a minimum, I needed to report this.", "Very bright light, slow moving object that made no audible noise.I was on the front porch when I saw a bright light moving very slowly in the sky that did not resemble a plane or helicopter traveling west to east.  Our property is often flown over by both types of aircraft (planes and helicopters).  This was a very bright white light that did not flash.  Was brighter that a normal spot light or landing light.  There was also no red or green flashing as on other aircraft.  The craft appeared to be lower than the cloud cover.  There was cloud cover but not dense, could still see stars through the clouds.The object made no noise, in fact as I was watching this object a regular aircraft flying from the east to the west flew over and was at a higher altitude and I heard this plane with no problems.  Continued to watch the unknown craft until it disappeared to the east.", "Large blimp-like object hovering with multiple white bright lighte, leaving quickly at a rapid speedDriving north on Folsom-Auburn rd from the city of Folsom toward Granite Bay.  First spotted what appeared to me to be a large aircraft with I&rsquo;m guessing 2 to 3 lights, very bright white, almost directly inline in the direction I was traveling.  This was just a little south of Folsom Damn Road. My initial impression was of a  commercial aircraft with landing lights on heading toward me.  Based on this assumption,  my estimate was that it was over the Roseville-Rocklin vicinity, maybe 10-15 miles distant.  This was a winding, slightly hilly road and I was driving between 45-50 mph.  Initially it was within my view for a few minutes consistently.  I did not focus on it all the time but was interested in figuring out maybe what it was since it seemed unusual in it&rsquo;s flight path for the area.  Most commercial lights run E/W  and having landing lights at that position seemed premature, especially for any southbound flight path  toward the old Mather AFB where I know there is corporate commercial traffic. As I proceeded north, the road became more winding, with many tall trees bordering it.  My view of the craft became more intermittent.  My focus was on driving safely, since I still assumed it was nothing  more than an aircraft.  But I still tried to keep a general eye on it.   Not knowing whether the winding road was affecting by judgment, my distinct impression was maybe it was gradually swerving in a gentle turn slightly west.  The trees along the west side of the road were interrupting any continuous view to just a few seconds. As I approached at some point seemed to be stationary in it&rsquo;s position.  Without being positive one way or another, it is possible it was stationary more or less from the point I first saw it.  At this point I assumed it was a helicopter, with not the ordinary display of lights.   This still seemed off since this is not an area I would ordinary think of helicopters.  These lights were not searchlight, as the they were not scanning and there was not light stream through the sky.  At approximately 2 - 1 &frac12; miles of Douglas road it was evident the object was hovering within a mile ahead maybe &frac12; - &frac34;  west of  Folsom Auburn Rd.  Not knowing it&rsquo;s size but based on my speed an approaching it I  would guess it was between 500 - 1000 feet in altitude. At this point I was pretty sure it was not a helicopter.  There was no noise associated with it.  The lights were more blurry at  this point,  not knowing whether it was due to cloud overcast or moisture in the air.  My observation was still limited to quick glances of it when it came into view.  My distinct  impression of it at this point was of something poivnting E/W, large hovering with some type of frame of lights on its south facing side.  At this point I felt it had to be a blimp, or some very large balloon like object.  I felt I needed to pull of to get a better &amp; consistent view of it.  There was a single vehicle behind me, following closely but no shoulder to safely pull over.  I knew there was a place to turn off right within a couple hundred yards so I kept proceeding.  At this point I was approaching being perpendicular with the object to the East.   At this point I was able to see some of its outline.  The sky was fairly dark and I could see slight difference in the shade of darkness between the object and the background sky.  I saw it twice for just a split second each time.  It seemed I was mostly seen maybe the top right quarter of the object, and the closest I can say was it appeared do be blimp-like.  The top portion ran E/W slight curving downward East with it changing to something indistinguishable at its end.  The light were still on but much less visible and bright,  seemed to be slight away from the body of the object.  My impression of the lights were very indistinct, blurry, maybe shadowy, if that makes sense.  There was awareness of a bulk behind them but at the same time I saw nothing distinct that you would think you would see based on the lights even if they were pointing away from the object.  I lived in Southern California for thirty years until the early 1980&rsquo;s, and seeing blimps were a very common occurrence living in northern Torrance near the Goodyear blimp airfield in Carson.  This just seemed different.  Too low to the ground where there was no imminent landing.  The lights were different.  Not like the normal running lights of an airship and definitely not like the commercial lights for ad display.  There was no familiar hum of the engines.  There was absolutely no sound at all. As pulled past it slightly the lights were less easily seen, my assumption because I was now behind it , more toward it&rsquo;s north side.  I pulled over on the next intersection at Fuller St. and made a quick U-turn and pulled over to the curb, expecting to see the objection facing west at maybe 10-11 o&rsquo;clock.  But to my surprise, it was already moving south,  much quicker than I anticipated, especially since I assumed it was a balloon like object.  I could still  see lights but much dimmer and it was moving south still.  I&rsquo;m guessing maybe at this point it was 1-2 miles away already.  This shocked me.  Blimps do not move that fast.  But at the same time, it did not seem to pulling away at a fantastic speed.  I decided that if it was a blimp like object I should be at least able to keep in view for awhile if I headed back south in direction I came and the direction it was proceeding so I turned left back on Auburn Folsom Rd.  I had to wait from 5-10 seconds for the light to change.  Already the object was I&rsquo;m guessing was at least 5 mi, so I was anxious but still I followed.  I only caught a glimpse of the light a couple time over thles away next 5 minutes.  Losing sight due to the winding road and the trees.  I knew after I got closer to Folsom Damn Road my view would open up and then I might be able to reacquire my observation.  My impression was that since I was no longer able to see the lights that it had moved back east across the road and that I had missed this flight path.  When I got to the clear area it definitely not south or southwest.  It was not in the air east either but I concluded the only possible conclusion for the disappearance of the craft was it went east over Lake Folsom or landed in that direction.  I thought all of the assumptions were very slim.  I was just trying to think of a rational logical explanation for what I observed. If I heard this story from someone I would be skeptical.  I would assume there were flaw in persons observations, logistically in the least.  I am not one to make any fantastical assumptions about anything in life.  I ALWAYS assume a logical explanation for everything that seems less than logical.  I am very observant and analytical.  Its what I do and who I am.  Most people would consider me very intelligent and very informed. If someone could explain to me possible scenarios to what I observed I would welcome them.  Based on my experience I can think of absolutely nothing that would conform to my observations.  Thought I will admit my view of the object were fleeting and less than very distinct,  they were such that they were very analytical.  I would definitely refute anybody&rsquo;s allegation of anything that would explain it that did not fall in line with what I observed.  But at the same time I would accept that would explain it that made sense.  But my sense of the timing and logistics were very accurate.   I would say my guestimates of distance and height are  subject to some question based on the size of the object and never getting more the a second or two glimpse of it, my ability to gauge these things has always been way above average.  I am a very observant fellow.  I do not base my observations on whims like most people.  If I say something, it is.  If I&rsquo;m not sure, I will say so without problem.  If I don&rsquo;t know, I will say so. As far as my thoughts whether this was observed by anyone else, until I figured out it was hovering, I doubt if most people in the cars would have assumed anything abnormal.  If I lived in the vicinity of where it was hovering and was outside,  I&rsquo;m guessing if I saw it I would had observed it.  I&rsquo;m guessing within a mile of the object, anyone walking or outside would have definitely after seeing it, would have continued to observe it.  It was a cool night and maybe two hours after sundown.  The air was generally still and the sky seemed mostly overcast but I could distinguish of couple of stars.  This a suburban, semi-rural area.   There seemed to be slight reflection of city lights off the overcast clouds but getting darker definitely as you move East, with it getting much darker just about at the juncture of Auburn-Folsom road, with the definite effect of the large Lake Folsom to the immediate east.  When I saw the silhouette, this difference in shade of darkness of the object and sky was very slight but enough to distinguish the shape that I saw. If needed I could make a cursory drawing of what I saw.  It was not a whole image.  I do not have scanner available at this moment but could do so if it would help.  The drawing would be rudimentary.", "Nyack CA in Dec. 1982, cigar shape, lasting about twelve minutesI was in California, on Highway 80 heading southwest just passing the glider airport (I think that&rsquo;s Nyack-Blue Canyon but if not it&rsquo;s the one to the east [left] with a wind farm to the west [right]).  It was the early Eighty&rsquo;s, possibly November or December of 1982 or 1983.  I observed what I at first took to be a blimp crossing the interstate from west to east.  I noticed it because from my scientific, weather, history, Navy, research and other experience I knew that it was very dangerous for a blimp to be that close to the earth so near a ridgeline so commonly windy, and I wondered if it was in trouble.  As I got closer I realized that it did not have a gondola, then that it was closer to a cigar-shape than the usual teardrop-shape, then that it had what appeared to be windows along the side midline, continuous and extending around the nose and tail as far as I could see (which I verified as I passed).  I saw movement behind the windows (which seemed translucent rather than clear, like looking through sand-blasted glass) that was purposeful, not random, rhythmical or cyclic.  I pulled over and stopped.  There was no sound coming from the vehicle, particularly not the propeller and/or engine sound I associate with blimps.  It continued east at about twenty mph. following the land contours until it rose and disappeared over the hills.The color of the light from the windows was a sandy yellow and was the only light coming from the object.  There were no navigational lights of any kind.  The color of the surface gave the immediate impression of a silvery gray but upon closer examination it was actually metallic silver with some sort of mottled or textured surface.  Given that at that time my eyes were 20/5 and able to see in dim light even better that in bright light, the elements of that texturing had to be less than &frac12; inch.  I pulled out my compass and did a little trigonometry.  I figured out that it was between 70 and 85 feet long, and between 25 and 35 feet in diameter and that it was maintaining an altitude of approximately 200 to 250 feet.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "I saw a circular-oval object with a orange hue around it.Wile I was on my way over to my grandmother&rsquo;s house I noticed a blackish oval with a orange glow/light around it. So I went back inside and told my grandmother what I saw and grabbed a pair of binoculars and we headed back outside. I peered through the binoculars and could barely see it, then I walker closer and peered back into the binoculars. What I saw was a circular-oval form of object with a glowing light around it. The light had an orange hue. Then it completely disappeared from view, I asked my grandmother to check it out and she said she didn&rsquo;t see it anymore either.  We both thought that was weird, I took the binoculars and I saw it zoom to the right and came back to its old position and then disappeared from view again.", "Large &quot;sphere&quot; shaped object sighted hovering with an up and down motion.I wanted to report this event though it happened many years ago.  I never reported it to anyone before and thought it may be of interest to someone. I was 14 years old at the time of this sighting.  I lived in a rural area, on a farm.  On a Saturday morning I left my house to do some chores.  Across the road and approximately 100 yards from me, I immediately saw a large &quot;sphere&quot; shaped object about 50 feet in diamater, smooth and dark gray in color.  It hovered about 4&apos; to 6&apos; above the ground and moved in a slight up and down movement but made no sound. Being frightened by this unexpected sight, I quickly went back into my house.  After some time, I ventured back outside to see if the sphere was gone.  After looking around I saw that it had traveled across the road, and over our large farm pond and was now down behind a row of trees on the other side.  It&apos;s up and down movement seemed to be more pronounced but otherwise remained stable.  I once again retreated back into my house.  Not untill that evening did I venture back out to find that the object was gone.((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date in March 1962.

When we got out of the car, I glanced up at the clear night sky and noticed two very bright white lights centered between the bottom two stars of the constellation Orion. They were not flashing or twinkling and looked in brightness like the planet Venus, but they were two lights. I pointed the lights out to my wife and daughters. We observed the stationary bright lights for about 1 minute, trying to make sense of what we were seeing. Then the lights suddenly began to dim as though moving away at a high rate of speed and moved slightly up in tandem. After about 3 or 4 seconds the lights no longer visible at all. We went into our home and I checked the program Starry Night Pro Plus 6 on our home computer to see if any astronomical event was occurring in the vicinity of Orion that might explain what we had just seen. Nothing should have been visible in the area of Orion where we saw the lights, between the bottom two stars of the constellation", "Three white lights over Goose Creek-North Charleston - maybe pursued by USAF fighters?Conditions &ndash; very clear cool night.  Moonrise had not occurred yet. Upon leaving our house (facing east towards Highway 176) to get in the car, I noticed red lights of fast moving aircraft moving roughly north.  Living within a few miles of airport &ndash; this was not unusual, but they were moving very fast and were fairly low (I would say 500-1000 ft.) above a residential area.  They made a fairly tight arcing turn left and back around over Crowfield Lake/swamp to a SSE trajectory and happened to come right over our street.  The fighters made a distinctive sound and I would guess they were F-16&rsquo;s from Shaw AFB in Sumter.  Charleston AFB does not have fighters as permanent party residents.  The 4 fighters were all less than 2 plane widths apart &ndash; definitely not a typical formation over a densely populated area at night.  Now really interesting part. Thinking that that was an unusual flight pattern for a Saturday night my wife and I got in the car and started driving to North Charleston.  Just as we were leaving our neighborhood we saw 3 unusual white lights about the height of a cell tower (200 ft or so) over the Goose Creek Reservoir Swamp (between Wannamaker Park and Goose Creek).  We saw the lights for about ten seconds, and then they were gone.  We drove back around the same way later, and were not able to see the same thing again, so it was not some errant streetlight.  So either it was a plane that crashed into the swamp or something else.  There were no blinking white or red lights, no anti-collision lights, just three very bright white lights (almost life bright streetlights) 200 feet over a place where there are no streets. It is now 2152 as of this writing and a family member also claims to have seen a strangely flying white light from the Isle of Palms connector looking toward the big dipper.  Apparently this light was moving erratically (fast then slow then fast then slow again) for about 45 seconds.  Apparently then they disappeared - I will try to pick more details out later.", "Object shaped like a backslash (&#x5C;) zoomed across downtown Providence sky.I was driving down North Main Street in Providence towards downtown.  It was sunset so  the airplanes over the city had their lights on which attracted my attention to the sky.  All of the sudden I saw a silver diagonal line much like a backslash (&#x5C;) zoom across the sky right over the city towards college hill.  It was moving faster than anything I had ever seen and as soon as I realized what was going on, it disappeared.", "3 balls of light, moving in a weird triangle formation.I just reported a sighting earlier at around 21:07 PM EST., about a single ball of light. I was just again, outside smoking a cigarette, while I noticed 3 more balls of light, they were not flashing, just sold white light. The 3 were flying, very high, in a crooked triangle formation. Preceeding noticing them, I saw an aircraft, 757, most likely, flying towards Fort Meyers International Airport. There 3 balls of light, were flying away from it. I am not sure of what direction it is, I am new to the area and rather confused as to the layout. I have never in my life, seen anything like it. I had to constantly, look away and tell myself, I can not be just seeing things. Totally bizzare.", "Slopw moving orange glowing object, then a single light and extremely fast movingOn December 31, 2007, my 2 sons (ages 20 &amp; 17) and I were on the driveway of my parent&rsquo;s home in Groves, Texas. We saw a slow moving object in the sky coming from the southwest direction. The object appeared as if it had large yellowy, orange flood lights shinning from every side of it and the lights looked like they were in a fog (a hazy, glow around the object). I looked everywhere else in the sky and the sky was very clear. The object was large. My sons thought it was a helicopter and they heard a sound from it.It moved slowly across the sky at a 45 degree angle between us and due south of us. As it got approximately due south of us, the orangey lights went off and a small single white light was on it (not shining out from it, just on it). The object was not hazy anymore. The sound stopped and it changed direction immediately (not a smooth turn, but instantly). It moved towards the southeast sky from our location. After it changed direction, the object moved extremely fast and was gone in approximately 3 to 4 seconds. The object then looked as if it was extremely high in the sky and went higher as it moved away. It did not go out of sight towards the horizon, but went out of sight moving up and away. A plane could not have covered that much distance that quickly.My son called the local airport that night and again the next day (to talk to someone else) to ask if anything had been reported. They had no reports of anything. The sky was very clear that night and stars were all around.", "silver sphere in the skys of palmdalewe were in my brothers back yard cooking hamburgers and i looked up and there it was way up in the sky was this silver sphere. it seemed to be standing still as if it were taking pictures of earth. we looked at it for about 45 seconds when it seemed to catch us looking at it. thats when it shot into space whithin seconds we couldnt see it anymore.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I opened my left side window to watch as the UFO passed approximately 500 ft. underneath my plane (this distance is only an estimate on my part). I then banked the plane to the left so that I would not lose sight of the saucer as it when under the nose of my aircraft. The UFO continued on a straight and level path, and although my air speed was 110 m.p,h. the UFOs speed was such that there was no way I could catch up to it. If I had to approximate it&apos;s speed, I would guess at 400-600 m.p.h. The saucer never deviated from it&apos;s straight course. As for the size of the UFO, I can&apos;t really say, since there was nothing that I could compare it to. But if I had to guess, I would say about 30 to 50 feet in diameter. It happened so quickly, but I did get a very good look at it. There were no windows or any markings on the UFO saucer. The colour was a dull silver, almost a grey colour. I usually carry a camera in the side carrying pouch by the pilot&apos;s door. But this time, the camera was in a sports bag behind the rear passenger seat. There was no way of getting access to the camera. If I had a passenger with me that could have handed me the camera, I would have been able to get a very good picture with my 35mm camera! Now when I go flying, I always make sure that I have at least two cameras with me at all times. This was a once in a life time experience. It is now 20 years since I had my UFO encounter. To this day, I have had no other experiences with UFO sightings from the ground or in the air.", "triangular shaped object over SW Ohio, moving very slowly and completely silentMy wife and I were returning from dropping our son off at his mother&apos;s house in Midland Ohio. It was somewhere around 10pm in late November or mid December, probably 1994. We decided to take a short-cut over the back roads through the cornfields just outside of Blanchester Ohio. It was very dark, no street lights and no moon, and I noticed some lights approaching us over the cornfields from my left. At first I thought it was a low flying aircraft but it was moving very slowly. I took a second glance at it and noticed that there were three white lights in a triangular formation (one in the front and two to the rear). The lights did not blink and there were no red or blue lights, only white. I was intriqued by the fact that it seemed so close to the ground it must have been coming in for a landing, but I didn&apos;t know of any airports close by. Thinking that it must have been in trouble and was attempting a landing in the cornfield, I pulled the car over, turned off the engine and got out to take a closer look. My wife followed. By this time it was crossing the road in front of us. It was and equilateral triangle and appeared to be the size of a small jet flying very low. From our perspective it was about five inches long in the sky. It was a very quiet night... no tree frogs, no crickets and no traffic.... the object made absolutely no sound. We watched it fly over and off into the distance. We live in a flight path and I have seen all sorts of aircraft fly over at all times of the day, It wasn&apos;t like any aircraft I had ever seen. I had thought at the time that it must have been an hang glider, but why would anyone be flying a hang glider in Blanchester Ohio after dark and in the middle of winter? Maybe it was an experimental aircraft from Wright Patterson? It wasn&apos;t until years later, when I heard of eyewitnesses in Belgium seeing the same sort of objects around the same time that I realized what we had seen. While I have always believed in the possibility of extraterrestrial visitations, I! have al ways been very skeptical when it comes to eyewitness accounts. I&apos;m still not certain that this was extraterrestrial but I am certain that it wasn&apos;t like anything I had ever seen before. I have seen all sorts of aircraft (military and civillian), I have seen flares dropped from aircraft, I have seen blue flaming meteorites and hundreds of &quot;shooting stars&quot;, I have seen durigables and hot air balloons, I have seen high altitude weather baloons, I have seen satilites.... planets.... and comets.  The thing we saw that night wasn&apos;t like anything I had ever seen before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "bright object high in the sky, rotates and hovers constantly. almost like an insect.I&apos;ve seen this object or craft many times throughout the years in 3 different locations where I&apos;ve lived in Fredericksburg. Object appears high in the sky, appearing higher than most planes fly and definitely higher than any helicopter. (and moving FAR differently than those crafts.)  At a glance it appears to be just another star but if you set your eyes on it, you begin to notice movements not unlike that of an insect of some sort. It will start in one spot, hover around in circular motions and end up back in its original spot. Although I&apos;ve seen this object many times, tonight is the first night that I&apos;ve noticed the lights. I always thought it was just putting off one beam that stayed in place but tonight I can see that the lights seem to be rotating around the object. Very bright like the light from a large star but definitely not a star. I dont know anything about weather balloons or satelites but I dont think they operate like this. I just want to know if anyone else in the area has seen this. The last thing I&apos;d like to say is... a few years ago, I was living with my parents and saw this object (or one like it)early in the morning, about 2am. My dog began barking loudly and fiercely soon after I spotted it. Not barking at the object but something off in the woods almost directly under where the object was located. Needless to say, I was alarmed quite a bit. Soon after, he got worse.. howling and I looked in the direction he was barking and saw, from what I could tell, was a man running in some sort of metal armor but was so quick that he was gone within seconds. About 3 days later, I got home and my dog had broken his chain and was gone from sight and didnt return. The next day, I went riding around to look to see if he had been hit by a car on the main road. Sure enough, it appeared he had been hit. The strange thing though is that, any time previously when he had gotten loose, he NEVER strayed nearly as far as where I found him. Maybe I&apos;m just paranoid but my instinct told me that the night with the object and the barking had something to do with it. So maybe i&apos;m just paranoid but I&apos;d love to hear from some other Virginia people about this. Thank you.", "This shape reminded me of the Phoenix lights because it was a Triangle.On Feb 19th at 19:00 hours I was driving down River Rd in NW Tucson when I saw a set of 6 lights in the shape of a upside down V that were going across the Rincon Mountains.

PD))", "Witnessed numerous UFO&apos;s along I-5 from Stockton south to Tehachipi on busy holiday weekend.This event took place in 1973. I was 21 years old and traveled from San Diego County to Portland Ore with my brother and his wife on 4th of July weekend.  My brother was in army aviation at the time and I was a student pilot.  Another brother was an air controller for the SAC, a close cousin an army pilot and his brother an Air Force kicker.  We grew up adjacent to air bases: Kirkland, Biggs, Mira Mar and Camp Pendleton. We are very familiar with aircraft and their abilities. On the return trip from Portland we were at the cloverleaf of I-5 and I-580 in the Stockton California area at dusk. (perhaps 8PM). The freeways were very busy. My brother and I saw a craft coming from our 10 o&apos;clock position very low. Our first assumption was that it was a crop duster as they are common in that vicinity and they prefer to work right up to sunset. The craft had three lights, red, green and amber, not unlike any aircraft except that they were in the wrong positions and the anti-collision lamp did not blink. The craft came in right over our windshield at about 60 -100 ft AGL!  We looked directly up at it but only saw a blur. It appeared to be transparent. It past over us to our 2 o&apos;clock position and only about 300 ft lateral and 100 ft altitude. I got a good look at it. It was tubular with a simple frame for a fuselage. The craft was transparent as if made from see through covering. It had short stubs protruding from its sides that were not sufficient to be wings or airfoils. It had no engines. It immediately, without turning, returned in our direction while descending.  An impossible maneuver for any aircraft that I know of. It&apos;s speed was slow, perhaps 45mph. The stubs turned out to have bright lamps attached and they were activated nearly blinding us. The craft flew down to the deck illuminating the field of wheat (or rice) and pushing it aside as it moved a few feet above it. I again got a close look and the craft was not a duster or helicopter. I have never known dusters to use lights as dusting is too dangerous at night. We looked at other motorists at they seemed not to notice. We followed the progress of the crafts as it continued to crisscrossed I-5 in a similar fashion as we moved south at about 80 mph. Complete darkness fell swiftly. We then saw many craft with two lights performing the same maneuvers amongst the fields. They were acting as if they were looking for something on the ground by &quot;strafing&quot; it with their lights which were too close together to be mistaken as autos in the distance. We also noticed that at times they would stop and hover over the California Aqueduct and shine their beams downward. We stopped several times to witness the events. Though many times the hovering objects were close they made no sound. Again other motorists seemed to notice nothing. There were usually three in sight at all times. We tried to rationalize that it was helicopters, agricultural machinery or autos in the distance. However, in the following years i made that same trip many times at night and never saw anything like it again. Our only rational thought was that it was police looking for someone. We listened to the radio in ernest hoping for a news announcement. Of course there was none.The object(s) began following us at fence top level along the opposite side of the freeway, about 100 yards behind. We tested them several times by speeding up to 140 mph and then slowing to about 20mph. The craft(s) kept pace with us! When they seemed to be bored with this game they would fly off laterally at high speed but still stay within sight. Often they would be replaced by another in their former position. After the initial first sighting near Stockton, my sister-in-law fell asleep in the back seat. We attempted several times over the next few hours to awake her to witness the show but were unable to. She was clearly alive but slapping and shaking could not wake her. We were totally confused and decided to stop in at a truck stop a few miles off the freeway near the bottom of the Grapevine. We had witnessed this phenomenon for about three hours at this point. We made casual inquiries in the restaurant of the staff and truckers but no one saw anything. My sister-in-law remained unconscious. We continued on our trip south and had no more sightings. Upon awaking the next day my brother and I went over what had transpired. We discovered that we were missing somewhere between 90 and 180 minutes of time. We checked our gas receipts which were dated and time stamped and new our speed averaged 80 mph except for the few times we stopped which we accounted for. We had no sensation that we were abducted then or since and suffered no ill effects. Many years later I read a book by a UFO investigator that stated that 1973 was a big &quot;flap&quot; year in California and the Central Valley in general.", "Bright blue sphere traveling incredibly fast.I was traveling north bound on rt 8 with my fianc&eacute;.

It moved slowly and in a straight line and took around 5 minutes to go from horizon to horizon. We were in a valley at the time, so the mountains were fairly close, and the horizons were only a few miles apart.We are positive it was not a cloud as the sky was perfectly clear.

Then we looked up a little higher and we saw three jets at first they look like they was just going across but then they starting racing towards the &quot;light&quot;. At first I thought they were regular plane but they were too high and moving fast. Then the light&quot; starting moving south.  As the jets got closer to the &quot;light&quot; it stated to move faster.  So I told my son to get in the car because it&apos;s going in the direction we are going.  I could barely keep my eyes on the road because i was too busy looking up &quot;accident waiting to happen&quot;.  As we travel south on 460 to the Elliston area the light started to slight disapear (it look like it was now some where past blacksburg area) then from the southeast we saw another jet or miltary plane moving fast in the same direction as the other 3 jets and the &quot;Light&quot;. After that i couldn&apos;t see any more because of the mountains.  Whatever it was the i know the military was going after.   If i saw that &quot;Light&apos; i know others had to see it as well.  I am Christain and i believe in GOD and i don&apos;t believe in UFO or anything like that.  But after seeing what me and my son saw today make me think other wise.  I sometimes hear the miliatary planes fly over our area for training purposes but this time they were no-where to heard but only to be seen racing across the sky.", "Traingle Ufoseen at 11:00 pm a triangle shape craft UFO lights on the sides and in the middle in a line was bigger then a airplane about 700 or 1000 ft up in the air moving slowly and headed north east", "Four stationary light objects at Sunrise in the Eastern sky1/26/08 Was outside, noticed four stationary light objects at sunrise. Clouds were moving, but objects were not. The photos were taken within seconds of each other and the pattern remained visible until other clouds covered them.Objects seemed to be translucent and all connected. Estimate the objects to be about a mile and a half in length.", "Coming home from a board meeting I saw a black triangle over a house in my neighborhood. I slowed, turned off my radio, rolled down my window - it was silent about the size of the roof of a standard 1,500 sq. ft. home. On each tip there was a dim light. The object was low.I was on a trip when a young man mentioned seeing a triangle-shaped ship in Columbia/Waterloo, Illinois. I hadn&apos;t mentioned my sighting, so I asked him questions and he described what I had seen. He was on Route 3 on his way to work. The timing was the same time of year.END PS: A couple who are friends of mine witnessed a giant ship over the Lake of the Ozarks along with their two sons. He stated that the ship was gian, cigar-shaped, silent and moved very slowly over the lake - they witnessed this from a balcony of the place where they were staying (hotel/condo?). They said that the ship slowly turned and then shot away at extraordinary speeds. Also, they said that some of the lights were intensely bright.Thank You for your service.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates approximate date.

This came from the south and was at first a gold light it had flashing lights, not constant, but flashing faster than an airplanes and had no pattern. Also, they didn&apos;t make much noise. At first I thought they were choppers, but they were too silent for choppers. They seemed to be in a chopper shape though or airplane shape. The only other possibility is a government new-aircraft. I saw what was clearly a gvt plane fly after one of the things, but it was dark and I&apos;m unsure of all of this. I saw an at least regular airplane right after so I knew it wasn&apos;t one.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was 14 or 15 years old at the time and I was with two high school classmates. We were sitting on a park bench in the Sawyer elementary school playground. This is on the south side near 51st and Kedzie. It was summer vacation and we were out late (about 10 PM). It was already dark but as anyone who knows the city will tell you, the lights from the city will illuminate anything in the air. We noticed this object (which looked like a disk from our angle) move from our right to our left (this equates to south to north). It was fairly large and fairly close. I was about the size of a 474 jumbo jet and it was close enough to look like an airplane making a landing at nearby Midway Airport. It moved very slowly and there was no sound at all. As I said it looked like a disk from the angle we were viewing it at and it did not have sharp edges &ndash; they were more rounded. The edges had what looked like portholes (round windows) around the periphery of the object. The inside of the object was very brightly lit and it looked like people moving around behind those portholes! I remember seeing at least one &ldquo;person&rdquo; who appeared to be looking at the bird&rsquo;s eye view of the city! I think the object was rotating but very slowly. Other than the light from the windows there were no other lights. We watched it slowly make its way very far north and we were able to follow its path until it just appeared as a spec of light which then moved east and disappeared. We were all very exited about this sighting and we decided to call the police to report it. It turned out that many, many people had called about this and the official police explanation was that it was an airplane towing an illuminated sign. I never believed that explanation because I know what I saw and it was NOT an airplane towing a sign. If anyone else saw this on that night in Chicago please tell what you saw. I would appreciate hearing that someone else was witness to this strange object (notice I did NOT call it a craft although I believe that is what it was). There is one person here who describes the same thing but with square windows and he says it was in September 1964. I am fairly certain that my date is correct &ndash; summer of 1962.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Flashing LED lights and such illumination of blue, green, and short spurts of yellow.It hovered about an eyeshot away and just hovered for 3 hrs.

I was up in the Flatirons with my friend ((name deleted)) and saw what appeared to be a white disk flash across the sky.  It was westward from us and we saw it for approximately 7 seconds.  It was headed from north to south, with several dipping motions in the process. It was difficult to make out what was in the sky because I was on my knees.", "Bright-White round-shape in the sky for a couple of secondsSaw something that looked like a full moon, only bigger. It was very bright and only lasted for a couple of seconds. I was watching TV at the time with my father and we both saw it high in the sky through the patio window in our family room.", "Yellow oval UFO exits cloud bank above Snolqualmie Forest foothills and disappears in cloud to South.I was stopped in the right turn lane, two or three cars back from the stop bar looking east at the intersection of 38th St. and Pacific Ave. in Tacoma, WA.  It was approximately 4:40 p.m. and the weather was overcast with some sunbreaks but mostly low, billowy gray and white clouds and a light gray cover that completely obscured the Cascades and Mt. Rainier from my view. As the traffic began to move, I saw a yellowish orb (shaped like a tic-tac from my vantage point.) exit a gray cloudbank to the north, and move at a constant velocity and altitude above what I presume were, the foothills of the Snoqualmie forest in the Enumclaw vicinity. Within seconds of seeing the object, I made a quick glance to my right to make my turn onto Pacific Ave heading south. I looked to the east and fortunately I was able see it again, between the telephone poles, in about its last 1/3 of visible travel before it entered a white cloud bank to the south. I had no time what so ever to try to grab my cell phone camera and miss the opportunity to witness and/or try to identify what I was seeing. I estimate the distance from my vantage point to the object at approximately 15 to 20 miles, (using Google Earth).  At that distance, I could not make out any surface features, hear any sound, or observe any contrails or changes in its color, shape, or trajectory. When the object disappeared into the white cloudbank, I immediately looked at the clock in my truck, which is accurate to a minute or so.  It was 4:40 p.m.   I started to write down this info as I drove south down Pacific Ave. From my vantage point with the hills visible behind it, the objects trajectory and size reminded me of one of many film clips I have seen countless times on television, of jet aircraft flying nearly nap of the earth, dropping ordinance with the desert hills in the background. In contrast, less than 5 minutes down the road at the intersection of 72nd and Pacific, I looked up and saw a 727 looking jet liner very high in the sky, but obviously low enough to clearly recognize as an commercial aircraft. I grew up in Lakewood WA, very close to McChord AFB.  I have observed many aircraft fly at varying altitudes around Tacoma for over 30 years.   I soloed a crusty Cessna C-150 at Shelton Airport in the summer of 1986.   I became proficient at recoqizing aircraft, especially F-16s, F-15s and F-18s by their vertical stabilizer orientation at very long distances.  I feel I would have recognized the profile of the object as a fighter jet or a light plane at that distance except that it travel much to fast to be a light plane.  Also, even though there may have been a break in the clouds, a glint from an aircraft windscreen does not look like a yellow orb.  Fighter Jets don&rsquo;t fly along the Snoqualmie Forest. My conclusions are that it was either:  1) Ball Lighting 2) Super secret Boeing aircraft developed over the decades from captured Nazi plans and prototypes.3) An example of the yellowish appearing, cigar / orb shape UFO seen and filmed throughout recent history.", "Small miniture light very high for 5 seconds. Then vanished upwardNot a cloudy day. A small light appeared to come down for about 5 seconds then it went slowly upward, and dissappeared. Appeared to be like a small light. I know for shure it was not a aiprlane, beacuse it was to high and it eleveted upward then vanished. I just mentioned a word abot UFo to my brother, and it happened 5 minutes afterward.", "Unknown Spotlight flashes on CanyonThe event in question took place just outside of a very small farming town called Mecca, Ca. This town is very close to the Salton Sea in Southern California. It was a very dark night, me and my good friend were just driving through a small canyon, this canyon was very short with windy roads, so you can&rsquo;t drive fast thru this canyon. The sky was clear with very few clouds. We were driving the speed limit which was 40 MPH through this short canyon.  We were just about to reach the end of this small canyon, when all of a sudden I saw out the corner of my eye a very bright spotlight, similar to a spotlight that police helicopters use. It was showing at the top of the canyon, at that moment I told my friend to look, the spotlight seemed to be moving parallel to the car. The spotlight flashed on for about 20-30 seconds, then it would disappear, we turned off the music in the car, rolled down the windows to listen for any sound, we heard nothing, it was really shocking to me, I am a very logical person, who was very skeptical about UFO&rsquo;s. But on that night I became a believer. My friend and I could not see the source of this very bright spotlight, we could not hear any sound of any kind.  This is what had my friend and I shocked. The spotlight was following parallel to our vehicle for another 3-4 minutes. It would flash on for about 20-30 seconds, it was moving, it must have flashed on and off five or six times, reflecting of the tops of the short canyons. I turned to my friend and said, No one is going to believe what we just saw, he looks at me in amazement, and said, I know. We both still have this encounter very fresh in our minds; we will never forget what we saw that night. I am a believer!((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

While driving south on PA State Route 51 a few miles south of downtown Pittsburgh just after noon a darker spot appeared in the end of one of these clouds seen at the top right of the windshield.  A quick look determined it was probably a puff of black smoke but another look was surprising to see a round saucer shapped craft slide out of the cloud into clear blue sky.  It was moving slowly from right to left bringing it closer but was tipped at about a 45 degree away.  Shortly after appearing in clear sky the craft went to a higher level about twice the height it had been at.  When it reached the higher level it still had the slow sideward motion and same degree of tip.  The motion to the higher lever was faster than the slow sideward movement but did not start out slow then get faster and slow down before stopping.  It was one smooth move and being tipped at that degree it carried the craft farther away and easily seen from the top of the windshield as it slowly crossed over the highway.  When it reached a point where it could be seen out of the driver&apos;s side window it suddenly came back down to about the same level it was when first seen.  The smooth fast motion back down was the same as when it went up and the tip never changed so it came closer.  When it stopped it still had the same slow sideward motion and it was observed sliding into the end of another cloud roll.  This craft never wavered and moved as if it was following a beam, when it went higher the craft maintained the same slant.  Assuming the visible part was the bottom of the craft no features,lights or sound was noted.  Judging by the height of the hills and clouds the size of this disc would be about the same as a small plane&apos;s wingspan.

Her nephew had run to her saying they saw something and it looked like an asteroid entered into the atmosphere and exploded.  I ran outside for a look and immediately ran in for my family. I called my niece and had her on the phone.When I looked up it looked like a bright yellow tinted haze at first. We continued to watch because the haze began to change a little, it expanded and got brighter. As we were watching we saw something fly quickly up beside it on the right. The object went up and over the top of the haze and disappeared. Then another appeared on the right side it was flying slow at first and then it shot off across the sky, we never took our eyes off of it. It went across our horizon and then it stopped and went back in the other direction. As it approached the haze another bright object flew up and disappeared below the haze, then the 2nd object just disappeared.Next the bottom left corner of the haze looked as if it was funneling, just the corner of it. It was like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. We were in awe and yelling at each other &ldquo;do you see that&rdquo;. Then through the center if the funnel shot out a bright round object. It flew directly out then around to the right side, flew up and then disappeared.The skies were clear and beautiful, not a cloud in site.  I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what that haze was but there is no denying the 4 objects we saw.  To me, they didn&rsquo;t appear to be in our atmosphere but above it although I&rsquo;m not sure.The whole experience lasted about 25 minutes.  The haze didn&rsquo;t completely fade for another 10 minutes then it was completely gone.The witnesses were myself 32, my husband 31, my sister 28, her husband 30, my 2 daughters 7 &amp; 11, and my niece 16 who lives 3 miles away.", "Unknown Red Oval in the sky over the San Francisco Bay AreaRed Oval shape with orange circler lighting circling around the oval moving at slow pace from San Francisco to San Jose.

From my job, there is an Air Force base (strategically put there I begin to wonder??) about 15-20 mins car ride away...After observing the lights for several minutes, an air force fighter jet flew across the sky from west to east and then disappeared... Within a minute or two of the fighter jet leaving, the pack of 5 smaller lights broke up and moved side-to-side up VERY quickly until they all disappeared.  (From the moment they started ascending til they were no longer visible must&apos;ve been about 20 seconds)  Then the two lights that were next to the brightest one also broke away and ascended very quickly.. The last and brightest one ascended quickly but did not fully disappear...Most of my co-workers had stopped watching at this point, however I followed this bright one as it moved in the SE direction for close to 45 mins and eventually disappeared...I checked the next day the see if anyone had reported anything and I tried googling but nothing ever came up...After reading descriptions of sightings on here, I had to post because some stories are EERILY similar to mine.

PD))Inquiry into alleged crash of unknown aircraft.Joint Investigation by NUFORC and MUFON of Georgia, Fireball, Columbus Georgia  Occurred : 11/29/2006 16:00 (Entered as : 11292006 16:00) Reported: 11/30/2006 5:27:48 AM 05:27 Posted: 12/7/2006 Location: Columbus, GA Shape: Fireball Duration: Unknown  (NOTE:  Readers, for a full understanding of the following described inquiry, please see full original witness account at NUFORC; Columbus Georgia, Fireball, Posted 12/7/2006). Recap-  A resident of Columbus Georgia, a retired educator holding a PhD, was reportedly ill on 28Nov06 and did not follow the normal local news of the day.  The next day, on 29Nov06, he discovered the circumstances of the 28Nov06 Columbus suspected &apos;airplane crash&apos; as covered by the local TV station and newspaper.  At that point, he was mystified by certain events that had occurred earlier that day (29th) in relation to the Columbus Airport, said area which he had driven past in his automobile.  These unusual events described by the witness at the airport involved an alleged unmarked 727 that was taxied close to the adjacent roadway, and was suspected of causing the witness&apos; passing vehicle to stall, as if some unknown electronic device was in operation from within the craft. Other unusual circumstances relating to this are described in the original account. The below described inquiry attempted to sort out all of the matters described by the witness in his NUFORC statement, which basically alleged that something unknown was recovered and then secretly removed from Columbus Georgia by agencies unknown. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  On Thursday evening, 7Dec06, Peter Davenport, the Director of the National UFO Reporting Center, contacted this writer and described the account posted by the witness in this case.An agreement was reached to further scrutinize the situation. Unavoidable events then occurred which delayed movement on this investigation in the desired prompt manner.  This writer was in the process of returning to MUFON after a 2+ year absence, and was in a transitional phase.  Furthermore the MUFON representative in Columbus Georgia had suffered an extreme medical condition which left him permanently disabled, and no other FIs were in close proximity.  This writer lives some 75 miles north of Columbus. Then during the first phases of the investigation, this FI developed an extreme case of the flu and bronchitis, with pneumonia, which lasted several weeks, most of which I was unable to speak properly. This writer contacted the witness by both phone and email and further discussed the account.  He was asked, and stated he would inquire, if his associate PhD, his passenger on 29Nov06, would also submit an account.  (This account was never produced). During these conversations, the witness stated that the local TV meteorologist (name on file) had stated that he had noticed a return on his Doppler radar unit about the time of the purported &apos;plane crash&apos; on 28Nov06, and that he had spoken to this meteorologist.  This writer identified the meteorologist and placed repeated phone calls to him which were NEVER returned.  An email also went UNANSWERED, as did a letter posted to him at the TV station. The witness had also described a quickly formed task force of search personnel that had been formed on 28Nov06 shortly after a &apos;crash witness&apos; had phoned 911.  This search party consisting of Columbus Police and Fire/Rescue, FAA, and soldiers from the adjacent massive Fort Benning. (NOTE: Sidebar-  This writer recalls seeing this large search operation covered by the local Atlanta TV stations, and the Columbus authorities stating, at sometime prior to 11:00PM, that no downed aircraft had been found). The area of the suspected downed aircraft, vicinity of 8801 Macon Road, is the location of the Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft facility. Furthermore said Macon Rd. actually forms part of the northern perimeter of the Fort Benning Army Base.  From past experience, this writer is aware that any major public safety emergency IMMEDIATELY outside of the base has been responded to by Army emergency personnel due to the the possible effects on the base itself and due to the Army being a &apos;good neighbor&apos; to the local Columbus authorities.  Thus a response by the Army Military Police, Provost, or base public safety personnel, is not unusual in a case such as a possible downed aircraft. In this same vein, this writer contacted the Director of Security for the Pratt &amp; Whitney facility (name on file).  He stated that he recalled the afternoon of the event.  The police had sent an officer out ahead to check on conditions as the search was organized and deployed.  He spoke to the officer, but could report nothing vital.  The DirSec&apos;s office is elevated, and he stated that it overlooks most of the area in question in a panoramic view, and that he had noticed nothing extraordinary such as a crashing aircraft or similar. This writer also contacted the Columbus Police i.e. 911 Center to locate records of the initial emergency call and the original &apos;plane crash&apos; witness.  This writer was bounced around to different divisions, and generally ignored for days on end.  Past professional contacts in that agency maintained when this writer was a Chief of Police had been transferred or also retired.  This investigator then filed a request for records under the &apos;Georgia Open Records Act&apos;, a state law similar to the FOIA.  This produced what was described as the only record relating to the event (since they maintain that nothing was found), a 911 dispatch card.  It listed the original caller&apos;s name and not much else.  The nature of the &apos;call&apos; was described as &quot;Caller sts seen a plane go down north east of Pratt Whitney&quot;.  Time received 15:56:14; Time dispatched 15:56:19; Time arrived 16:08:52. This writer phoned the name listed as the original 911 witness, with NO response.  A complete letter of explanation of our needs, insuring confidentiality, and a SASE, was then mailed to the witness, again with NO response. This writer also filed detailed FOIA covering all aspects of this matter to the FAA.  On 30March07, the FAA responded stating that &quot;........searched our files........could NOT find any records responsive to your request....&quot;  During this inquiry, the writer earlier contacted a journalist with the largest Columbus newspaper (organ and name on file).  This individual had demonstrated in past years that he was a friend of Ufology, of MUFON of Georgia and ISUR in particular.  All aspects were explained to him as well as request for informational help through his various contacts among the local government and community.  He agreed to &apos;make some calls&apos; and pass any info to this writer.  This individual developed nothing more than what was already known about the search for a downed aircraft, which he had monitored on his public safety scanner. Also contacted was the Air Force Space Command.  This writer sent a request to Lieutenant ______ ______, USAF (name on file) explaining what information we sought  regarding returning space junk and re-entering debris.  The answer came on 5Jan07, indicating that the 1st Space Command Control Squadron at Cheyenne Mountain AF Station confirmed that there was NO returning orbital debris being tracked in the vicinity of the southeastern USA at the times in question.  Likewise the Joint Space Operations Center Weather Flight that there were no unusual space or terrestrial weather phenomena observed during the same time period.  A note added, in order to discuss meteors, refer to NASA. The following data highlights should be noted, as it was taken directly from the data base of NUFORC, regarding the following states in the southeastern USA;  28Nov06, between 4:00PM  and 9:00PM and later;  Georgia- EST zone- Dacula, 7PM, Bright green object like shooting star, seemed to stop....moved on.Nahunta, 7PM, fireball observed, no color given. Dalton, 7PM, fireball observed, long tail, shooting across sky, changing pink and green, broke into 2-3 pieces, vanished.  Rome 6:35PM, fireball glowing green, NW to south, broke up into several pieces, appeared to strike earth, witness suspected space debris or meteor. Lawrenceville 6:30PM, very bright green light &apos;eyebrow shape&apos;, silent, very high-speed. Rising Fawn, 6:15PM, 2 round green lights falling toward horizon, aqua-green, no tail, like pencil erasure held AAL, witness later heard Chattanooga weather report of fireball meteors. Alabama- CST zone- Birmingham, 1st, 5:30PM, Blu-grn ball of light; 2nd, 5:30PM, green light streaking across sky, thicker tail than meteor, seemed close to ground, went over a &apos;mountain&apos;, gone; 3rd, 5:30PM, large round bright green circle, WNW to ESE, seemed to be meteor; 4th, brilliant green light to NE, quicker than a plane, 45 degree angle to earth, lost behind trees; 5th, 5:30PM, large green fireball, W to E, surrounded by glowing white light, tail like a comet, next day news said NASA had no meteor reports, news called it a &apos;UFO&quot;.  Pinson, 5:35PM, fireball, white then turned green, vanished behind trees....said landed 2 miles away. Huntsville, 5:30PM, bright green light, traveled east over Chapman Mountain, very fast, wife saw same from different location miles away, like Roman Candle. Bremen, 5:30PM, bright green fireball, falling, resembled fire works display. (NOTE: Alabama Sidebar--The &apos;Decatur Alabama Daily News&apos; ran a story in their 29Nov06 edition.  &quot;Lights in Sky Probably Space Junk or Meteor&quot;.  Thumbnail--The 911 Center in Morgan County began receiving calls at 5:28PM CST on 28Nov06, that a brilliant lime-green light had appeared and the callers were claiming it was a &apos;downed aircraft&apos;.  A multi-agency public safety search effort was mounted in the area and no downed aircraft was found.  Local astronomers went on to describe space junk, and so forth.  Including that lime-green would be consistent with burning aluminum re-entering the earth&apos;s atmosphere. A University of Alabama astronomer stated the &quot;sightings were too late to be explained by the meteor shower that took  place last week&quot;.  (Leonids).  Article went on to discuss bolides, the differences in the way the human eye perceives color and a recent golf shot made by a Russian cosmonaut that hit a golf ball into orbit to become &apos;space junk&apos;). Tennessee, split into EST and CST zones- Knoxville, 1st, 10:45PM, 8-10 blu-grn lights, very bright, circular, largest like 1/2 moon, others smaller, E to SE, seemed 60-100mph, large aircraft like a &apos;tanker&apos; seen following behind; 2nd, 6:30PM, 5 very bright blue lights, silent, passed overhead, vanished, distant boom then heard, 5 minutes another boom; 3rd, 6:30PM, large blue fireball, moving east, unlike &apos;shooting star&apos;, traveled 180 degrees, broke into 2-3 pieces, reminded witness of shuttle breakup. Chattanooga, 6:30PM, bright green light, silent, as if 100 feet above ground, intense light, looked as if had 2 parts, shot forward then gone, policeman stopped, got out and looked.  Soddy Daisy, 6:30PM, 2 bright green lights close to horizon, falling at angle, witness says could make out a cylinder or cigar shape from which lights seem to come.....vanished.....neighbor saw same driving miles away. Oliver Springs, fireball, streak of light, NW to ESE, saw 4-5 balls develop from it, burned, went dark. Kentucky, split into EST and CST zones. Stanford, 6:30PM, very fast green light, W to E, strange shade of green.  Hyden, 5:00PM, 7-8 blu-grn lights, appeared far away, detected circular motion. North Carolina, EST zone.  Marshall, 7:00PM, green light, too fast for an aircraft, S to N, seemed 5 inches off horizon AAL.  Marble, 6:50PM, bright green light, silent, illuminated clouds, moving to NE, seemed 3000-4000 feet, 200-400 mph.  Boone, 6:40PM, fireball, large, bright green, poorly defined edges, clouds glowing green, changed direction slowly.Franklin, 6:25PM, 2 green lights, very fast, down then upwards, silent, one ahead of the other. While there is a difference in times, directions, and exact descriptions, there is enough probable cause therein to indicate there was in fact something afoot in the SE skies of the USA the evening of 28Nob06.  TOO MANY similarities not to have been connected to the same, or a series of, related aerial event(s). It&apos;s obvious from past investigations that a bolide, fireball, large meteor, or huge returning space junk, can be seen by ground observers MANY hundreds of miles apart.Likewise large meteor showers.  Past investigations have found CREDIBLE witnesses that all believed the light/object/fireball observed went to ground nearby when it actually traveled over the horizon, sometimes into another state.  A good example of this was a SC police helicopter pilot who made such an observation on the Ga/SC state line.  He was preparing to call out the search parties for a downed aircraft and actually landed his chopper to refuel so as to cross into Georgia to assist.  The object observed on that occasion was later tracked by citizen&apos;s reports across Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and on into Arkansas. During the course of this investigation, it was found that the previously orbiting Russian reconnaissance satellite Cosmos 2423 was launched on 14Sept06 and it&apos;s orbit began to decay before completion of it&apos;s expected appx. 120 day mission (possible mechanical malfunction).  Various sources indicated that the breakup began on or about 17-18November 2006 and the satellite was then destroyed at some point by ground command to better control any resulting impact damage and to prevent &apos;foreign&apos; intelligence services&apos; from retrieving any possible surviving components.  The U.S. Space Command indicated that Cosmos 2423 generated 28 cataloged fragments, NORAD catalog numbers 29604-29631.Additional speculation is that the now smaller Cosmos 2423 fragments might have taken as long as 30 days to re-enter the atmosphere, which puts the 28Nov06 date well within that window. One would like to think that the US Space Command would not be intentionally deceitful to the American public regarding requests for information, but in matters dealing with intelligence about reconnaissance efforts of a potential future foe, I&apos;m not so sure.  In fact, in such a case, I would fully EXPECT such matters to remain confidential within our military and intelligence community. Additional speculation on my part is that IF anything HAD been recovered during the Columbus Georgia &apos;downed aircraft search&apos;, and it rose to the level of requiring the find to remain secret or confidential, the Columbus Municipal Airport would be the last place used to remove it from the local scene.  The Columbus Airport is only some 4+ miles from the Ft. Benning base perimeter, and the location of the &apos;search&apos; area is practically atop the base&apos;s northern property line (Macon Road vicinity). Fort Benning Georgia is IMMEDIATELY adjacent the City of Columbus.  This fort is one of the largest U.S. Army installations in the world, and is the home of the Army&apos;s Airborne School, the Headquarters of the 75th Ranger Regiment, and the Infantry School. Official records indicate that Fort Benning, and it&apos;s various training commands, is serviced from within by Lawson Army Airfield which is capable of, and does, land the largest aircraft owned by the U.S. Government; the C-5, C-17, C-141, C-130 and others.  It is this writer&apos;s opinion that anything requiring such secrecy as described by the witness would have been flown out of Lawson Army Airfield.  Doing so would give TOTAL and COMPLETE control and security to such a confidential process.  Such security would be marginal, or non-existent, at a civilian municipal airport.  This is not to say that such a municipal airport has not been used during certain government projects, but again, anything arising to such a confidential level would be routed through a government installation if at all possible.......there is no doubt in my mind.Under such conditions it would be difficult indeed to prove for certain that anything clandestine took place. As to the circumstances of the event occurring on the airport access road i.e. the witness unexplained stalled vehicle near a 727 aircraft.  Over the course of this inquiry, the writer has touched base with various former and retired persons with a background in military intelligence and other electronic &apos;specialists&apos;.  Speculations vary, but in the opinion of one &apos;specialist&apos;, an electronic system that might cloak or disrupt the outside monitoring of the aircraft systems or communications........&quot;I would not be surprised if such devices exist.  But effecting nearby electronic components?  Likely not&quot;.  He went on to describe the need for this that some military aircraft might have......Air Force One, but such system would have to be discrete, being vital that it NOT affect other systems........further describing sound cancellation devices........additionally, the one successfully used with some Black Hawk helicopters and similar techniques used in our submarines. It&apos;s apparent that the Georgia &apos;downed aircraft witness&apos; saw something that led to notifying the authorities.  So did the witnesses in Decatur/Morgan County Alabama, both events leading to an official ground search. Did pieces of Russian Cosmos 2423 or some other satellite or space junk come down in the southeastern USA?  Not according to the USAF Space Command. Did the southeastern skies experience the &apos;Green Fireball&apos; phenomenon as have other parts of the USA in the past?  Perhaps. Was a truly anomalous event, including unknown craft, involved?  Maybe. The NUFORC and MUFON of Georgia wishes to take this opportunity to appeal to ALL future witnesses........when reporting any unknown aerial event, please do not hesitate to provide full information.  NUFORC Director Peter Davenport and the MUFON organization sometimes need ADDITIONAL information in cases that might prove vital to our understanding of the various aerial phenomenon.  Your identity will be protected to the fullest extent.  Who knows?  It could be you that provides the clue to opening up a whole new chapter in the study of these mysteries.

From arms lengths it was about 1 1/2 inches long. The estimated distance from me to the object was 1 1/2 to 2 miles away at an altitude of about two thousand feet. the object was stationary in the sky. The wind was blowing about 10 MPH. I was looking in a westerly direction walking down the 7th Fairway of 18 holes of golf I played today. The sky was perfectly clear...no clouds. Nothing else in the area of the sky where I was looking, not even birds. It was a dark silver or puter color, and there was no reflection from the object even though there was plenty of sunshine. The duration of the sighting was about 5 seconds, then it just wasn&apos;t there anymore.", "We saw two red orbs - The first one went up and over to the right - The second one stopped and became more intense in colour going form red to white - it then seemed to burst into a bright white light and poured out red/orange liquid -it wasn&apos;t a beam of light as it wasn&apos;t a straight line it was &quot;Drippy&quot; - The craft then followed the path of the liquid down to the ground- I couldn&apos;t see as it went behind some trees we could still see the red glow- Then the craft started to climb back up to its original position it went over to where the craft had stopped (it had now disappeared). We have no idea what it was.", "Large, low-flying square aircraft with lights in each corner moves quickly then makes a right turnI was out shoveling with my brother and a friend, and we saw this large, perfect-square aircraft over head, which had lights in each corner.

I viewed a brighly lit object streaking across the sky in a large arc. An estimated 12:00 to 9:00 arc at about 15-30 degrees above the horizon, and an estimated southwesterly direction from my vantage point, and heading south (parallel to my direction of travel). The objects &quot;tail&quot; was pastel green in color. It looked to seperate or breakup at the end of it&apos;s travel (like an explosion). In a very bright light as magnesium or titanium would look when it burns. Sort of like fireworks would look if you fired it horizontally. That&apos;s what I thought it was. Either that or an electric transformer. It looked very, very close.((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor at 05:28 hrs..

The completely,silent object had absolutely no sound and was so low to the ground that I felt as though I could throw a rock at it. I won&apos;t forget seeing the orangeish red lights come on one at a time it was so scary they were giant I had two brothers and three family friends that saw it and were so scared they won&apos;t even talk about it. Oh and when I came outside they were screaming about something falling out of the back of it. I watched it and followed it as it went off into the distance. I lived in the middle of a densely populated city of Stockton I can&apos;t believe no one reported it to the media I was only seventeen at the time and was pretty shook up and scared they were coming back. Oh and Hail-Bop comet was visible in the sky at that time which was scary enough to look at.

In order to get to the beach you have to cross a lagoon by boat. Since we arrived at around 11:00 PM there were obviously no more boats so we knew we&apos;d have to wait until the morning to go across.  The lagoon is not that big.  I parked my car in front of the lagoon and sat with my friend watching the sky.  We&apos;d been driving for several hours, so we were kind of tired.  Suddenly a huge, bright pink/orange colored round object departed from the ocean, and went into the sky.  If I had been alone, I would have thought I was hallucinating but my friend saw the same thing.  We were both speechless as we saw this object take off into the sky.  Instead of disappearing into the sky, it hovered about the ocean for several minutes.  The radiating colors of this craft were unforgettable.  When it was still, the light that it emitted would shine brighter.  But when it moved it would become more dim.  Finally it disappeared.  My friend and I had shared a strange moment that to this day, few people believe.  We slept in the car that night.  The next morning when we went across, we asked several people who lived and worked on the beach if they had ever seen something similar.  Apparently it is something very common to that area.  Everyone we talked to had seen these things, and it seems to be something very common.  If someone ever wants to see one of these, I recommend going to this same beach and watching the sky.  It has been happening regularly for years and I imagine it will probably continue to happen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was about 15 mins from Florence, TX when I saw a large spacecraft fly over head. It was flying low to the ground about as high as a low billboard. It made no sound. From underneath it was like a clover shape with three petals. It had intricate red lights on its underbelly which is how i was able to see the actual shape at night. This was very close so there was no mistake about what it was. I have seen all kinds of planes and jets because i grew up in Hampton Roads which is home to a number of military bases. I know what planes look like and sound like but this was truely not from here. I called the police department to make a report and the officer was shocked when I pointed out the aircraft made no sound so I felt like he knew this was very unusual.", "Rotating Saucer Shaped Object with Multicolored Lights Flying Over JacksonvilleI have debated whether I should share this story or not, but this has bothered me for almost 31 years.  Although time has faded my memory of the exact date and time of this event.  I will attempt to re-account my sighting. I was around 7 years old at them and it was in the evening perhaps in the spring/summer of 1976 and my parents, younger brother and I had stopped by a local McDonalds for a bite to eat.  We were eating inside our car in the parking lot when both my brother and I noticed a low flying rotating object flying over a strip mall across the street.  My parents dismissed it as an airplane or helicopter or something rationale, since Cecil Field was very close to this area,  but my brother and I were just fixated on this object!  The object was maybe 400-600 ft. up in the air as it flew over this strip mall moving from left to right in our field of vision.  The object was circular with multicolored lights (red, green, blue, etc.) around its edges, it rotated like a carousel with a slight tilt to the right and angled facing us so you could see it was circular.  I could see all the individual lights and the object itself rotating clockwise.  The object also had a single light on the top that illuminated a little bit of the surface around it.  We did not hear any noise that would suggest an airplane, helicopter or blimp. We eventually lost sight of this object, but I was left very shaken and the event has remained etched in my mind ever since.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I remember thinking about half an hour before this happened that I should stop staring at the sky because I never see anything anymore (I hadn&rsquo;t had a sighting since June of &rsquo;07, and they used to be relatively frequent). As I was staring out the window I saw this white ball of light that didn&rsquo;t leave a streak in the sky nor in my vision like an ordinary light would, and it didn&rsquo;t make a sound. It looked sort of like an opaque circular light bulb in the sky. As I watched, it seemed to stretch out and turn into a long oval before it disappeared from my vision (it went behind the trees and I couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore). This all happened literally in a second, it was moving very fast. I really can&rsquo;t tell how big it was because it was moving so quickly, but I think it was just slightly smaller, if not the same size, as the moon. It was moving from South to North.((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  One of several reports from the same source, and they seem to us only marginally credible.  We may be wrong.

The object was not a reflection because it passed behind a tree&apos;s several branches and behind the projecting corner of the building I was in at the time.  Object appeared to be moving too fast to be far away, i.e. if it were a plane at the distance estimated the plane was moving faster then any plane I have ever seen.  If it were closer then I have estimated I should have been able to see wings or a tail. The object appeared to not be falling from the sky nor racing upwards but maintained a steady lateral vector.", "Boomerang shaped object flying over highway 375 in Nevada by area 51We took a drive out to Area 51 in Rachel Nevada on 2/16/2008.  We took tons of pictures of the 51 rd,  The Little Alie inn etc. etc. but right before we would drive down the 51 rd to the warning signs, we stopped and took pictures of myself and her at the famous sign that says Extraterrestrial highway. When we were taking these pictures you can clearly see that on the times between shots were about 3-5 seconds per picture. The weather was crystal clear, and daytime. I took like 10 consecutive pictures of the sign and nothing out of the ordinary was in the pictures except for one. Now we did not notice this object  when we were making our visit, but when we got home from our vacation I saw this strange object that was kind of the shape of  a boomerang mostly black and gray.

It was very light green in color and was more like a short bullet instead of a longer cigar shape.  It was traveling from west to east in a level flight path.  My perception was that it was about a mile or two from my location.  I watched it for 6 or 7 seconds before it disappeared from my view because of trees along the road I was walking on.  It impacted my memory because of it&apos;s shape and color.  I had never seen any object in the sky with its distinctive pale green color.  It definitely had no perceptible wings.  It was rounded on the front and flat on the rear.  It&apos;s length was about 3 times its height.

There was very little light pollution and the sky was the clearest I had seen for at least a week.  The Object was a &quot;round&quot; greenish-blue ball that moved from the North to the Southeast not in an arc, rather in a straight line.  This was not a shooting star as it moved extremely slow, I would estimate the altitude at 13,000 ft, and as I indicated earlier the trajectory was not in an arc.  Judging by the trajectory, this object may have landed in a nearby Tennessee State Park.  Upon following a truck to the Hurricane Mills, TN exit at a fuel stop there I asked him if he saw the same object and he indicated as such that he had seen the same object.  I travel a great deal in my Job Duties, often at night due to the lighter traffic around metropolitan areas of Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville, TN.  I have seen other aerial phenomenon during the other that I travel but none not quite as unusual as this.  First the color of the object, speed and travel path.  This object was not of earthly origin.  I told this story to my girl friend who said I should contact your website, which I have and am thankful to &quot;air&quot; this matter in your forum.

As I looked up in the sky I saw a silver looking object which could have been mistaken as a giant beach ball.  It was almost certainly the color that would blend with the sky but distinct enough that you know that it was not &quot;part of the sky&quot;.  It was a very clear day and somewhat average temperature. It appeared to be partially hid behind a cloud.  At the top of the sphere was an illumination of some kind that was almost white in color.  It appeared to be a reflection of the sun.  As quickly as I could ask my daughter if she saw it and then turned back to look at it again - it was gone.

The object was sighted in the southern sky and was a cigar-like object that appeared to have a slight dark or shadow side running diagonally from the tip to about 9 o&rsquo;clock on the left side of the object.  It moved slowly across the sky for what appeared to be a mile or so. It stopped moving horizontally but looked like it was moving up vertically.  Suddenly about 8 or 10 bright saucer-like objects appeared around the original &lsquo;ship&rsquo;.  They did not appear to exit the original object, rather they appeared around it.  The new objects moved about freely and effortlessly.  They even appeared to form geometric shapes (a trapezoid, a rectangle with 2 parallel lines of 3 saucers each, etc).  The bright shapes looked like fireflies circling the original object.  They disappeared as quickly as they appeared, flying for about 3 minutes. The original object kept moving upward, moving from side to side occasionally.  Once more and about 5 minutes after they had disappeared, the saucer like objects reappeared and did a similar dance as in the first episode.

The moon was big and bright in the south east.  I turned off the &apos;street&apos; light to better enjoy the moon.  Then I noticed it.....just about 1- 1 1/2 inches to the right of the edge of the moon.  My first impulse was to think of a plane, but it had too many lights for a plane.  Then it began to sink in that it was not moving.I reached for the binoculars and began watching it.  It appeared big. It had either blinking or rotating red and white lights.  There may have also been some green but using the binoculars I would hesitate on the green. There were 4 each white and red  lights.   They were all in the same horizontal plane giving a &apos;cigar&apos;  shape impression. Of course they could have been rotating around something.It did not move.  After a bit i began  to perceive slight movement in relation to the moon.....but  it was due to the moon  advancing.  The object was  stationary.After several minutes a most remarkable thing began to occur. The large object began to ever so slowly divide into two smaller objects......as if two attached craft were separating. They ever so slowly parted until they were about an inch apart.After several more minutes they began to move &apos;outward&apos; from earth.  I say that because the elevation did not change in relation to me or the moon.   this caused me to believe they were going &apos;away&apos; from me.   I watched them with binoculars until they were out of sight, which was quite some time.   This also indicates they were moving &apos;out&apos; and away.  The elevation did not vary in relation to the moon. I watched them for a total of about 30 minutes.

Being a curious person I set my clock to wake up so I could witness this celestial event.  I went outside that morning and within a few minutes I did see some heavenly body streak across the sky. Just before I was about to go back inside to bed, I saw something else that I&apos;ve never seen the likes of before or since.  In the not too distant night sky I saw a disc shaped object floating slowly towards me. It was very brightly colored (the lights alternated red, blue, green and orange in a circular pattern around the object).  I was transfixed by this sight as it inched towards our house. Over the next twenty minutes it floated closer and closer to the yard where I was standing. After about ten minutes of observation it was clear to me that this object was approaching and would soon be directly over head. I would estimate the disc at about 500ft in diameter and flying about 500ft in the air. There were times when it appeared to come to a dead stop and simply hover, then begin floating slowly closer. The flickering alternating colorful lights were the most striking thing about it and I remember wondering what government technology could produce such an object. At about the 20 minute mark in the sighting, the object was nearly directly over my head and I remember a strong fear coming over me. I was afraid of being spotted by this craft and went back inside the house. From various windows inside I continued to watch the object as it flew over the front of the house and I ended up in my bedroom watching it pass over the back yard. The object never made a sound. There were a bunch of trees behind the house a few hundred yards away; once the object glided over those trees it appeared to descend further. I watched it hover just above those trees for another 10 minutes or so before it ascended and quickly flew ou! t of sig ht. No airplane, weather balloon, or helicopter that I know of could account for that sighting. I will never forget what I saw that night and I have come to believe that others have seen the same thing as well.", "2 Witness&apos;s  Saw A Stationary Object Hovering Near A Cell Phone Tower. &quot;Object was Hugh&quot; Changed from Red To  Amber Color &quot;No Sound&quot;Was Driving On Rt.50 Traveling East from Parkersburg, WV.

I see air traffic from the Nashville airport at night all the time, but this object had no lights. It was solid black, and it traveled much slower than any other air traffic. In fact, a jet flew past at the same time the object was in the sky, and the jet had several lights. They had to have been less than a quarter of a mile away from each other.

This time line is only 10 to 15 seconds.  The color of  the object was a white grey.  I live in a small city of  Guadalupe which is 7miles west of  Santa Maria, CA.  Between these two cities is seven miles of farmland, very flat farmland. We were traveling east on highway 166 from Guadalupe when we saw this thing around 10am.  I was driving , my wife sitting shotgun and my three kids in the middle seat of our Suburban.  The morning was solid overcast, but very well lit.  The object was only approximately 50 ft. long.  It was flying very low only about 200 to 300 feet off the ground that is why we all noticed it.  As soon as I noticed it I immediately rolled down my window to see if I could hear it flying.  Guadalupe is only 17 miles from Vandenberg  Air Force Base, and Santa Maria has an airshow with fighter jets and they do travel fast and low.  When at the air shows those jets, traveling away from you low, make a tremendous amount of noise at high speed.  That is why when I saw the object I tried to listen to hear the noise, the kids think it&rsquo;s cool.  While waiting to here some noise I notice that there wasn&rsquo;t any distinct lines or features on this thing and then  it is gone over the city.   The object traveled into over the city of Santa Maria. We have a telescope, my kids and I look at stars, planets and meteor showers.  I hunt, fish and often record the rocket launches over the hill at VAFB.  I see the airshows and this did not look like any plane.   This incident happened on 9-8-2007.   The reason I haven&rsquo;t  reported it until today  1-23-2008 is I just learned there was a place in which to report events like mine.  I remember the date and time because my son lost his soccer game socks and we were going to buy a new pair so he could play.  Not telling anyone of this incident really bugged me.

All 6 were identical, shaped like simple dashes or hyphens, and were oriented horizontally, (i.e. like the wings of an airplane, not the fuselage). They were the same bright, yellowish-white color as an ordinary light bulb filament.As they silently flew on a straight, SW path across the sky, they stayed in a tight group, while smoothly and continuously shifting positions in relation to each other.Their speed and altitude appeared to be very similar to that of an average commercial jet at cruising altitude.

They were amber-yellow in color and were in a line-like formation.  We stopped the vehicle and exited to get a better look.  We heard no sound and the lights remained in the same location in the sky for a few minutes.  While watching, the lights would disappear one by one and reappear in a different location.  Eventually the lights all disappeared at the same time, vanishing completely.  The reason I am reporting this incident over 2 years later is because today for the first time I saw a show on the Discovery Channel which showed almost exactly what we witnessed.  Before seeing this show I thought that we had been the only people witnessing such an event.  Although the show is taken from 1997 footage I have never seen it before.  The difference from what we saw and the show was that the lights we saw disappeared and reappeared in different locations in the sky. Also, instead of seeing nine or so lights we saw between three to five at any given time.  I also witnessed these same lights at a different time and location while driving home with a friend from a band competition.  It was around 1:00 in the morning and these lights were in the opposite sky (east instead of west).  My friend and I did not stop driving but watched while we drove.  These lights seemed to be moving across the sky in the same line-like formation.  After I made a turn the lights were behind us and a few minutes later we looked back and they were completely gone.  There was also a third encounter with these lights on a different night around the same location as the first where I was alone and saw the same lights.  I was unable to determine if these lights seemed to be individual or that of one craft.  I have not seen these lights since 2005.  All of the witnesses are well educated and do not believe in supernatural beings which is one of the reasons we d! id not w ant to report until now.

PD))Although I myself have not seen a UFO, members of my family and friends have had various types of sightings.  To the best of my knowledge, only one has ever been reported (July 2006 in Virginia).  I feel that perhaps some of these stories may be helpful in collaborating other sightings.  All of these individuals are down to earth, honest, and intelligent, and have no reason to fabricate. The July 2006 sighting that my son&rsquo;s half sister and her boyfriend reported:  They saw an extremely large triangular shaped object over her boyfriend&rsquo;s rural home in Virginia.  It moved slowly, also with no noise.  It was in the evening and had lights. They watched it for several minutes and when it seemed to notice them, it shone a light over them.  They were also completely frightened by it. The following is a list of other sightings; exact dates are unknown. Early 60&rsquo;s &ndash; my sister and brother drove over a hill on a farm road outside Dell City, Texas, and stopped when they found gigantic tumbleweed blocking the road.  As they were trying to decide if they could go around it, it suddenly lifted noiselessly off the ground and slowly rose straight up, then shot across the sky.  It happened in broad daylight, they were very frightened by it, and their story has never changed over the years. 1995 &ndash; a niece and nephew spotted an extremely large triangular object moving slowly over Las Cruces, NM, and followed it for some time.  It appeared to follow the Rio Grande River, moving from south to north.  It was nighttime, was lighted around the perimeter, and had a low hum.  They also noted several military helicopters in the area that also appeared to be following it.  My nephew is now an English professor at the DABCC of New Mexico State University. Early 80&rsquo;s &ndash; a good friend who was living on a ranch outside Tatum, NM told me of seeing an extremely large object over their ranch home.  It occurred around dusk, and her teenage daughter and two of her teenage girlfriends also saw it.  As it was told to me, the daughter and a friend were sitting outside waiting for another girlfriend to arrive when the object suddenly came over a nearby hill and hovered over their home.  The girls ran in and told the mother (my friend) who was on the phone with her husband.  My friend told her husband to hold on, and put the phone down while they all went outside to look at it.  As the other girlfriend&rsquo;s approaching car became visible in the distance, the object suddenly sped over to the car and followed it to the house.  The girls were completely hysterical and as they watched, the object suddenly went straight up and across the sky.  It had some lights and moved noiselessly.  When my friend told my husband and I this story, her husband confirmed it, as he had heard them all screaming while he was holding on the phone. 1998 &ndash; another one of my four sisters also encountered something mysterious, possibly a UFO.  She was driving on Interstate 25, from her home just north of Las Cruces, NM to the university for a class she was taking when she noticed a small blue ball flying alongside her car.  At first she thought it was a reflection, but then it started to move around her car.  It continued to follow her car for some distance and it freaked her out completely.  When she got off the Interstate ramp at the University she drove straight to another sister&rsquo;s home a few blocks away.  This other sister confirms her story and says it took a long time to calm her down.  She and her husband had to drive her home. August &ndash; 2007   My son, who is 36 and a schoolteacher, and his mother-in-law both saw what they describe as a &ldquo;large invisible object&rdquo; cross the early evening sky.  They noticed this invisible object because it blocked out the emerging stars as it crossed the sky.  As it moved slowly and noiselessly across the sky, they could note the triangular shape.  They also noted some military helicopters in the area right after the sighting. I also have a cousin who is a missile guidance engineer at White Sands Missile Range who has told me on that he has been present on several occasions when pilots have returned from flights and reported seeing UFO&rsquo;s.  On these occasions, if any photos or videos were taken, there is always a group of government personnel (unknown dept.) who show up and confiscate the photos or video.", "NOT IN OUR ATMOSPHERE!!! 90-DEGREE TURNS!! FLASHING WITH INCREASED SPEED!!It was the beginning of August, late at night, maybe a little past midnight. Two of my friends and myself were down the road from my house, lying in a field, looking at the stars.  A little solid white light caught my eye, so I pointed it out to my friends.  Both of them acknowledged it and were just as amazed as me.  They at first thought it was a plane, but I pointed out there were NO flashing lights or red lights. On top of that we all agreed that this thing was NOT in our atmosphere.They then decided it was a satellite, but were proven wrong when it made a 90-degree turn east. After its turn it shot stage right really fast and made another 90-degree turn north. It is hard to tell how far it traveled but from my perspective about four inches across the sky. After its second turn it came to a sudden stop, and started to flash slowly.The flashing lasted about 7 or 8 seconds and increased in speed until it shot outwards away from earth leaving a white trail behind it that slowly dissipated.  It was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate.  PD))", "Brilliant Unexplained Object Soaring at Incredible Speeds and Angles over the South Georgia SkiesWhile driving down Hwy 82 in Tifton, my mother-in-law, son and I noticed a strange light in the sky, travelling at an odd angle and speed. First, we thought that it could possibly be the defunct spy satellite I read about in the news, and we dismissed it out of hand. Then, we turned onto Hwy 319 to head towards Norman Park, where we live. Around Omega, we spotted the object again, and this time it was headed back in the exact same direction, at a much higher speed than previously. As the road turned, we lost sight of the object again until roughly crossland, where we again spotted the object (cigar shaped and brilliant white at first, but as the sun set, it was glinting with shades of pink) travelling in a straight line parallel to the horizon. We don&apos;t know what it was, but we know a lot of things it wasn&apos;t. Its the first unexplained object I&apos;ve ever seen as an adult, and I wish we&apos;d had our other cell phone with us so that we could have taken a picture of it. It was rather creepy.", "The craft was oval shaped, with lights rotating in the middle of it and a green alien with bulging black eyes.It was Mid-October 1990, I was thirteen years old and was on the phone with a friend when my father came in my room and told me that I needed to feed our dog, which stayed outside. It was around 9:00 p.m. I got the dog food and went to do the chore quickly so I could get back on the phone. It was a clear and cool night. While walking to feed the dog I noticed how beautiful the sky and stars were. I bent down to pour the food out into the dog dish as I stood up, I noticed this oval shaped flying object that had green and red lights circling in the middle. There were windows in the craft where I actually seen a green figure with a huge head and big bulging black eyes. This figure is just like what is reported in most alien sightings. This is how I know that I am not crazy. I seen this way before people went Area 51 crazy like they did in the late 90&rsquo;s. The craft was flying extremely low across a field. After staring at it for about 2-3 minutes, the curiosity left and fear took over because it noticed me and started coming my way. I ran straight toward the house. As I approached the steps I looked back as the craft quickly went backwards out of sight. I was upset and got my parents to walk out to see maybe they could see it. They did not get to, it was gone. I knew what I seen. If you tell people this story they think you are making it up. After almost 18 years, I think about the sighting often and have a lot of questions. This sighting happened in Reidsville, GA. I could understand how people would feel this story is far fetched because if I would not have seen it, believing it  would be difficult, especially since I am almost a 31 year old man.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

From the Equator you see the &quot;rich&quot; part of the Milky Way, as opposed to being in North America. On this particular occasion which left me no doubt as to the existence of more advanced and intelligent life forms; I noticed one quickly discernible moving light object among the stars. What was peculiar about this object was that as it travelled across the sky, it would make two cicles around another (star)then travel in a straight line, make two circles around another (star) and so continued until I could no longer track the item because I had to blink since teh eyes become dry to dry to keep open.

ON Jan 1 2008 around 1215 am I saw saw a glowing orange ballon shaped obhect that seemed to float over the trees near our house.  It was bright enough that it caught our eyes thru the windows. We were in differnt rooms and differnt floors but both saw it and ran out to try to see what it was.  It really looked like a miniature hotair ballon with a orange glow or fire color.  Object would rise and lower and moved very slowly.  It was not far away 200&apos; or so but made absolutely no noise.  No strong winds or inclement weather, object was clearly visible and easy to see. Object just seemed to disappear as I was watching it.   I would like to say that this object has been reported locally several times in the last few months.

I was in the army stationed at Fort Bliss Texas (the air defense center) training to shoot down aircraft.  Fort Bliss is not too far from Biggs Air Force Base. ( A SAC Bomber Base). We had fallen out for formation around 4:30 in the morning and it was about 1 hour before sunrise.  While standing in formation (I) we observed a dish shaped object approaching from the west, white in color,( that could have been due to the altitude and the reflection of the rising sun giving it that color) and you could tell it was spinning because what appeared to be flames were coming off of it. The object stopped very suddenly and began to hover. You could tell that the object was spinning and leaving what you could say was a vapor trail.  The object moved at great speed and would stop abruptly and change direction. The entire platoon witnessed this object for about 10 minutes. As with any occurance like this; we talked about it during breakfast and I think that is as far as it went. We had heard on the news several reports of strange  objects being seen in other areas of the Texas panhandle around the same period of time.  Finally the object reversed itself and went out of site in the direction from where it came.  But when the sun came up the vapor trail disappeared.There were no flashing lights or lights that could be seen nor was there any sound that could be heard.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As i continued to drive south I saw that a craft was leaving the streaks. When I exited off of Rt. 17, I was proceeding east on soldier hill road, when I again saw the craft leaving the trails. I exited my vehicle, and noticed that the craft wasnt that high at all. I would estimate that it was only a couple of thousand feet. Yet, it made no noise. It was cylindrical in shape, and was criss-crossing the sky leaving these white contrails. I entered my vehicle, and as I was driving past the Oradell reservoir, I again saw the craft, and again I exited my vehicle to watch it. As it passed, I again noticed that it made no noise. I finally made my way home, when I again saw the craft. Leaving the white contrails (vapor trails). Some were several miles in length, and would widen to a couple of hundred feet. This time as the craft came overhead (again with no noise), I took some pictures, I got the trails (contrails, vapor trails - not really sure what they are). But, I could not get a clear picture of the craft. After I file this report, I will attempt to blow up some of the pictures to see if I see anything. If you would like copies of the photographs, I would be glad to forward them along.  The incident started about 6:45 and ended at 7:27.

Catching my eye because i can see it go in and out of my blinds. I looked out the window and saw 2 other solid lights which looked like starts. Colored incandescent almost amber-like. Nothing out of the ordinary? I&apos;ve slept with my blinds open for the 3 years Ive lived here and am used to seeing planes en route to LAX and helicopter flying around. This is the first time anything unusual has caught my eye. The two stationary objects looked like pinholes in the sky. As I look at the stars, they shimmer and have a bluish white color. All 3 objects looked very far. they were in the same area for approx 45min, then i fell asleep", "Guitar Pick shaped UFO Flies Over Houses In San Antonio SubdivisionMy wife with brother and I were sitting outside on our patio deck when I noticed something I thought might have been a floating bag drifting over from the direction of our neighbors house toward us. I pointed it out to my wife and made a joking comment about it being a UFO as she is a serious skeptic on the subject. My brother and I started discussing how the object was at a high altitude for it being a plastic bag and discussed the physics behind the strength of the wind needed for it to stay aloft. As we  we discussing this, the object made a lazy L-shaped U-turn toward the house behind us. It was at this point that both my brother and my wife noticed that the object had a &quot;guitar-pick&quot; shape and was not a plastic bag. I also noticed that the object was rocking back and forth on its axis in a slow wobble. We stood motionless watching the object as it continued toward the street in front of the house behind ours. I would approximate its altitude at being between 50-100 feet from the ground. Its length was 3-5 feet and had almost no width that I could see, making it extremely flat. The objects color was very white with no lights or moving parts seen. It made no sound that we could hear. When it reached the next street behind our house it started to gain altitude steadily. We could not begin to guess the speed at which it rose but it must have been extremely fast because it reached a very high altitude in around 30 seconds. At some point before we lost sight of it in the sky, I noticed that there was a tiny white round object that had seemingly materialized from the sky and flew very close to the &quot;guitar-pick&quot;. I mentioned this to my brother who then stated that I must have been staring too long at the sky and was seeing a reflection of the light. I stood close to him and pointed the object out. He grew excited as he saw another white orb streak by the &quot;guitar-pick&quot;. My wife suddenly pointed out yet another one moving in the opposite direction the other 2 had taken. These white orbs were moving at speeds that were impossibly fast and seemed to orbit the &quot;guitar-pick&quot; in motion. The &quot;guitar-pick&quot; at this time was almost out of visual range but looked as if it was still gaining in altitude. There were no other aircraft in the sky that day. There are sometimes military aircraft in the vicinity but as it was a Sunday very few if any were flying. I served in a ADA (Air Defense Artillery)Army unit for 3 years and can readily identify many types of aircraft by sight and sound. I have never witnessed anything to the same likeness before and probably will never again.", "Object  over Rt. 80 standing still with bright white light on bottom and sides...no sound..no movement...I was traveling west bound on Rt. 80..I noticed a bright white light in the sky..the light was a few miles ahead of me..My first thought was that it was just a plane heading east to Newark Airport. If it was a plane heading east it should have gained on me since i was heading west, but the object was just standing still..As i got closer i noticed a State Trooper sitting on the side of the east bound lanes with his overhead lights flashing, but he/she didnt have a car pulled over..It looked like he/she was there just observing the object as well...The object was about 4 to 5 hundred feet off the roadway and about 200 feet in the air. It was sort of bell shaped with one very bright light on the underside and other not so bright lights along the sides..I slowed down to about 45mph and got a good look at it for about 10-15 seconds...I heard no sound and it didnt look like anything i have ever seen before..I must admit my heart was racing...After returning home i called the police department in the town where i saw the object but was told there were no other reports...I know others must have seen this also because it was so bright and unusual that you couldnt help but notice it.", "01/19/2008, 17:50.

PD))", "BRIGHT lights, some fading in and out, forming a V on one nightMy family and I had witnessed a UFO in broad daylight in May 2007 (listed on your website) and ever since then I have been looking in the sky not necessarily looking for something else to happen but observing and paying attention. Beecher is located next to the town of Monee and very close to Chicago Heights, etc. and I have noticed several reports in the last couple of months. In particular, I was shocked that not more have been reported (regarding these crazy lights that fade and appear again) but I read the Monee report and felt relieved that someone else had been noticing this. This has been going on for MONTHS and I just am now getting around to reporting this. Who else do you report this to?? At any rate, this is what I have been experiencing on a REGULAR basis. I work in Kankakee and live in Beecher. Every night when I travel home, I take a certain route (typically I-57 North to the Peotone/Wilmington exit and then take Cicero [Rt. 50] North until I get to &quot;Beecher Blacktop&quot; Road and travel east on that road until I get to &quot;Will Center&quot; Road I believe it&apos;s called. Since it is dark out where I live (mostly cornifelds and some houses but no street lights for long stretches at a time) I can see all the stars very clearly and helicopters on occassion or small aircraft flying along with commercial aircraft flying at higher altitudes in the distance. I would say at least 2-3 times a week back in October, November, December of 2007 I have noticed these &quot;lights&quot; that appear in a &quot;V&quot; formation but are spread pretty far apart. It&apos;s like they are &quot;pointing&quot; towards the race track (Balmoral Race Track). The lights will sometimes be 2 or 3 and the most I have seen was around 7 lights that are very distinct and very bright. And then all of a sudden, it&apos;s like someone turns the lights out. But they fade out typically. It is really hard to describe. The one night, I was on the phone with my boyfriend and I saw these BRIGHT lights that were not moving, they were not planes, the only thing I could think of was maybe a helicopter or two (or 6) but they were just hovering. Not making a sound. But when I pulled into the area where I live, I got out of the car and there was NO SOUND. I know when a helicopter is in the area because you can obviously hear it coming/going. There was NO SOUND coming from these lights and they were constant. One light in particular (on this night back in October 2007) seemed to be &quot;leading&quot; the other lights. There was a dominant light and it remained constant in its shining and brightness. The other lights (from what I remember 6 others) had formed a &quot;V&quot; shape and it was perfect spacing and it was pointing towards the race track. One of the lights in the V formation would fade out slowly - completely disappear. Then another one would go out. Then another. Then one of the lights that &quot;went out&quot; would come back on.  IT WAS SO STRANGE!!!  Like I said, I was sitting on the phone with my boyfriend and he was asking me to tell him what they were doing. He said to stay there and observe them. I didn&apos;t like the feeling I was getting of &quot;being watched&quot; but I stayed and watched a little more. I knew they weren&apos;t stars as I know where all the stars are and how bright they are, etc.  I couldn&apos;t stand it anymore and went in the house, all the lights in the sky remained where they were.  Very weird. Other nights when I have driven that route (traveling towards Balmoral race track in Crete, IL) the same thing would happen where there would be 2 or 3 lights one night, 3 or 4 the next night and then they wouldn&apos;t show up at all. The light would be VERY BRIGHT, constant, and then ALL OF A SUDDEN they would shut off.", "A bright white light hovered over Pueblo Blvd. bridge over the Arkansas River, about 30 ft. above traffic, but no traffic seemed to seeMy friends and I were parked in my friend&apos;s car at Pueblo City Park, in the dirt lot directly behind the skate park. We were parked right next to the drop off to the Arkansas river and the fence to the little basesball park behind the skate park. We were facing the bridge of Pueblo Blvd as it goes over the Arkansas River. We were sitting there for about 20 seconds before we noticed there was an odd light hovering above the Pueblo Blvd. bridge. It was a bright white light, but the light from this object seemed to only radiate outwards horizontally, diagonally upward, and seemingly upwards. It did not appear that the light could have been seen should you have been lower in elevation than it was in the slightest. The elevation of the craft was approximately the same as our current elevation, as the bridge seemed to be 25-30ft lower in elevation. We could not see what the shape of the craft was. We were amazed because it was hovering directly over passing cars, but those cars apparently were not aware of the bright white light we saw above them and no glare from the white light shown off the cars or the road. It sat there for about 15 minutes, ever so slightly wavering back and forth along the length of the road, and to our amazement no cars beneath were aware of this bright white light above them. Then the light turned off and there was nothing where it had been. About another minute later the white light turned back on, but it was closer to us, over the river, about halfway between us and the bridge it had previously hovered over. This time, there were two more lights apparently attached to the craft. The big white light on top, a small orange light to the bottom right beneath the white one, and a small red light to the bottom left of the white light, just slightly lower than the orange one. All of these lights were round at this time. The white light appeared to shine like a light bulb, in every direction equally, and out of the middle of this appeared part of the light was focusing like ! a spotli ght. The glare from the shifting spotlight effect started at our upper left, then appeared to scan across us to the bottom right, then back to the upper left. I began filming the light with my video phone, and the light moved closer to us over the river. This was the closest it had gotten to us. Just as my 45-second recording ended, we noticed a pair of headlights behind us driving toward where we were, and we watched to see if it was a cop. You&apos;re not allowed to be in the park past 10pm, which we were doing, so we wanted to know if it was a cop. Well, it was. We could see the spotlights on it and the emergency light fixture on top. It drove up behind our car and we started our car and started to drive off, the whole time the ufo was still shining brightly, proudly displaying itself over the river. The cop followed us out of the skate park area onto a one way road out of the park with no turn offs. We didn&apos;t look back, but the cop&apos;s headlights were very bright and very close behind us. All of the sudden the headlights turn off. We look back, and where there had been a cop driving behind us not even 30ft behind, there was nothing but an empty road for about 125ft behind us. There was no where for the cop to turn off and the road behind us was well lit by a street light. That cop car simply vanished. The next night we returned to the same spot. There was that same light hovering over the same bridge, but this time the light was just slightly dimmer, and the white light attached to the craft appeared to be a pyramid-shaped bright white light that was rotating counterclockwise. Each edge of this pyramid shaped white light seemed to be darker than the flat surfaces emitting the light. Again, while it was hovering over the road it did not have the lower orange and red lights turned on. It hovered over the bridge for about 10 minutes, then the light turned off and it vanished. About five minutes after that, it turned its light back on, appearing on our side of the bridge, but off to the right above the tree line. This time, the red and orange lights were turned on again and the white light was too bright to see the pyramid shape. It kept the same elevation the whole time, but moved around very very slowly over the trees. It then turned all lights off and vanished again. About 5 seconds later, it re-appeared in the direction of the Arkansas river, but at least 4 miles farther away. It moved back and forth for about 15 seconds, then turned off again. About 5 seconds later, it appeared even farther away on the horizon, moved around for about 15 seconds, then turned off again. We sat there for about half an hour and it re-appeared between us and the bridge, over the river, but this time slightly lower in elevation to us. This was the closest it had gotten to us. The red light on the bottom began to slowly increase in intensity, then decrease, then increase, and back and forth. The main white light appeared to scan us again and the craft began moving even closer to us. This time it didn&apos;t appear it was trying to scare us off by slightly moving toward us, this time it looked like the thing was coming for us. My friend started his car, peeled out backing up while turning around, then peeled out toward the exit to the skate park area. The white light behind us came right up to where our car had been parked, and m! y friend floored it toward the exit to city park, as it exits onto Pueblo Blvd. The light did not follow us out of the skate park area, it just came right up to where we had been parked and we lost sight of it. At the closest, this light was about 4/5 of a football field away from us. The only thing we could think is that it was a military drone aircraft of some type. Also, this craft never made any sound we could hear. Both nights it was about 10pm and both nights were very dark with very little star visibility.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The light was so intense and the whole ground around us lit up like it was day time! There are NO lights in the bike trail and it was not an airplane,helicopter,or a meteor.

It was followed by a bright yellow-white streak, like a comet. My husband was driving and talking on the phone, so although I pointed at it and exclaimed, he did not see it before it dissapeared behind the mountains. It was moving rapidly, as if it were falling out of the sky, and it appeared to actually have a green ring of neon light around the edge like some sort of fair ride gone horribly wrong. I saw it for 2-3 seconds, perhaps, and all I could think, was what in the HELL is that? I don&rsquo;t really believe in UFOs, but&hellip;what was that??? It was, for me, at least, an unidentified flying object. I kept watching the western horizon for as long as I could, but saw nothing else strange.

The objects were not moving and were blinking steadily. After about 5 minutes one of the objects starting moving East and towards us. It was going semi-slow but it moved past us and we saw a disk shaped object with a yellow haze around it (maybe a forcefield?). It had red blinking lights with green non-blinking lights.That one went off into the darkness. We then started watching the other 2 lights, and one of them started to go northeast really fast and away from us. All of a sudden it turned blue and stopped and started to blink. We then paid attention to the other one that was not moving. All of a sudden the first object came blitzing back from the east down away from us to the west and disappeared.

The sky was perfectly clear and there weren&rsquo;t any clouds in sight.  The con-trails were different in size and makeup.  The large ones were not dissipating into the air and were left in a grid pattern from north to south and east to west.  I could tell the difference because the usual con-trails were smaller in size and dissipating into the air almost immediately after they were exhausted from the engines.  Then there was a distinct X that was made by these planes.  Suddenly out of no where there were these two oval shaped objects that were floating across the sky where the X was, not leaning behind and con-trails.  They were spaced apart and traveling east on the same trajectory.  I couldn&rsquo;t see any wings and I thought it was just that they were too far away to tell but then a third plane came up behind them.  This plane had the con-trails and I could distinctly see the wings.  It was traveling in the same line behind the objects.I called the FAA and demanded answers to what was in our airspace and the operations manager put me on hold for about 20 minutes and then reported to me that the planes were an Air force training operation out of Reese AFB in Lubbock TX.  They were T-38 training planes.  Well, my father is an x-fighter pilot and retired commercial pilot and I know what T-38&rsquo;s look like and it wasn&rsquo;t them.

It only lasted about 3 seconds then it turned to flames and immediately dissapeared. Less than a minute later, three jets which looked to me like military fighter jets, came up from about where the light had been and branched in three directions. One went straight, one went to the right and the other to left. I never saw the planes again. 4 other players along with myself witnessed all of the above.

Shortly after 2200, I saw an object that was round to oval in shape I am unsure if it was tilted if at all. It was not emitting any light at first but a faint reflection of light pollution making its shape apparent. I was facing east; it passed by at about 20-30 degrees above the horizon moving from south to north. I noticed it first coming into sight from the right behind a few trees. It was in plane sight for approximately 90-120 degrees, for 5- 10 seconds.  For the last 3 seconds of my observation, it was emitting a neon-blue light. There was no apparent source of the light, meaning no visible bulb or bulbs, it looked like it was projected off of the surface or the surface itself was emitting the light in sporadic pulse. Only parts of it were making light, not the whole object, it was not in unison or uniform. It was like an imitation of lightening or the reaction to some form of stimulation, comparable to bio-lumination. It stopped making the blue light just before it fell out of sight behind more trees. It did not slow, stop, accelerate, or alter course for the duration of my observation.   I am within 5 miles of a municipal airport, and within 10 miles of a naval station, that holds near constant helicopter operations, this was not a helicopter, I have military training in identifying and reporting surface and air &ldquo;contacts&rdquo; and identifying standard light configurations, I am very familiar with the helicopters I used to observe in the military and watch fly over the house every day and all hours of the night.

I can only speculate the altitude of the object; it was low enough to reflect a very faint and dull light from urban lumination for the duration of my observation.", "UFO Sighting Occurred: 11/?/1975 approx 8:00pm EST Location: Albany, NY Shape: Bright, White light Duration: approx 30 seconds  I just happened to look up in my friend&rsquo;s back yard.  I noticed two objects in a very clear night sky.  One object was clearly a jetliner traveling north to south.The other was the UFO heading the same direction but at such a high rate of speed that it just froze me in my tracks. The UFO then made a sudden dead stop in front of the jetliner.  Then it made what appeared to be 90 degree turn up away so fast that it just &quot;blinked off.&quot;I told my friends who were all inside the house. They kind of looked at me as most people would. Well, as we sat around the TV hours later, the 11 o&rsquo;clock news started, to everyone&rsquo;s shock the &quot;top news story&quot; was the report by the pilots of a &quot;UFO&quot; sighting. I sure would like to get a copy of that night&rsquo;s newscast. I will never, ever forget that night.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Time: Around 12 Noon to 2:30 PM Central Weather: Fair, few clouds.I was outside my home.  Something caught my perifial vision.I also felt what is similar to &ldquo;static electricity&rdquo; on my skin.  It was likened to what one would feel if they rubbed an inflated balloon and ran it just above the hairs of his arm.I saw for about two minutes a large dark purple to black Triangular shaped craft. It was not an exact triangle because the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; side the triangle was just a little longer than its two other sides.  From what I could compare with objects it was near I would guess that two sides were about 75&rsquo; feet and one side was about 100&rsquo;.  It was about 50&rsquo; above the ground and about several hundred feet away from me at a &ldquo;11:30&rdquo; position if I were standing in the middle of a clock.  It was traveling no more than 10 mph along a path that was heading about 19 to 20 degrees angle.  It made absolutely no sound.  It did not have any windows or ports. It had no markings. It had no fins. It look just like a smooth very dark purple to black triangle. I could see the bottom of the craft but only from an angle as if one is standing at a short distance off the side looking up.About 2 minutes later, (counting time when I first saw the object it accelerated vertically as almost instantly in a 180 degree line straight up and disappeared into the blue sky.About 2 minutes later I did hear the sound of jet craft and about 2 to three minutes later 3 military jets were in my plain sight but at an altitude higher than the craft I previously seen. (400&rsquo; higher maybe?.) These jets did appear to have Air Force Insignia on their tail fins but I am not sure because they were just going too fast for me to be positive about this.  I did call an Air Force base in MO.  (I don&rsquo;t remember which one but I think it was Whiteman? Not sure about the spelling.) I did remember getting frustrated because no person seemed to know where exactly I should make my report to or who to talk to and no one said they had information about whether or not Air Force Jets were flying in southern Iowa at that time. So I just gave up and forgot about trying to pursue the matter.) The 3 jets did fly in the exact area the craft went vertical into the air but they kept traveling in this direction until I could no longer see them.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

However, the lights appeared to be moving in a very erratic/random fashion.  Looking through binoculars, the lights appeared to be circular dots chasing one another.  The effect was similar to when you move a sparkler quickly and randomly; thus seeming to create what resembled the appearance of string theory energy.  It was like a string light show, with the different colors chasing and blending with one another.  In instances the circular, oval shapes seemed to collapse, though never disappearing.  The lights would zip back and forth up, down, sideways, but always staying in a string configuration, whether open ended, or closed.  At the end of  twelve minutes, the lights just seemed to fade as if retreating farther into space.

It headed North for appprox 15 seconds, than disappeared again behind tree line.   Have never seen anything like this...must of been 10-15 times the size of a normal airplane in the air within atleast a few miles of interstate.  It didn&apos;t look like any blimp I have ever seen..wasn&apos;t oval at all, but more sphere like with a smaller top. I am embarrassed to say that it looked just like pictures of UFO&apos;s I&apos;ve seen in the news latey.  I couldn&apos;t believe myself.  I am not the type to report this, but it was just to amazing not to.  I am a professional.  A 37 year old married mother.  I am a registered Intensive Care Nurse and my husband is a respected Surgeon in Jacksonville.  I would most definitely not make this up. This was not a blimp..growing up in Florida, I have seen many, many blimps, rockets, space shuttles, etc...especially since my father was a rocket scientist at NASA and I lived in Cape Canaveral most of my childhood.  This thing was going very, very, very fast...much, much faster than any blimp could travel.  It was traveling so smoothly through the air with no sound.  It was soooo unusual.  I am unable to express how different it was than anything I have EVER seen.  It was going maybe much faster than a jet plane could, but it was almost like a &quot;glider.&quot;  Tried to take photos of if, but I was driving alone, and they didn&apos;t come out too well on my camara phone.  I tried to call FAA to find out about it..but couldn&apos;t get anyone to answer me.  It was stopping traffic...it was just like NOTHING I have ever seen in the world.

The building was directly next to a state park at the end of a little peninsula separating the bay from the canal. It was dark on the balcony and dark outside.  It was approximately 11pm.  The two observers had been sitting for about 45 minutes watching the sky as they talked.  Suddenly one observer saw what she believed was a plane until she noticed that it was not.  The object was flying south toward the ocean gulf and was going slow enough and low for her to briefly glimpse a triangular flying object with no lights on it.  The only source of light was coming from the back end:  a tail of orange/red emissions that decreased in size as it left the back of the vehicle; Think golf tee.  Its emissions gave enough light to show the contours of the bottom side of the vehicle.  The bottom revealed a scalloped like design, much like the old corrugated roofs.  By the time the observer had registered this information and realized it could not be a plane (it was too close and did not look like one), it and its plume shot quickly away with no sound, then disappeared. The second observer saw a light out of the corner of his eye and turned in time to see a flash and then nothing.", "Triangular craft blue lights.Around 11pm I was standing on the balcony of my apartment.

THE CRAFT (S) WERE ON THE SAME WESTERLY DIRECTION AS THE AIRLINE.THE REASON I NOTICED THE OBJECT WAS DUE TO THE PASSING OF AN AIRLINER JUST BEFORE AND I WAS WATCHING THE PROGRESS OF THE IT MOVING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION.

It moved with the same speed and light residue of a shooting star, except that this night, it was drizzling rain, and the entire sky was overcast gray. You couldn&apos;t even see the moon, the cloud cover was so thick. I&apos;ve tried to rationalize what I saw several times, but seeing as how whatever it was flew below the clouds, I can&apos;t think it was a shooting star, and since there was no thunder or lightning, I can&apos;t see how it could be any atmospheric phenomena either.", "I was coming home late night with the wife from work. We live in the town called Cowiche its north of Yakima out in the country. It was a very clear night with the stars out.  There is a cannon that leads far into the hills and towards Tampico. You can see at least 3 miles up the cannon from a distance as the slope goes up toward the mountain base. We were on a flat stretch that is called the hop stretch and at that angle you could see up the entrance of the Cowiche cannon. We saw an oscillating greenish/blue light and a reflective look as if the lights where reflecting off of something shiny with a hit of reddish underneath it. The object was about a mile up the road from us moving toward the mouth of the cannon hovering just above the trees. As we got closer the object looked disk or roundish in shape and was moving very slowly into the cannon and then ascended up to just about the ridge sides of the cannon and continued very slowly as to be traversing the cannon and we stopped and watched it for about 12-20 minutes as it slowly continued up the cannon with its lights oscillating and disappeared from sight.

Don&apos;t remember the exact date, sometime in 1970, I believe in the spring. There were about 30 of us watching a movie, &quot;The African Queen&quot; in the Student Union in the middle of campus. The movie was over around midnight, and we all walked out of the building. There, hovering approximately 20 feet above the ground in the open area near the Student Union, was a disk shaped, grey metallic craft. It was not small, I&apos;m guessing approx. 50 feet wide. It had red lights in a band around the middle of the craft. It was completely silent, and was not moving. I had the feeling that time stopped, we all stopped moving, stood where we were, as if frozen in time. No one said a word. I don&apos;t know how much time past. The next thing I remember is that the craft lifted straight up, made a perpendicular movement, then straight up again, and was gone. Its speed was faster than one could even imagine. No acceleration time, it was at a standstill, then gone. No one said a word, we all just walked back to our dorm rooms on campus. This was very out of character, because this was a very &quot;radical&quot; 60&apos;s type college, with a very verbal student body! I was walking back to my dorm with a friend, and were walking very slowly, as if walking through mud. I said to her, &quot;Maybe we should tell someone&quot; and she said &quot;No, don&apos;t bother&quot;. When I got to my dorm, I called the TV station (left a message) and the police (who didn&apos;t believe me). That was it. No one ever spoke about it. I forgot about it almost immediately. Then I started remembering it in detail around 20 years later. This was the only time in my life I saw a &quot;UFO&quot;.

I suddenly saw a bright, white fireball in the sky. I ran to the window and watched it fall for a couple of seconds before it disappeared behind the trees. It was bright white and appeared to be on fire. The moving flames were white hot, however, not orange, yellow, or red. I felt no thud of impact, heard no sounds, nor saw flames of an explosion. I ran to my car and drove east along our road to check the neighbors&rsquo; homes for flames or evidence of a crash site where a small plane may have crashed. I was basically looking for flames. Finding nothing, I hurried home and called 911 to report what I&rsquo;d seen to the Crow Wing County Sheriff&rsquo;s office. After discussing it with the dispatcher, I jumped on a snowmobile and looked for signs of an aircraft crash out on the lake ice, finding nothing. A short time later I received a call from the investigator from the sheriff&rsquo;s office who had just checked Northgate Lane, further to the east. He, too, found nothing, and we concluded that we were looking for a needle in a haystack, and that I might have seen a meteorite.

The light was not a color that I know but it reminds me of halogen head lights. Sort of blue-ish. But not like a light on a plane&hellip;not blinking&hellip;just steady&hellip;but to clear to be a headlight. The object continued over the tree line and then began traveling towards the crescent shaped light.  As the object passed by there was a series of lights on the back of the object.

They seemed to cross the sky in formation&hellip;and to move with purpose as if they were being instructed to do what they were doing&hellip;..They hovered at a point for a moment and then they began to fly around the sky going in a circular patter flying from west to east passing close to the crescent light and then moving on, sometimes moving in a zig zag pattern. At one po! int an o bject came from the crescent light. There were three small bright lights it hovered for a moment. My eyes caught a bright flashing light coming from the woods. The light was a sort of off white color&hellip;it streaked across and then the light went up into the sky&hellip;.I saw the same object that I saw leave the crescent shaped light begin to move to above where the lights from the woods were.

She has no interest in UFO&apos;s and is a typical 13 year old liking shopping and Hannah Montana. I am a pure skeptic myself but she rarely is untruthful and I can always tell.  In my opinion she was not lying nor would she have a reason to be untruthful. Here is what I can remember from our conversation. She was in bed last weekend which would be around the 20th of January I guess and it was around 11 PM at night. She heard a large gush of wind and looked out her bedroom window. She then witnessed a triangular shaped craft hovering just above a tree in the front of her house. She said it was &quot;five feet&quot; away but from her description it was more then likely about twenty feet away from her window. It apparently made no noise other then the initial gushing from its decent. She drew a picture of it on her napkin and it is a standard triangle with little lights making the triangle form on the bottom and one larger light in the center of it. I asked her why she did not go get her mom or grab her camera but she stated &quot;I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off of it. It kind of made me stay there.&quot; Which I take is that it mesmerized her in some way. As I said she knows nothing about UFO&apos;s but I have seen a few programs on the History channel discussing the triangle craft sightings so I got pretty interested as it was a near perfect description of the footage seen on those shows. I asked her how big it was and she tried describing the size. The best I can come up with is an estimate and it was not very big. Maybe twenty feet long and able to hold two people max. I asked her what it was doing and she stated it was hovering over the tree top. She said she blinked her eyes and it was gone &quot;disappeared.&quot;  This event occurred in Graham WA in the area between Highway 7 and Meridian St which is still rural and heavily wooded. It is funny because just a few weeks ago, in our local paper, they had an article on Dennis Kucinich UFO sighting and they said it occurred at Shirley McClain&apos;s home in... Graham WA. Again, I do not believe in aliens and personally I think this is the next &quot;stealth&quot; fighter of its age and will be unveiled soon. For decades people reported the Stealth as an alien spacecraft until it lost its top secret status. The same thing will happen for the triangle crafts and I cannot wait as this technology is astounding. This account does not end here either and this is where I started to wonder if she was making this all up. She said she saw the craft again the next night! She had a sleep over at her friends (they live four miles away) so that would make the first account happening last Friday for the record. So on Saturday they get into her friends parents hot tub outside and she sees the craft again off in the distance about one hundred yards away. Her friends who thought she was crazy before saw it to and it simply descended from the top of the trees downward toward the ground and out of sight. This account was given to me two hours ago by my daughter and is accurate. I believe she saw the craft both instances and that McChord airforce base, which is near by, is performing tests on the triangle aircraft in Graham, Washington as we speak. If you need more info or need me to speak with her again for more detail let me know as this is all I have.", "A row of Five bright lights over ManhattanSaw five flashing large lights, sometimes changing color to red, in a horizontal line over Manhattan from the Jersey side of Hudson River.

My husband said &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an  F.O. , I  said F.O. what&rsquo;s that? My daughter who was about 13 then, said flying object Mom. My son who was  11 at that time, interrupted her and said you mean U.F.O.   I  asked him how  he could  tell that its not an airplane or something. He said, &lsquo;cause it looks like a boomerang with orange lights., and it&rsquo;s moving too slow for a plane.It had  5 big lights,  looked like headlights , but the one in the middle was white, and the other  4 were amber in color 2 on each side. It was very dark against the dim lit sky, you could see it was in a &ldquo;V&rdquo; shape and you could not see the sky between the lights . It was very large and looked to be as long as a football field  from wing tip to wing tip. We watched it all the way to our house , which was only a couple of minutes. We got out of our truck and watched it for at least  10 more minutes as it was moving towards Phoenix it looked to be right over Phoenix International Raceway going towards Sky Harbor International Airport. We could see the airplanes, coming  and going from the airport, and they were much  faster and higher up.I have seen  some strange things in the sky where I grew up, west of Phoenix  on  195thAve. or lovingly called Jackrabbit Trail, I&rsquo;ve watched the jets from Luke A.F.B. scramble out to the White Tanks mountain range on several different occasions following a sighting near or around Litchfield Park, Rainbow Valley , Goodyear/Avondale, and Buckeye  Arizona. One time we had a cigar shape U.F.O. hover over our own house, with a light so bright it was like lightning at night only not a flash but a steady ultra bright light, When my mother tried to take a picture with a Polaroid camera the whole inside of the camera melted, when she went to pull out the film, it was like melted strings of plastic or rubber and it stuck to her fingers like hot wax, she had a bad burn on her thumb and first finger from it. Then just as fast as it came, it just lifted up and out of sight, a few seconds later here come the jets from Luke A.F.B. That one I&rsquo;ll never forgot about. I was  only around 10 years old then. I am  a firm believer of  U.F.O.&rsquo;s  and you have to pretty self centeredCall to think that we are the only ones in this whole universe.", "Very bright brilliant white object  flying low altitude at an absurdly stunning speed.I was on my back patio sweeping rain water puddles off my walkway when I noticed a brilliant bright white light coming towards my home from the northeast. I saw the object for about 5 seconds before it was nearly going over my home but it was slightly to the north of me. This thing went by at an unearthly speed, did not change directions and was completely silent. I watched the object streak away from me heading southwest. I estimate the object traveled horizon to horizon in 10-15 seconds.The atmosphere was very clear at the time of my sighting but there were a few scattered low clouds. The object seemed to be flying just above the low clouds and was flying parallel to the ground.  It was extremely hard to make out the shape due to the brightness and speed but it appeared to be a classic saucer shaped UFO. There was an amazing bright white glow around the object as it passed by and it was stunningly beautiful. I did have a camera phone in my pocket but obviously had no time to attempt a picture.It&rsquo;s been about two hours since my UFO sighting and my heart is still racing with excitement. What was most shocking to me was how low this UFO was flying for such a remarkable speed and that it was silent! There must be others who witnessed what I saw.", "small bright star like object hovering in the skyi was standing at the backdoor of my house. the sky was clear with no clouds. there were 3 aeroplanes in the sky at the time. when i noticed a small bright object moving slowly in the sky it stopped moving above my house and stayed there for approx 10 mins with no sound and i could see it was rotating because the sun was catching it. then it slowly moved away then dissapeared. it was not a aeroplane or helicopter as i see them flying over everyday. this is the second time i have seen the object in the space of 4 months.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Then it seemed as though it knew we had discovered it and the UFO started to glide towards us and over our property and over the top of us and it was hugh.! It covered approx. 2 acres in size.These three lights were all under a triangular shaped craft, which seemed to rotate as they went.This triangular shaped craft glided silently over our entire yard and and a neighbors yard and had a violet to brownish amber color from the lights under it by then.I also noticed that there seemed to be a  like a &quot;field&quot; around the edges the triangle shaped craft, I say this because at the object passed over our heads the stars seemed to wiggle around the perhirphy of the outside circumference like heat stagger or like when you look out over the hood of your car on a hot sunny day, you see the heat rising off of it. Then the stars would disappear untill the object moved past us and stopped blocking the view of the stars.The National guard radar did not paint a target they told me, as i called them. but this triangle shaped craft suddenly moved faster than a jet plane as it left our area, and I wonder if there radar could even register that speed.This object was close, real close to us, like 1-200 feet above us, and all black.There was also no sound either before, during or after the sighting from the object.It gained enomous speed and curved north and east as it departed in a big hurry.We have not seen it since.

While i was driving I saw a diesel truck parked on the side of the road, i thought that was weird. but in the far distance i saw about 5-7 lights light up in a row and start spinnig slowly to the right.Then all of a sudden they shot off in the same direction (south) and dissapeared.

My fianc&eacute;e was already seated in my car.  As I rounded the car to the driver&rsquo;s side, I opened the door and proceeded to get inside.  Before I had entered the car, I glanced upwards (in the fluid motion of getting into the car, my head looked upwards) and saw the object.  There was low cloud cover, and the clouds were slightly lit from either the moon or the sunset, although not brightly.  Between the sporadic cloud cover, I witnessed an extremely fast bluish-white light traveling from my left to right.  The object appeared to be relatively low to the ground, but above the cloud cover.  There was absolutely no noise.  The first time I saw the object, it lasted for about 2 seconds.  Since I could see the trajectory of the object during that time, my eye continued along the sky to where it would have been if it were not obscured by the cloud covering.  A few seconds later, I witnessed it again between the clouds in the same color and speed as previously seen.  Since I am familiar with fighter jets in this area of San Diego, I am familiar with the relative speed at which they appear to be traveling to the ground observer.  This was significantly faster, and without the usual accompanying sound that jets make.  Additionally, it appeared that the object was completely glowing, or possibly I could only see the flame produced by the object.  It may be important to note that I have better than 20/10 vision, somewhere approaching 20/5 vision.  In the short time I saw the object, I could not see anything traveling in front of the object, such as a rocket, although this could be possible.  Also, the &ldquo;flame&rdquo; appeared the have a gradient of color from white at the top to blue at the bottom, not from end to end as might be expected from a jet or rocket flame.  Also, in comparison to the diameter of the flame, this would be an unusually long flame, as it appeared to have a length approximately 10 times i! ts heigh t.  Also, although observed very briefly, the ends of the object appeared to not be pointed, but rather slanted toward the top of the object.  There didn&rsquo;t appear to be any trail left by the object, although it was so bright that visually it left a slight optical trail.  This was far brighter than what you would expect even a full moon would reflect off a reflective object.  The moon, however, at that time, was below the horizon and not visible.  Sunset had been approximately 45 minutes earlier.  I will e-mail a diagram showing my best estimate at the distances and my position at the time of the sighting.  The red arrow on the diagram shows my position and direction of viewing. It may also be helpful to know that I have never reported a UFO, nor do I claim to ever have seen anything unexplainable before.

We were living out in the country on top of a knoll surrounded by cleared open pasture land. The night dark and overcast but not raining and no stars were visible. As we exited the car and started walking to the house something caused me to look up. I then spotted the lights on a vehicle passing directly above us. These strobe lights were in a &ldquo;V&rdquo; configuration that began at the lead point and traveled down the leading edge of both wings simultaneously. The object was quite large or quite low as it took up a large section of the sky above us but we were not able to accurately judge this due to the weather conditions that night that did not provide any stars behind it to outline the size and shape of it nor were there any ground lights to illuminate it. As we watched, this object made a slow turn to the south towards Knoxville and moved out of sight. At no time did we hear any noise from this object or any other lights. I have wondered about this for years now and have tried to debunk the experience as being a plane or a balloon but as yet can not. This object when spotted was traveling in an east to westerly direction and performed a slow 90 degree bank to the south.  It was moving at speed that would cause a commercial aircraft to stall and too large to be completely silent. We would have at least heard the air flowing across the wings and/or control surfaces. If it had been a balloon then we would have heard the engine as it moved southward.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The general size was roughly a little larger than a private prop plane. There were two cars infront of the truck and two behind all with different plates. All the vehicles had tinted windows and were white in color. From what my wife and I could see all the occupants of the vehicles were clean cut white males in what appeared to be white button down shirts.

I recall my husband and I were returning home from seeing the movie &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby&quot; with Mia Farrow. My husband (soon to be ex, at the time) was a navy pilot who after 6+ (?) years active duty, was still very active on weekends logging as many flight hours as he could manage (helicopters). Our house was in an older, established very residential area and our street was a rather steep hill from top to bottom. We lived about halfway up. My husband noticed something around the time we neared our house, that was in the sky seemingly at the top of the hill. Where our street ended, another street intersected where if you turned left, you continued on up the hill for some ways and very shortly you were in a quite rural area with farms, fields, etc.So he slowly proceeded past our house on up the hill out of curiosity, not really saying much. The object was huge and hanging apparently close to ground, not moving. Not making any sound. I was a little excited, my heart was speeding up, but I said nothing. I was young and trusted my husband in most matters, where if there were cause for alarm, he would not approach this thing and furthermore, as a pilot and a military officer, I figured he probably would be able to figure out what it was, etc. So I hung in there.We got to a sort of level part of the road, about a half a block long, and it seemed we were really close to the object by then and had a pretty clear view of it, and since it was not moving, we pulled over beside the road and either stopped or idled the car and just sat there and stared at it.There was a thickly wooded area across the intersecting street which we could see well from where we were. But I couldn&apos;t figure out exactly how close the thing was to us or to the trees. The wooded area was a small zoo actually; it did not seem that the object would have much opportunity to hover or land within the zoo area because it was rough terrain on foot, hilly and bumpy, etc. and the whole zoo area itself was small.The craft must have been just above the height of the trees, because the treetops did not obstruct any part of my view of it.  At any rate, probably if I were someone more mature than I was at the time, I could have estimated how far away it was, etc.  All I can say is that from where I viewed it, which was actually too close for my comfort, it was at least the size of 5-6+ school buses. It was a definite saucer shape and the overall color was a dull, non reflecting finish, maybe dull dark gray.  But there were lovely bright orange round lights spaced around the rim of the saucer. They were not the type of lights that were giving off light, or beams, they were just sort of lit from within.  And, on the dome part of the saucer, that is the hump part that sat on top of the saucer, there were seemingly windows spaced all the way around (I assumed, couldn&apos;t see anything but the side I was facing). They were rather small, rectangular shaped windows that were white, that is they emanated a white glow from within, not as bright lights but same as the orange lights in being lit from within. I was extremely curious at this point, wishing I could get a glimpse of something inside, but these &quot;windows&quot; did not seem to be like regular windows on a house, that is, for the purpose of seeing in and out of. They could have been just white lights or some other part of the craft that looked like windows to me.  Because the white of the rectangles seemed more of a solid white, you could not see through it.At any rate, I do not recall any of the lights blinking, although it is possible that the orange lights could have been. I don&apos;t think so, though. My husband and I just sat there looking at it for maybe 15 minutes, maybe more, sort of waiting for it to do something, but it did not do anything at all.  It just hung there silently.  It was a very clear night. I can remember how clearly I could see the thing. The outline of the dark parts of it were clearly visible because of the many street lights in the area.  I could not see the underside of the craft, though.  After awhile, my husband decided it was not going to do anything and so we drove home.I do not recall us ever talking about it and I forgot about it mostly, although I would recall it any time the expression UFO came up. I guess I just subconsciously decided that my husband probably had a good idea what it was, etc, but I had known him to be involved with military missions that were very secret and he could never discuss any part of them with me and of course I never pressed him on those matters. If I was wrong (and looking back I think I probably was), and he really had no idea what it was and was maybe even frightened by it, he would not have let me know that either, for not wanting to scare me.  At that time he was away a lot (50% of the time or more) and we had 2 toddlers, and I am sure he would not want me getting all hysterical over this idea, especially since he no doubt saw no threat.I was not a news person at that time, did not read newspapers etc.  But my husband did, and I am pretty sure he would have mentioned it if he had seen any articles about it.  He would have looked for them.  And in spite of where the craft was, in the midst of such a residential area, it was an extremely quiet neighborhood, and it&apos;s very unlikely anyone who lived there but us, saw the thing.  It does seem likely, though, that people driving by might well have seen it, as we did. The road that ran alongside the zoo was a somewhat busy street, that is, at least busier than the street our house was on. I suppose you would not really call it busy, though.  People were almost never outside or even awake (with inside house lights on) past 10:30 pm or so, on our street and nearby streets. The majority of residents were older, many retired folks. This was probably around midnight, give or take. I did not see any signs that any of the people were up and about as we drove up the hill, nor would I have expected to at that hour. At that time, we had not lived there very long, a year or so, and I was not very friendly with my neighbors yet, and I never discussed this with any of them or asked around to see if anyone had seen anything.  At that point in time, probably those particular folks would have gotten a bad opinion of me if I had!  In reading through the NUFORC website, I noted many older reports such as this, and so I decided it must still be relevant after all these years, so here it is.  At least it feels somewhat relieving to tell it to someone. I will attempt a rough drawing of the craft and enclose a Binghamton area map marked with the location, to be sent via snail mail.  This will take a little time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As I drove closer, the light was larger and brighter than a normal spotlight I&apos;ve seen before from a helicopter.  I began to slow down and stare through my windshield as I was coming upon it and was almost underneath.  I could tell it was coming from the right to the left as the beam of light was getting brighter.  When the front end of craft appeared in the opening of the roadway (above the trees by approximately 100-200yds), I realized this wasn&apos;t a helicopter.  I pushed my clutch in and pulled over to the side of the road.  The entire front end of the craft was the spotlight.  The best analogy I can give is it looked similar to the battlestar galactica in the first star wars movie.  It was very large and I was almost directly underneath it.  I pulled over, rolled down my window and looked almost directly up at it.  It was moving gracefully and slowly across the opening of the roadway.  The sound was a sound of a light to medium hum.  Almost like the sound of it going through the air.  There wasn&apos;t a rumble of an engine sound.  It sounded like when your furnace kicks on and you can hear the air blowing through the vent, except louder.    I remember thinking that this thing was huge.  The thoughts going through my mind where - this isn&apos;t a helicopter.  What kind of plane is this?  When I realized the entire front end, which was flattened, was the spotlight, I then looked for wings and there weren&apos;t any.  It was moving slowly as well.  I&apos;ve been in plenty of planes and currently live near an airport, and I know a plane moving that slow isn&apos;t possible.  At any rate, when I realized it wasn&apos;t a plane, around 1/3-1/2 ! of it wa s above me with the rear still hidden by the tree tops on the right hand side.  I then said to myself, scan this out and I started scanning all over it with my eyes.  The middle had a slowly pulsating red light.  There were many smaller white lights around the perimeter that were spaced, I&apos;d guess, at around 20-30yds each.  There were roughly 4-5 lights around the longer sides of the oval, with the spotlight out front.  After looking at the lights, I started to look at what was on the body of the craft.  There was stuff?  Again, like the battlestar galactica.  Whereas there were tons of protruding parts all over the place.  At this time, I realized I was out in the middle of no where, by myself.  I remember looking to my left out the window into the woods.  When I thought that I was alone out in the middle of the woods, and when I noticed the darkness of the woods, I got extremely scared, like a monster was about to come out of the woods and get me.  The scared/terrified feeling is like you get as a kid and almost become unable to move.  I remember locking my door and reaching to roll up the window and begin shifting into 1st gear.  As I was rolling up the window, I continued to watch it.  The front end was almost now out of sight and the rear end just broke out from above the trees on the right side.  I started to release the clutch and roll the car when the craft changed its speed.  It originally had to be going no faster than around 25-35mph (taking into consideration the distance).  When it sped up, it doubled/tripled its speed.  I looked forward and shifted into 2nd gear just as I saw car lights coming around the bend (just as I was pulling off of the shoulder of the road).  I figured they had to see this.  I began to slow down and they flew by going normal speeds.  I hit my brake lights to see if they would hit their&apos;s and no go.  I drove home, told my dad about it, he laughed and said it was probably a DNR helicopter.  I know what I saw.  I had time to evaluate it, it moved very slowly, it was dir! ectly ab ove me, and extremely close.  It did not have wings, it was not a helicopter unless there is one that is of this size, and it did not have an engine sound.  When I stretch my arms out, I can measure that the width of this was approximately the distance of my hands being apart of around 1.5 feet.  Extend that angle out to the length of those pines, then add around 100yds+ above that, and that&apos;s the width.  The length was the length of the entire view of the sky that can be seen across the roadway, then minus about 20yds or so.  When the front was about 20yds from being hidden from the trees on the left hand side, only then did I recognize the rear come out from the tree tops on the right hand side of the road.  It continued at its slow pace until it was around almost 1/2 out of view (I could still see the red light in the middle) then it sped up.  Total time from viewing the front of the craft until it was gone, approximately 1min.  I just closed my eyes and replayed the event and it was probably close to 30secs.  Very scary feelings.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The husband and wife were indoors when their farm dog began barking nonstop for a few minutes after 8pm local time when the husband eventually goes outside to check on what reason the dog kept barking. The dog was looking out to the NE of the house in a field so the husband looks up in the sky to see three huge amber lights hovering silently he guesses about 300 feet above a cattle field. Two were close together and one was up and to the left of the others.  The lights glowed orange-red with short spike-like beams emanating around each light.  The dog settled down laying in the yard watching the lights.  The husband is startled by its silence causing him to be awed and spooked by the lights. Suddenly the lights blinked out and the husband rushed back into the house and got his wife to come outside to tell her about the lights.  The wife came out with a pair of binoculars.  They see the lights reappear again silently hovering but the husband said they moved further away to the NE but reconfigured into a different pattern of three lights.  The wife looking through the binoculars said she sees four lights in a rectangular pattern now hovering just above the trees in the distance.  The weather is clear and cool near 45F with a SW breeze.  The husband said the area is rural cattle ranches SW of West Plains, Mo.  The husband agreed to check with his neighbors to the NW to see if they saw anything or may have had any strange animal deaths in the area.  The husband said that he had a similar sighting about a year ago last March 07 with a straight line of four large amber lights again hovering silently over the same general vicinity that just blinked out and reappeared further away. The husband is unsure about any missing time. Just a note this area was hit by a tornado earlier this month near Bakersfield.

I was looking west from just south of Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, California. It was just after 7:30pm. The weather was crystal clear. It was so clear tonight that I could see more stars than I&rsquo;m normally able to. There was a lot of air traffic tonight as well, but something else caught my eye. About 45 degrees above the horizon, a dim white light appeared. It was only as bright as a star, but it wasn&rsquo;t there before. It seemed to be as bright as the brightest star in the sky. It seemed to turn left. The light dimmed as it appeared to turn and simply vanished. There was no flashing light. There were no red and green navigation lights. I moved quickly to a darker spot, away from parking lot lights, and kept my eye on the same spot in the sky, looking over in the direction it seemed to be going, and there was nothing there. I stood and waited for a while, looking for any flashing light, no matter how dim. I have good night vision, had been outside for a while, and 20/20 vision to boot. Nothing appeared. I could see other planes in the sky. Even planes further away could clearly be seen with much brighter lights and the tell-tale flashing navigation lights I&rsquo;m used to seeing working by an airport all the time. This light was not over or near the airport, however. I believe it was very high up in the atmosphere and possibly off the coast. In fact, I believe what I observed was a &ldquo;Iridium satellite flare.&rdquo; It would be my first time seeing one, if that&rsquo;s what it was. I thought there would be more of a flash&hellip; This simply appeared and faded out after a few seconds. It was subtle, but it caught my eye.", "&quot;Shooting Star&quot; that made immediate 90 degree turnI was on the phone with a friend in my backyard and happened to look up towards the western sky just as what I though to be a &quot;shooting scar&quot; was streaking across the sky away from me and towards the west. About one second and 45 Degrees across the sky later the object promptly made a complete 90 degree turn towards the south and one second later vanished out of view. I have watched many meteor showers looking the exact same direction in my backyard before and have never seen anything like this, the amazingly effortless change in direction made me immediately believe that it was a UFO. I was so shocked that I went quite on the phone for several seconds until I finally came to and alerted my friend of what I had just witnessed.

She was sitting in the passenger seat up front and said &quot;look at that--its a spaceship circling the moon!&quot; There was still plenty of light out at this time of evening and the sky was perfectly clear. The moon was at 11:00 as we were driving. Of course I thought she was joking, even though she kept saying &quot;look, look, its a spaceship going around the moon&quot;. I still did not take her seriously, and then she said &quot;its over here now, between the telephone lines&quot;, and for a fraction of a second, I saw what she meant: a circular white light, that seemed to have a center and a halo, darting around.  I saw it only once; it would flash then dispappear. After the only time I saw it, we did not see it appear again. She obviously saw it for a few more seconds than me.

Around 2:45am yesterday night I was on my cell phone with my friend talking to her and sitting on my steps outside my door. In the East I seen what looked like a bright star, at fist I thought it was Venus, but it started getting brighter and brighter and it was moving closer, it wasn&rsquo;t moving very fast probably just a little faster then a normal plane. It wasn&apos;t a plane beacuse it was a lot bigger and it didn&apos;t make any noise. For a few moments I thought it might have been a meteor rite. It was coming towards me and it looked like it was going to fly over my neighborhood, but instead it turned upwards and started to rise towards a patch of clouds. There was a break in the clouds and it flew up through them, and then into another higher patch of clouds and disappeared until I couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore. A few minutes after that I heard one or two millatary jets fly over out of the opposite direction in the West over my head towards where I seen the light go into clouds. I couldn&rsquo;t see them though cause there was more clouds that moved in. I described everything on the phone to my friend as I was seeing it. I&rsquo;m not sure what it was&hellip;  It could have been. A very large falling star... slow moving (for a fallinf star) that kinda fell/flew but then ascended upward back into the clouds. A plane with a huge bright light bigger then the plane strapped on the front. I ruled out it being a satellite or the space station cause it was under the clouds and sorta low and in mid sky within the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. To me it&rsquo;s a UFO&hellip; that&rsquo;s what I got the feeling that it was, by the shape of it, and because it was Unidentified, Flying, and it was an Object. The best I can describe it is a bright star that looked like Venus does on a good night which is what it looked like at first. Only it got 50 times bigger as it got closer. I could tell it was bigger then a plane it was glowing like a golden bright white light, oval and round in shape. It didn&apos;t make any sound. The maneuvers it made by flying towards me horizontally and then it moved upwards vertically into the clouds have to say that there was something was piloting it. This was defiantly something other then the norm. I don&apos;t have any tapes or pictures. I&apos;m writing this incace anyone else seen anything or got anything in a photo or on tape the night of Febuary the 16th or early in the morning on the 17th 2008 over Texas around the time after the cold front moved though.

It seemed to move too slowly for an aircraft.  It gradually drifted Northward and after a couple minutes it changed course and moved toward the East as it dimmed.

At the time, I was entering my senior year at U.C. Davis.  I am now a practicing trial lawyer.  I was returning home from a job training that had lasted all day.  I had consumed no alcohol and I wasn&apos;t under the influence of any drug.  I have never suffered from any delusion. As I was driving on the causeway, in the middle lane, I noticed two red dots hovering over my windshield.  At that point in time, I couldn&apos;t tell how high they were.  I could only see them from my peripheral vision.  I assumed I was being speed tracked by a police helicopter.  So, I tapped on my brakes to slow down, as I was speeding.  I could clearly see two red lights, one hovering directly over the other in a vertical position.  At this point, I was sure I was being tracked by a helicopter.  I couldn&apos;t see any shape, and my fear grew, because I was sure I was going to get a speeding ticket.  The red lights hovered only about 50 feet over my front windshield. To my amazement, the red lights came to hover directly in front of my car, and suddenly white lights lit up and illuminated the craft and the entire freeway.  I was so shocked.  I looked around to see if any other cars on the freeway could see what I saw.  To my left, there was a red Jeep Cherokee with about 2-4 college girls.  I could clearly see the woman with light brown, shoulder length hair looking over her steering wheel, eyes fixated on the craft. At this point, the craft was still only about 50 feet over our cars.  White track lights lit up one after another to create a moving effect along the outer circumference of the craft.  The craft was shaped as if two low sloping cones were put together.  So, from the top or bottom I imagine it looked circular.  From the side view that I witnessed, it was diamond shaped.  The craft was silver in color and had no other edges.  The track lights would take about one second to travel along the edge of the craft; again, these side white lights were extremely bright, like flood lights.  The craft remained lit for about 3 minutes. All of a sudden the very bright track lights went out, and one could only see the two vertical red lights.  The red lights then shot off westerly in the fastest acceleration I could ever imagine, leaving a solid red line in my vision.  Seconds later, I could see the red lights darting hither and to over the hills around Fairfield and Vallejo.  I could see this darting behavior for about 30 seconds to one minute. The girls in the red jeep and I pulled off to the Mace Blvd exit in Davis, CA.  We both got our of our cars, screaming and yelling, &quot;Oh my God! Did you see what I saw?&quot; We asked each other if we had cameras.  Then, I got in my car and sped off to my apartment.  I screamed for my roommate and a friend to grab a camera.  I told them about the incident.  Then we went out toward Vacaville on Highway 80 West. I could no longer see the red dot over Fairfield.  So I pulled off to an 7-11 store and asked if anyone else saw a UFO.  I got some really wierd looks, and my friends thought I was a bit loony.  When we were getting back into my car, we could hear loud sounds of jets.  We looked up and there were numerous Air Force jets, fighter jets, cargo jets, etc., flying in two or three separate formations.  They were flying low and we could all see well over 20 jets flying west in the direction of the UFO that I had seen. It has been 13 years since I saw this event.  I tried to forget about it, but it has to be the single most influential event that has occurred in my life.  I live a pretty eventful life as a trial attorney, but this has never left my mind.  I think of this event often.  My memories of it are very clear.  The event has caused me to question many fundamental things about my existence, my religion, and my government, questions that are yet unanswered.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

After six am, I noticed a light in the sky just a little north of the highway but off in the east.  I looked at it for a bit and decided that it was probably a star- but it just didn&rsquo;t seem like the right place for one- not too mention I didn&rsquo;t see any other stars.  So, I just watched it as I traveled east.  As I headed east, I went onto the Basin Bridge, also known as the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway.  Light began to break and I watched the light, I had also thought maybe it was an airplane, but it had no Navigational Lights and it should have passed me by now.

I was West Bound on I-90 in the vicinity of Mile Marker 232.  I saw a very bright flash of light in my drivers door window.  I turned my head  and observed one large yellow light with two smaller lights.  One of the smaller lights appeared to be blue and the other a coppery bronze. There was no observable lateral motion.  All observable motions was either downward (which was my best guess) or directly away from me.  I lost view of them without seeing impact either because they burned out or impacted below a small line of hills south of the Interstate in this area.  The area of observation was dark as the moon was on the opposite side of my car in its setting phase. The flash of light in my drivers door window surprised me and I immediately turned my head for fear something was coming through the median at me.  It was high enough that I never saw in in my rear view mirror. I am a retired AF flight crew member.  I recognize that lateral displacement would indicate movement parallel with me and the lack of lateral movement would indicate movement directly towards me or away from me or straight down (which was my impression).

They seemed to be alluminated by something and were a glowing orange/red color.  They were very high in the sky.  Flying around similar to the way a group of birds would.  But there is no way they were birds because they were too high in the sky to be able to be seen.  I know these objects were extremely high in the sky because an airplane flew over head about 60 seconds after they were gone and it was about the same distance up, (maybe a little lower) and was much larger.

The height and size of the object is impossible for us to properly determine. However, a rough estimate would make it about the size of an asprin at arm&apos;s length, and 1,500 ft in altitude. The weather conditions are as follows: Temp 41. Wind Chill 32. Partly cloudy. SSE Wind 20mph. Gusts 30. Visibility 10 miles. Humidity 44%. Barometric pressure steady. Moon near full. No noise was heard by either of us. Sadly, I was without camera or video so I couldn&apos;t document it, other than posting it here and elsewhere as a case file.

It was just near or above the top of the trees in the park , just above the children&rsquo;s play structure.  The flashing or strobing light was similar to a police car light except the light thrown was as big as a city block.  I turned to see the center of the light turn yellow/orange with drips of the same color. Then it was gone.  My sister, who was looking the opposite direction, saw bright colorful lights illuminate her field of vision. She notes the absence of sound accompanying the lights.((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor at 05:28 hrs..

G. cutter Valiant, which was (is?) stationed in Galveston Texas. We were going to Norfolk, Virginia, for some battle training at the naval shipyard there. I was usually put on lookout, since I had very good eyes back then. I think we were off the coast of Miami (anyway, I remember it as being in the Bermuda triangle) and I saw a light come down from the clouds.  I was looking north, and this light came from the west and landed on the water. A few seconds later, I saw the light continue flying east and up and into the clouds. I dismissed this as a water plane landing on the ocean at the time, but wondered why it only took a few seconds to fly off again.  Then again, it could have been a helicopter that just idled near the water.  It was too far away to know for sure.The strange thing about this trip, is that on another watch in the Bermuda triangle, I was told to report all boats and ships in the area because there where multiple contacts on the radar. I thought the guys were pulling my leg, because it was a clear night and the moon was shining bright, but there was nothing but smooth water on the ocean. When I switched shifts to steer the ship, sure enough there was multiple contacts on the radar. I thought maybe a school of whales, but we never saw any break the surface.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The object did not make any sound what so ever that I could tell. This thing was the biggest thing I have ever seen in the air, and it was probably several miles away. I noticed a small Cessna aircraft in the vicinity and the object dwarfed the aircraft. The Cessna aircraft look as big as a pinhead next to this object. The object then moved in a southerly direction and disappeared behind a building. I went around the building to maintain my view and the object seemed to have just disappeared. There were several other people out walking and saw this object as well.", "black triangle masks stars in Santa ClaritaSummer 1998, in the backyard hot tub with my wife, in Santa Clarita, California.  Totally clear, starry sky.  Of course, I&apos;m not looking at the sky, I&apos;m looking at my wife&apos;s bikini top.  But she&apos;s looking at the sky (damn you, pot belly!), and she says, &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot;  We both look up, and there&apos;s this triangle shape obscuring the stars.   It&apos;s totally black, slowly moving from east to west, silently.  That&apos;s the thing I remember most, the silence.  Our neighborhood is very quiet, so any aircraft passing overhead is always audible.  In retrospect, I wish I had grabbed a camera, but this was when 1-megapixel digital cameras were state of the art and didn&apos;t come with shutter speeds, plus I was wet.  So we just watched this triangle mask the stars as it slowly cruised overhead.   From our view, the size was like if you put both your forefingers and thumbs together in the shape of a triangle and held your arms out.  There were no lights at all.  I have waited over 10 years to tell this story, and I present it here as fact witnessed by my own eyes.  I wasn&apos;t beamed up by a UFO with multicolored Christmas lights.  I saw a black triangle obscuring the stars.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As we approached Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport&amp;#8206; (a small Cessna airfield and flight school) to our north west, I noticed about 6 bright yellowish/white lights in a V pattern; only it looked more like a &ldquo;check&rdquo; because the last top-left area was not lit. I&rsquo;m familiar with &ldquo;Lights over Phoenix&rdquo; and I called my good friend who is quite skeptical of the famous video. At this point, I assumed I was looking at a couple Cessnas doing night training, but I wanted to call my friend and tell him what I was seeing just for fun. While I was on the phone with him, my Fianc&eacute;e pointed out that there was a 7th light now in the sky next to them- and much to my surprise, I looked up to see the 7th light duplicate to reveal an 8th light, which instantly glided into position, turning the &ldquo;check&rdquo; into a &ldquo;V.&rdquo;  Two minutes into the event, as we neared the small airport, it became evident that the lights were not tiny Cessna aircrafts. We could now also make out that each ball of light was in fact three large white lights, as if a commercial airliner had a large spherical light on the bottom-front of the plane and one large spherical light on each wing tip. About another 30 seconds passed and the &ldquo;V&rdquo; shape broke up and each aircraft began to pass over head. At a stop light, I opened my car door and stepped out to get a better look at these &ldquo;planes.&rdquo; It was when one was right over head that I noticed a tiny red beacon in the very center of the aircraft that was blinking. There were no stars in the sky, and I cannot 100% fully verify that the triangle shaped craft was connected all the way around- but for whatever reason, despite never seeing a photo of one, I just assumed it was triangle shaped. It&rsquo;s like I could make out the darker matter. I couldn&rsquo;t make out wings or anything, but my mind saw it as a triangle. My fianc&eacute;e asked me what was going on, and I told my friend I would call him back. I told her I thought the planes were actually &ldquo;UFO&rsquo;s&rdquo; because at that point I had no idea what they were and I wanted to scare her. They were large, triangular shaped crafts who made no noise as they passed overhead. I&rsquo;ll reiterate that it was midnight on a deserted street and literally no noise could be heard. I turned into an apartment complex and physically got out of my car and attempted to take a picture with my phone. My hand couldn&rsquo;t stay still and with the VGA resolution I snapped a blurred picture that looked more like headlights than anything else. I deleted it when I got home (before I realized the significance of our encounter.)  Because I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to fathom alien crafts, and my fianc&eacute;e didn&apos;t appreciate me trying to freak her out, I just assumed I was witnessing some new airliner which I&rsquo;d never seen before and began to drive home. I took I-69 south and noticed one of the aircrafts following the highway. This struck me as extremely odd because I&rsquo;ve lived in Indy for quite a while and never before had I seen a low flying airliner simply &ldquo;follow&rdquo; the highway. It passed overhead and I saw a few more off in the distance. It was actually really eerie. I&rsquo;d never felt like that before. I got home and Googled whether or not Indianapolis International had any delays or runways out, explaining why so many aircrafts were simply cruising around the city at low altitudes at midnight. Literally every flight was on time. That&rsquo;s the last I thought about this event until today when I stumbled upon a website describing these triangle shaped UFO&rsquo;s with three white lights and a center red beacon. I noticed how they mentioned these crafts fly low over populated areas, and even follow highways. When I read that line I literally got chills. I&rsquo;m not going on record saying I witnessed alien crafts, but I will stand by my report that I saw exactly what all of these websites are describing as &ldquo;triangle shaped UFOs.&rdquo; The physical description and behaviors mimic exactly as what I witnessed. I felt that I had an obligation to tell somebody or some organization that I witnessed a number of these crafts. I&rsquo;d sure like to know what they were. I&rsquo;d draw you a picture but it would look exactly like the dozens out on the web right now, except the center red light was about a quarter of the size as the three white lights. Well, that&rsquo;s that.", "Silver bright obect over HeathrowI noticed a silver bright object from my bedroom window.  It was stationary and i watched this oject for several minutes.  The time was around 12:35pm and the sky was beautiful blue and clear. One of my main concerns was the fact that it was actually over Heathrow airports flight path. As i continued to watch this object it never once moved its position, as i tried to capture this on my camcorder it started to flash once really bright then the flash got a little dimmer and suddenly disappeared.", "Might be a UFOI was setting an item on my deck in the back of my apartment and I noticed a bright light blinking light coming from the sky.  So I turn my head expecting to see a plane moving across the night sky but instead I see an almost motionless blinking light.  I thought well maybe it is a satellite but then I noticed a satellite to the left of the light that was pretty faint in comparison.I called my Roommate over to look at it to double check to make sure I wasn&apos;t crazy and I was seeing what I was seeing.  She came to the deck and I didn&apos;t even need to point the object out.  She noticed it right away.  She saw it move in a little circle but it was so far up in the atmosphere it was barely noticeable.The colors it is Blinking is red, blue, green and white.  It is too far up to make out an actual shape.  And who knows we could be wrong and it could just be a really low satellite. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??

Difficult to see was a small sphere like object, white in appearance and resembling a star but rounder edges. Two co-workers also saw the object.  It did not move for a period of at least 30 mins. It was very bright, sunny day, with wispy high clouds that moved fairly rapidly as it was quite windy.  My first thought that is was possibly a weather balloon.  It was difficult to spot, and the fourth person was not able to see it because of the bright sky, though the sun was behind and above us.  I took photos with my cell phone, but strangely there is the pole I used as a marker but instead of the very small object we were looking at there is an oval large bright light.  This happened in two consecutive photos. I was wondering if anyone else has reported anything like this today.  There was a tremendous amount of jet traffic and contrails in that sector of the sky. As far as I have checked there were no unusual celestial events going on either.  I thought I would go ahead and report this since we have had some ufo sightings in this area recently.((NUFORC Note:  We just spoke with this witness, and we found her to be quite credible.  She had contacted the National Weather Service, and Carlswell AFB, attempting to determine whether they might have launched weather balloons, and they both reported that they had not done so.

We stared a few moments and began walking again. I stopped to talk with the safety guy and we watched it for at least 10 min. Others noticed us and began watching. You could see the air traffic from Sea-Tac well below the light. Once back on the aircraft carrier some of the Stennis officers and sailors had noticed it also, a couple of men maybe piolets because of their clothing said theres no way thats a hovering chopper.I figure at about 7:40 pm it flickerd twice and was gone, just blinked out.

I had almost forgotten about it so when I started taking pictures the earths shadow had already covered most of the moon. This was around 7:35 my first few shots were handheld but I decided that the tripod would be a good idea. I took many pictures tracking the moon as it moved to the right across the sky. I stopped taking pictures around 20:10 because clouds were starting to move in. I never saw anything out of the ordinary while I was taking the pictures.After I downloaded the images I noticed a rainbow colored object in the lower left hand corner. Out of the 34 pictures I took it&rsquo;s in almost every one. Even the shot where I made the mistake of using a flash.I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not a light refraction. There is clearly a saucer shaped object with a full spectrum of colored lights wrapped around it. You can clearly see that the colored light wraps around the object. You can see how the light glows out into space kind of like a flashlight beam. My only guess as to why I didn&rsquo;t see it is that the light must pulse at a rate that makes the object invisible to the naked eye. Kind of like when you take a picture of an older TV &amp; see line in the picture that you can&rsquo;t see when you&rsquo;re actually watching the TV.((NUFORC Note:  The witness describes himself as an experienced photographer.

I thought maybe it was a satellite dish.  As I was watching it I noticed that it was moving very fast, unlike a satellite or airplane, it was very bright. After about 30 seconds of watching it I noticed that about 5 more of these started to appear all over the sky all around the same time. These bright lights were moving very fast, all over the place.  About 15 seconds after the other lights showed up an much bigger object appeared. The very large object was bright and slow.  It was not moving near as fast as the small lights, it was traveling slowly, it was dimming in and out. It would be bright and fade out, then get bright, fade out, etc. After fading in and out for about 10 seconds it completely disappeared, that is when I ran inside to get my 2 friends because I knew this was very strange.  When we were all outside, the large pulsating light was gone but the smaller lights were still in the sky flying around.  About 2 minutes later, the large light appeared again very briefly, disappeared, and was on the other side of the sky.  Surrounding the large light were about 5 of the smaller lights, just hovering around it.  This lasted a very short amount of time and they all started to disappear one by one. On the opposite side of the sky, the last little light we saw shot out into space at a very high speed until we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  Not even a minute after the last light shot into space, 2 Air Force jets flew  by. I knew these were jets for obvious reasons (lights and sound).  The UFO&apos;s had no sound at all.((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea whether this is a serious report, or not.  The witness provides only an e-address.

In less than one second there was an F-4 fighter plane chasing a glowing orange ball about 20 feet in diameter, 75 to 80 feet in front of the F-4. They flew almost directly over our head at less than 200 feet.The F-4 and the glowing orange object continued out over the adjacent interstate highway for a mile or so, toward the River de Peres. Before they got to the river, still at just above treetop height, the orange ball abruptly changed direction by approximately 90-degrees, and increased speed to the point that it was able to cross half the sky (60 degrees of angle) from left to right and achieve an altitude of 10 miles or more, in less a quarter second. The object then, just as abruptly, stopped dead in the sky, and it appeared to be taking a position so as to better observe the F-4 as it banked around looking for it. Or so it seemed to a 13-year-old&rsquo;s imagination.After the glowing orange object abruptly changed course, the F-4&rsquo;s engines--previously very loud--suddenly became almost silent, and he banked right and left a couple of times as if he were looking for the object. He then continued for a couple of seconds, and made a wide sweeping turn over the River de Peres, and doubled-back over his previous path.After a few seconds, the glowing orange spherical object sitting still in the sky shot away at incredible speed and was completely out of sight within an eighth of a second.It has been many years since this occurred, and I just want to make sure that it gets reported.

They were about plane&rsquo;s altitude above the house. One set was right above my neighborhood (The Fairchild neighborhood), one set was further east perhaps Cedar Knolls/Parsipanny),  two other sets were further west, towards Randolph/Washington Valley area.  Within in each IDENTICAL set of lights were four smaller, white,  round, globes which moved in a rapid clover leaf like/&rdquo;infinity&rdquo; pattern - never touching each other, and always staying in the same circumference. There was not a sound coming from these formations.  All four sets had these four lights moving in the same &ldquo;infinity&rdquo; pattern, but not in complete timed unison with each other. I ran in the house to get my husband and the phone. I got a flashlight to &ldquo;try and signal back&rdquo;.  We did not have a digital camera, or a video camera at the time, nor a phone camera, or, I would have grabbed one of those items.  My son who was about 3-3 1/2 at the time was peering at them from his window.  My neighbor, a fireman,  came out via my husband&rsquo;s beckoning, and they were standing on his stoop in awe.   We live near to Newark and Morris County airports, but these were most definitely not planes, as we are in the flight patterns of many large and small planes, and helicopters we are frequented by the sights and sounds of planes constantly. These sets of lights did not move. These were also not the &ldquo;attention floods&rdquo; used for celebrations or grand openings of businesses. There WAS NO BEAM of light coming up from the ground, nor coming down, or forward as search lights in helicopters, or a plane&rsquo;s path lights. Each set stayed in the same spot for about 20-40 minutes.  I can not remember exactly, however it was long enough for me to call the police, call my Mom, and call one of my good friends.  When I called the police, they did say that other people had reported seeing the strange lights in the sky. I had inquired about any noted celebrations where folks might have had &ldquo;attention floods&rdquo; beaming up, but none could be noted. I have also seen the &ldquo;flash lights&rdquo; that the local Morris County Airport shooting up on cloudy nights near Rt. 24, but these would never have been visible in my neighborhood, and not in four distinct sets over such a large area of geography. I went out to walk around the neighborhood to see if I could get a better view, but at this point, the clouds were clearing, and then lights were gone but, I did not get to see how they dispersed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was with my instructor at the time and had been flying on instruments only (IFR) for 20-30 min. At the time we were mid-way between Palm Springs and Apple Valley, which was our destination.We were approx. north-east of Big Bear when my instructor said to me that &ldquo;we have traffic at 12:00&rdquo;. This statement was to notify me that we had converging aircraft directly in front of us. This in itself was alarming because federal regulations state that all west and east converging aircraft were to fly at 1000 feet separation plus 500. This aircraft was obviously ignoring the rules because he was heading straight at us! As this object approached closer and we prepared for evasive maneuvering, we noticed that this object was void of any type of wing surfaces, propellers, engine nacelles, or landing gear. As we drew closer the object seemed to veer and passed off our left wing at approx. 100 feet. At this distance it simply appeared as a metallic sphere. It left no contrail, had no cockpit, and was most certainly moving under its own power on a flat trajectory.My estimation of its closing speed was that it was flying close to ours, based on my past experiences with other aircraft in close proximity. At the time we were flying in the 120mph range. The time available to see this machine was probably no more that 5-6 seconds at the most.Once it passed, I banked sharply to get on its tail. But by the time we were in position&hellip;it was simply..gone! Nothing had been said between my instructor and I during this entire event, until after we had finished looking for the object. I asked him &ldquo;what was that?&rdquo; His response was that he had no idea, and then told me &ldquo;when we get back, don&rsquo;t say a word about this ok?&rdquo; And I never did. Not until almost 20 years later, when I found him again flying for a major airline, and had a chance to speak with him about it. All our recollections matched, and we both were still perplexed as to what that thing might have been.Since those days I have acquired a commercial pilot&rsquo;s license and flown professionally. I have also acquired several degrees, one of which is in Aeronautics. And in addition, I became a federally licensed aviation maintenance technician.Now I am a public school teacher at the secondary level and teach technology education and aviation science classes.And NONE of my training, education, or professional experiences has helped me to explain what I saw that hot summer afternoon so long ago.", "Very Close encounter with a UFO.Me and my two other friends were on a road trip to Houston TX. Normally people would take I-10 all the way, but for some reason my friend who was driving at that time, took some other route which lead us further away form civilization. I think we were somewhere near New Mexico.  It was about 4:00am. The sky was still kinda dark. Not a single car on the freeway. I was sleeping in the passenger seat when all of a sudden my friend who was the driver, woke me up and pointed to the sky above and said what is that?  I sat up and cleared my eyes and looked above. There it was, a UFO no more than 150ft above our car on the freeway.  At that time, the sky was still dark. But as close as that UFO was to our car. There&apos;s no mistaken that it was a UFO. The UFO was coming down as we were looking at it. Surpisingly, the UFO made no kind of noise at all. It was moving very very slow. It was 360 degree with three circle lights under the flying object. As the UFO came down and hover to the side of the freeway it got so close to the ground, the UFO was literaly touching the grass. Then it started to move into the dark and out of our sight and that&apos;s when we lost total sight of the UFO. To this day, I still remember what I have seen that night. It was unbelieveble. I Don&apos;t deny what I have saw that night nor could anyone tell me that I could of mistaken it for a plan.  This UFO was so close to us that it was literaly sitting above our car no more than 150ft and coming down even closer.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

A small bright light was flying along the terraced houses opposite (across a green about 100ft away) just at the level of the roof gutters.

It moved to the end of the row of houses where it rose up to the full height of the roof. I was still looking for &apos; the person controlling the model plane,&apos; when it started to accelerate and ascend.

It could have been any time between early 1974 through summer of 1976.  Though, I believe it was a summer evening in 1975 after dark, which would make it after 9:00 PM EDT.  I am estimating the time based the fact that some of the neighbors who were there moved to a different neighborhood in 1976, and I don&apos;t think I had started first grade yet, which I did in September 1975.  I put it in summer, because I don&apos;t think I would have been out riding bikes in the dark during school, but it could have been spring and maybe earlier in the evening, but it was definitely after dinner.  It could have been 1974, and I have seen similar reports from that year, but for some reason I think it was later. I was out riding bikes with my brother and some neighbors in Newnan, Georgia.  In the summer of 1975, I was 5 years old and my brother was 8. There were 5 or 6 of us all gathered at the end of the driveway of the kid across the street from my house.  We were in a subdivision off Roscoe Road, and during the event we were facing due north. Most of the land in that direction for about a quarter mile was undeveloped forest, but there were houses on the gravel back road and pasture beyond some of the woods.  Right next to my house was a clearing that at one time was going to be a short road, and the neighbor&rsquo;s driveway was directly across the street from it. What caught our eye was a huge, glowing, orangey-yellowy circle or sphere that flew in from the west and hovered near the center of that clearing, not too far over the tree line.  We all stood and watched it hover for a moment, then it split in half vertically and fire shot up out of the middle. I don&rsquo;t remember an actual fireball being released, just an explosion of fire.  Then the two halves came back together and the sphere flew back off to the west and below the horizon.   I seem to remember it went up a little before it went west and down.  All the movements &ndash; appearing, disappearing, splitting, and rejoining &ndash; were calm, smooth and controlled, like gliding. From what I remember, it didn&rsquo;t make any sound. I don&apos;t recall it illuminating anything. It seemed to be close, maybe &frac14; to &frac12; mile away, but there is no way really tell how far away it was or how large. The width of the clearing was standard two-lane road length, about 20 feet, and the object appeared to take up about the same amount of space in width from our perspective. It may have been a little narrower or wider than the clearing, but not much.  The entire event was brief, probably under a minute. I haven&apos;t seen those neighbors in a long time, but my brother and I still talk about it from time to time.  My sister had gone in for a minute and missed it, but she remembers us telling her about it. I have never seen any mention of it anywhere by anyone else and don&apos;t recall anything at the time.  I come to sites like this occasionally to search for a description of anything similar around the same time. Not knowing where the object really was means, of course, that anyone for many, many miles could have seen it.  I&rsquo;ve found a few similar stories from around GA around that time, but the only one that mentions fire at all reported a fireball from a rectangle. A couple of years ago, I met some folks in Athens, GA who knew two guys that I knew in high school in Newnan.  They told me that in the mid-to-late 1980s, two of them were in one of their backyards lying on a trampoline and saw some type of event which they described as a UFO that totally freaked them out.  I don&apos;t recall all the details of their experience, but I do know it was different from mine.  I think they saw a line or other formation of several lights.  At any rate, I got very excited when the people started to tell me about it, because I thought it may have been around the same time as my sighting.  After I found out it was a good 10-13 years later and different, I still remained quite excited about it, because that particular guy lived about 2 miles north of my house in the Macedonia Road area.", "The object was travelling at quite high speeds !

The weather was quite bad but because of how low the craft was flying there was no mistaking that it was not of this earth ! there was no sound so it was definately not a plane or hellicopter ! As it got into the distance it didnt go down or up, the light just vanished.As it went accross the fields --and im being very very serious ! a beam of light came down from the craft and hit somewhere in sherwood forest ? it was more of a quick burst of energy !! as though it shot the ground with an energy beam or something fell from it ??

As a dog handler, I knew their perception was keener than my own and I looked to where both dogs were focasing their aggressive behaviour. To my complete shock &amp; fear, both dogs were looking up in the same direction at a 45 degree angle. I looked but did not immediatly realize what I was vaguely beginning to see was the silouete of a triangular shape no more than 100 ft above me and no more than 200 yards in front of me. The most upsetting feeling was consuming me as this shape was standing still in the air without the slightest sound! In retrospect to the angle, nose straight up with bottom triangular sections down. A terrible sence consumed me which I can only ascertain was what was making my dogs snarl and show their teeth. I did not stay any longer and pulled my dogs and took them back to the house. Many years later when the Stealth was first revealed I was amazed at how similar it was to what I witnessed in 1983. Possibly could have been the testing of the stealth but I still question why it would have been over Cookstown in lieu of the endless barren miles of the military range. The key I would assume that would solve this or separate this incedent from question would be if the stealth is capable of hovering 100 ft off the ground, nose straight up without making a sound or vibration.", "shiny metallic red top in Briarwood,NY 5-10 min.While walking my dog in the local park at Briarwood,NY.

We were traveling north. Now we are turning left at the light. I look up in the sky to my right and see an orange red glow. As I&apos;m telling everyone to look all of us except my youngest which is four, see the one red orange glow. At first we were thinking maybe a plane blew up or a star fell from the sky. Then right after seeing the first glow, we see four or five other round orange, reddish glows below it and slightly to the east.  It was one glow and stayed glowed until the other four or five lit ,but they either had just appeared or lit up at the same time. They were not in a circular formation. They were in more of almost a straight line curving slightly east with the last two even more so to the east.  From the distance they seemed to be the size of a basketball. They stayed in one spot and glowing for no more than 10 seconds,it was just enough time to get a good look and then there was no glows..so we assumed they were gone.   At this point we are all looking at each other saying we never saw this before.  After going through the drive thru teller as we are leaving we all look up across the street hoping we see this again so we can take a picture with our camera phone.  We are further west now than what we were but only about three blocks down the street. About two or three minutes later now leaving the bank we are starting to traveling east and my husband, oldest and self start yelling at the same time look their they are again.  It was the same thing pretty much the same formation as before.  They stayed in one spot with the same glow.  Again they did not stay long.  Its like the glows were there and gone. I didn&apos;t get a picture. It probably would not have came out good on a cell phone but I would have like to have tried.  You could clearly see they had moved, in the west direction. The orange red circular glows best described, looked like the tip of a cigarette lit..that bright orange color. Now after doing some research we believe these could have been some sort of ufo space craft.  I do believe that we do have visitors that come to earth and some don&apos;t.  I&apos;m sure most people don&apos;t want to talk about it either since people will think the ones that do are crazy. Could you let me know what you think.

I was sitting there looking up at the stars, ( the sky was clear and no wind) a typical thing for me to do, and all of the sudden there was this dark thing flying over our heads.  Just as I said what the heck is that, my 10 year old son looked up and saw the same thing.  It was moving at a slow steady pace.  It was dark out so there was just enough light to make out the outline of this object.  I say object but really it looked more like some kind of creature, not an inanimate craft.  As far as size goes, being dark it was hard to judge the distance in height, but it appeared to definitely be above the tree line but lower than an airplane that is usually way up there.  It was probably about 20-30 feet in length and 15 feet wide. Around the time of the sighting, an airplane did go by on the other side of my house, it was flying kind of low as it was coming in to land.  It had all it&rsquo;s lights on and I would say this thing was probably as high as that plane.  It was dark in color, kind of an ashy blackish brown color.   From my point of view, (directly under it) it didn&rsquo;t appear to have wings, and was sort of lumpy around the edges, kind of like a blob.  It&rsquo;s belly looked to be very smooth and flat, sort of like the belly of a stingray.  It had no lights, no sound, it was totally silent and was gliding very smoothly through the sky.  It had what I would describe as a tail although it just looked a little more narrow than the body of it. We were able to watch it for about 3 -5 minutes before it was out of our view.  I know this was not a bird, not a balloon, it was not a hawk or an eagle, or a flock of geese.  It reminded me much of a creature  from the ocean, such as a whale.    I don&rsquo;t have any photos of it, when I saw it I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off of it.  I was stunned and very curious.  I have drawn a picture to the best of my artistic ability (which isn&rsquo;t saying much) but you will be able to get! the ide a.   I have been looking now for it to come back and if it does I will get an actual picture of it.  Thank you.

The craft was at a very high altitude and no noise was heard. We were both laying on the ground on our backs in the snow.  I saw the object and did not say anything.  As the object moved off my friend than said to me &quot;Did you see that?&quot;  I said ya what was it. We both didn&apos;t know but concluded it was moving too fast to be an aircraft.  We were both aircraft entusiasts built alot of model airplanes and lived near the Wilkes Barre Scranton airport so we felt we had enough knowledge to make that conclusion. The craft moved extremely fast, not totally unblievable speed but alot faster than any jet.As I grow older I think back on that night and with the increased knowledge I feel the object may have been the SR-71.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As we were walking, we passed an older couple and the man was pointing up and saying to his wife, &quot;There!  Did you see it that time?&quot;  Not wanting to appear rude, we continued our walk, but did glance upwards as we passed and saw nothing. About 15 - 20 minutes later, as we walked back to our hotel, the same couple was still looking into the sky.  At this point, I had to ask what they were looking at.  The man told me to look at a particular grouping of stars in the sky.  It was a perfectly clear night, and there were many stars out.  My friend saw it first, then his wife, then I did.  My wife never got the visual.  Here is what we saw:  About every 5 - 10 minutes, way up in the sky, it appeared as though one of the stars would shoot accross to another star and stop.  After another couple of minutes, it would shoot to another star and stop.  It kept doing this in the same triangular pattern between the same 3 stars.

There may have been but I don&apos;t recall. The craft was no more than 100 yards in front of me, a dull almost invisible black. I could see a bulge in the center of the craft kind of like a cockpit area. It was angled towards me so I never got to see the bottom. I ran into the house to get a pair of binoculars. It was still there when I came back out. I had the distinct feeling of being watched. I held the binoculars just below my face to get a fix on the location but the instant I put the binoculars to my eyes the craft had disappeared.

The peak is named Verdi Peak and it is 10,900ft. msl. What I thought were 3 white birds was the suns reflection off this UFO that was headed straight at us!  It came over Verdi peak and stopped and hovered approximately 150 ft. above an 200 ft. west of our position. The craft had a mirror finish, no seams or rivets, no windows, no front or rear.  It made no engine or any other noise. The most amazing thing to us, was that the craft never changed its attitude in any way, aways remaining ridged in space like a gyro does. The craft was shaped like an cartoon cigar, like a foot ball.  It was so close, we all agreed that it was approximately 70ft. long and 40ft in diameter.  We all had the intense feeling that we were being &quot;check out&quot;!  IT scared the daylights out us. Then things got even stranger, from a hover, the craft rose straight up until it had gained about 3000ft. of altitude from where it had been hovering, enough altitude to clear the mountain ridge and it flew north with a sudden burst of speed, the likes of which I have never seen, before or after the sighting. We could see the Jarbridge Mts, about 100 miles north, into Idaho from our vantage point on the mountain ridge.  We watched this craft go from right above us, to a little speck that disappeared over Idaho in about one and a half seconds!

Only one of us had a wrist watch, and he had left it in the car. When he announced what the time was, we all were just dumbfounded!

I do recall the event very clearly, but it is something that my family and I have never spoken of. Well, a couple of years ago I did ask my mother some things about that night, but she has no memory of it. There is really not a lot to tell about the actual sighting but I will do my best to explain my encounter. I will also mention facts I do remember to help substantiate my gaps in memory.It was about 6:30 pm when my family and I were going into Quincy,Il. We were coming from Fowler, N.E. of Quincy.We drove west down U.S. 24 to Neikamps corner where we turned South. We traveled south to Ellington Road where we turned and headed west again. We traveled about 200 feet west when the encounter began.We were going into Quincy to go to church, we were going to a revival meeting. This being said, helps me to establish the time and approximate date. The revival meetings  started at 7:00pm and the location of the encounter is about a 15 minute drive to the church. We were always early to the meetings as my dad was an usher and had duties before services would begin. This also helps me get a rough idea  of the year. I actively attended church with my family from about 1968 to 1972. I want to say the encounter was in 1970 but I can&apos;t jog my memory enough to state that as a fact.I do know we were riding in a  white 1964 Chevy station wagon. Since my father has died no one remembers when we owned that car.We were heading west, just in front of the WGEM radio towers.  I was setting behind the driver looking south out the window.  The sky began to become very bright.  It was very dark out at 6:30 in the evening so it must have been late fall.  As the sky brightened I became very afraid, I thought it was the end of the world.  I remember looking to the sky to see something but there was nothing to see.  I then turned and looked north towards the radio tower and saw the brightest blue white light I have ever seen in my life.The next thing I can remember we were headed south on Columbus road, just coming up to the KHQA radio tower.No one said a word about anything, we just kept going towards Quincy.  We arrived at 16th and Locust in Quincy, without ever talking about the light.  Everything looked normal at church when we arrived.  I could see the people shaking hands and greeting each other as they always do.  We got out of the car and went in and began to socialise as usual when we found out we were late.The services were over and everyone was going home. This would make the time be around 9:30 or 10:00, services always lasted that long, or even later.We talked for a bit and then returned home. We missed the whole church service, went back home and never said one word to one another about it.I have often wondered over the past 38 years or so what happened. Roughly 3 hours of time are gone and not one of us has said anything about it. I have mentioned it to friends and family a few times, but I have never offered an explanation. I have no idea what happened in the 3 hours but I do know I takes less than 5 minutes to drive from the WGEM towers to the KHQA tower.

I then saw a third object moving from South of the Space Shuttle and ISS in a northerly direction, it crossed paths very close to the Space Shuttle and ISS. After passing the Space Shuttle and ISS it made a very large arcing turn to an East heading. This object was not as bright as the Space Shuttle and ISS and looked very much like any other man made satellite except that it changed directions; Basically it moved from a North heading and changed directions to an East heading after passing the S.S. and ISS. This was also witnessed by a friend 5 miles away.", "ufo sighting in northern california three of them 1055 am 2-9-08was talking on phone when wife screamed &quot;look up in the sky&quot; I did and saw 3 disc shaped objects in sky floating about a half mile from the ground about 900 ft away , no noise no birds in sight the one in the middle turned dark black as if it stopped reflecting the sunlight and moved in a vertical motion straight up into the air then returned to its original placement in the formation then  it began to reflect the sun light again. then I took a piece of mirror and tried to signal the object which then the three of them mached my signal then took off at a rate of speed unknowen to me. they diapeared. then returned in their original spots from which I first noticed them. then our local airport allowed Three planes to take off and the ships moved away keeping the same amount of distance from the planes until they were no longer in sight.", "My family were visiting disney world Christmas of 1987.  Because the family was from Winnipeg Manitoba Canada, we were staying in Tampa Bay Florida for half the duration of our trip (2 weeks)to Florida.  The other week was to be spent at bush gardens at a different hotel.  The hotel we were staying at was called the The Sonyesta.  On or around the night of 19 Dec 1987 we decided to visit a restaurant called King Henry&apos;s Feast in Miami.  We left the hotel in Tampa at around 16:00 on the 19th and drove to Miami.  The King Henry&apos;s Feast was a Medieval style dinner and show and the whole affair lasted many hours so by the time we left Miami to go back to our hotel in Tampa bay it was quite late, around 0:00.At around 1:00 am we were on a deserted stretch of highway near - as far as I can remember- swampy country with scattered palm trees.  Because it was somewhat dark I can only remember seeing flat ground with telltale plantlife that indicated swamp such as sparsh high grass, rushes and bumpy, in some places, reflective ground indicating stagnant water in addition to the dark outlines of palm trees.  I remember that the moon was full when we left Miami but at 1:00 on the highway it became foggy.My memory becomes hazy at this point, but I recall other cars stopped by the road and people looking at something in the sky.  I recall the other passengers in the car gasp and say &quot;oh look!&quot;.  I recall seeing three other people besides the passengers in our car.  The other peoples cars seemed to have headlights on.The passengers of our car consisted of 4 people.  Firstly myself age 7.  I was at that age an avid camper with my parents and that is how I knew what swamp looked like.  I am now 28 and a Captain in the PPCLI, a Canadian Infantry unit and I have seen action in Afghanistan.  My father is a doctor who practiced at the St James Clinic and Misecordia hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada.  My Mother was or was studying at the time, to take her bar exam.  She has been called to the bar in Winnipeg and British Columbia Canada.  She no longer practices law but is a stay at home Mom for my younger siblings who were not yet born at the time.  The final passenger was my Dad&apos;s mother and my grandma who is now deceased but at the time worked at a clothing store for senior citizens in Winnipeg.My Father and Mother were in the front 2 seats of the car and my Grandmother and me in the back.  As we approached what I remember to be one or two cars pulled over at the side of the road with people beside them I perceived 6 light blue glowing lights rotating in the sky.  Each was the size of a quarter in my memory, but only because they were some distance away.  I seem to recall we got out of the car at this point to look at the lights but I have another memory of staying in the car the whole time.  The lights did nothing but rotate, in my memory at an angle and down towards our car.  The whole scene-like a picture- was us, bottom right ground, road bottom middle, other people and cars bottom left.  Mid right was shadow of palm trees, mid center was fog but flat bumpy ground, mid right was fog, top right fog, top center fog with some traces of moonlight seeping through and top right were the six blue lights rotating at an angle facing us.I do not recall how long we lingered watching the lights but at some point during this time I recall glancing out of curiosity at the other people near our car and to our left to see if they were as amazed as us.  I recall a man with shaved head and glasses in a white shirt looking calmly back at me with an amused expression.  I have conlicting memories of this man; one memory that he was in another car and I saw him through a window and another memory that he was outside the cars to my left at about 9 feet away.At this point I draw a blank and do not recall if the lights disappeared or we just got bored and decided to leave.  We got back to Tampa Bay and had no other encounters since.  After returning to Canada at the end of the vacation we did not discuss at all afterwards memories of the vacation.  Anytime I brought up the issue of the lights my mother scolded me, dismissed the event or made fun of me so I soon let the matter drop.Upon remembering this event last year in September 2007, I questioned my father and mother at a restaurant and it took them by surprise.  I said simpley &quot;do you remember the 6 blue rotating lights in Florida?&quot;  My father remarked off hand (and without any prompting from me) that there were lots of people watchig the event.  My mother then remarked that she had no memory of other people there.  We were all 3 of us discussing the event further in the car and my mother became very agitated and angry while my father seemed very curious and trying to remember more, or so it seemed to me.  My Mother did give me a detail I had not remembered-my Grandmother had decided to purchase communion which was a book about alien abduction.  My Mother told me all this nonsense about UFOs was due to my Grandmother scaring me.  I do not recall ever discussing the event with my Grandmother at all.Please let me know if anyone has had a similar experience.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Large bright white objects falling from sky with a tail of fire, then hovering and moving laterally over LA county California 1/26/08Approx. 6pm apparently over LA county, two or more bright light object dropping from the sky with a tale of fire such as a comet fell and then stopped and moved in a horizontal movement to the north and various other unusual horizontal directions including hovering.

These objects were bright white light.", "UFO or flares?I was watching TV when my son came home and told me to &quot;check out these lights&quot;.  We went out on to the deck and looked out over the trees.  (From the second floor it was, at arms length, the size of a quarter or a little bigger)  At first there was nothing.  Suddenly the sky lit up in bright colors.  They stayed on for about 5 seconds then went off.  I ran inside to get the camera.  I was able to get two shots.  While waiting to see if anything more would happen, two jets went flying by.  Coincidence? My husband, who did not come out to see, tried to explain it away.  Flares from military maneuvers.  Over residential areas?  Doesn&apos;t make sense.  We live about 5 miles south of Ft. Indiantown Gap about one mile off of I81.  There are jets and helicopters that frequently fly overhead but they can be heard.  This made no sound and was stationary in the sky.I went inside to put the pictures on the computer to get a better look.  My daughter had just arrived home with a story of seeing a UFO while driving on I81.  She said it was round with lights all around the outside of it.  A light coming from the top.  She looked away for a moment and it was gone.On Tuesday, 2/12/08 the local paper published this article: The Patriot News Air Guard flares, not UFOs, lit sky http://www.pennlive.com/patriotnews/stories/index.ssf?/base/news/1202784007315510.xml&amp;coll=1  I am not buying it.

He saw a group of lights and pointed them out to me.  They were moving slowly and low in the sky.  There were two groups of four bright white lights, in a straight line, one larger group above the other smaller group, similar to the shape of the ship on Star Trek.  The entire group slowly turned to the right, then split into two separate groups, each a group of four bright white lights with a red light underneath.  The two groups slowly passed over us and continued on toward the southeast until out of sight.  There was no noise at all, completely silent.  I am sure that it was not airplanes or a blimp.  I tried to take photographs, but wasn&apos;t sure if I was getting anything because it was so dark.  When we looked at our pictures later, I was shocked to find not only the two groups I was focusing on, but three more groups of different colors in the photo as well.  In the photo they appear zig-zagging, but they did not look like this by plain eyesight.  Witness 2 (19 y/o male):  It was around 9:00 pm, and my girlfriend and I were on the way to my house from the high school baseball game.  We were driving down the road and I noticed some strange lights in the sky.  I told her to look and she was surprised too.  There were four white lights and a red light.  The four white lights blinked in a rolling sequence and the red light did not blink at all.  I am sure they could not have been  planes because they were too close together and were moving very slowly and I could not hear anything.  They were low enough that I should have been able to hear something.  As they moved along, it seems that the red light was moving ahead of the white lights.  I have never seen anything like this. Witness 3 (40 y/o female):  I did not witness the event first hand.  My daughter called me at approximately 9:15 pm and was very excited.  She said that her and her boyfriend were heading to his house and saw strange lights in the sky.  They had stopped and were trying to get pictures.  She was very nervous and excited and was talking to me as they passed overhead.  She said they were low down and completely silent.  I could not hear anything over the phone.  She said they had been in a large configuration, that they looked like the ship on Star Trek, then broke apart and became two separate groups, but kept moving together.  I was trying to tell her to get photographs, and she was trying, but didn&apos;t think they would turn out.  She said she couldn&apos;t see anything solid, but the lights appeared to be moving as one object.  We were on the phone for several minutes, and they were moving on toward the southeast.  We were surprised to see the photos, and the appearance of other groups of lights they hadn&apos;t noticed. They were both very excited and certain that these were not planes. These kids are mature and not easily excitable.  We live in an area near an airforce base and major airport, and we are accustomed to seeing planes of all kinds, day and night.", "bright ball seen in the northern sky traveling south from Nuevo Leon MexicoWhile on vacation at a friends ranch in Nuevo Leon Mexico, myself and two others witnessed what appeared tobe a UFO traveling south for a period of two three minutes then dispeared in what looked like it left the atmosphere.It could have a space shuttle but I do not think we had one in space on this date.

I looked up as I was running and saw 3 lights moving in a consistent formation.  They seemed too low to be an airplane and too high to be a toy.  As they moved along they began to weave and zoom among each other.  There was no pattern to how they were moving.  They were moving short distances really fast.  After a few seconds of this movement they shot off out of sight.  This is the only sighting I have had.  I am not a sci-fi freak.  I am a reliable college grad.

I was looking up at the stars because it was a very clear night and to the east is the Oakland Airport, so there are always lots of planes to see. All of a sudden to the northeast, I saw bright lights, which seemed to appear from nowhere and made the few plans in the sky look like distant stars. As they got closer, which took only 20 seconds or so, It looked like it could possibly be round, there were three rows of horizontal lights, maybe ten across on each row, each light five times bigger than the brightest star. They were not flashing, but at one point it seemed to turn, so the lights appeared to rotate slightly and the shape of the object changed into a wide V shape,I called out to my husband but by the time he got outside it had disappeared behind a building and I didn&rsquo;t see it again.In all it lasted about a minute.I was looking east,it apeared from the northeast and it traveled south. I have never personally seen a UFO, my husband has, and I&rsquo;ve always laughed at his description and told him it was just a plane, or possibly a star.

I knew it was not a plane because planes can not travel at such high speeds and make such a quick right turn. i did have my camera right next to me but did not have time to grab it and take any evidence. I apologize for that, so this could be another of many cases that do not matter, but i am just saying what i saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  Possible hoax.  PD))", "Object seems to be in Orbit twinkling, but through binoculars many very bright  lights in patterns.The craft at first appeared to be an unusually bright and twinkling star. Which caught my eye shortly after returning from work and bringing in some firewood. So I watched it for a good min or so. Before deciding it was not any celestial body I was familiar with and seemed too deliberate in it&apos;s &quot;twinkle&quot;. The object was obviously high above the earth and did not appear to be  moving from it&apos;s general position. Which was not far above the tree line and to the SE of my position when first noticed it.I went and grabbed my astronomical binoculars and returned with it not having appeared to move. I focused on the craft and clearly made out intense bright lights which varied in pattern and color. The colors appeared to be red, green and white. The white light seemed particularly intense. There was a variation in speed of color change and pattern change. As well as varied patterns. Though hard to be certain it did appear to be a circle perhaps a sphere? But due to some of the patterns and the manner they appeared it seemed a circle. Honestly hard to be sure of a dark shape against a dark sky.The lights however were very visible and easy to make out as well as certain patterns. For example a circle of light alone made up of lights appearing to be on the edge of the craft. As well as patterns appearing on what appeared to be the bottom and a mixture of the two. It did seem to move but not in a rotational &quot;flying&quot; manner. It seemed to only move across the sky very slow as though stationary. As it was first noticed from the front walk and was followed over the hours to the side and back.There was another witness whom I called out to confirm what I was seeing and followed it off and on for the duration as well. They too used astronomical binoculars and actually were kind of startled. They could make out the lights and the changing of patterns and intensity as well. Though never under the impression that it was the ISS as I have observed it. We confirmed the ISS was not in the area. Further when it is it does not exactly linger. Likewise with satellites which it could not be for several reasons. Nor was it any type of airplane or helicopter. First it was far too high and second I live near an airport. I know what a plane and a chopper in the sky look like. Not to mention both actually went by as well in the course of the night and the difference was glaring to say the least.The sighting actually continues as I write this. This is now 1-30-08. It appeared in the same place and followed the same path tonight. I would imagine it could have been there last night too. It was overcast so I don&apos;t know.", "Gentleman phones air traffic control tower to inquire as to what he saw.First, I need to stress the following:  I AM NOT THE WITNESS OF THIS EVENT.  I am an air traffic controller relaying vague information collected by a caller who contacted me during my shift. The caller reported seeing a &quot;balloon&quot; shaped object passing directly over the runway at the airport where I work.  The caller estimated the object to be at 2,000 ft., flying from north to south.  Given what was told, I attempted to locate the object in the sky to the south.  I was unable to do so.  I saw nothing. I contacted another air traffic facility; one equipped with radar.  I explained to them what had been reported and asked them if they saw anything to the south of the airport that might account for this.  The replied in the negative.  Additionally, a pilot who landed approximately 10-15 minutes after the call reported seeing nothing abnormal while flying to the airport.", "UFO fleet?  Hundreds of sparkling lightsMy husband and I were on our way to the gym at 5:25 in the morning.  A flash of light in the eastern sky caught my eye.  When I looked up there were what looked like hundreds of flashing lights, almost twinkling, white and yellow. We stood in the gym parking lot and watched it for about 10 minutes as they continued moving east and faded away.  It looked like hundreds of lights, flashing on and off.  Like a swarm.  I don&apos;t know if it was all lights coming on and off on one giant vehicle or hundreds of seperate vehicles traveling together. It was east of us and over the cape.  There is an Air Force base there, but there jets are currently not flying.  This is definitely not jets.  We don&apos;t know what we saw, but it was huge.

We were on the U.S. 60.   My wife was driving and I looked out in front of me at what I thought was a funny smoke shape about 30 miles plus away.  It had a ribbon like shape and was vertical  thus my thought it was smoke.  However it was in the middle of the horizon and maintained its shape for the entire duration of this experience.  I continued to watch this trying to figure out what it could be.  It seemed to appear and disappear over and over with a waving like motion.  I then saw these round like puffs that looked like something bursting in the air like when you see movies of flack but the &quot;smoke&quot; was white in color.  What really seemed strange was that this explosion then seemed to reverse in outward movement to inward and more condensed.  It was then that about 10 Miles away I saw something that looked at first like a hot air balloon going through fog.  It was at that moment that I thought, &quot;Wow&quot; there is fog really low going horizontal to the freeway.  Then it appeared again even closer and it the object came into view and looked more like the front end of a blimp, however it was huge.  I thought, wow that fog is alot closer to the ground than I thought and the blimp looked as if it was within 30 feet to the right of us.  It was then that I saw that my eyes seemed to adjust and realize that what I was thinking was a low fog was a very high cloud and around along ways away.  I yelled out loud, &quot;WHAT IS THAT?  I realized that whatever it was, it was the largest object I had ever seen.  I told my wife to look but she was driving and could not see what I was looking at.  It was at that time that we passed the 202 ramp and the 60 dipped.  I watched the object all the way until the wall next to the freeway covered my view.  My wife kept saying, &quot;should I pull over?&quot;   I didn&apos;t know what to do.  I kept waiting and looking to where I thought it would emerge from the end of the cloud into open blue sky.  It had been! clear a ll day and we where out at our with our friends and so clouds were the last thing I expected.  I did not regain view of the clouds where the object was seen and I told my wife to exit the freeway.  She exited the freeway at power road as I looked into the sky looking back and forth scanning the whole area for a low flying hot air balloon a blimp or something else as the path seemed to be heading toward the opening sky.  We drove north on power until Broadway and never again saw this object.  It was then that I saw  a jet flying in the opposite direction as the object I saw and the jet was still pretty high flying the normal pattern toward PHX Sky Harbor airport.  I gasped when I realized the magnitude of what I had seen.  The object dwarfed the plane like a plane against an upside down mountain.  I continued to reflect back on what I had seen and can only say that it was only the front end blimp shaped in front and the smoke like ribbon was the same object passing through the clouds giving the solid object the smoky like appearance.  It was not a cloud behind another cloud. It was a definite Oval object and I would estimate it from just the nose and from how far away the clouds where that it was bigger than the size of the city of Phoenix. I don&apos;t know what it was, or what it belonged to. I know that I saw something and I know that it was a solid object.  I have never seen anything that big except for a mountain.  It was not a mountain.  The object I saw was skimming through the clouds and because of its huge size it through my perception of the actual distance of the clouds way off.  The planes that flew in toward Sky Harbor were still very high above the ground and the clouds where still higher in the air then they were.  No low flying  clouds.  These clouds where pretty high.", "Orange glowing object seen over Riverside County, releasing small glowing red objectsI saw a small &quot;craft&quot; with an orange glow, moving slowly (maybe 100 to 200 MPH) through the sky last night.  It was heading from west to the north-east, moving fairly slow and about at a height of maybe 40,000 FT.  I noticed it right away, in that it didn&apos;t have the same glow of a commercial or private plane.  Not to mention, the entire object was luminescent/glowing (it wasn&apos;t the headlight of an airplane, but just as bright).  Anyhow, as it began to head north, I started noticing small red glowing objects were being released from the craft.  These small objects would propel themselves and an incredible high rate, straight down, or in a 90 degree angle and then just disappear.  These red glowing objects were being released, every 5 seconds or so.  After 3 of these glowing-red objects were released, the craft then released 3 more objects, all at once, then begin to accelerate and incredible rate of speed.  As it was accelerating, it begin to lose it&apos;s orange glow and literally began to disappear! Before it disappeared, it seem to accelerate to over a 2 thousand miles an hour (from 200 MPH to 2000 MPH with in 2 or 3 seconds).  I watched this object for approximately 5 minutes (from start to finish).", "Flaming sphereical object hovering and disappearing as jets neared its postion like a cat and mouse game.Tonight once again a UFO was hovering and disappearing to the north of this rig. This time it was further away. But here&apos;s the good part, 2 jets were swarming this thing and right as they got kind of close it would disappear. Once the jets flew by were it was it would come up a little ways away from were it blacked out. These jets when it would light back up (UFO) they would turn in a bank and come back and just watching these jets was wild the way they were &quot;chasing&quot; the UFO. Those things can move fast. But once again the night time crew saw all of this also and with my co-worker &amp; I and the crew that makes 7 witnesses. At what I would call the end of this sighting it looked like something fell right where it was located. It looked like a meteor but as it neared the ground in about a 45 degree drop it seemed like it righted itself and paralleled the ground then disappeared again.", "Bright light seen over the city of Chicago.My boyfriend and I live just south of downtown Chicago, about a block east of the lake. Last night I was sitting out on our fire escape between 6 and 6:30 PM. I looked out to the north and in the distance saw a bright white light resembling a giant star moving straight up into the sky. After watching in for a few seconds I called my boyfriend out to show him what I was seeing. Being a skeptic he was more amazed than I was about the light in the sky. We also saw commercial airplanes around the craft and they looked tiny in comparison, as did the stars visible in the sky. It was moving relatively quickly and now moving towards us. As it got closer it appeared possible that there were two curved wings coming off of the flying craft. We watched it until it disappeared behind our 11-story apartment building. There was no sound we could hear coming from it.", "I spotted a white light with a wavy tail that vanished midsight as I was watching it.Object seen between 10:45-11:10 PM  on New Year&apos;s Eve 2007(12/31/07) In the C- Section of Palm Coast Flagler County Florida USA. (This information included in the main body for further clarification.)  Object glowing seen out of the corner of my eye as I looked behind me to make sure there was no one stalking me. (I had heard there were drunkards out that night.) I then turned around and looked directly at it. I lasted over five seconds after that . it was roughly half to three-quarters the size of the full moon in size and glowed white and had a wavy tail almost like a shooting star except it was fluid and almost like it were made of a fluid light. The object dimmed and then vanished after traveling across the sky and was facing diagonally downward-right from my perspective. There was no obstruction in the way that could have blocked it to make it vanish a the point in the sky it did. May not be an aircraft at all...may be paranormal in nature though this is not provable. It made no sound as it was moving through the sky but was most certainly low altitude due to it&apos;s relative size and clarity in comparison to an airplane that was passing at the time. It was not low enough to make a glow on the landscape below it. No sound of a crash was heard and from it&apos;s general size if it had crashed into the ground something should have been heard. It did not look like any form of aircraft or living thing that exists to my knowledge.It was not really a fireball so much as it was a hito-dama shaped light. I was not tired, emotional, under any  great  amount of stress and have never had any form of drug or any sort of hallucination. When I saw it I got excited because I had just seen something really strange. I was surprised but not at all fearful. To my knowledge no one else witnessed this object.", "5 bright flashing  lights hovering horizontally in Charlotte NC sky at nightMy husband, 7 year old son and I  were driving on I 77 Northbound towards I 85  around 7 pm (dark) and saw a bright light  in the dark sky, slightly larger than a close by helicopter would be. It was stationary so we thought it WAS a  police helicopter. Then it dawned on us that our police dept most likely doesn&rsquo;t  own that many helicopters! They had flashing lights but were not flashing lights on the ground like police helicopters do when they are looking for someone etc. They just hovered ther and were very bright.As we merged onto I85 we saw 2 then 3, then 4 more similar objects/lights in the distance all what appeared to be exactly the same distance away from one another. We live in the city, at the end of a street  near a hospital ,with helicopters landing and taking off many times of the day and night, so we know what they look and sound like day and night.  We are also very familiar with the airports traffic patterns and what several airplanes coming in towards the airport on the horizon look like.  This was not like that. These objects hovered like helicopters had flashing lights of red gold and white all at the same altitude over the distance of about 10 miles altogether.As we drove down the road, (about 8-10 miles or so, we saw all of the lights remain where they were, but began to notice in between them were VERY small objects (tiny red lights) that travelled at very high speeds  between the brighter larger main objects. We stopped the car and witnessed several of these small objects travelling very fast in different directions.

Using the binoculars it was clearer and we could see there were 3 in a triangle shape. Observing the closest one noted that within the circle were electric currents which also changed colours.  A very strange event,  I have never seen anything like it in my life.  After a while noticed a 4th one in the distance.

I was about 8-9 years old playing football in my street with my brother and a friend that lived 2 houses over. I looked up into the northeast sky and noticed a small/medium craft hovering.  It looked to have 4 thruster looking devices on the underside of it.  If I could compare the underside of it to something, it looked like an one of those simon says electronic games.  Each of the 4 thrusters had a flap dangling from the outside rim of the undercarriage. As the craft would ascend, the flaps would uncover the thruster simultaneously.  If it would descend, the flaps would cover them up. The top side of the craft (not very visible to me) looked to be a half sphere. The craft&apos;s body was a black/dark purple shade.This took place in East Mesa, very close to the Apache Junction/Mesa boarder. Just south of the US60.

I was, and still try to be a skeptic.  I study science and specialize in mental health. However, while driving along Interstate-5 near Seattle, I saw something I could not explain very well but will do my best now. It was a craft in the sky that appeared on a side view at first, as a black slit, not moving, then panned towards me revealing its disk shape and the top of the craft.  From this view it was shiny and light in color, but opaque like glow-in- the-dark material that is not glowing.  It then veered to the left and flew back up vertically, seeming to be sucked into the clouds.  After this, a small monoplane flew by in the area traveling east. Then a commercial jet flew nearby traveling northwest.  This gave me scale and relative perspective to the craft. When the craft disappeared, it was as if it was fleeing from sight of the two planes that would soon come into view. I then looked to the car next to me and noticed a man in a BMW also looking up at the area in the sky talking on a cell phone.

As I drove toward the area, I reached a clearing in the sky so a good part of the sky was not occluded with trees etc. This was about 2 or 3 minutes after seeing the light. When I looked up, there was definitely a circle of lights. My mind was thinking &ldquo;falling star&rdquo; so I thought they were helicopters that were around where it fell, but as I watched them, they were all in a perfect circle, all completely still and there were at least 6 or 7 lights.   The circle was covering a huge area in the sky.  We continued to drive in the same direction, but we weren&rsquo;t getting any closer to the area or the circle of lights, so we went home.I called the local news station to see if anyone else had reported something, or if an aircraft had gone down.

It was a sphere shape and would have been about as big as one of those lamps on top of a tower.  As it got closer it was obvious that it was some kind of air craft, not a meteorite or any sort of space debris just by the shear fact that it was moving so slow.

The light didn&apos;t vary in intensity nor color, it was a pinpoint to my naked eye but very bright, it was pure white and brighter than any star or even Jupiter.  I am located in Cuenca, Ecuador which is in the southern third of the country about 7 degrees south of the Equator in the Andes.  The sky was 3/4 cloudy but with breaks sufficient to track the light visually as it was well above the cloud ceiling.  I first noticed it while standing in my back yard simply looking up at the stars through the cloud breaks. The air was clear however.  I first saw the light about 30 degrees off the Southern horizon and was able to track it intermittently through cloud breaks until about dead overhead, 90 degrees off the Western horizon. The sun had set about an hour before so it was not sun reflecting off a plane and it was going faster than any plane again with no sound at all.  It travelled at a steady speed. It was not a satellite as satellites go much slower than the light I just saw.  The light I saw went about 2.5 to 3 times faster than a satellite. I am an ameteur astronomer and know satellite an standard 100 mile low orbit speeds very well ever since the Russians first sent up Sputnik. I have never seen a satellite even close to the brightness of the object this evening. I have never seen aircraft lights resembling this light. I&apos;m age 61 and have lived in major airport cities all my life and I have excellent vision (corrected with slight prescription glasses).  I didn&apos;t have time to rush in and grab my binoculars it was proceeding so fast so I simply observed it.  It took about 60 seconds estimated time to pass from 30 degrees off the Southern horizon to where I lost it due to solid clouds about 90 degrees perpendicular and slightly to the East of where I was standing. There was no wind nor interfering noise to blot out any noise form the light source.  Cuenca has an airport but I know the standard approach and exit flight paths and since there was no wind there would be no reason for planes to deviate from the standard flight approaches and exits. I have no idea what the light source was but it was steady, silent, white, very bright, travelling straight and fast (over the clouds).

The speed at which they operated seemed extremely slow by comparison to &quot;normal&quot; aircraft that I am familiar with, being an airline pilot. And there was complete silence.

I was only 15 or 16 and heard some strange noise in the tree near me so turn and run back to the house.  When I got back to the house about 400-500 yard.  I turn and they were gone.  I never told to many people because I was by myself and most people do not believe in UFO&apos;s.  I thought it might be the ARMY testing something because FORT DRUM is about forty mile from my old home stead.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We pulled over because it seemed odd to us that there would be commercial airliners flying low and in a flight pattern. The presumed aircraft were directly in front of us as we were looking East at mile marker 362 on HWY 70. I had turned off my lights so we could get a better view. As we were watching the flashing lights, again presumed aircraft, and discussing whether they were military aircraft and were they practicing flying, just slightly to the North-east and out of nowhere we visualized six bright lights, not quite orange and not quite white in color, appear tilted and low to the ground. Four of lights remained almost steady for a couple of seconds then in succession, two more lights came on which allowed us to see the spherical shape and a 30 degree angle on the craft (above the lights). They disappeared one after the other, again giving us a visual of a sphere. Immediately I asked my brother if he just saw the same thing and he replied yes. It was so close (compared to the flashing lights we were originally attracted to) that the hair all over my body stood straight up and my heart starting pounding. I was fumbling for my cell camera and continue looking in the direction we saw the lights, when I saw four of the lights again a little higher, a little more north and in succession&hellip;ie first light flowed to the second, again giving off a perception that the craft was spherical. I was unable to capture a picture in time. So, as I was again fumbling (shaking) with my camera phone when we both saw the lights directly north of us and further away, this time there were 5 lights that followed in succession. Unable to capture an image as it was too far for a camera phone. Immediately after we saw the 3rd sighting, we noticed the flashing lights come out of formation and zigzag in front of us, still what appeared to be higher than the spherical craft. After about a minute of this, we saw the four flashing light craft take off quickly towards the south and seconds later heard the deafening roar of what sounded like jets. We waited for another 5 minutes to see if anything else would reappear, however, nothing else showed. During the few minutes we saw the 3 sightings, we were the only ones on that section of highway, however, shortly after the jets left there were 3 other cars that passed us (on e going east, the other two west). I have never seen anything that seemed so odd. Also, we had the windows down after the 1st sighting, but never heard any noise until after we saw the 4 craft leave. I am a higher education graduate with a prominent career in the healthcare field. My brother works in customer service. We were on our way to visit family and have been on this stretch of road numerous times over several years.

PD))Possible Alien Voice?Hi, this happened about 2 months ago, a UFO-type phenomena seems like a logical explanation. This occurred in Cheney, WA on December 13th, give or take a day. I am a junior at EWU.Myself, my roommate and 2 friends were sitting in the living room, we were all watching one friend play a video game, but the volume was really low, almost mute, and we had my computer playing music at a moderate level.   I am sitting closest to my room, and all of the sudden I start to hear this weird sound.  It starts from nothing, and it sounds like a giant loud machine, like reactor is the best way to describe it, and it came in sound waves and each wave got louder and louder, like  pulsating vibrating waves, and the whole time I could not tell if this was in my mind until I looked at my friends.All of my friends jaws were dropped,  they could hear it to.  At the point of almost deafening, it then made just like a quick split second space type sound.Then a voice asked in perfect English &ldquo;WHERE AM I?&rdquo; and clicked out with the same split second space sound and it was done, all of my friends agree that the voice was not in any way, shape, or form a human voice, I definitely agree.  The best way to describe it is like a creepy, confused little creature, but in a way sounded harmless.   We all agree that it happened in my room, which scares the hell out of me.I emailed a guy who I thought was an expert and he tried to tell me it was a ghost sighting or something, but I cannot stress enough of how much like a creature it was.  I just really want a logical explanation, it was a very scary event, probably only lasting 10 seconds tops, and I am sure you have heard some sightings and events in your day, and all of this happened, even though it sounds really crazy.Do you hear of this often? Or do you know what the hell happened to us?  Thank you very much.Another question I have is why my room, my apartment, we live on the 3rd floor of a college apartment complex.  Prior to the event, probably a month or two I had been looking up UFO stuff pretty tuff, so when it happened, and when I started thinking about why it happened in our apartment, that scared me.", "Bright light moved moderate speed stoped and went oppsite directionBright light went west then almost stoped and went east turned on its side a little bit it was kind of flat((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We had just finished setting up the Barbeque for a late dinner. We were in a suburb called Harris Park, Sydney. The night was beautiful with not a cloud in the sky. As I was cooking some sausages on the barbeque I noticed a very small but slow moving object directly above us. It was moving in the East direction. It appeared just as a light. I thought at the time that it would be a satelite as aeroplanes have both red and white lights blinking while flying. As it dissapeared in the East direction. I noticed another object moving at the same speed heading in the North direction. This object was moving at the slow same speed but was brighter. I told my friend to look up and check it out. As we were watching it, the object sped up and dissappeared. My friend didn&apos;t know what it was and neither did I at that moment. As we were speaking about the idea that it could be a spaceship or UFO, my friend just had is eyes pealed to the sky. As I was finished with the cooking, my friend noticed something brighter directly above the house. It was very bright of white light, like lightening light during a storm. As the object seemed to get lower and lower above his house we noticed that the light that was coming from this UFO was reflecting its light off the street and houses. The UFO made no sound, unlike helicopters or aeroplanes do. My friend grabbed his video comera and filmed as much as he could. I was amazed too. It would of been about 3-4hundred metres away and shining brightly over us. I thought it was an angel of light but my friend was convinced that it was a UFO. It moved very slowly and headed in a Northerly direction. It was brighter than a night of a full moon on a clear night. We watched the object move north slowly and watched it dissappear over the horizon. Since then my friend always carries his video camera at night and believes that we were visited by UFO&apos;s. I told him that even though they may seem like they come from another planet that they could come from Earth. To this very day, my friend and eye meet up regulary and watch the footage he filmed over a case of beer, wondering if something like that would ever happen again.((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

It is a clear blue sky day and the highway is next to the Atlantic Ocean.  The ocean was calm and less than 12in waves crashing the shore.  Out to sea, I could see three large freighters anchored off of Port Everglades, approx three miles off shore. Some small recreational boats numbering less than 5 were crossing the horizon heading north and south and out to sea to weed line for fishing. Out to the NE I would guess approxmently 7 to 10 miles I could see two very large standing tall white cylinders and two to three white cubes next to the cylinders.  It looked like tall buildings out in the ocean; I would say that they were 8 to 12 stories high and 4 stories wide. The 2 to 3 cubes were &frac12; the size.

They were flying in formation and obviously were not in whisper mode. They had no visible lights or typical lights on, I could only see them due to the light reflection. I thought this was strange since there are no bases nearby. I could hear them for about 5 minutes before they flew over the development. No other aircraft were visible in the vicinity at the time.", "Strange ball of white light  travelling over WacoDriving from San Antonio to Dallas one evening, I happened to look out of my passenger side window and noticed a ball of light travelling through the sky.

The &quot;dust&quot; looked like sparks flying off the ball of white light.The object was much closer to the earth&apos;s atmosphere than a comet would be and it was travelling at about the same speed as a commercial aircraft.

I saw a few satellites and a couple of meteors among the stars.  I then saw a dim red light above the trees some distance away.  The light was small, steady, a deep cardinal red, moving slowly in a horizontal fashion over the big lake.  The light quickly rose in altitude and began a &quot;ballet&quot; of arcing turns and curved trajectories, appearing to approach closer then retreat farther away.  The speed varied from almost static to a blur.  I noticed the light being reflected on the lakes surface at one point. The only sounds were those of frogs, toads, loons and birds. The light might have been a large object some distance away, or a smaller object relatively close to me...it was difficult to tell because it never flew below the tree line to provide a scale of size or proximity. The show lasted about three minutes.  I related my observation to a party of other campers a few days later who were exiting from the north.  They too stated that they had seen the unusual red light.

It so happens that there was another airplane in the sky at the time and this object flew by the airplane like it was standing still.

I asked someone to point them out to me; it took me about 30 seconds to notice them for myself. They appeared to be white.

A few people had cameras or cell phones with cameras and were trying to take pictures. I saw that one person has already posted their report and included 3 photos. They do look more rounded in the photos, so it was probably my eyesight that made them look more flattened somehow. A couple of people thought they were balloons, but I did not think so for 2 reasons. First, they did not drift together in the same direction like balloons would be if carried by the wind. They would change direction, go into and out of clouds, and move in opposite directions to one another and stop and hover, then move again. There were 3 or 4 initially, then only 2, then only 1.

I have had 5 UFO sightings to date. Now that Ive covered a little background, let me get right to the latest. Date: 10-20-2007  Location: N 38 : 12 : 11  Lat      (NAD83) W -81 : 23: 54  Lon  West Virginia (Crown Hill area)  Time: 8:20pm  I had to travel to Tazewell Virginia for business that day and my trip home was around 2 hours. After dark I checked the night sky on a regular basis, I usually do this since it increases the odds for seeing things, sounds simple, but a lot more people would be seeing these things if they could forget their problems for a moment and just look up. As I was traveling west on route 60 between two small towns, Hansford, and Crown Hill my attention was drawn to the brightest star in the sky, since it happened to be near my field of view when I glanced upward from the wheel to scan the sky for anything of interest. Having stared at the bright star for a second or two I dropped my gaze below the star and discerned that I could distinguish the mountain top from the sky since my eyes had adjusted to the night, and the fact that there is a strip mining operation located along the top of the same mountain providing some ambient lighting helping to clearly define the top of the mountain against the black star filled night. OK cue the Twilight Zone Theme, here&apos;s what happened at that point. For a completely unknown reason I glanced back at the highway, just to be safe, I had not seen another car for some time and after making sure I was still driving safely I looked back up, but I stopped short of actually looking at the bright star and instead became fixated on an area just below the star I had looked at previously. I remember thinking &quot;Why am I looking at en empty piece of sky?&quot; Before I could even formulate another thought a large orb of white light appeared, Ok, let me explain how this appeared, it started as a small pinpoint of light and grew to a large orb of white light, fast, but slow enough that I mentally registered the observation. I believe I stared at this for about 5 seconds before I witnessed another orb appear to the right of first orb, it arrived in the same manner as the first but appeared to be slightly smaller. I will try to explain this next part as clearly as I can. After the first two orbs appeared they were followed by around a dozen more, with each orbs appearance taking 1/2 the time as the last, accelerating in speed until all 12 had fully appeared in a loose straight line in the sky, I remember thinking wow, that looked like a computer controlled sequence of lights. At this point I decelerated down to about 25 mph, I know this area is not heavily traveled so I wasn&apos;t concerned since I was alone on the highway. At this point I was convinced that I was looking at a small fleet of luminous orb UFOs, I remember getting nervous and a bit frightened when I noticed that it looked like the orbs on the far right were moving. I thought I was going to witness ariel feats of a dozen UFOs hovering over the mountain. I quickly realized I was actually looking at a huge triangular configuration of around 16 large white orbs. At this point I swallowed hard and felt a lump in my throat, I did have the resolve enough to roll down the window and listen for sounds. You guessed it, no sound at all. At this point I went for the phone to get a picture, it politely refused to go into camera mode, seems the battery was too low, that&apos;s another weird story in itself. I then fixed my concentration back on this triangular formation of white orbs of light. It was heading straight for me, but it was also rotating on its axis without banking. It rotated until the point of the triangle was pointing north from its previous eastward orientation. At that point it began travelling north from its previous eastward course, all without banking, it remained plum while rotating to achieve a new azimuth heading. It was on course to pass over my view. Before I continue I want to stress that given the nature of the appearance of these orbs, as in how they appeared, one after another in a clearly timed and perfectly executed nature, I am left with only two conclusions given the data I witnessed myself, one is that this object for all purposes de-cloaked in a timed sequence before my eyes, or two, the object materialized from some other time/space/dimension. Needless to say both are quite humbling to see/contemplate. Lets get to the size of this object, I call it an object because once I could see underneath this thing, it was blocking out the stars, and the large orbs of light were clearly following the leading edge of this triangular object that occupied the space in between the orbs. The orbs were anomalous, hell, everything about this was anomalous, I felt like I was in overload mentally because nothing was correlating to any prior experience. I could not resolve a single thing about this that made sense, it was ominous and very disturbing to me.It was at approximately 700 - 800 feet in altitude and roughly 1/8 mile ahead of me and took up 3/4ths of the windshield in a 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee. It appeared to have a convex semi circle rear on it judging from the orbs of light in the back. Let me explain the high strangeness of these lights around the perimeter of this object. I looked intently for any signs of these being mounted to the side of a solid object, I could not see anything that indicated that these orbs of light were attached to the black mass that they clearly were following in perfection with, as a matter of fact I felt a cold chill of fear and amazement when I realized that the dark mass that was clearly blocking out stars as it passed overhead, was blatantly, absolutely refusing to reflect any light from the obvious orbs that were mere inches from it!  I noticed then that another white orb of light had appeared at dead center underneath the light absorbing black triangular mass. This new orb was blinking on and off, in a slow repeating cycle. I looked for a refection of light from the undercarriage of whatever this black triangular mass was, but to no avail, the Orb of light would appear and then disappear, I said it that way because it didn&apos;t power down and back up, it simply was there then gone then back again. I laughed out load at this point, I was just in awe at this, and let my analytical side take a break, I just tried to take it all in and experience it rather than trying to understand it, my logical mind sort of passed out from overload. At this point I actually physically jumped at what happened next. one instant there was a black star filled open sky in front of this huge triangular object, the next instant there is another black triangular object travelling at the same speed, in the same direction, and within approximately 100ft of the first object. I was utterly just numb at this point and reverted back to my logical mind as the trauma of a second triangle appearing like a David Copperfield finally sent everything else I had into shock. The second black triangular craft did not share the luxury of a light absorbing hull as its big brother continued to disturb me with. Rather this new entity gave me a couple of things I could relate to, one it reflected light, and two the lights appeared to be fixed to the object and quite visibly had a housing around them. Let me point out that the new object had all blue lights, and more interestingly enough they appeared to resemble LED lights in appearance. This new triangle looked like the classic Belgium triangle with the difference being it had blue lights, three of them positioned at each point of the triangle respectively. The other noticeable difference in comparison to the Belgium triangles was the fact that I could clearly see an elaborately geometrically designed housing covering these blue lights. I couldn&apos;t make out much detail from the blue light reflected from the undercarriage of the new triangle, but I was relieved a little in knowing it did reflect light, unlike the disturbingly huge triangle that defied physics in every detail of its existence, and somehow absorbed light, it was like a triangular black hole, very disturbing to witness. At this point I watched them both disappear over the mountain to my north from the view of the passenger side window. I drove a few more miles before I really snapped out of it. I told my wife and two children as well as two of their friends all about my encounter three times in even more excruciating detail than here. I couldn&apos;t sleep and in the end I worked a full day on two hours sleep, full days are usually 10 hours for me, but I was still energized from the night before. As a footnote, I work in a building that is directly in line with the Charleston airport, I watch C-131&apos;s fly over at a very low altitude, I am fully aware of the size of this aircraft at various altitudes and I estimate that it would take 16 of these flying at the same altitude in a tight V formation to roughly equal the size of the first triangle, they would also need to be fitted with large round lights mounted on extensions from the hull to simulate the orbs, so a mistaken aircraft this is not.", "Bright green light at 2amI worked as a manager at a popular fast food chain and after closing, I was getting a ride home with another employee. As we drove down the street late at night, we suddenly saw what appeared to be a bright green star. It grew in intensity, made the whole sky seem to glow slightly green, then split in two and shot off in different directions. We were both completely silent for about 15 seconds before he asked if I saw that. I confirmed that I did. It was very cold that night but at that point, it felt much colder.((NUFORC Note:  If object was visible for one minute, it probably was not a meteor.

PD))", "White Light Streaked Across Sky, Greyish Shape Appeared With It Just Above Tree LevelThis event took place around 20:53pm central standard time.  I was outdoors watching the lunar eclipse come to its climax.  After the moon was completely eclipsed, I took a few minutes to myself to think how beautiful a thing it really was.  I was taking pictures but failing in my attempts.  My digital camera kept stalling on me, shutting down and then restarting again.  It was a mere 9 degrees Fahrenheit outside and I had been outdoors for about 20 minutes.  I began to wonder if the cold was making the camera malfunction or if something more scientific as the eclipse was causing this mishap. I began to think to myself how I should start heading indoors (since the eclipse had occurred) but something compelled me to stay a bit longer and linger. There I stood in my backyard suddenly looking about the sky and watching all the planes take flight.  It was a busy travel night I gathered since I had seen at least 7 aircrafts flying about the sky (I live roughly15 miles from a major airport).  I watched how graceful they appeared and then noticed the stars out (which is rare being so close to city lights, pollution etc.)  Soon there was nothing moving about for me to look at. All was quiet in the night sky.  I took one more glance to the eclipsed moon and looked down to the ground, being careful to not step on ice and fall.  Something caught my attention to look up one last time-straight up-.  It&rsquo;s hard to describe what made me look and what even I really saw for it occurred very fast and was nothing I had ever seen before. I saw this silhouette or shadow type blob appear out of the thin sky, grey in color, almost invisible. Around it was the brightest light I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  If it wasn&rsquo;t for this bright white light, I would not ever of made out the silhouette in the first place.  The light streaked across the sky, so quick and so straight I just froze and stared up trying to follow with my eyes where it could have gone.  The streak was thick (diameter but not length) and left no remnants&hellip;.it simply vanished as quickly as it appeared. I frantically searched the sky and started to walk around searching for where this light could have possibly gone. I could not explain it, I was dumbfounded.  There was no cloud in the sky for this light or object to disappear in to and the speed of this light was unreal!!  I was stunned as to what just happened.  My first reasoning was a falling star.  Witnessing many falling stars over the years I compared and contrasted the facts and visuals and knew in my heart there was no way that was a falling star.  The flight pattern of the light, the diameter of the light, the sheer brightness and speed was unexplainable.  Plus, the grayish image I saw split seconds to the light illuminating around and or hovering near it was also unexplainable. My second line of reasoning was a plane (since I had seen so many out).  I laughed at myself when my brain tried to suggest that one.  Planes do not hover, come out of nowhere and jet to nowhere.  I have yet to see a plane travel at the speed I saw this light move.  Plus, the fact how this all occurred in less then 4 seconds.  I&rsquo;ve re enacted this event in my minds eye and when I do I get this sense of awe and estrangement.  My brain just can&rsquo;t wrap around it.", "observed two lights hovering diagonally over the ocean in santa barbara california for many hours.I was driving along the coast in Santa Barbara between 4 and 5 am this morning and noticed 2 strange lights hovering over the ocean very close to each other. They were in a diagonal formation and one was brighter than the other. It was hard to say how high they were hovering, but id say at around 1,000 feet above the water. I pulled into a parking lot on the beach to observe them to see what they were or if they were moving. I sat in my car for around 45 minutes listening to music and keeping an eye on the lights. They did not move. I proceeded home and was able to see them from my home until daylight a few hours later. I asked around about it and someone claimed to have seen the same light formation at 9 pm the same night.

I was lying in my bed, which was next to a window on the second story of my house. The window was facing southwest and across the street was another two-story house with trees to either side. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and seeing a bright red-orange fire ball in the sky above the house across the street. It was about the size of the full moon in the sky, but appeared to be much closer. It was bright, but it was lighting anything up on the ground, at least from where I was positioned. The fireball was shooting out small bits of fire, which would orbit the ball for a time leaving a trail behind them before plunging back into the main body of the ball. There were clearly flames on the surface of the ball, as well. It looked a lot like what you might imagine an atom with its orbiting electrons to look like. Small specks of fire swinging around the fire ball in all directions. Furthermore, to the right of the object I have just described was an array of white dots, larger than stars, but quite small. In the sky, this would be probably six times the diameter of the fireball in distance. These white dots would line up in two rows (there were probably 8 of them) and then one on the end would scoot through the sky, at first slowly and then with increasing speed, toward the fireball, then stop and turn down and head back to the main group ending up in the lower row, when it originally been in the upper. I watched for probably an hour and a half taking in the beauty of what I was seeing. I contemplated waking up my parents and nearly did so, but I was reluctant to take my eyes off the phenomenon in case I were to miss something. I never woke them up and eventually went back to sleep. The date I have proposed is approximate. I have only recently begun to share this story with people because in the past when I tried I was met only with skepticism, which is, I suppose, the right response. In any case, it seems to have stuck with me a! nd now I would like some answers. The only possibility I can think of, which does not rule one way or the other in terms of extraterrestrial activity or otherwise, is that it had something to do with the nearby Hanscom air force base. This air force base is in a pretty densely populated area, so it doesn&apos;t seem like it would be a good location for top-secret technology testing, although I have heard that some of the research on stealth fighter planes was carried out there.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Very low-flying, metallic saucer-shaped craft with multi-colored panels by major Michigan roadway in daytime.This event occured late-spring/early summer of 1991.  I was about 11 years old and playing at my grandparents farm.  The sky I recall being perfect blue; not a single cloud in the sky.  Noise was at a minimum, save for the sounds of my own play.  There may have been intermittant automobile sounds before OR after the incident, but not during the 10-15 seconds the sighting occured.  This 100-acre farm is right beside a major roadway AND railsystem.  On the other side of the country &quot;block&quot; (approx. 1 mile north) lies I-94, the major Chicago-Detroit road system. As I was playing, I saw a glint in between leaves to the north.  I remember pausing, then looking back up.  I saw another &quot;metallic&quot; glint, but due to the leaves I could not make any shape nor size out.  There was no sound.  As I ran out from underneath the tree&apos;s canopy, I remember being scared for a second thinking that, as low as it was, it might be an airplane...but without a sound. When I emerged, I saw it.  Talking with my dad later that day about it to determine height/distance (remembering I was 11 years of age or so) we decided it must have been about 100-150 feet north of me; there is a cornfield that runs 100 feet north with a woods on the northern edge.  The object was somewhere above either corn field or just beyond and above the woods. The object was moving very slowly.  I would have to say no more than 15mph or so judging the distance it moved west to east (approx. 150 feet in 10 seconds).  I remember thinking I should hear a &quot;hum&quot; as I had been an avid viewer of the TV program &quot;Sightings&quot;; however, there was no sound or &quot;vibration&quot; whatsoever. The &quot;metallic glint&quot; I first observed came from the top and bottom edges of this pie-shaped craft.  I could tell the edges were round, as in the center (which was the majority of the &quot;face&quot; of the side of the craft presented to me) had around 5 different colored &quot;panels&quot; standing vertically.  As a kid, it reminded me of the Lifesavers candy wrapper; each &quot;panel&quot; or window stood vertically, top and bottom of each panel meeting the metallic top and bottom of the craft.  Each panel was one solid color (I only recall three colors now; red, green, and purple). The craft was not very high; being yound and unable to judge I cannot guess, but a separate &quot;incident&quot; I will relate in just a moment may allow you to judge the height.  However, it kept moving westward at an even pace, moving perfectly straight (not changing altitude or bearing).  Then, as if on a sudden, it shot off in another direction and altitude!  It headed about forty-five degrees to the north (roughly North East) AND UP in altitude at about the same angle.  This object, which appeared so low to the ground, was out of sight completely within 5 seconds.  Maybe less. I stood there...obviously stunned...for only a few seconds. I cannot remember which I experienced next first, but I heard a helicopter just about the same time it too emerged!  This came from the west, heading east (same &quot;flight plan&quot; as the craft).  It was at about the same height as the craft but travelling faster (&quot;pre-spacejump&quot; I should say).  It was so low, in fact, that I could clearly see the spaces in between the letters on the helicopter: US ARMY After joining the National Guard a few years later, I was able to identify the helicopter.One UH-60 &quot;Blackhawk&quot;. It should also be noted that, about 30-miles due west, is a Michigan Air National Guard base that I would presume this came from.  Now I know the crew had to see it; it would have been right in front of them. I would also be surprised if no one else had seen this.  To reiterate: The day was clear.  The craft travelled between TWO major roadways.  The top and bottom caused such a glint that I noticed it while playing BETWEEN the leaves of a rather large tree.  The sides of the craft were quite beautiful, actually; each a separate distinct color.  It should have been noticed out of the corner of anyone&apos;s eye.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

My girlfriend and I decided to go to Zuma Beach in California just north of Malibu late one evening. She had a recent model Pontiac ((type deleted)).  She borrowed the car from her step mother for the evening.  She had a curfew and we decided we should start heading back from the beach toward home in the West San Fernando Valley. We left Zuma at a quarter to 1:00AM. She drove and we took PCH (Highway 1) for approx. a few minutes to Malibu Canyon Rd. Turned onto Malibu Cyn towards the 101 freeway and the SFV. There was no one around that intersection prior to turning onto Malibu Canyon. I noticed that there were no other cars on the road behind us or in front of us at that moment, and I had a clear view as we began to crest the first part of Malibu Canyon Rd from the ocean for about a mile ahead as we began to twist and turn on the sinuous canyon road ahead. It was a clear evening. Excellent visibility.We past by the Hughes Research Lab where they test satellites for aerospace. No noticeable activity that evening. Sometimes the huge box that camo colored would be open and they would have something they would be testing. Not this night though. We had a cassette tape playing in the stereo, it was the kind of tape player that would change sides automatically. The event began as we neared the tunnel. I looked out the passenger seat window to my right into the darkness of the canyon and I felt like I saw something out of the corner of my eye only to be staring into darkness. The Canyon is wide to my right and the cliff is a 500-700 foot drop off.  My feeling was that there was something there though which made no sense to me at the time. I shrugged it off quickly and let her concentrate of driving the car. I didn&apos;t want to alert her to something that was only a feeling. We went through the tunnel, and emerged from the other side. That is when I began to notice a &ldquo;brightness&rdquo; from behind our car develop, as if there was someone behind us who was going to need to pass us soon since they were coming at a good rate of speed. I turned to look at my girlfriend and she was upset that someone would want to race pass her this late at night. It was a weeknight and nobody usually would be on this road on a weeknight anyway. Maybe someone racing someone in the canyon..  The light grew to the point where she squinted her eyes, and flipped the mirror. I remember the bright reflection across her eyes at this point from the rear view mirror was still a very bright reflection across her face and she had to then move her head to avoid being blinded from that point on. The light was from behind the our car, it did not &ldquo;flood the compartment&rdquo;, but what the light touched it appeared almost perfectly while, perhaps like a sodium light or probably a flash from a camera except a constant incredible blinding brightness. She began to accelerate. The mood changed quickly from being upset to being worried that some jerk was trying to ! run us o ff the road or chase us through the canyon. That is when I turned around to give this jerk the universal hand signal to back off. As I turned around to look at the person driving, I had to squint  as if I was looking at the sun when I turned around. I thought I saw something that looked a large station wagon, except the lights went all the horizontally across the grill of the car following us. They were square and they were not quite like lights with light bulbs that cars have. They were more like flood lamps for a football stadium. They were slightly larger. I turned around quickly as to not be blinded by the light. I turned to look at my girlfriend and she was becoming panicked. I told her to go as fast as possible. She got the car up to 75-85MPH  and back down on the turns.. I rememebr the tires were screaming on the turns.. Even the slightest straightaway she would bring it back up to around 80.  I turned around again, and the light had not changed distance to our car. It had remained approx less than 10 feet off of her rear bumper. It was impossible to shake them. The second time I turned around, I did not see a station wagon. I saw a grill of lights. There was no glare from a chrome bumper like you would find on a station wagon. The light would burn like if you were sitting in front of a TV set too close for too long, like a very powerful tanning booth on full blast. My girlfriend was starting to under compensate her steering, and I told her take her foot off the gas. She refused and she was screaming at this point. I put hand on her leg and told her to use the whole road, both lanes. Anyone in front of us would see the light and have to pull over. The next thing that happened was very strange. The light was gone. It simply ended. I turned around, saw that it was gone. I looked really hard to see if it had turned off, or if there was a shadow under the street lights.. and there was nothing. It was completely gone. My girlfriend was shaking. I told her to pull the car over to the side of the road. S! he refus ed. She didn&apos;t speak a word for the rest of the trip. I tried my best to tell her everything was alright, and that it was gone, whatever it was.  I flipped her rear view mirror visor back down. I kept an eye on her for the rest of the drive back into town. She was different, and I was very worried at this point about something and I didn&apos;t know what it was. Something was wrong. For the rest of the drive I just let  her drive the car, and she drove straight back to her parents house in Tarzana, way at the top of Vanalden, south of the Ventura Blvd. The drive felt odd, yet very calm and relaxed. Like waking after a nightmare after you are done being frightened half to death.. She parked, and sat there for a minute before turning the engine off. I noticed two things at this point as she just sat there almost in shock. The tape player had stopped playing the tape. The tape was completely done on one side as I ejected it. It didn&apos;t flip or changed sides automatically.. I put the tape back in, and it changed to the other side automatically that it normally would have. I then ejected it and put it in my pocket. I looked at the clock. It took a full ten seconds to wrap my brain around what it said. It said 1:12AM.  My mind went back to Zuma and it was 15 minutes to 1:00AM. We entered the Canyon at at least 12:55, and somehow we traveled all that way to her house in &lt; 13-15 minutes, which is impossible. I asked her about it the next day, and she vaguely remembered it. After summer she went home, out of state,  where her real family was living. We had lost contact with each other. I wrote her but she never wrote me back.. I came up to visit her a couple of months later, and she wouldn&apos;t talk to me the whole time. I only would talk with her brother who was also a good friend of mine. We didn&apos;t have a nasty breakup. There was no reason for her acting this way, that I would have been aware of. I tried to think back to whatever it could have been... I asked her brother to ask her about the incident in the canyon, and if that was the reason, because that was the only thing bad that ever happened. She told him she didn&apos;t remember anything happening in Malibu Canyon. He said it was like she blocked out the entire summertime we spent together out of her mind. I was horribly heartbroken by this, and I returned home to LA. This incident happened in 88&apos;. Years later when I grew into adulthood I had a few nice cars.. Eventually I got a sport car. I still try to attempt to beat that record time I did in the canyon. The fastest I can make it from PCH and Malibu Canyon to the the valley is 22 minutes. That is hauling and screaming the tires the whole way, not just part of the way.  I even got a ticket for it once by the Malibu Sheriff in all my years of reliving that drive... My only speeding ticket in my life. ha.. She eventually grew up to be a burn patient specialist and married someone from her church. I have heard about stories of people who had lost time. Somehow I gained time or &ldquo;froze&rdquo; time going through the canyon in that car that night that I still can not explain why to the best of all my ability. For a while I thought I wanted to attribute what happened to the Hughes Research Lab that is located inside that canyon, the only facility. I don&apos;t know why, just my own intuition. I can&apos;t say I saw a UFO. I never saw it leave the ground. I never saw anything land from above. I felt like there was something just prior to entering the tunnel and it would have been floating approx 500+ feet above the canyon gully next to the road we were on.1.2.Perhaps what followed us could have been the Sheriff or some kid in a V8 muscle car. I didn&apos;t hear it make any noise above the sound of the Pontiac&apos;s V6 motor. Whatever it was was not car in my opinion. I did not have KC headlights. They were larger and square and not incandescence lights. They were the most perfectly while lights I have ever seen in my whole life, and they wrapped around the entire front of whatever you want to call it.. I just call it the &ldquo;grill&rdquo; of the front of whatever it was. A rectangle entirely made up many large rectangular lights. Approx 16 of them. That part bothers me. I haven&apos;t found anything that has that kind of light configuration on any type of vehicle ever. It could  have been a practical joke, maybe some teenagers were waiting for someone like us to be coming thought he canyon late on a weeknight. Whatever followed us that night, came up fast, and stayed perfectly on the bumper of the Pontiac and stayed perfectly behind us on ever turn, and matched our speed perfectly for at least 10-15 heartracing minutes.. As soon as we saw the lights of the city ahead then it was gone like someone turning off a switch. It didn&apos;t have tires that screamed. I am still very bothered by what happened. I have waited until now to post this hoping somehow after all these years I would have some way of explaining it, after all my research, and I do not. I will admit that I&apos;m a huge fan of Sci-fi books. And I&apos;m a big nerd into systems engineering and that is what I do for a living. I&apos;m a big nerd today. There is some missing time I&apos;m dealing with still. I&apos;m no longer bothered by what happened. It happens so long ago now. I actually enjoy driving that same road at night sometimes, hoping whatever it was would return. Kinda. Sorta. Maybe not.  I have seen some strange lights over the Hughes Labs.. I have told just a few close friends this story. My only witness, my girlfriend can not recall this happening. Her brother remembers my conversation with him about asking her, but that is all. I&apos;m le! ft alone with this memory today.. I wanted to share it here in case someone else has had a similar incident in Malibu Canyon or frozen time.  That&apos;s all I have. Thank you. You may edit this to however you wish for brevity but I wanted to put as much detail as I can still remember and feeling for the moment and also with my own conclusion. I&apos;m a UCSC grad, and I own my own company and have a house in Venice Beach, California.", "Bright metalic object flying westward Very high in sky.Watched what looked to be a cylinder shaped object, highly reflective, silver head westward across the sky, had an extremely long &quot;bright white&quot; tail stretching out behind it.. I would say about a foot length behind a pencil point or smaller sized object.  It flew very high and very fast.  It could possibly be a jet? Couldn&apos;t hear any noise, above the many birds in my yard.  The tail seemed to evaporate in a shimmer behind it. Not like a contrail that lingers.  Thought it could be the space shuttle, but after checking the website it wasn&apos;t due to take off till 2:45pm today.   Could be nothing more than a jet?  I would love to know one way or another.

The following is how it was seen.While unloading my shopping bags, I heard a helicopter in the distance. After a few moments it was within view. The only thing obstructing my view was the roof of my house. The helicopter then cleared the roof and continued moving southeast.At this moment in time,I was returning for my second trip to the car for the last of shopping bags. The noise of the helicopter was loud enough, to make me look again. I looked towards the helicopter and spotted another flying object near the helicopter. There was no noise from it, as far as I could tell. The helicopter continued moving southeast until another object appeared about 200 yards ahead. I say &quot;appeared&quot; because I did not actually see the craft arrive at that point. I was still focused on the first object; the second craft fell into my view as the helicopter moved into the space.At this moment my wife was also starring at this strange sight. She said she was wondering what had grabbed my attention.I explained to her what I had seen so far. My daughter then came outside where my wife told her to look towards the sky.Craft 1 started to pulse from a dull yellow to a color of that from a BMW headlight, a bluish-purple.Within a few seconds Craft 1 left at an unknown speed heading north. This is the last I saw from Craft 1.While Craft 1 left the helicopter was still heading souteast and Craft 2 was now about 100 yards away. At this point I believe the pilot saw this object. The helicopter quickly, sharply turned due east towards Sunrise Mtn. The Craft hovered for a moment while the helicopter continued moving.The Craft then got in front of the helicopter, again baout 100 yards. I did not see the craft move as I can describe it is more of a blink and then it was there. At this moment I was aking both my daughter and wife if they were seeing what I was seeing.The helicopter quickly and I stress quickly; turned head directly south. I saw the tail of the helicopter whip around and a higher exhaust note from it. The helicopter continued moving south with its nose down,tail high moving fast. The craft at this point moved along the side of the helicopter still 100 yards away. This mirror image of the craft and halicopter lasted about 10-15 seconds.The next thing that occured was that the craft stopped and redirected towards the north. It moved slowly at first and zoomed away.The craft were long about the same size as the helicopter.The pulse affect of the craft was as that of a squid when it is under stress.The speed was awe inspiring.There was no known sound if any coming from the craft.The helicopter was not a police or military aircfart,it seemed to be a medical helicopter.", "real UFO picture. {crystal clear}We have a crystal clear pictuer of a UFO.

I went into my pick-up and started it to warm my cold bones. There were only two other campsites in use since it was the &apos;early&apos; season. One site had a few young folks and was noisy till 11pm. When I woke the sky was cloud covered, dark, and the storms had died down but the staedy rain had not. I left my tent and went into my pick-up, started the engine to warm-up, and lit a cig. Now after my 1974 UFO incident; and all the &quot;Talk&quot; after that one this was unique. All of a sudden a stream of Universal Pictures Stars decended from the low clouds. They shot straight down out of the clouds, fromed a circle, just like in the movie intro, and then spread out. There were about 15 little stars flying down, they seemed to hit the water and spread out to the west. These small lights flew at about 200mph when they came close to the water, never touched it, and spread out on the west side of the Sawmill Lake. I have been camping here at that time 30yrs. and never saw anything like this! These little lites streamed through the trees like firflies. But at 200mph! 4 of them stopped at what I knew to be an abandoned trail, the others were still flying through the campsites. One of the lites left the area on the far but close side of the lake and flew through the woods towards me. I lost track of the rest, this one was coming right for me. It landed on my windshield! I have drawn a picture, and it is not a UFO, but a small creature. The one that left the fold of 4 flew through the woods towards me; and landed on my windshield. It almost looked like a grasshopper. It had the same oval dark eyes; suchtion-cup finger tips, and was about 5&quot;tall. I spoke to it mentally... I Thought i Had died and they were there for me...NO! It flew away, wings and all, rejoined the other lights at the center of the lake and flew straight, with his/her friends; straight UP from where they came. This was not a UFO, but some kind of close encounter...s! o has an yone reported something like this? Aliens not in a ship? Aliens just here in some sort of glowing gold bubble? with wings, feet, hands, etc.etc. WOW Someone help me here.... my 2nd; and VERY different CE3rdK.

The event occurred at around 8:15-8:45 p.m.I first noticed the lights as we were walking on the pier back to where my car was parked. I told my daughter to turn around and look at these lights that were in the sky off the coast. I knew that it wasn&apos;t a plane because planes aren&apos;t stationary in the sky, and it was too low in the sky to be a star, there was no sound, and the  lights were red on top and yellow on the bottom, close together, one light on top of the other light. We kept walking on the pier and continued to look back at the lights. All of a sudden there were no more lights in the sky. We just went down the stairs, got into the car and drove home. Of course, we talked about the lights on the way home, and speculated about what it could have been, but it wasn&apos;t until I started hearing about reports of lights in the sky in Phoenix, and the documentary about UFO&apos;s on the Discovery Channel that I&apos;m watching right now, that I felt compelled to report the incident.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We left Odessa, then a small town, and headed home on rt. 385. we headed West on 185 to N.Mex. and Holloman where we were stationed. We had spent the Holiday weekend with his sister and neice. When we left Odessa we headed North on 385 to Seminole and grabbed a coffee.  We then continued to Hobbs before we turned West.  We were on Hwy #529 then headed for Artesia.  It was an &apos;empty&apos; land back then. After the #180 junction, and we knew where we were going, we stopped, to take a leak.  Back then the land was empty and dark.  Not like my NYC my home... so here it gets strange.  We stopped about 1/8mile outside town to take a leak near a phone booth.  We got back in the car and started to drive and in about 1/4mile a UFO appeared in the sky, it came from the west and stopped about 250ft above us, it was hovering on us. Jim pushed it to 140mph. and it held, we slowed to 20mph and it held; we stopped, and got out.  It had sparks flying out of it when we stopped...and I said to Jim, it looks like it is having trouble, Jim agreed. It was 11:15pm then...next time we looked it was 12:30pm. We got back in his car and tried to outrace it; we couldn&apos;t (we went 160mph); we slowed and it did not leave. The entire incident to point was about 5.5miles in duration, an 2hrs. Then we saw 3 F-4&apos;s with BLUE tails headed towards us. We knew the planes because we were their mechanics. The round, UFO was still sparking when we stopped to watch... then, in an instant it was hundreds of miles away to the North West, at the base of the upcoming mountains (near Roswell)(NOT ARTESIA)... the F-4&apos;s, OUR PLANES; made the 120 degree turn to pursue the craft and it had gone from here to there (300miles) in an instant. It was a 60 degreee turn, with no radius, and just a simple 140mph backwards motion to a simple 60 degree turn to the Northwest. The Planes arced over our heads, and thier efforts seemed so insignificant to the speed the craft was able to move at.  The &quot;Saucer&quot;, and it was a &apos;saucer&apos; this time; moved from the center of the flat desert where we were...to the near side of the upcoming mountains in 1 second, what our planes could do in 20; about 200miles!

The whole base was in an uproar and at TOP-LEVEL Security when we got in at 5am... and alot of incidents occurred after that date...alot of CONFIRMATION took place; and the base, which allowed us to drink cases of beer at TRINITY SITE; was closed by ARMY troops. When we headed to Trinity that friday we were all of a sudden surrounded by armed troops turning us back. Two weeks later there were 1,000&apos;s of lights in the sky... and anyone that was stationed there then can realate them... was that our real first encounter???

This was just my friend and me in the car.  Anyway we were driving on top of South Mountain near Stabler Arena when I noticed what look like a helicopter above a new housing development.  They were still building this development.  This was about 7 football fields away or so.  I said to my friend as a joke &quot;look its a UFO&quot;!  We thought it was a Helicopter because it was just staying still and hovering.  I said to my friend to flash your lights at it in which he did.  This object began to move upon us flashing our lights coming directly towards us.  We then began to drive towards it as well.  It amazed both of us that it responded to our flashing.  There were no other cars in the area either.  Anyway we drove closer to it arriving at the main road and we stopped our car in the middle of the road.  This object was still coming right at us and moving very slow.  I got out of the car and my friend stayed in until curiosity finally got him out of the car as well.  I said to my friend &quot;what is that&quot;? We both at this time were filled of adrenalin as this object slowly passed right next to us. It was close enough to throw a rock and hit it.  We could both see it wasn&apos;t a Helicopter or a Airplane.  I can remember it was Triangle shaped with 3 lights.  One in the front and 2 in the back.  You could see metallic on it as it went by, we looked at the side of the ship and some under belly.  We were both stunned at what we were seeing, the thing that always got us was that there was no sound, maybe just a slight hum.  You couldn&apos;t hear an engine!  It slowly went passed us.  It disappeared when it went behind the other side of the mountain.  I&apos;m still shocked at this.  We both got back into the car and drove off.  My mind still tries to figure out what really was that thing.....My friend and I talked about this recently bringing back a lot of memories etc and we wanted to report this to you.

At 12:12 or 13 AM this date I witnessed a delta shaped aircraft or whatever of some kind over Tacoma, WA that was totally silent and a medium grey slightly towards the light grey side.  Just a little darker than the cloud that it flew over.I followed my wife outside with our dog for her last potty break before we planned on going to bed.  She and the dog went out the back door, which faces east.  I followed and stopped at the edge of our back porch to light a cigarette, but before lighting it, I looked to the east, up into the sky.I saw movement and noticed a triangle shaped craft at what I estimate to be 1500 to 2000&rsquo; in altitude about three seconds before it flew over a small cloud from south to north where it became invisible due to the color of the craft, and the thickness of the cloud.  As it moved north, I was able to see movement through thin spots in this cloud, but only two times.  The total time of this sighting did not last more than 5 or 6 seconds.This craft was moving at about 200 to 250 mph.  I base this on the fact that C-17s from McCord AFB fly over my home every day of the week, usually with full flaps and gear down, doing touch and goes.I do not know the speed of the C-17, but if for touch and goes with flaps and gear, I think they are traveling at about 200mph or a little less.A very large fir tree sits on the block just to the east of me.  When standing in the same place on my porch, extending my arm full out and placing my thumb on the top of the tree and where my little finger ended with my fingers spread out is the altitude this craft was at.With my hand spread out like that, my little finger will be on Orion and my thumb just shy of Sirius.There were no signs of any lights on this craft and it moved in a straight line and was approximately directly overhead of somewhere between D St. and Pacific Avenue South that run North and South in Tacoma, WA.At the distance is was from me I could put stretch my arm out, place my thumb over it and the tips of the wings could be seen just slightly past my thumb.  The tail of the craft had a slight protuberance past the back of the triangle.The craft flew in a straight line from south to north.There were no visible lights or marking of any kind.No exhaust trail.Not any hint of a cockpit or any raised part above the craft.However, the most peculiar thing is it was totally and completely silent.My wife did not see it as it happened too fast for me to even tell her until it was over with.There were no aircraft in the immediate vicinity.

I walked up the steps of my apartment and looked up. I sparked the cigarette then looked back up at all the constellations.

Earlier in the night I was out with my laptop on Stellarium just star gazing, it is a hobby of mine. The last time I reported a UFO everyone laughed at me and told me it was a satellite but this time I am certain that I didn&apos;t see a satellite. As I was looking up I noticed something fly really fast from above my apartment&apos;s roof. It traveled VERY fast across the sky but not as fast as shooting stars do. It was faster than any passenger jet I&apos;ve ever seen. It shined with the intensity of Venus and flickered more than any star in the sky. But what made it different is that it was a brilliant green. Green on the rim and white in the center. It traveled across the sky and into the horizon in at least 15 seconds. It looked sort of like a roman candle or a flare shot going off but it was way to high to be either and traveled at a constant velocity.

Singular object splits in two, lights fly across sky.On one evening around Dec 19-20 1993 (approx the date of Hubble&apos;s first repair mission, either the launch evening or the evening of the repair) a friend and I witnessed a Ufo fly over the area of Ottumwa, Iowa. We had heard on television that NASA were working on the Hubble and we wanted to see if the shuttle was visible at all, my friend and I grabbed our binoculars and stepped out into the driveway of my home. We were looking all over (we really had no idea where the shuttle or telescope would be, we were simply enthusiastic teens looking around)  5 minutes or so go by... my friend was looking Southeast and I looked toward the Northeast for a while and paused, I then saw what appeared to be a shooting star, instantly it splits into two balls of light (i then told my friend to look at it) we both watched as the two lights flew in formation from Northeast to Southeast, their behavior was very bizarre and exciting to watch, they flew as if a ribbon had been placed up in the sky and they were following the shape of it, going up and down irregularly, the lights flew from left to right across the horizon like this. My friend was clever enough to grab his binoculars and watch as it trailed off into the horizon, all he could say was &quot;no, way! no, way! because we both thought at the time we had just seen a Ufo. He reported the object was disc shaped through his binoculars after he watched it trail off into the distance.. I can&apos;t verify that it was, as all I saw were two lights. These objects were witnessed for approximately 8-10 seconds, they crossed our field of view in that time and emitted no noise that we could hear. From our point of view the object entered from the Northeast, splt in two, travelled south and exited Southeast.. Many years later I heard of the phenomena of ball lighting, I thought perhaps that was what we had seen but the two light sources seemed to fly with each other the entire time. If I were to guess the altitude, over 1,000 feet above ground, probably anywhere from 1,000 - 5,000 would be my best guess, it appeared to be rather close from where we stood. There is a communications tower near here, it flew above and behind that at a distance. Speed, most likely over 1,000mph, It crossed our field of view in 8 seconds or so. I can&apos;t remember the color of the lights, all I remember is thinking the object was a shooting star at first..    I can provide an illustration of what we saw or a high quality animation if needed. I am an artist, it is actually easier for me to show what we saw than describe it. It would be an approximation however, I can&apos;t remember the exact details as it has been many years, the memory is still fairly vivid though..

When I looked closer I recognized a Smoke trail, like you often see behind an airplane. I followed the Smoke trail with my eyes and saw a light at the beginning. It was hanging still, so it wasn&apos;t an airplane. 1 Min. later it started moving, so it wasn&apos;t a star. Because it left a smoke trail it couldn&apos;t have been a sattelite, I thought to myself. The smoke trail would never be visible to the naked eye if it was a sattelite.

We live out in the country probably 8 miles out of town. I was looking at the moon and noticed 4 diferently colored lights flashing fast.  I think the colors were red, white, yellow, and blue.  At first I didn&apos;t think anything of it then I began thinking; when I see airplanes at night flying overhead there are only two lights flashing, one on each wing, and both are colored white. Well the lights on the aircraft where of different colors, and where flashing rapidly, faster than I have ever seen an  airplane lights flash.  Also, the where flashing in different orders; such like the red would flash, then the blue, then yellow, then white; all at random choice it seemed. The object didn&apos;t seem to be moving, just sitting in the sky.  I cannot tell a definite shape because it was pitch dark all I saw were those lights.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My home is located on the Pacific Ocean beach about 25 miles north of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and faces almost due West. The evening sky was clear and many stars were visible. At about 8:40 PM we noticed a bright orange colored object rising up from directly west over the ocean. We had an unobstructed view. The first one we spotted appeared to be some object burning up in the atmosphere as the light was not steady, but flashing more like a fire. Distance is hard to determine but I would guess that when first spotted they were 5-7 miles away and as they proceeded towards being overhead, they went further away. I immediately retrieved my 24 power telescope to get a better view. As the first one reached approximately 40 degrees from the horizon and appeared to be getting closer, I could see that it was cone shaped. It had 4 or 5 dark lines extending from the &lsquo;nose&rsquo; towards the &lsquo;rear&rsquo;. It was heading in an easterly direction. When it was approaching 80 degrees, almost straight overhead, a couple of my friends shouted that there was another one coming from the same direction as the first one. I re-directed my telescope toward the second one and observed that it was similar to the first one. It appeared to be getting further away, diminishing in size, as it reached about 45 degrees off the horizon. It then stopped crossing the sky and remained in its current position for about 5-8 more minutes. A third object, similar in appearance, appeared coming from the same general direction as the two previous ones. I watched this one as it changed directions numerous times and seemed to approach the second one but not get too close. The general direction of its travels began as the others, from west to east, but it also turned toward the south and reversed direction as it approached the second one. It went back and forth changing directions 5-6 times and for about 10-30 seconds on each leg. At this time, I tried to re-locate the first one with no luck as it was diminishing in size and brightness. I returned to watch the third one for about 3 more minutes, until I could no longer see it. All three appeared to be of similar size and shape when we first spotted them. They all had coloration like that of an object burning up as it entered the atmosphere, very orange in color with the wide stripes extending from &lsquo;front to rear&rsquo;. The light emitted from them was flickering as a fire would, with occasional flashes of higher intensity. The flashes of fire were coming from the &apos;front&apos; of the object. I hope that this is of some value to someone and of course, I hope that there are other sightings reported from this area with more detail.", "Sighting in san diego- Summer of 2007: possible bright object or may have been flash but shortly after seeing that i saw a beam or lgitI was in Mission beach California for vacation. Some night toward the end of July I don&rsquo;t remember the exact night but me my friend and two girls were listening to music on our balcony of the house we rented. All of a sudden a bunch of the street lights went out and a lot of houses went black too as if there was a blackout and then I turned around and I saw a slight white flash or white bright object in the sky and then a beam of light and then it was gone and shortly after that all the lights came back on. This happened on South Mission beach area. It was very strange I don&rsquo;t know what it was but all I know is it was like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It was definitely very strange. It moved very fast it disappeared in no more than 2 seconds. It was a roundish in shape I guess u could say but I couldn&rsquo;t really tell if it was a bright object or a flash. The sky was pretty clear that night too and there was a slight breeze if I remember right, if that helps at all.

Up in the air about 200 to 300 feet. was a large disk shaped object with large round yellow/orange lights spaced all around the perimeter that we could see. It was so large that we could not see the lights around the back side. It was huge. It dwarfed the size of a high school track and football field complex. We stood almost right under it. The people there getting gas and the clerk inside told us that they see these large craft quite often and they said that the craft were US equipment and that it is no big deal. We watched it move from it&apos;s stationary position upward for quite a ways up. Then it tilted upward to our right and flew away very fast and out of sight in seconds. The craft made no sound and no exhaust seemed present to us. It was so great to just stand and watch.

I looked outside my bedroom window, and there was something in the sky, a backwards V-Shaped object, with the lights flashing, not like those on airplanes do.  It was flying so close to the ground, and I live on the hill, surprised it passed over the hillside.  It was a really huge object, nothing like you would see in the United States airforce, or probably any airforce in the world, it was too big.  I can&apos;t say the objects, as it was snowing too badly to see how big it truely was.  All I could see was the lights.", "Here&apos;s my case I rerported to Nuforc.org. It&apos;s horribly written so I&apos;ll rewrite it here to tell more of the details. It was not hunting season like Nuforc added, and I could find a more accurate date if I found court dates of a custody hearing, because it happened a week or two before that date around 1996. (link to my case at bottom)  ----------------------- My story;  I lived in a travel camper about 100 feet from my parents house on their property which adjoined my grandparents property at the bottom of a mountain, Virginia, in Roanoke. There was a field 8 acres in size between my parent&apos;s and grandparent&apos;s homes.One night, it was getting late around 11 p.m., I started hearing some dogs bark (we had no dog, it must have been neighbors in a distance) and went to look out of the tiny window in the back side of the camper and across the field. I saw a light in the woods about 200 feet down from my grandparent&apos;s home (on my grandparent&apos;s property). It was going around a tree and stayed in the same place the whole time. The family sometimes let a hunter racoon/squirrel hunt? so I wondered if it could be him. After watching several minutes, the light went out. I went back and looked a few minutes later and it was back on, but soon went out again. I left, came back, and each time the light would be on and go off when I looked and kept doing this in sinc with me watching or not like it was playing a game. Then suddenly a red light shot up out of the woods and over the ridge (like a flare?) Then nothing. I left the window again. This was a little disturbing, so after a few minutes I had to go look again. There was a HUGE triangular craft headed from the direction where the flare was toward the field. It was going VERY slowly and low. It was totally dark, no interior lights, and no normal exterior lights except one long red light that went completely from front to back of the craft. It&apos;s flying altitude stayed below that of the mountain peak. It took a long time to go from over the field, to the peak and when it reached the peak, it went beside it and behind it. Then it seemed (later realized a much smaller craft) to circle behind the peak and come back around the other side of it and it started coming back down the mountain in the direction of my house. This scared me so I grabbed a handgun I kept for protection, and went outside to watch it. There were no exterior lights on this craft coming toward me, and there was a light inside lit up like a cockpit. It was barely skimming the tree tops as it made it&apos;s way down the mountainside. When it got about 200 ft. from my home, it stopped and turned it&apos;s interior light off. I could see this one was about the size of a helicopter. It then traveled over to my backyard and hovered just a few feet directly over a light pole. It shone a big spotlight down in the yard, which I was standing just on the outside of. I panicked and ran as fast as I could to my parents house next door. When I looked back, I saw no signs of it still being there. I went inside and woke my parents up, telling them what had just happened. Suspicious facts; There is no way a human could see me in this tiny window from such a far distance, without having binoculars, telescope and intentionally keeping a lookout for people watching. These crafts made NO noise. I did not have any missing time (in case anyone wondered about possible abduction, no it didn&apos;t happen). But, I am left feeling very angry and violated that whoever, whatever, this was did trespass on private property, on the ground in the woods, as well as flying under the allowed altitude according to government regulations. Military, alien? I don&apos;t know. I do know this technology is either secret military, or alien in nature. I have searched since then to compare and identify it, and I have not been able to identify it still. The closest thing I&apos;ve seen is from a UFO story on t.v. of some people in Australia who had an encounter with a huge triangular craft with a long red light. I called the Roanoke airport the following week and asked them if anything strange showed up on their radar the previous week. They just laughed at me and then told me no. Here&apos;s my Nuforc report;  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16107.html  10/15/96 23:00 Roanoke VA Triangle 1 hour I saw a triangular craft with only red light from front to back on it. Craft stopped over my back yard and shone light down. 2/18/01 ------------------ Note to Nuforc;  There is nothing in those woods. Just plain trees! It doesn&apos;t matter if you contact me or not, even though I checked at bottom of form. It&apos;s just that if anyone wants to go onto the land and check for radiation, or whatever, or if anyone wants to meet me and go to the area this happened at, I can arrange that. I do not want to say publicly it was at the bottom of Bent Mountain, because I do not want to be identified publicly and some locals might know it&apos;s me with that much information put in there. I don&apos;t care to investigate for my own purposes, but only if you think you might gain some helpful knowledge or if Nuforc could benefit in some way by doing so. I also hope you don&apos;t give our information out to the government, as that worries me the government might hurt or harrass people if they are doing secret operations and people are telling about it.

MO near Glenstone and Grand on the very night of the Lunar Eclipse and Hale-Bopp.On the very night of the Lunar Eclipse, while Hale-Bopp was still in the sky, we were cooking outside and watching the sky because the Eclipse was getting ready to take place. I had the urge to look up into the south sky (opposite direction from the comet) and saw what to the best of my recollection was either the front of a disc or a large batman type of wing floating overhead. I called loudly to my husband to come out and witness this, as I knew he would not believe me. He came out just in time to see the craft go over the house to the north. It was above the streetlight and it appeared to be round. While it was overhead, it was not visible, as though looking only at the sky. It could only be seen on the cusps of the craft. It flew off and curved right away to the northwest after passing over our home. I watched the news that night hoping others may have seen this, but there were no reports of it. My husband at the time was teaching at a local college. The next day he asked if anyone had seen anything odd the night before, whereupon one did tell that he and his girlfriend also saw something similar in the sky the prior evening, while watching for the eclipse. The thing that was confusing to me was that, in my mind, an object that appeared that size would fall out of the sky, were it flying so smoothly and at such a low speed. It seemed to be on cruise at a low speed. The only other solution to this speed is that it could have been much larger and much higher, appearing smaller and closer. However, we could see the streetlight in front of our house reflecting onto the back of the cusp or disc as it flew off. I have tried to do a search on the internet to see if others spotted this ufo during the Eclipse and Hale-Bopp, however, the only other thing I have found was references to Heaven&apos;s Gate. I/we were never in the slightest interested in cults. I have thought of this many times and hoped others had seen the ufo on that very night and also wondered if they, whoever they are, intentional! ly flew the craft that very night because they knew people would be watching the eclipse that night.

I was amazed of how clear the night&rsquo;s sky was, and also how well you could see stars.  I started to focus my attention at the brightest star in sky. I stared at it for about 15 seconds pondering if it were in-fact the north star, then realized it was more eastern. At about that moment of realization, the frozen star-like light started slightly moving to west in a straight but slow motion. I started yelling at the other 3 people outside with me, and pointed out the moving (non-blinking) bright white sphere of light. We all had a sudden rush shoot through our body&rsquo;s once we had all realized we&rsquo;d never seen anything like this before. No one said a word, just mumbled slowly stuff like oohhhhhhhhh! or whattttttt! (I could tell that everyone was truly freaked out.) The light started speeding up gradually while swerving slight zigzags in the sky. About 2 minutes into  seeing this object pass across about 3/4s of the visible sky , it suddenly disappears.  We instantly ran across the house to front yard to see if we could still see anything from a different angle. Around 45 seconds after seeing the light go out/disappear we all 4 see a super bright shooting star looking thing with a long bright tail zoom across the whole sky(diameter about- 8 gauge).While these events were going on, flashing lights like lightning were striking about every 10-15 seconds and no one saw any actual lightning, nor heard any thunder, we just saw light flashes in the distance.

At 2045 by my watch which is one minute faster than the official U.S. time, I observed four lights going from southwest to northeast, from my 11 o&apos;clock to 2 o&apos;clock position, at elevation about one half way between the horizon and directly overhead.  The lights were four abreast at first, top to bottom from my perspective and eqi-distant apart, which I thought was unusual for military aircraft.  If you hold your hand at arms length with your thumb and first finger about three inches apart, that would encompass the formation.  There was only one light per object and they were not blinking.  Each light was maybe three to four times the size of Venus, with a faintly greenish tinge, and appeared not distinct, but slightly hazy like looking through a fog.  They went through about twenty degrees of the sky and then one light dropped back into trail.  After going through another twenty degrees, they disappeared behind a cloud.  They traveled in a straight line.  The entire sighting lasted about twelve seconds.  I expected to hear sounds of jet engines following the lights, but heard nothing.  There was no vapor trail like I observed on other normal aircraft seen later.For many years, I have done a lot of fishing at night.  I have observed many aircraft flying overhead and have seen many shooting stars.  This was like nothing I have ever seen before and immediately caught my attention.  The unusual formation, speed, and lack of sound were unique.  To cross the sky that quickly, they had to be relatively low but I heard no sound.  If they were too high to be heard, they were going many times faster than other planes I have observed and were extremely large.  It was definitely not the ubiquitous weather balloon.To our south about thirty miles is Seymour Johnson AFB.  I was stationed there in the mid-60&rsquo;s and am familiar with military planes.  Their F-15&rsquo;s often fly over Greenville since their runway has a north-south heading.  They are generally low enough to be heard.  We also see the louder F-18&apos;s out of Virginia Beach.  Most aircraft have red, green, and white lights.  On most airplanes you can usually see blinking lights or rotating strobes and not all lights are visible from every direction.  The four lights I saw were steady and looked the same from a left to right forty degree arc.  Pitt-Greenville Airport is about four miles away to my northwest.  I worked there for three years ending two years ago.  Again I never saw anything like this during that time.About me.  I am sixty-four years old and retired.  I was in the air force four years, worked at Eastern Airlines for twelve, and was in computing for thirty-five years, the last eighteen with a university.  I do not believe in UFO&rsquo;s, little green men, or alien abductions.  But I will admit that this was like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen before and it was interesting.

We were passing through Sugarcreek on our way to Bellbrook (my home town) when we saw the strangest aircraft in the sky. It was large, black and triangular with one white light on each point. It seemed to be hovering nearby. It made an odd humming noise and was able to move very slowly. We pulled over to watch it and two others appeared in the distance, moving incredibly fast and moving in ways that you would not expect of an aircraft. In fact, their movements struck me as being completely unnatural. Even now I cannot conceive of how anything man-made could move in such a way. I looked at the clock. It said 1:40 am. There was no mechanical interference and we didn&rsquo;t lose time.

There is an air force and army base about 15 miles from here.  March 31 at about midnight I went out to have a cigarette.  About a minute after I got outside I looked over the horizon.  There was a light with an odd haze/glow moving around just above the tree line.  I decided it was an airplane until I noticed that the light stayed there for a second, zig-zaged around, and then shot down under the trees.  The light then came back up to a higher area and repeated the same movement. At this time I realized it was definitely not and airplane that I knew of.  The object continued this for quite some time, at least 20 min, and then disappeared.  It took place above the north horizon.", "My UFO sighting experience occurred at 12:23am Monday, May 5, 2008.The night sky was clear and full of stars. After looking up in the sky searching for the big dipper, I noticed three bright stars lined up parallel with each other. I wondered what they were connected to. At that point I noticed that they were slowly moving further away. I could see they were flashing different colors, blue, white and red. They hovered and moved unlike any aircraft I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I watched the three objects for 20 minutes. I could not see a shape but the movements and lights of the three objects were clear and undeniable.I am 46 years old and have always leaned toward being a skeptic in regard to unidentified flying objects.

No movement, or strobe lights, but then the lights just disappeared like they had just been shut off.

I live in San Diego, and the evenings can be a little misty or foggy. The lights of this object seemed to reflect off of the fog making the whole phenomenon a little hazy. Just as soon as I got a good look at this phenomenon it appeared to fade back into a cloud, but like I said there were no clouds present. Absolutely no sound was made by the phenomenon. The whole event only took about 5 seconds.

The lights moved in a &quot;sign of the cross&quot; type of flashing sequence with four distinct colors (red, white, blue, green) being witnessed.

They disappeared for a minute or two, and then reappeared in a different location  a half mile further to the south, but in the same triangular formation. At one point, on of the lights separated into 2 lights, then combined back into 1. The lights would brighten and dim in intervals, but the brightness of all 3 objects was totally synchronized.

Witnessed by hundreds.We were at the county fair along with a few hundred people when two bright lights flew directly over downtown St Augustine.  The back light sped up to catch the front light and both continued to move across the sky at a slow speed.  They eventually both faded out, and then a third flew directly over us at the same speed and in the same direction. All three were the same brightness and color.  They did not blink like a regular plane. It was definitely not an airplane.  Hopefully others will write what they witnessed!", "Triangular or diamond-shaped craft produced rhythmic circular humming as it slowly flew by very low in the sky.Last night on March 19, 2008, I was coming home from the grocery store and was about to turn onto my street, when I observed a really bright light up in the sky above what used to be a field next to my neighborhood. Now, there is new construction going on every day and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if the bright light was atop a new cell phone or radio tower that may have been built next door or if it was a search light on a helicopter. At first, I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether the light was stationary or moving very slowly so those were the two possibilities that immediately came to mind.I parked the car in front of my house and was about to unload groceries when I noticed the bright light was gone. Instead, an object was moving very slowly and steadily from the north, where I originally saw the bright light, to the south and it passed directly overhead, quite low in the sky. If I had to guess, I would say it was perhaps 20 stories from the ground. I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether it was triangular or diamond-shaped, but it was one of those, judging by the half a dozen or so red and blue blinking lights on the underside of the craft.I can&rsquo;t stress enough how slowly and how low in the sky it was much lower than a plane would fly. The other unusual thing I noticed was the sound it made. It was a humming sound that repeated in a circular fashion. It was definitely made by a machine, but it didn&rsquo;t clank metallically, and it wasn&rsquo;t high-pitched. It&rsquo;s difficult to describe, but it was certainly rhythmic and repetitive.I am not sure how big it was because I couldn&rsquo;t see the entire outline of the craft, but it was much larger than a helicopter and probably smaller than or about the size of a football field. I wasn&rsquo;t afraid as I watched the object make its way slowly southward. Instead I was curious, trying to figure out what I was looking at. Unfortunately, my camera was in my upstairs bedroom and my camera phone is virtually worthless at night.It wasn&rsquo;t long before I lost sight of the object and went into the house with my groceries. The time was exactly 11:30 pm when I walked in the front door. I estimate that the entire sighting took about five minutes. I awakened my housemate and told him what I&rsquo;d witnessed, and then called my sister to tell her, too. I mentioned it to my boyfriend the following morning and he said that there are now planes that can hover, but that they would have no business doing that above a residential area. All I know is that it didn&rsquo;t look or sound like any kind of plane I&rsquo;ve ever seen or heard. One second it was there and the next, it was gone.The night was cold and clear. There was a full moon with little or no breeze in far south Austin, Texas. I was completely sober and have no history of mental illness or attention-seeking.

It was a clear night with bright stars and no clouds.  I saw two lights moving from the west towards the east in the sky moving at what appeared to be a constant speed and in a straight line, about as fast as a small airplane would be going.  The two lights had just flown almost directly over the Las Cruces Airport.  The two lights were bright white color and were not flashing or blinking.  One was in front and was a little larger and brighter than the one following it.  Their alignment was straight with the path and the distance between the lights remained constant.  They remained the same brightness until right before they disappeared which I will describe later.I could not hear anything but I didn&apos;t think that was unusual.  I pointed the lights out to my wife and remarked how it might be an airplane except the lights weren&apos;t blinking and there were no red lights.  I said it seemed strange for a plane to not have flashing or blinking lights.  It crossed my mind that it could be a UFO but I still thought it was probably a plane.  She said it was a plane.We watched it and within a few seconds noticed an airplane flying west by northwest.  The second plane had flashing red lights and non flashing white lights and didn&apos;t seem unusual in any way.  The plane and the lights we saw first were heading in a way that they looked like their paths would intersect.  They looked as if they were on a collision course.  So we watched, not really excpecting them to collide, but just watching.When the plane and the lights intersected, it was hard to tell if the lights passed under or over the plane.  Their intersection appeared to happen almost directly overhead.  So far there was nothing really strange except for there being no flashing lights accompanying the two white lights.  The strange thing that happened was: immediately after the plane and lights intersected, the two white lights faded away to nothing.  the fading away was fairly fast but not instantaneous.  It seemed to take about a second for the fading to be complete.  Then the two white lights never reappeared.  There were no clouds and the airplane had just passed through the same part of the sky immedialty before yet it did not fade out of sight or even get dimmer momentarily.  The airplane was still visible and continued on it&rsquo;s way.We both thought what we had just seen was very strange.  I suggested it might have been an alien spaceship but my wife dismissed that idea.  I really can&rsquo;t think of a good explanation for the lights fading away like that and a few people who I described it to also thought it was weird.Neither my wife or I had been drinking or smoking anything.  I have not drank ( or smoked anything ) in over 23 years.  I am a computer scientist working for the Army at White Sands Missile Range and my wife is a Chinese immigrant.  It might be possible to check with the Las Cruces airport to see if  1 plane or 2 planes where flying over the area just to the east of the airport at around 8:45 PM on those nights.  I will try to remember exactly which night it was.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The light was white then dimmed and rebrightened to orange.  It was like a huge spotlight in the sky shining straight horizontally towards us.  My husband said he could see it was going down vertically very slowly.  When it became orange, it shined for a minute or so and then dimmed out until it was completely gone.

She was driving while I rode in the front passenger side.  The road to the highway from our home slopes downhill and gives you a view of NW Gallup on the outskirts and a railroad system that goes W to E.  I was describing to my wife an encounter that had happened to my brother and I, just the day before almost exactly 24 hours ago.  I then looked ahead above the railroad tracks as we went down the hill and saw a bright white round object and I stated that what I had seen earlier looked exactly like it!  While we proceeded closer I could see that it was not moving in any conventional manner.  It did not appear to be moving at all.  Suddenly two more identical objects appeared to the N and to the SW of the initial object.  We turned down Highway 66 and I had become quite excited by this point.  We took another turn which goes north and across the railroad tracks and then took another right which takes you down Warehouse Lane, which is home to Burlington Northern, and a few other municipal installations.  I had my window rolled down and I had not taken my eyes off of the formation when we had come to a stop off the side of the road.  I got out and looked above and could still see three objects when suddenly I could see one more, then another, then 6.  They seemed to just appear from nothing and then I detected some that looked like they were coming down from space at very high speed.  They zipped down so fast that a few looked almost like a meteor coming down.  They were all moving independent of each other and it had gotten to a point were I could count up to 12 of them.  They were at different altitudes from each other but all were going in a mostly W &ndash; SW direction.  It was partly cloudy and windy at about 20-25 mph from the SW.  I noticed one object that was different from the rest in that it was quite a bit larger than the rest (about the size of a quarter held at arms length) and was rapidly rotating and changing forms.  It looked somewhat translucent but it seemed like it had some kind of field that enveloped around the shape of the object.  Around the edge of the field was slightly brownish and seemed much closer than the other objects. I could see approaching aircraft coming in from all directions and are what I would deduce to be military jumbo type aircraft.  When a few of these planes came close a few of the objects actually appeared to be playing with the jets.  They flew in very close proximity to the planes and flew even alongside them for a moment or two.  The formation almost seemed like a flock of geese or a school of fish in the ocean the way in which they moved with each other. There was no noticeable noise that came from these objects.  They all slowly disappeared through a cloud front that was approaching from the W or by just disappearing as the fleet headed W.", "Sitting out sie on  a balcony looking at the skyline.I,was sitting at a freinds house balacony.

At approximately 8:28pm, I stepped outside to lock up a conference trailer on my company&rsquo;s property. After I locked up the trailer and began to walk away, I glanced up towards the moon, almost directly overhead, and I was surprised to see what appeared to be four red lights crossing the sky at a slow but steady pace. I stopped and stared upwards at the lights. They seemed to be traveling from north to south in a straight line. I couldn&rsquo;t see what the lights were attached to. I couldn&rsquo;t see the shape of any kind of aircraft. I couldn&rsquo;t tell how high or how low they were in the sky, however if it was one solid object and it was very high, then that would meen it was very big as well. The lights easily stretched out to cover the sky about ten moons wide. They were also very quiet. If they made any sound, it could have been the sound of a commercial airliner passing at a very high altitude overhead, a very faint and distant sound, although that sound could have easily been confused with the low hum of A/C units on top of a nearby office building as well. I&apos;m not sure the object(s) made any sound at all. The lights did not blink, nor were they were not very bright. They were almost faint in the sky, easy to miss unless you glance up and happened to spot it. They did not have the normal navigation lights you expect to see on any commercial aircraft. There were no strobe lights, no green lights to show what side of the aircraft you might be viewing. They did seem to be traveling to my left, but keep in mind they were practically overhead too. I still should have seen a green light next to each red light if these were planes in formation. It is possible that these were military fighter jets with an different light configuration than what civilians are used to seeing, but these seemed to move slower than I would have expected to see and I actually am used to seeing fighter jets at night. I was in the Navy and lived near Mira Mar in San Diego. I&rsquo;m used to hearing the jets clear! ly and s eeing a blue light with a white strobe. At least, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m used to seeing over the city at night. As I continued to watch the lights, a few moments into observing all this, I realized I might be witnessing a UFO sighting and so I quickly tried to gather any more information I could before the lights flew out of sight. I was too far from my truck to grab my camera. None of the security cameras pointed straight up. I realized my eyes would be the only thing I could rely on to remember this by. My first thought was to look at each light closely. What each light seemed to be was a set of three lights. There were two bright red lights with a white light in the middle. That white light seemed to be dimmer than the red lights by comparison, but also seemed to be on the leading edge of each set. The next thing I tried to determine before it got too far was if what I was seeing was a formation of aircraft or one solid object. I jogged back a few steps until a bright enough star was in it&rsquo;s path. I stopped when the upper two sets of lights seemed to be getting close to that star. Halfway between the two sets of lights, the star disappeared for a moment. It seemed to me at that point that what I was seeing was one solid chevron shaped object. The whole sighting took maybe 15 to 20 seconds before the lights went over the horizon and behind the building I was standing near. I ran to the far edge of the building to get a few more seconds of viewing, but the lights were too far gone by that point. I could not see any more. I asked around, but I was the only person who saw this. I reported this to the Carlsbad Police Department and to Channel 6 News in San Diego. I will include an image I drew of the sighting. I am 29 years old, Ex-Navy, a trained observer, and I&rsquo;ve worked at that location, near Palomar Airport, for at least 4 years. I have never seen lights like this, not here or anywhere else for that matter. I&apos;d also like to note that cloud cover moved in later that night and the direction of the wind seemed t! o go aga inst the direction these lights were traveling.", "Lights seen by many, including DJ who announces location in sky.I am the on-site manager of a local low-power FM station. I received a phone call from a friend to look in the north sky. I went outside and at first couldn&apos;t see anything. I asked the friend more details where to look. There were some trees in my view that covered the portion of sky I needed to look in. I walked down to a lower house on the property for a better view and contacted the occupant. After explaining what we were looking for, I notice the first of several lights. They were yellowish and slowly accending upward. There were many of them. At that point I realized that these were not anything one would normally see in the sky. I ran back up to the broadcast booth and announced what I saw. I asked listeners to look, and we recieved many eyewitness phone reports. The lights flew in a &apos;question mark&apos; formation according to some callers. Another caller described a &apos;backwards letter C.&apos; From my perspective, these lights were spaced further apart. They slowly floated upward. A couple callers said they saw them float up toward space, but I stopped watching in order to announce this event quickly to the public. They were very bright, and callers closer to the area described them as being consolidated...that is, multiple lights made up each distinct object. I would say I was about 4 miles from the area the lights were flying over. Knowing the elevation of this property and the area in general, what I saw must have been flying at about 2000 ft in altitude. In the event that these were flairs, I called 911, who called the Coast Guard. I don&apos;t think at all these were flairs, but better safe than sorry. One caller suggested that they might be flairs. All the other callers after that said that they were sure they were not flairs.", "I saw strange objects in the sky.Four circular objects that were different colors. one was light blue, white, yellow, and purple.

It was moving at a steady pace and it wasn&apos;t loud as if it were a plane or helicopter.  It was a lot smaller than either of them. I thought maybe I had seen a one of those blinking tower lights flashing, but once I focused on the red flashing object and realized it wasnt a blinking light from the electric poles, it vanished into thin air.", "We both saw a very bright light that drew our attention from what we were doing.   The light startled us both.On April 22, 2008 around 11Pm, my friend and I were outside enjoying the crispness of the night.  At the same time we both noticed a bright light in the sky to the south.  The light appeared out of nowhere and glowed brightly in the same exact spot for several seconds.  Then there was another light right beside the first that did the same thing.  It could have been as much as several miles away. We both looked at it as we both said , &ldquo;Man what in the world is that?&rdquo;  The light got brighter for a moment then disappeared in thin air.  We both walked towards the light for about a hundred yards when we noticed that there were several planes/jets in the night sky in the area.  As we watched the jets circled the area above and around where the light had came from. For at least 20 minutes we watched as two then three jets seemed to be monitoring the area.  The jets were flying cross patterns and large circles in and around the same area.  Then out of nowhere there was 7 bright bursts of light in a trailing pattern.  The light was very bright at first and within a second or two would get brighter then go away. Within a few minutes after this the jets left the area and the night became still. Prior to seeing the first bright lights, we had seen a very low flying jet moving across the sky on two separate occasions.  This may have been some sort of military training, but at ages 36 and 38 we both have never seen anything like this.", "A bright star-shaped object streaked gracefully across the sky and emanated red and green before disappearing.It was dark outside and I had been playing hockey. I started to get the feeling that I was being watched, it creeped me out, and I went and sat down to the side of the parking lot I was in. After a few minutes of sitting down, I began to hear a few dogs barking quite a bit. I eventually got up and left, and started to head home. I live right below the top of a rather large hill, and there is an intersection at the top of the hill. I got to the top of the hill, and non-voluntarily, I looked up to see this bright star-shaped object in the sky. It was the color of a star at first, and it streaked directly across the sky quickly and gracefully. It streaked for a few seconds, and it began to emanate red and green for a second or two, and it disappeared. It almost seemed like it was crashing when the red and green appeared. This was the only object I saw, and it was shaped almost exactly like a star but it seemed too unnatural. I heard the sound of a plane afterwards.", "Barely visible cicular craft with small red lights that floated independently over the craft like flies.Making a report of this type is something that I never could have imagined, but I just saw an unexplainable object.  At 9:00 pm, I witnessed a barely detectable object that flew over Texas A&amp;M University at a height normally reserved for military aircraft.  The object was silent, round bodied as large as a jumbo jet, but with strange red lights that seemed to float independently around the fuselage.  The craft was moving slightly faster than an airliner, but again it seemed to float, with no noise and with no normal aircraft lights.  The weird floating red lights where not attached to the aircraft and moved over the aircraft body likes flies.  The craft moved from the south over the college toward the east and the whole flight over the town lasted perhaps 5 to 8 seconds.  In looked like it met up with another object of similar design and then both vanished into the night sky.  It was really strange and I am left completed numbed by the experience.", "Many lights on a hill moving around a bit.There were about 6 lights moving around on the hill, one of the witnesses cameras has all of the lights shown in an attached picture but my camera would only pic up one of the moving lights as seen in my attached video.", "Strange lights above Tacoma, Washinton.To whom it may concern:  I was just reviewing your site about sightings in Washington State.  I came across the report of the light in the sky above Tacoma, Washington and wanted to inform you that I saw the same light on numerous occasions about every night from August to November.  At first I wondered what it could be, my first thought was a UFO or some other type of object.  The object would sit in the sky for about 10 - 15 minutes and then disappear for about 10 minutes, but only to reappear.  It would only reappear in the same exact spot as it did before, as if it hadn&apos;t moved at all and was slowly flashing.  I called a couple of people and from the information that I have gathered, this light is not a UFO at all.  We have two military bases up in the Tacoma area who do nighttime exercises about 20 days out of the month.  The lights in the air were possibly flares that were calculated to be shot up into the same spot each time...they are like a delayed flare that gives dark areas bright light and just enough visibility during nighttime engagements for about 10 minutes and is a slow burning flare.  This could have possibly been what the other people have seen. I used to live on a hill in Tumwater, Washington where I could see the light quite well. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t live up there any longer and the place I live now is surrounded by trees so I cannot tell if the light is still visible on dark/clear nights.((NUFORC Note:  Possible aircraft lights, we wonder.  McChord AFB is nearby.  PD))", "moving stars in the early night7:10pm I was taking my son to the supermarket and as I always do I point up at the stars to him like planet Mars and Jupiter. I am an avid sky watcher so I know quite a bit about the night sky. I reguarly read Astronomy magazine and know what I am looking at and what to look for more than most.clear night with nothing blocking a nice view of the stars and planets and satalites above. I know a satalite when I see one as the spin and reflect the light of the sun as they go accross the sky. I know the space station as I point it out to my son early morning. This is what my wife, my son and I saw: As I was pointing out  the most visible of objects in the night sky like Mars we focused all of our attention on Mars it is clear as can be also very bright and red.  It was not moving at all as planets only can move as fast as the earth can spin.  Mars is what we really knew we were looking at.  Until it began to move in an od fassion from above to the North first slow almost un-noticable then abruptly it began an Easterly path for about 15 seconds slowly then rapidly began a southerly path before moving West then East again. This is od very od planets, stars, satalites and Earthly airborn objects do not as we know yet move in this fassion yet.  The altitude of tje object apeared to be high so high it was mistaken orriginaly for Mars.  We all know Mars doesnt move from a stationary position above head directly to the North, East, South then West then East again.  The movement from each direction was abrupt and smooth with a clear scense of thought behind each action.  Nothing in nature can cause stars to move like this, planets or even satalite to move like this.  Again the motion was stationary directly overhead 30 seconds for argument sake then slow movement to the North 15 seconds then to the East abruptly 15 seconds then to the South abeuptly for 15 seconds then to the West abruptly foe 15 seconds then to the East again abruptly for 1 minute. This one minute East path was the final direction of the object after that 1 minute East the object began to speed up first slowly picked up speed then faster and then faster then even faster appearing to move East and get higher in altitude until disapearing before our eyes not over the horizon but up up and out of sight.  No clouds to hide behind no other thing up in the sky to mistake it for. This is what I saw my wife saw and my son who is very young saw.  But my wife and I are skepticle about UFO&apos;s due to the great distances needed to traverse in space-time.  This leads me to believe that what we saw was extraterestrial in its nature. Since then I have kept my head up and looking and again the very next evening at 8:45 I looked at my watch first then to the sky and saw a simmilar object, this time same type of object as far as brightness and size was moving north for 30-40 seconds before moving West then speeding off West and increasing altitude and disapearing into the clear night.  Again the following night I look upward at around 9:15 and see a much brighter object as seen the two previous evenings.  This object was 10 times the luminosity also same type of motion just brighter. Exactly the 3rd sighting goes like this I come home park the car and exit the vehicle.  I look up to admire the stars and I see clear as day a bright planet but this night it apears to have the luminosity of ten versus the previous two evenings this 3rd time the motion from up above to the north increasing altitude until disapearing.  Note none of the sightings did the objects disapear over the horizon rather disapeared into a higher altitude vanishing.  No sound ever.  And again I am an avid sky watcher and know what I am looking at and what for. This is what leads my skepticle mind to believe what I have been seing for three nights to be a clear ET Event. I do think again if I look up I will see again soething that others with fancy equipment could video tape and verify. I am an educated sky watcher and a skeptic due to the fantastic distances.  Make note of what I have seen please as the next person to see what I&apos;ve seem won&apos;t think they are crazy.thank you kindly.S", "Thought it was a shooting star but it kept getting larger then stopped and disappearedLast night I was driving through New Mexico and I was on highway 40 heading west at approximately the 93 mile marker, it was between 405 and 410am central time so I don&apos;t know if they were an hour or two hours behind us time wise.Anyway, I seen what I thought was a shooting star so at first it was like cool, then I watched it thinking what should I wish for and realized it kept getting bigger the closer it got and thought that&apos;s strange.  Then I stared at it and noticed that it was greenish and had a red trail behind it then it just stopped and now was green with a red trail but it was not shaped like a star... it kinda looked like a visor on top then a straight line to a diamond shape middle with a straight line below it then IT JUST DISAPPEARED.  Seriously, it was falling like a shooting star at first then just stopped in mid air for a couple of seconds and that was it, lights out... it was gone and the sky was dark again.I&apos;m not saying it was a flying saucer or anything but I do know it was not a shooting star ... don&apos;t know what it was but I definately say something.", "Small White Object Flies Over Golden Gate Park in Slight Wave MotionWhile playing tennis in Golden Gate Park, I saw a small white object approaching from the East and heading to the South.  I pointed it out to my three companions and then took some photos of it.  Players on another court noticed it too.  It moved in a slight wave motion, side to side, but always forward.  It moved quickly across the sky in a matter of minutes.", "Aircraft following a possible UFO?First of all, Im not sure what we saw that night but it had everyone thinking. The four of us were boating down the river doing some fishing when I noticed something moving in the sky around the Little Dipper.  It was circular and a bright white color moving from left to right.  As I was looking at this object the other people in the boat noticed it too and one of them made the comment that it was just a plane but it was moving too fast, and there were no other lights, just a solid white light. The next conclusion was that it could have been a satelite which it could have been, but the speed and the amount of area that it covered as it moved across the sky was amazing. In about a minute or so this object appeared at my far left and streaked across the sky to my far right before we lost it over the mountain. I was in the military and have seen and been around planes, jets, helo&apos;s and I&apos;ve never seen something move this fast, I was astonished. Maybe twenty to thirty seconds after we lost sight of this object, my friend pointed out a group of aircraft behind us. They were in fairly perfect formation with the same lights with a differant aircraft behind them (I say diff. because the lights were diff. on this one) and were moving in the direction of where we last saw the object before it went out of sight over the mountain. In all there were five aircraft, and all seemed to be tailing this object that we saw. We watched for another minute before they too moved across the mountain out of sight. This may not be a ufo sighting but it was too wierd not to report to someone. If anyone else had the same sighting that night, hopefully they report it so that we can find out what it was or wasn&apos;t.", "Saw bright orange lights that went on and off, and also seemed to split into more lights.We saw 8 lights up in the western sky in a formation. The lights seemed to split into two lights, then went off. After the bright lights went off, there was what seemed to be sparkling in the sky. When we could see the lights, they went back and forth", "White Sphere darts from in front of the moon towards Test Site with possible electronic effects.While on the job (which requires both witnesses to be outside for several hours) at approximately 19:55 PM, I noticed at a medium altitude a strange pulsing red &quot;dart&quot; (I&apos;ve seen plenty of F-15s, F-18s, even B-1B Spirits while on the job due to the job&apos;s location under an Air Force flight path, and this seemed like a military airplane with its lights on) fly at an abnormal (faster than Air Force aircraft normally fly in the area) and leave a strange fog behind it (looked like a vapor trail but was highly visible against a dark sky), and I point this out to the coworker next to me. He sees it, and we talk for a moment about it, then he turns, yells and points to the moon, upon which I see a white dot of light accelerate from in front of moon north towards the Nevada Test Site.  After traveling several degrees in the vision in just a second or so, it had accelerated to the point it was no longer visible.After this I began marking times using a function on my watch, and at 8:06 I noticed another one of the red darts. During the next hour the sky around our job is filled with air planes and helicopters deviating from the normal flight path into North Las Vegas Airport to circle around the area.When I leave the job for home at around 22:30, I check to see if my laptop (which I don&apos;t normally leave in there) was okay, at which point I find the backpack and the laptop to be both hot to the touch (I&apos;ve never had this problem before), with the laptop already fully powered on. The laptop has only an effective battery life of 70 minutes, and was not at full capacity the last time I used it, which was around 18:00.  Out of curiosity, I touch the back of my hand to the car stereo, and it is also hot to the touch.This is not the first time I&apos;ve seen &quot;white spheres&quot; or dots over this part of the city. In fact, this is the third time in less than a year, but the first time I reported the incidents.", "I was looking out my sliding glass door, through the screen, at what appeared to be almost a Christmas card photograph; two trees and a star between them on a slope on top of the ridge.  I remarked to my friend that the scene looked like a card, and he looked and saw what I saw.  Then I turned away for a second, looked out the door again, and saw the &quot;star&quot; move above the slope and over the ridge.My friend and I saw it once, and then it was gone!((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

There was no sound and it was proceeding across the sky at an extremely high rate of speed. From the time we noticed the object until the time it had passed was approximately 3 minutes. We noticed that there was no pulsing light and no sound. This was a solid object that did not change in color. I had to point it out as it appeared as a star. My friends and I after pointing out the object were awwwwd. We could not explain what it was and it was moving extremely fast over the sky. At the time we had noted commercial aircraft in the sky but this object seemed 5x further away and had no flashing lights. The speed of the commercial planes was not even close to what this object was moving. I know what planes look like at high elevations and this was nothing close. For something like this to catch my eye and make my company look in aww I figured I would report it.", "Large, colorful disk shaped ufo over Addison.I woke up between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. due to a strange pulsating feeling that I had. I then went to the kitchen and drank a glass of water, hoping to shake the feeling and go back to bed. For whatever reason I decided to step out of the side door on the southern side of my home and saw a large disk shaped object in the hovering over a cow pasture in the southeast direction from my position. I estimated it to be about fifty yards across, and hovering about 150 yards above the ground. It had several large lights in a ring formation around the bottom of the craft that were glowing with an intensity that I liken to a very high powered hps light bulb. The colors of the lights are what astounded me though, they were extremely rich and saturated looking and were displaying changing colors that I can&apos;t even begin to describe. The craft itself didn&apos;t really make any sounds, it just had a strange pulse that it seemed to give off. Almost as soon as it had started, the craft shot up at about a 45 degree angle and cut back to my left before disappearing into the darkness. I&apos;ve always been skeptical about the whole ufo thing, and honestly, had I been asked yesterday afternoon if I thought such a thing really existed I probably would have been unsure, leaning more towards no.", "A bluish/green sphere dropped out of the sky and was observed at two different locations 65 miles apart.On Feb. 21 @ 20:39 (CST) I observed a bluish/green sphere shaped object dropping out of the evening sky.

It disappeared into the trees approximately 10 degrees above the horizon.  At the point it disappeared into the horizon the object was 15 degrees East of South.I mentioned this occurrence to an acquaintance who lives in Grand Rapids, Minnesota the next day and he and his wife observed the same event.

The lights were white in color, they werent very bright at all, something that would easily be missed by someone not looking directly at the sky as I was, I was outside smoking and tend to stargaze which I believe is the only way anyone could have seen it.

It was approaching from the east traveling at a high rate of speed and was even leaving a bright trail as it went by. There was a low cloud cover that night and it was just below the clouds. I told my girlfriend to look and she saw it as well. When it got about even with my car it took an immediate 90deg turn to the north when and up into the clouds.

I noticed yellow and green lights rotating around the craft with a large yellow light on top of the large triangular strut. It hovered COMPLETELY noiseless for about 10 minutes, then me and my family witnessed 3 or 4 smaller crafts come out of the bottom and fly away. The speeds of these crafts were humanly impossible! The smaller crafts were pulsating green lights. After about another 8 minutes we all witnessed the smaller crafts re-enter the large one. It continued to hover for a couple of minutes then it just disappeared right before our eyes! I just want to let everyone know that this is NO HOAX!

We were laughing and singing along with the radio. I looked up into the sky and I saw a strange orange light. I felt almost hypnotized by it, then it disappeared. Immediately I told myself that it was only a glare from a passing vehicle.As I was turning to ask my girlfriend if she saw anything. She was actually turning to ask me the same thing. so was a loud, simultaneous, &quot;Did you see that!!?&quot;  Now skeptical, but still thinking logical, I assumed it was a cloud passing over a bright star. Or even a planet. That&apos;s when I looked and about 3/4 mile northwest of the initial observation. I saw another one and then another right next to it. Each time one appeared... one disappeared in a timed sequence, and in a perfect, counter clockwise circular motion. Like a domino effect. Now intrigued, I frantically rolled down my window despite the cold winter air. Just when I thought it was gone another sequence would appear. Each time it appeared to multiply or pulsate, and always in a perfect sequence. There were never more than three lights in each one. I saw a total of three individual sequences on the way home, (like a 5 minute time period).When we got back to the house my girlfriend was trying to convince me that it was probably a helicopter or something. It wasn&rsquo;t.So now we&apos;re standing in the driveway waiting on these things to show up again. It didn&rsquo;t take long for them to appear. This time there are 2 sequences in the sky at once about a mile apart from each other, (she no longer thinks its a helicopter), and we can barely see super small twinkling lights in between each pulse. I also noticed that there were suddenly several of the small twinkling lights all over the western sky, moving in random directions. some fast some slow. some times disappearing/appearing. I noticed a low distant rumbling during the sequences. Like an engine, or explosion, or breaking barrier. Every dog in the neighborhood was barking. Just as fast as the show started, it ended.I personally cant think of a logical explanation. Fireworks? In the winter, with no sound, and in 2 different parts of the western sky... doubt it. Maybe a flare? Why? and how so timed in 2 different areas? Could be a hoax... but someone would have to have a lot of time on there hands because I did some research on this today. I discovered several, damn near, to the &quot;T&quot;, same observation as me. not only that, they were in different years and in different locations.

It was a glow.It stood out to me because of the quality of light and the unusual color.As I watched it, it moved slightly in a very minimal southerly direction. The it stopped, and after a couple of seconds it did something that truly took my breath.It dropped, straight down, in a dead fall, at quite a fast speed.Of course, it was so high up that it never did have a great deal of detail in its appearance, remaining a glowing blue medium star size object...but it dropped from about 80 degrees up, to approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.And then it stopped...sat seemingly motionless for a few seconds at that 30 degree level...then took off at an incredible speed, heading due north.The whole event lasted approximately 30 seconds or so.", "Soundless Hovering Crafts in Arlington Heights ILI live about 10 miles from O&rsquo;Hare International airport (Arlington Heights IL) and I see thousands of airplanes taking off and landing daily.  This flying craft was sitting in a fixed position in the sky over my friend&rsquo;s neighborhood for about 1-2 minutes and then started to slowly hover farther away.  My friend and I followed the craft for as long as we could then lost it in sight.  I dropped my friend off (he lived very close by to where we saw this) and then I started to drive home.  All of sudden I saw the flying craft again but it was about &frac14; mile away from when we first saw it.  I drove as fast as I could through the neighborhood to try and get closer look.  Finally I was driving directly below the flying craft.  This craft looked nothing like a typical plane for this area.  It looked like there were multiple cigar shaped tubes all connected to one main base.  It had different sets of lights that were blinking in a order.  When I was driving directly below this slow moving craft there was almost ZERO sound coming from it.  Most airplanes around here even 5-10,000 feet you can still hear taking off and landing from far distances.  This Craft was also able to fly straight upwards and take off very fast then it would slow down and go lower.   After I lost the sighting of the first craft I started on my way home where I saw 3 other crafts (same designs) hovering slowly over 2 miles of neighborhoods that I drove through to get home.     I&rsquo; am not surprised at all by this, but at the same time would like to know why soundless aircrafts are being flown very low around my neighborhood when there is a airport so close.", "what i saw had no tail    it was a blue light  it went across the sky then fell to earth.it was blue light round it went across sky then fell to earth it was night time((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Very nice indeed with great air quality that night.I was on duty and doing guard. The premises are outdoors and are guarded by guard and dogs in strategic positioning.While outside and on top of the small roof overlooking the night and starry sky. I distinctly recall the perfect night and how the stars were out. Then as i positioned to my left and towards lower manhattan side i noticed what seemed to be a shooting star. It was bright and streaking with a blue red into the atmosphere. I was amazed first as i thought it a rare chance to see a shooting star. But as i expected it to fizzle out. It only went distant and stopped seemingly pulsating. I was thinking this is odd. Then the pulsing had in a flash moved east as if by a enormous speed and in a  seeming instant. I was now really getting a bit curious and also uncertain what i was expecting. Then i noticed another pulsing closer and i was now sure this was more than odd. Within a flash i looked up and there directly by some amazing unexplained way i was seeing this enormous craft that was very sophisticated and truly unimaginable. The outer side was running a thousand patterns of seemingly colored lights in some sort of sequence. Yet somehow i looked towards the center directly above me and saw movement as if something was being done within the opening as it seemed to turn. But i didn&apos;t know what it was doing.Yet i also knew that if i could see this craft here in a borough of ny city then this may have a cloaking ability or some type of force to disguise or hide itself if necessary for its own advantages.I knew that in a instant just by its presence. That i was just nervous and almost wishing for what happened when it just ascended into the upper heights directly above then did the zipping movement into the distance where i saw a pulsation again and then it zipped out. This i almost never share due to its circumstance and the nature of our being on earth. But i feel this event had shown me there are real di! mensions to other realms of being and a extreme degree of sophistication and who knows what else around .

He said there were strange lights outside and that they had been moving around the northern end of the valley from east to west.I went outside while still on the phone with my nephew and he said look to the WNW and we both saw one large lone reddish-blue silver light glistening in the WNW Sky. It appeared to be 3-5 miles away, however I am not certain. He said he and his father had been observing for longer and said more would appear, that they had been visible and then not, just then one light appeared and then several seconds later another appeared then several seconds later a third light appeared. These three lights were in a near perfect triangle, not an isosceles but flatter with approximate 45-degree angles.They remained that way for maybe 30 seconds with all four lights glistening the same sharp reddish-blue silver light. The fourth light appeared closer because of its brightness also it was positioned higher and to the left of the triangular formation of lights. The lights appeared to hover and move very slowly to the left, keeping their same distance from me. The lights forming the triangle then vanished into the westward sky and left the remaining fourth light that slowly drifted to the left and west over the horizon of mountains. No sound was ever heard form these lights.Ten minutes later a large plane came from the ESE and crossed directly over and directly in line with the west ward direction of the lights until out of sight. This plane had a deep roar of motors had no normal colored airline lights, but several large yellowish orange lights marking its body. Not sure if plane was in support of the light formation or in search or niether.Do not know if lights were military training or just what they were.

I was getting up myself to see what was going on when I saw my son looking out the door towards where the dog was looking.  At that point he said, &quot;What is that?&quot;  My second son and I went to the front door and looked out and hovering above several of our neighbors houses and very close to the trees was a huge object and we were staring directly at it!  At first our eyes were directed to 2 red non blinking lights that were opposite of each other and when our eyes started focusing in the dark a little better we could see that there was a very dark (almost matching the night sky dark)cylindar looking object that these lights were a part.  This gave it a cigar looking appearance and as each end looked like burning embers of red &amp; it made no sound whatsover.  My son who first spotted it was scared and ran back into the house.

Through the tree line behind our home and slightly above the horizon, I noticed flashing lights, like that of an airplane; only these appeared to be brighter even though there was an obvious distance between myself and the object.  They were brighter and more colorful than the simple red green flashing of a plane&rsquo;s wingtips.  More colorful, meaning that it APPEARED to me that there was a blue and white flash along with the red and green.

I asked her if she wanted to see a UFO and to come quick.  She ran out, I pointed out the object to her and she also witnessed the object.

I had to move around a couple of steps to keep in into view; there was also a distant tree on a little hill that I was looking at the object through.  She asked me could it be a helicopter distantly overhead, and I said that I was pretty sure that it wasn&rsquo;t.  I have some dealing with helo&rsquo;s in the past and I am sure that isn&rsquo;t what it was.  After moving around in the sky for a couple of minutes, the lights just turned off.

I kept walking in the direction of the lights toward the field and stopped at the field to let the dogs do their business while I watched. I had assumed that they were helicopters looking for one of our neighbors who have had a shady past; however, I saw that there were no beams of light coming from the craft as a spotlight would. They were simply bright, a whitish yellow light like that of a typical household bulb. As I watched the craft appeared to be at about the same altitude, but about .5-1 mile away from each other, making the distant one appear lower in the sky. They were motionless in the air, simply hovering. While watching I noticed that each craft had two strobes that alternated. One red and one white. These lights blinked in unison to each other although on separate craft. The crafts then dimmed simultaneously, although the strobes continued to blink, still in harmony. The craft then traveled off in the same direction parallel to each other, still at the same altitude. I could not hear any noise, and am very accustomed to seeing and hearing helicopters in the area. Although I cannot judge exactly how far the closest craft was, I would estimate approximately 1/4 mile. The crafts continued in their path until they were out of sight behind a forest that was closer to me and obstructing the view. Again, I could detect no sound and it was a clear quite night at about 55 degrees F. This occurred between Lyons Mill Rd and Eldersburg MD just on the SW side of Liberty RD.

I was around 10 give or take 2 years when my friends and I were walking down the B and O railroad tracks behind my house.  We entered the town of West Wyoming and as we past our favorite and Only outside movie screen.  We got near some field by the tracks and saw a burnt area.  So my 3 friends and I went and checked it out.  When we approached the area it looked like a perfect circle with a circumference around 25 feet !!  As we searched the circle the grass and weed structures were bent in perfect harmony.  I did not remember if there was a smell.  We were intrigued when a police cruiser came to the spot and told us we would have to leave so as we were just fooling around in the field we left.

I was with a friend named ((name deleted)) down Wyoming avenue  in Kingston at twilight near Cook&apos;s Pharmacy when we noticed 3 bright lights in a triangle about 500 yards in the sky.  The lights took a slight left turn and headed toward the river,  So we followed.  We could see the lights and when we reached the river near the cross valley extension they turned north up the river descended and went toward the river itself and whoosh ....the 3 bright lights disappeared near the  river.

There is a patch of hill than a stone patio next to dock we have permission to fish from.  we decided to setup on the patio.  As we fished you could see the street light across the way by the park.  So we fished and some time later around a hour or two I noticed that the light didn&apos;t go out and seemed a little closer.  I thought nothing of it and fished some more.  Then I noticed it closer than BAM.......... I looked up in the sky and saw a Black object hoovering oh so slow above us moving toward our back.  It looked like no UFOs I saw in books and other source before.  The shape was like a small triangle in front with another bigger triangle behind it. I have a attachment drawing it was all black.  AS I ran to the road that circumferences the lake the craft went slowly out of sight.  When I ran back to Steve he looked bewildered ,  I said;  hey man did you see that and he just keep fishing with a sort of nod. O asked him what time it was he said 10:30 am..

The green light was about the size of a dime coin if I was to hold it above me against the windshield, and did not get much smaller than that in overall size as it moved away from me.  There was no tail, no trailing smoke or anything one might associate with a meteorite.  It was not a solid ball of light; it had points of light, like a star in the sky.  It moved incredibly fast, in a straight line, it did not arc towards the earth; it remained elevated in the sky, and disappeared in the distance like a light going out.This was fascinating and beautiful to see.  It was incredibly fast, and from the distance that I estimate it traveled, I don&rsquo;t think we have anything publicly known that can travel that fast.

I was on the phone talking with her as she was coming outside to see it.  Before she got outside, however, the large bright light shot straight up into the sky and disappeared quickly.  As I was telling her what I had seen, military aircraft began flying overhead.  We counted eight airplanes in a row, flying low in a straight line, directly toward (ENE) where I had seen the bright light in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

PD))", "SILENT OBJECT OVER AMELIA, OHIO, 3/23/08  1:30 AM3/23/08 approx. 1:30 A.M.Amelia, Ohio  While on the back deck of a friend&rsquo;s house, saw an object moving slowly from the northwest to southeast at an altitude roughly between 125 and 250ft above the ground. It was not much higher than the tree line. I work in the defense industry, and I&rsquo;m an aircraft technician by trade, and consider myself very familiar with many different types of aircraft. However, this was something I&rsquo;ve never seen or heard about in the industry. This object came within about 100 yards from where I was standing, at roughly the earlier stated altitude of 125-250ft above the ground. This object had a very bright light at the bottom of it, which looked to be encased in a housing of some sort, because it gave off a slight lampshade affect directly above the light itself allowing me to see that it was attached to an object. The shape reminded me of  a canister, similar to an aluminum soda can, but again making out the object above the light was somewhat difficult because the light was so bright. I could see that above the main light there was no sort of lighting on the object. The main light itself was not bright white, but off white to a yellowish white. The light was very similar in color to a set of lights you might see over a highway or large parking lot, not quite bright white, but an off white. My best estimate was that this object was 4 to 6 feet in width and approximately 6 to 8 feet in height including the light.As this object approached just above the tree line from the northwest, it must have taken close to  15 seconds to reach its closest point to me, again roughly 100 yards from where I was standing. It looked to be moving very slowly under 20mph. As the object reached its closest point to me, I opened the back door, and instructed my friends to come look at the object. Four other people besides myself witnessed this from this time on. When the object was at it&rsquo;s closest, it appeared to stop for roughly 10 seconds, when I noticed a slight rocking motion from it. It looked like the craft stopping caused the rocking motion, which appeared to rock 1 or 2 feet in both directions. The object made no sound at all, during the complete time I witnessed it. After the object paused in place for roughly 10 seconds, it changed it&rsquo;s original direction towards the southeast, to the southwest. From this point it stayed in a straight line, moving slowly above the tree line, for another 20 seconds or so, when the light suddenly went out for 3 to 5 seconds, and suddenly reappeared for another few seconds then disappeared for good. After the object changed direction, although still moving slowly, did pickup some speed possibly 30 to 40mph until I last saw it.My impression of this sighting, was that it was very likely manmade, and reminded me of some sort of surveillance craft. It was not like anything I have witnessed or heard about in the industry, but did not do anything beyond current defense technology. I was however very surprised that it did not make ANY noise whatsoever.", "three changing color groups of lights hovering over rooftopsI was awakened this morning about 5:40 am here in west Houston by my 17 year old daughter who was up early for school. She was sitting eating breakfast and happened to notice a strange light out the back window. She said she watched it, got her sister (15), and witnessed three distinct groups of lights hovering over the rooftops in the distance. They said they could see a dark object in the center of one, but two were just hovering as changing colored lights (at different heights),  That&apos;s when they woke me. I ran outside to see and confirmed two of these objects. At an arms length I&apos;d say they were about the size of an aspirin or peanut.  Fairly large and distinct with 4 or 5 lights making up a cross or diamond shape.  The lights were pulsating and changing colors: red, green, blue, white, turquoise.  They were hovering at different heights above the rooftops of the next neighborhood.  One was very low, just barely over the rooftops, the other about twice the height of the homes below.I went in to get my astronomical telescope to see if I could zero in on it. While I was trying to sight it, the one I was watching reduced in size, turned orange and began to move to my right. I followed it around to the front of my house and watched it slowly move parallel to the ground just above the rooftops until it disappeared behind homes.The other light was gone when I looked back.My daughter tried to film it, but could not get it focused due to palm fronds interfering with autofocus. However, you can see the two objects and the colors that they were cycling through.We don&apos;t know, of course, what it was, but the two objects I saw were silent.About twenty minutes later I went back outside and saw an aircraft approaching from a different part of the horizon and could clearly hear that it was a helicopter.  So I use that in contrast to the silence of the first sighting. The night sky was clear, but moonless, so it was very dark.", "04/04/08 object sighted moving from west to east.approxmately 45min duration, arcing to the north while still moving twards east. This part is what struck me as strange the craft did a button hook and stoped abruptly as if someone or thing had parked it. Witnessed by longtime friend who veiwed the same object as I did.  Both of us will take a polygraph to confirm sighting is authentic. time was 9:15pm till 10:00pm. The small object was not a sattelite.", "Disappearing light over Fort MyersMy neighbor and I were talking out back and I looked up and saw a small white light moving very slowly across the sky, I told my neighbor to look at it. He noticed that there were no blinking lights on this object like a regular aircraft. The night is crystal clear and other planes lights were as clear as day. After watching it for about 1 minute it slowly faded away to nothing. Like I said before there were no clouds in the sky, and there were other aircraft in the sky in and around the same area, and were completely visible. Not quite sure what it was but I have never seen anything like it before.", "Light moving over SeviervilleI was sitting on the front porch it was almost dark. I was in Dandridge TN, I live on top of a ridge facing the great Smoky Mountains. I can see 5 counties from my porch. I sit out their every evening and watch the sun set but I have never seen anything like this before. I watched bright light move across the sky. It was over the area of Muddy Creek, north East of Sevierville. The light, which was not blinking, was moving very slowly across the sky, using the Mountains as a reference the light was only a couple of hundred feet off the ground. Our mountains are only 6,000+ feet tall and it was at the base level. When it neared Sevierville the light dimmed and I lost it. this took about five minutes and the distance between when I first saw the light to when it dimmed and I lost it was about 7-8 miles and lasted 5 minutes. About 30 minutes latter I saw it again and it moved from Sevierville back the way it came to muddy creek, going to same speed and at the same elevation. It went back another 6-7 miles then I saw it land. I was able to see the light through the trees as it went behind the ridge. I didn&rsquo;t see anything else that night. We have a lot of helicopters in the area, I have seen these and this was not helicopter, it was traveling too slow. We have an airport but an airplane cant land like that. Besides it is a very small airport. As far as a helicopter landing, no one with that much money lives in Muddy Creek. I have never seen anything like this before, I watch the evening sky every night, and I can see 5 counties but I have never seen anything like this.", "two egg shaped floating objects that looked like oustrige eggs, grey in color aluminated and had a jet of fire out the back.At midnight we heard a strange sound wile camping so we went to it and we went to it.

Multiple close encounters.2006 UFO Sighting in Gallatin County Montana Multiple unexplainable sightings through the night.August 29, 2006. Bozeman Montana.Skies, Clear, Cloudless Night. Temperature 40 degrees.I was camping, with sleeping bag only, behind a burm in a grass-less construction lot.  It was about a quarter mile square.  Mall to the south, treeline to the north, townhouses to the east and the highway to the west.  I was told later that there is a military base of some kind near this location.12:30 AM While camping out in an empty dirt lot behind Bob Wards Sporting Goods noticed what thought was a plane or planet (too low to be a star), blue-white. It began blinking/flashing noticed several other blinking/flashing objects low in the night sky as well. There is an airport in Bozeman so figured it was a few airplanes, but kept looking anyway. This went on for some time, I&apos;m guessing 15 minutes.12:45 AM Suddenly one of these &quot;planes&quot; began to move through sky at will, whimsically even--gaining losing elevation, making impossibly sharp turns. The flashing became frenetic. Then other two flashing objects began moving similarly. They behaved like this for about 30 minutes. They disappeared searched sky but they were nowhere to be found  2:15 AM After an hour searching sky my heart slowed down and I decided to turn over go to sleep. 3 &quot;meteors&quot; streaked from sky (west to east) to the ground behind some new townhouses, one-at-a-time in short intervals. &quot;Okay,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;I&apos;m awake again.&quot; I kept watching the townhouses. In a few minutes I noticed movement around the townhouses and 20 feet above townhouses, two unrecognizable shapes (because they were dark against a night blue sky) moving silently in a circular fashion. Gradually they began to emit light began to see them clearly. My neck hair was standing on end.2:25 AM They were two, sometimes three playfully eminating, green, misty, dancing globes above aforementioned townhouses almost cracked a smile watched dancing lights until they stopped, just before sunrise.*That was it for that night.***  I camped here for the next couple days. I saw the dancing lights above the town houses every night. Then on the last night I was to camp here, I was watching the dancing lights and suddenly a room in townhouse was brightly illuminated for a fraction a second, as if someone had a flash light (stark, cold blue-white light), then another, in sequence--as if someone was going room-to-room. But quicker than a human could run to each room. I wondered if there was anyone living there and hoped they were alright. There were cars parked out front, but no sign of human activity. I wondered if this was some kind of signal. I was afraid.3:00 AM It took me a while to calm down but, I turned over, my back to the townhouses and tried to sleep. I looked out toward the treeline. Trees relax me. That&apos;s when a red light amidst the trees turned on at ground level. I figured it was the brake lights of a car. The light slowly and silently rose 15 feet into the air paused and began moving toward the highway, dispelling that thought. &quot;Okay, it&apos;s a helicopter far away, it&apos;s just further away than I think it is&quot; I told myself. I kept listening for rotor wash. I heard none and under close observation I could tell it was in the stand of trees and I knew there couldn&apos;t be a helipad behind a landscaping company. By this red light reached the edge of the stand of trees. I was on my feet, putting my shoes on, I was really scared and wasn&apos;t sticking around for this, but I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off of it.3:10 AM It hovered there momentarily. Then a white light seemed to turn on, but I realized that this object had simply begun to rotate. It kept rotating slowly and began a slow pass of the field along the highway edge. I knew it was a triangle now because I could see it&apos;s bottom now. It had 3 lights, 2 white-ish and one red. Before I could collect my things it was directly over my head not more than 20 feet in the air. I could see it&apos;s shape clearly now; only because it blacked out the stars as it went. It was a triangle with rounded corners. About 20 feet on a side. It did not stop as I recall. Slowly spinning and swinging it&apos;s course around me, as if to say hello then off in the direction of the town houses. As it passed I noticed a low-rumbling sound, like a muffled V-8 at idle.3:12 AM That&apos;s when I ran. I ran as hard as I could with 60 pounds on my back in the opposite direction and hitch hiked out of there.If anyone has information on this or has seen anything like it PLEASE contact me ASAP! Thank you.", "very large elongated disc-shape with flashing red/green lights. hovering, made no sound, saw for 20 minutes.I was outside with my dog on 4-30-08 at 9p.m., when I turned the corner outside my house and noticed a VERY LARGE craft hovering a few hundred ft. over the high school athletic field adjacent to my house.  It was silent, it did not make any sound whatsoever.  It was a very large, elongated disc-shape, with flashing red and green lights all over it.  The body of it seemed to glow from within ever so slightly.  I watched it hover for approx. 10 mins, after which time I came into the house and called the police non-emerg. number, to ask if anyone had reported seeing such a thing.  The officer asked &quot;do you mean over Madison school?&quot;  I replied no, over Trumbull High and Hillcrest schools.  Evidently, someone had seen something earlier over Madison School.  The officer asked me if it looked like it was trying to land, and I said no, it was just hovering. I also called 2 family members who live in other parts of towm to see if they could see anything, none of whom did.I went back outside to continue viewing, and the object was still there, hovering and occassionally ascending and descending slightly, as well as turning slowly from side-to-side.  I went in to call a neighbor, and both of them called me back saying that they also saw it.I went back outside and continued to watch it, I watched it for about 20 minutes overall.  It then started to descend more, wavering somewhat from side-to-side as it came down.  It got to the treetop level over in the direction of the Vocational Agricultural School, and I ran back into the house to phone the police to tell them it seemed to be coming down, and when I ran back outside it was gone from sight.I phoned the police this morning, to ask if they had determined what it was, and they said that no, they did not, but they filed an official police report, based on what they saw.  Evidently, some police personnel had also seen it.", "red ball of light with orange tail then vanshedHeading east bound on interstate 595 saw a ball of light with a orange tail behind it watched it for a minute or two before the orange light went away and it became a red ball of light.

It was about 5,000 feet in the air and really bright The red ball of light stayed with our car as we were watching it to our east.

They streamed across the sky from the southwest to the northeast, at a very high rate of speed. I thought that they might have been meteors or space junk, but they were so hard to see. If I wasn&rsquo;t watching an airplane fly over I would have never noticed them. I only saw them for about 5 to 8 seconds.", "Sighted two bright objects which moved and suddenly became motionlessI am a 21 year old male, and have lived in Hot Springs since I was born.  I have always loved the outdoors, and have been fascianted with the skies for as long as I can remember. I was not intoxicated on this night, nor was I feeling particularly emotional or tired. Facing west on ravenwood place, I see an object moving to the south which glowed with a hazy red light, moving quickly on what appeared to be a western bearing, and getting closer to the earth very slowly.  At this time the object appeared to be extremely far away.  My first instinct told me it was a comet or something similar, based mostly on the fact that it seemed to be too far away to be in the atmosphere.  It also appeared to have fiery red tail at this time, although what I saw as a tail may have just been my eyes blurring the image trying to maintain focus as it moved. Within a minute or so of seeing the red object to the south, I see what first appears to be a very bright star, with a bluish white color, directly to the west of me.  When I noticed that the light from the bluish white object appeared to be flickering slightly, I moved to a place in the road where neither of the objects would be obscured by trees.  After getting a clear perspective, I saw that the bluish white object was still flickering slightly, and was moving slowly to the south, then began to slowly bobb back and forth (south to north) as well as up and down, and I turned my attention back to the red object, which was now to the southwest of me. Now able to see both objects simultaneously from the aforementioned perspective, they both seem to be much closer than they had when I was looking at them separately.  When viewed seperately they appeared to be at least two hundred miles away, if not much farther.  When I had them in a single visual frame, they appeared to be be between 50 and 100 miles away. After the red object reaches the point to the southwest of me, it appears to begin moving north, which makes me think it may have been making a wide clockwise circle, starting from the south, and ending in the west, almost directly above the bluish white object. With both objects to the west of me, the bluish white object appears to be maybe 5 - 20 miles high, with the red object about 10 - 40 miles above it, and they still seem to be 50 - 100 miles away from me.  After coming almost directly above the bluish white object, the red object starts descending towards the bluish white object, without pausing or altering it&apos;s speed.  The bluish white object then appeared to ascend up towards the red object, although much slower than the red object descended  I would have dismissed the bluish white object as a plane or helicopter after seeing it move, but it seemed to be much too high for a helicopter, and seemed to be moving far too slowly to be a non-harrier airplane.  After coming to the realization that these two objects were not inanimate, and were moving towards one another, my vision began to shake slightly as I strained to comprehend what I was seeing. When the red object seemed to be no more than 5 - 10 miles above the bluish white object, both objects stopped moving suddenly and quite simultaneously. At this time I became completly amazed at what I was seeing.  Both of the objects were staying far too still to just be moving directly towards or away from me.  As astonished as I was by then I really can&apos;t remember how long both objects stayed perfectly still, but it was at least 30 seconds, if not 4 or 5 minutes.  I was outside maybe 5 - 10 minutes total during the aforementioned sightings, and when I went back inside I believe the objects were still motionless in the same positions. I came back outside about 30 - 50 minutes later, and the objects appeared to be in about the same place, and shortly thereafter the red object started ascending away from the bluish white object.  After reaching its original altitude if not a higher one, it started moving to the east, being almost direcltly over me at one point, but still about 10 miles to the north of me.  It was moving extremely fast, and I heard a &quot;sonic boom&quot; about 20 seconds behind it.  When it passed above me it seemed to be at an altitude of 5 - 10 miles.  With the red object much closer than it had previously been, I could tell that it had 2 red lights opposite one another, which did not flash or flicker.  There was a yellow light directly in between the two red lights that was flashing on and off, every second or so. There was a second yellow light directly in front of the first, which did not flash or flicker.  I couldn&apos;t see anything of the craft except for the lights, which appeared to be (based on a normal airplane frame) posiitoned on the wings (red lights), one on or near the underside of the nose (steady yellow light) and on the underside of the craft directly in between the wings. I then turned my attention back to the bluish white object, which now appeared to be moving north again, to where I first saw it.  The bluish white object stayed in the same area flickering, and I went inside after watching the bluish white object stay in the same place for a few minutes, and noted that the red object still seemed to be moving very quickly in an easterly direction. I went back inside at approximately 10:30 pm (cst) and didn&apos;t go back outside that night. My overall feelings from the event are that the red object may very well have been a  military aircraft, as the pattern of lights was fairly normal, and the sound of the sonic boom seemed similar to other sonic booms I&apos;ve heard that weren&apos;t associated with an unusual sighting.  I don&apos;t know much about aircraft, but if the red object was a man made craft, it had to be some type of harrier, as it definitely stayed perfectly still for no less than 30 seconds, at an altitude of no less than 30,000 feet. Since I didn&apos;t get as close of a look at the bluish white object, I really can&apos;t speculate as to what it was, but it stayed in the same area, moving no more than 35 degrees from a given perspective.", "Red light, from 0 to ? in seconds. Over Panama City Beach, FloridaMy wife and I were going to Carabba&apos;s to eat dinner, traveling West we saw a red oval shaped object just kind of sitting there in the sky. I thought it might be a planet or something the way it just sat there. It was the coolest thing I can remember ever seeing, because like a bolt of lightening it took off sideways then straight up. I&apos;ve seen jets kick their afterburners in before but this was nothing like that, the speed that this moved from sitting still gives me chills today. Even the new planes that they have at Tyndall AFB would not be able to touch this, it would be like trying to catch a Porche on a Tricycle.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The time and date is memorable because it was my birthday and my wife and I were visiting New Orleans to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and my 65th birthday.The light that I observed was unusual because it proceeded across the night sky at a remarkable speed&hellip;taking less than a few seconds to pass overhead and disappear in the night glare of downtown New Orleans.  By comparison, moments after the light disappeared, a commercial airliner moved across the sky at a snail&rsquo;s pace.The size of the light was comparable to lights one might see on an airplane, not particularly bright but not flashing or changing in color.  If at the altitude of normal air traffic, the light would have been moving much faster than the speed of sound.  If at a lower altitude, one would have expected a horrendous noise (as from jet fighter plane) but no sound was heard.The light was definitely not a meteor or a satellite.  A meteor would not have moved that slowly and a satellite would not have moved that rapidly.  No sparks, contrail, or trailing illumination was observed.I have watched the night sky all my life and never witnessed anything similar to this rapidly moving light.", "Questionable AbductionHello.I want to report something which happened to me many years ago.  The problem with this is that I am not honestly sure that I did not dream these events.  When I was going into 6th grade, which would have been the summer of 1959 I had an event happen that happened at night and I was supposed to be in bed sleeping.  At this time we lived on a farm with our house surrounded by thick woods.  Our closest neighbors lived about a quarter mile down the road on the other side of the road.I recall being in a compartment or room and there was an adult male there with me.  I believe that he was about 25 to 30 years of age.  He just sat there on the bench which was attached to the wall with his head down, his legs spread slightly and leaning over with his elbows resting on his knees not moving nor talking at all.  I recall looking around wondering what I was doing there since I was supposed to be in bed sleeping.  My bed was in the basement of our home and I shared the room with my two younger brothers with my younger sister sleeping in the next room.  I stood up and walked around the compartment and thought it was strange since I was supposed to be home sleeping but I found myself in this compartment.  Three walls appeared to be made of a metal and the other wall had a very large window in the upper half which covered about half the length of the compartment in which we were.   The door into the compartment was between the window and the bench also under the window the bench continued on the other side of the door, I think anyway.  The bench which I had been sitting on and which the man still was sitting on was attached to the wall with the window in it.The window looked out into a passage way and was slanted outward.  I was just a little afraid at that time and was looking at the window wondering why I was there and most of all wondering where &quot;here&quot; was since I had no memory of going to this place or even leaving my bed.  I was watching the window when this being walked by.  It was taller than I was at the time.  It was NOT the grey or whatever people normally think of as being involved with UFO&rsquo;s.  This thing more resembled a &quot;woki&quot; as pictured in the star-wars movie.  This thing was not wearing any clothes or have any type of equipment on it that I recall seeing. I seemed to remember that the color of the hair or fur was a dark brown.  I remember then I became very afraid and was scared that that thing would come into the compartment in which I was located along with the man.  I yelled and screamed and ran and jumped onto the window, using of course the bench under the window.  I kept yelling and clawing at the window while laying against it deathly afraid that thing would come into the compartment.  I was totally amazed that all throughout this incident the man in the compartment did not even raise his head or show any interest in anything happening.I recall nothing more and later in the night I woke in my bed, raised up and looked around then lay back down and tried to go back to sleep which I did.  To this day I am not sure this really happened.  I have told my wife about this &quot;incident&quot; several times but I never had the nerve to tell anyone else.I should tell you now that I WILL NOT submit to anyone trying to hypnotizing me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Bright light to tiny red light to nothing.My boyfriend and I were driving back to my house (cutting through the neighborhood) when we both noticed a bright light in the sky. It was around 11:05 PM with a clear sky. When we noticed the light, we stopped for a second to look at it, thinking that it was coming from a plane.  After a few seconds, the light started to fade away, almost as if it were moving back. The big bright light dimmed into a tiny red light, then within seconds, it completely disappeared. We drove out of the neighborhood to get onto the main rood (which had a better view) to see if we noticed any thing out of the norm.  There was absolutely nothing in the sky but a few stars in the distance.", "Many odd behaving lights hover above trees, then rise in the sky, moving strangly and not making noises.On the 5th I was driving with my dad, when I look to the west and there are four or five yellowish white lights hovering low in the skyline, clustered together. They didn&apos;t appear to be moving but then one at a time about 30 seconds after each other, they would move, usually vertically into the sky and start to blink strangely, very unlike the behavior of an airplane or helicopter. We could not hear them at all, they did not go in one straight path like an airplane but moved sporadically. We drove into a parking lot and saw more of the same kind of behavior for about thirty minutes. We would see a few a yellowish lights just above the trees, stagnant and then it would start moving up ward, and then proceed to move about the western part of the sky oddly. At one point there was eight or ten in the sky at once, all in the western part of the sky. None of them crossed the sky like a plane does. I saw one fall straight down extremely fast, appearing almost like a meteor. My dad thinks they must have been near Dulles airport, but we are both absolutely certain these could not have been airplanes, or even helicopters.On the 6th, after explaining to my friend earlier in the day about my experiences, i continued to see suspicious blinking and hovering lights throughout the night. But around 10:15 we went out on his driveway to smoke a cigarette. And immediately upon looking at the sky we could already see strange blinking lights at different heights in the sky. This time it appeared they were directly above Woodbridge. A few seemed to cross directly above us. The yellow lights would again hover at a distance above the treetops, and then rise, start blinking white, red and blue lights and then move at a very fast speed, all without making any noise at all. One did cross above us particularly low in the sky. When it was above us it appeared to look like a triangle with a light in each corner, but we could not see the outline of the plane. Again, we felt odd that it didn&apos;t make any noise at all. We saw about ten of these, all throughout the sky, and on the drive home we saw one low in the sky, with many more lights then the others. It had white lights all lined up on it&apos;s side on one single craft. We took some pictures of several of these lights, I&apos;m not sure about the quality as I haven&apos;t seen them on a computer yet, but my friend can send then to me and if you want I can send these to you.", "A bright light from nowhere, awakened me from sleepWhile sound asleep, bright lights shined into my eyes causing me to roll over and go back to sleep.  In the morning I told my husband what had happened and  that I must have been dreaming when he told me he had experienced it too. The strange part about the whole thing is we have some rural land we vacation on.  There is nothing for miles, no electricity, or roads.  We have a building on it, but have not installed windows yet, so when we go to bed it is totally engulfed in darkness.  It is not even accessable by vehicle unless you know where you are going. How lights could penetrate the walls of the structure bright enough to awaken us is beyond me.  Also there was no engine sound and the light came from  outside the walls not the ceiling.((NUFORC Note:  Our Center has received a number of reports, which are somewhat similar to this one.  We have no explanation for how the phenomenon, described above, could occur.  PD))", "Traingular craft, with a circle in it&apos;s center,.  circular lights in the circle that rotated.A girlfriend and I were arguing on Clemson Campus, it was sunset.  I looked and spotted a trinagular craft, with a circle in it&apos;s center.  The circle had lights on it&apos;s edge and seemed to rotate in a clockwise rotation where the triangle did not.  I made my girlfriend at the time look and see it as well.  The craft circled a bit and seemed to hover near the Death Valley football field&apos;s lights, which were on for a game the next day.  It was friday, and games were on Saturday.  After she saw it, and asked me what it was,  I said I didn&apos;t know and it either dissappeared, or accellerated way quickly enough that I could no longer see it.   1991 was before the internet, but I have never forgotten this incident.  I mentioned this on /UFO on the IRC once and was advised to report it then,  but I chickened out.  But after years of looking at UFO pics,  I have never seen one that resembled what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

PD))", "In the south night sky I witnessed two  golden, glowing orbs appearing fives times larger than mosts startsOn Tuesday, March 26th, at 9:30PM, as I was driving into my driveway in rural north Florida, I saw a golden, glowing orb in the south sky. This beautiful orb was about the size of a baseball and looked like Venus or Saturn or Mars only much larger. I jumped out of my car to get a better view, and watched for a few moments. Suddenly the glowing orb made a quick jut to the left and then back to the right again, and stood there for a few more seconds.All of a sudden another orb indentilcal to this one zipped into view right besides the first orb. I watched in astonishment as these magnificent amber colored star-like orbs rocked and moved in direct opposite distances from each other, like a dance. Then suddenly the orb that appeared after the first orb shot away into the night sky and out of sight.I ran into the house to call my family to come outside to see this awesome sight, but when we all ran back outside, to my utter dissapointment, both orbs were gone! These glowing star-like orbs moved much faster then shooting stars and were much larger in size than any planet in the night sky!! Their movements were short and quick, and they could stand motionless for at least a minute at a time. Never in my enitre life have I seen anything like this! It was indeed something just like something out of this world.", "I believe we are being visited a lot more than people think.I was sitting by the fire, about midnight when I noticed that the &quot;stars&quot; in the sky were moving.  What follows next is the most amazing things that has ever happened in my life.  It went on for several nights, and they come back the same time each year.  I can&apos;t describe how bone chilling cold it was.  In the cow pasture behind the house I could see several &quot;tents&quot; with an ominous orange glow.  They were ships on the ground I later found out. I watched for several hours and could say I know for a fact there are several types of beings.  Tall ones, upwards of 8ft. Short ones, with larger heads and a mouth from ear to ear.Blue ones and orange ones.  One seemed very friendly as we interacted telepathicly.  The greys however did not like me watching them dig, or collect water or whatever they were doing out there.  I could fell them all around me. I tried to watch several different groups &quot;beem up&quot; to the mother ship above with some type os pure beautiful light that would flash in an instant, and these groups of aliens would be gone. Further investigation in the day time reveal weeds with accelerated growth, strange trails all over the field, that had no livestock in it at the time.  I even smelled some of these weeds and depressions in the ground, what seemed to me to smell earthy, like a worm almost.", "Bright orange/red half-moon looking object with what looked like a wavy flame tail.it was around 3:20am me and my Friend who was out picking up some donuts, going down the road next to our house. heading north. when we got down to the road we needed to turn at head to the donut shop, about 100 - 75Ft i saw over the tree tops a orange half-moon shape object in the sky, at first when i saw it i tough it was a half-blood moon. but when i saw it. it looked like it was about two - two and a half time lager than the moon we see in the night sky. it was a very bight orange. it only got to see it for about 2 - 3 secs until we turned down t the road,i told my Friend (who was the one driving) he wanted to see it but it was a bit to late at the moment. then when we turned to the road going to the shop, for about 3 - 4 Min&apos;s ride to the shop. i saw it a few more time over the north west area where i seen it the first time, by the time i seen it the 3rd time, it didn&apos;t look like no blood moon to me, it looked more like a huge fire ball. where i saw some wave coming from the back of it. and every time i saw it i told my Friend to look but he was always to late to see it. and he really wanted to see it. so after we got our donuts, came back. i was looking over there again to the north west area heading home on the sane. path it was around 3:35. and it wasn&apos;t there by the time we got back home i tough to myself, that couldn&apos;t been the moon since the moon can not go around the earth that fast with in such a small time frame, then i realized that was the north west area, and the moon cant go over in that are since the moon raises from the east and sets into the west. it was strange. when i did see it. it looks like it was slowly moving downwards to the earth, with the naked it it looked about a good 100 - 150ft big. might of been bigger. so i started to looking more into this, and i couldn&apos;t really explain what it was. all i know was it was a huge flame looking thing in the sky.", "Bright object in sky moving at extremely fast speed and changing course abruptlyWe observe this every night, near the moon and in several areas of the sky.  They look like bright stars, but move incredibly fast (changing direction suddenly).  We did research on the internet and some speculated that they were the ISS and/or satellites, however neither of these are applicable simply because of their rapid movement and extreme course changes.  I have no idea if we are seeing these due to our proximity to White Sands Missile Range, and this is mere coincidental speculation anyway.  My wife used our admittedly lower quality telescope, and the objects moved so fast they were leaving a &apos;streak&apos; and very difficult to track and focus.  We are and have been avid skywatchers since childhood.  While I would like to find a perfectly logical answer to this, the simple truth is that in my 54 years I have never observed anything like this.  The &apos;stars&apos; are unusually bright.  What my wife did glimpse is that the object looked round at first, and then changed shape (at this time she could not be more specific, however we will continue to watch and hopefully be able to provide more information).  A higher quality telescope will be in the future as well.  The most interesting of these objects appeared left of the moon last summer (June).  These objects are the last to vanish from the dawn sky, lasting much longer than the stars.  Any further commentary would be speculative which is not the purpose of this report.", "I walked out on my porch to look through my new telescope. As I was putting it together I looked up to see where the moon was so I could adjust my telescope accordingly. As I stared in the sky I witnessed a solid moving object that made no sound. I move from West to East at what appeared to be 5-10 mph. It had no visible lights which threw me because I always invisioned an UFO having quiet a few lights. I watched as it slowly went overhead for about a minute. It never changed speed or made a sound. Because it was dark, I could only make out that it was what appeared to be a diamond shape.", "Bright Light Over Grand Rapids MichiganI looked out of my window and, to the southwest, I noticed a bright-white light.  At first, I thought it was a plane (since we have an airport in the general vicinity),  but after a second or two, I realized that it had no blinking lights on the wings.I then listened for a sound... There was none.  The speed at which it was moving was also in question: it was slow and methodical...about 5-10mph at best.  As it climbed overhead, it began to fade, until there was nothing left to be seen&hellip;((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the source implies a nighttime sighting.  We have changed the time above, to reflect that fact.  PD))", "Squared Smile Shaped object flying really close to the ground and also very slow thru kendal area.Me and 2 friends spotted non blinking lights flying really close to the ground with a blue flame hoover out the back we could only see lights in the shape of this I_______I now picture that as a smile with 2 eyes in the top, we thought it was a 747 flying but then we notice how low it was and also how loud and slow it was going. We couldn&apos;t see a shape out of it the only thing we were able to see was the lights which were very bright. And in the back of the lights which would be around the bottom middle of the smile it looked like 2 big engines shooting the blue fire thru back.", "4 red lights moving in skyThere were 4 steady red lights approximately the size and brightness of radio beacon/obstacle lights. When first observed they were in a horizontal line. As we watched the lights repositioned into a box shape, and then a triangle. The lights then seemed to blink out."]
