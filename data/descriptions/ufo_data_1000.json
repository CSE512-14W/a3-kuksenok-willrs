It was dark when she left home at 0400 hours, on 09JN96, and she had noted the moon in the eastern sky, so she knew what that celestial body looked like. At 0500 hrs., she noticed a &quot;slice of light&quot; above a nearby mountain top.  It was bright, &quot;like a star.&quot;  She continued to watch the object for an estimated 35 minutes (approx. 40 miles), and the object appeared to stay in the same location. She noted that whe was about the only vehicle on the highway, except for a truck that was behind her, &quot;approximately 2 miles.&quot;Then, the left side of the bright object blinked twice (she thought), and the whole object turned black, or perhaps gray.  However, the object remained stationary, and the &quot;core part&quot; of it appeared to the observer to be round.  She also added that the object looked like a &quot;sideways Vee.&quot;  (?)

They were principally red and white sporadic, flashing lights. She pulled off the road and witnessed the object change course and pass overhead.  When she arrived home, where she has an open bakc yard, she could see it in the distance.  It was almost ciruclar in shape, but it was flat in front.  It was almost as if the front of the object was cut off.

The objects swung around, changing position with one another, then the top object vanished.  The other remained visible as we traveled forabout 20 miles.I was driving, and my friend ((name delted)) was a passenger.  We were on Route 8, on our way from Naugatuck, CT to Norwalk, CT.  About 1/3 of the way to Norwalk, in Derby, I spotted two large, bright lights in the sky, and pointed them out to ((name deleted)).  The lights were larger than a visible planet would appear; the closest description I can give as to size was that they were similar in size to street lights viewed from a car, only they were clearly very high in the sky, so the actual size of the objects had to be enormous.  We watched the objects, which were hovering in place, the one on the left a little higher than the one on the right.  Suddenly, the objects moved, rotating around one another (top to bottom) to switch places with one another.  Then, the one which had moved to the top winked out, just vanished.  There was a faint trail leading upward where that one had been, but it disappeared quickly.  I drove another few exits to Shelton, CT, where we got off of the highway onto Bridgeport Avenue.  We stopped at a car dealership which had a clear view of that part of the sky (I&apos;d say, south, maybe south east part of the sky--I&apos;d have to look at a map to be more specific--we were driving generally south at the time).   We got out of the Jeep and stood in the lot, watching the remaining light.  It kept its position.  After a few minutes, we got back into the Jeep, and I continued to drive to Norwalk.  We watched the light all the way to Norwalk; it remained the in the same part of the sky the entire way (probably for a total of 20 miles or so), so it had to be pretty high up.  When I dropped ((name deleted)) off at her home, I had one more look at the object by a running track near her house, then I headed home (driving north, so I could no longer see it in front of me).  I couldn&apos;t see the part of the sky where it was when I got home, so I just went inside. The lights were pale yellow or white-ish in color.  I thought they seemed round, but ((name deleted)) said at the time (and has maintained) that they seemed triangular to her.  They were definitely not airplanes (we saw plenty of planes in the sky that night--no comparison).  They also didn&apos;t behave like planes.I&apos;m 29 years old, female, married, a webmaster/graphic designer by profession.  I&apos;ve never seen any unusual phenomena in the sky before, and have always been skeptical about the whole UFO thing.  While these lights may not be alien in nature, I certainly can&apos;t explain them (if you figure out what they were, please let me know!)  I don&apos;t know ((name deleted)) age (mid to late 40s perhaps).

The observer went outside to get a better look at the lights, which were solid--not blinking--but they were gone.  However, he noted a very prominent light &quot;at the head of Orion.&quot;  the light was red, yellowish, and gold, and it had the shape of an arrowhead, but the back side of the object was &quot;recessed a bit.&quot;Then a second object joined the first!!

The weather was clear and the windwas minimal.  This Isl. is about 90 miles so.of N.Y. City, there at least two military basesrelatively close by.  There was 5 0r 6 of us sittingclose to the waterline at Beach Haven Terrace beach.  As this is a summer recreation areaand I was 19 years old at the time we were partying at the time of the sighting.  At thetime of the viewing I was not out of control perhaps slightly high but nowhere near to the point of halucinating (sorry about the spelling). I was facing the Ocean and I was just taking in the veiw, for example I noticed some boats and ships out for an evening cruise and that the Moon illuminated the sky enoughto see the eastern horizen very clearly. At thispoint out of my left eye I saw a very bright light parallel with the horizen, using my thumb at arms length I would estimate it at 1 or 2 degrees above the clearly seen horizen. Afterabout a second or two I shouted out to the othersto look over there. All but one of us saw it(the guy with his back to the sea was&apos;nt quickenough). by the time everyone looked it startedto do a 90 degree turn over the horizen and it did not appear to slow down, the fireball&apos;slight faded over the horizen within a secondor two.  And thinking back on the moment (later on that night whenI was tring to get to sleep) I believe I saw the siloutte of a cigar shape craft in frontos the fireball. This I can not be absolutly sure since my eyes did not have enough time to focus in on any details of what ever it was.I am also aware of the fact that it seemed to be reacting to my excitementfor the 90 deg. turn accured directly striaghtout from our position, a coincidence maybe, butI wonder.  I hope you can coralate this report with someoneelse who witnessed this event,I sure some of thefolkes on board some of those ships got an evenbetter look at it since they were much closer.I&apos;m just guessing but I believe it traveled atleast 2 or so in the time it was flying strightThe fireball did not get much bigger whenit was straight out from our position on the beachwhich is as close to sea level as one can get.With the help of a math oriented person you could get a rough ideaof how far it traveled and approx. speed.By the way I realize that CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OFTHE THIRD KIND had just come out in 77 and I really did want to see a UFO but at that timein my life I just had a passing interest inthe subject.  Hope this report helps.David Mitchell", "SUMMARY:  Two bright red lights moving in perfect formation flew over Billings on the evening of Jan.12, 1997.  They were&nbsp;flying at an altitude normally too low for conventional aircraft.  Too slow for an airplane. . .almost as if they were gliding.  They made no sound.On the evening of January 12, 1997 around 11 pm I was at my girlfriend&apos;s house and went outside to try to start her car (it had been very cold that week and we had been trying to start it for a couple of days).  I went inside the car, tried to turn it on and it didn&apos;t start.  I got out of the car and two bright lights hovering over a set of trees caught my attention.  I knew that there were no lights (city or otherwise) that should have been there so I looked at them for a second or two.  They were really bright but at the same time kind of dull (hard to describe).  I moved a few steps away from the car and they started to move in a northeasterly direction.  When I first spotted the lights they were probably 1/4 to 1/2 a mile away.  I ran inside and told my girlfriend to come out and check them out.  She got on her boots and saw them but went back inside because it was at least 10 degrees below zero outside.  I ran out onto the street and followed their flight path.  They fl!ew from a southwest to northeast direction and were probably 60-70 degrees off of the horizon.  The two lights upon closer inspection appeared to be made up of more than one light, possibly five. . .occasionally they would blink (they blinked quickly, unlike any other airplane light I have ever seen)  The thing that struck me the most is how they stayed _perfect_ formation. . .not straying an inch from their formation.  It was as almost they were part of the same craft.  This might be the case, but if this is so that means that this craft was at least the size of 2 football fields.  They were completely silent.  Billings is set against a continuous series of cliffs which are about 60-100 feet in height.  In comparison to the Rims (as they are called) they were about 200 feet off of the ground.  They were flying too slow for any airplane that I know  of (plus, as i said they made no sound)  It was if they were gliding.  I ran up a side street and watched them pass over the rims!and pass just south of the airport, if not right over it.  I watched them glide off until they went over the horizon.  It was very strange, as the entire time I knew this was something that I have never seen before in person.  I tried to call the airport to confirm any unidentified aircraft but couldnt get through.

But the only birds we had ever seen near the bay were totally white. The bird would have also had to have been within 5 feet in front of us to appear so large. We would have seen the bird clearly because the resort had small lamps that lit the nearby walkways, and we were able to view a gazebo that stretched out in front of us about 25 feet away.

It was small and luminous, but not very bright. It looked about three times the size of a regular star. I would have considered it to be a conventional aircraft, had it not been for the way it moved. It was extremely fast. It came in, slowed down somewhat, and then accelerated. Also, its path was a little erratic, not very smooth. After about only five seconds I lost sight of it. It could have disappeared behind the ridge, but to me it looked like it simply vanished. My friend and I are both senior psychology students at Arizona State University.

Their impression was that the lights were not very far away, and perhaps at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet.  They appeared to be low. After several seconds, the objects disappeared from sight, then reappeared shortly soon after.  The second object suddenly shot off.  About 3-4 minutes later, they saw them in the northwest sky.  Initially, it was one bright, orange,  large light, which then split into approximately 5 objects.  They formed a formation for about 5-10 seconds, which then simply disappeared.", "Five adults were witness to an object to what appeared to them to be &quot;three diamonds in a row, moving in unison.&quot; in the western sky.  The object(s) had flashing lights on it (them).  They estimated the object&apos;s (apparent) length to be equal to 4-7 times the diameter of the earth&apos;s moon. Even though they could not make out the shape of the object because of its distance from them, it appeared to be proceeding from north to south at a steady pace.  It was midway (vertically) between Venus and the moon.  They were located on E.

Then, while we were talking, he stated that it suddenly dropped down significantly to the horizon.I could hear the other parties in the background talking about the object.  One woman, who was looking at the object with some form of magnification, stated that it looked like it had &quot;seven panels&quot; on the bottom of it.  The caller stated that it looked like it had two headlights on it, with a bar running down the middle, perhaps.  This one is confusing!!  How can Venus streak to the south, and drop down.

Then, they looked to the west, and they noticed three more similar objects coming from the west, whence the first three had come.  Two of the second group were close together, with the third one standing off somewhat, as in the first case. The objects rose up to a higher altitude, and went over the ridge, or hill, to the east of their position.  They reported the sighting to the local sheriff&apos;s office.

When they left the second pharmacy, they witnessed the object a second time, this time right beside their car.  They got a very good look at the object this time. It appeared to them to be the size of an aircraft--perhaps a 747--and it was distinctly round.  When asked, the caller said she thought it was more spherical than circular.  It had many white lights on it, perhaps a hundred or more. The occupants of other cars saw it, too.  There were possibly two other cars that had stopped, and the occupants were standing outside looking at the object.  They were stopped in an area which is totally dark, with nothing but fields around.They called the Lodi Police to inquire whether there had been other calls.  They said there had been no other calls.

Saw red-green halo light moving across opposite ridgetop where no road existed.  Traversed ridge at medium speed then stopped, shot up to higher altitude, performed some unusual aerial manuevers before parking in the sky to the SE. It was soon joined by another identical light which also became stationary.  A large, flat, silent dark perfect triangular craft came down between the two lights and proceeded directly by them up the valley. It flew below the top of the ridge and was clearly visible for 30 seconds to a minute before it passed out of sight. The two lights remained where they were and were visible even after daylight.&quot;Dunn sighting&quot; two. The brothers were hunting near Highland Springs and were again sitting in their truck parked in a pullout near the ridgetop facing east, looking out over the valley between them and the opposite ridge.  It was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 mile across. Suddenly a light appeared to the NE over the opposite ridge.  They both thought it was a vehicle at first but having hunted the ridge they knew there was no road there only brush.  At brushtop height and as large as a truck the light progressed along the ridge.  Viewing it with a 20power spotting scope they describe it as a redish-green pulsing light with a clear white light in the middle.they didn&apos;t know what it was but were able to follow it in the scope,(on a tripod), until it reached the end of the ridge to the SE. There it &apos;jumped&apos; back and forth in the sky for a number of minutes. They were unable to keep it in the viewfinder during these &apos;jumps&apos;.  It then became stationary in the sky.  After a while, from the SE and much further away, a second identical light appeared and flew toward the first one, joining it slightly further to the west but also stationary.  The two lights never moved again.  About 04:30 a large flat, dark and perfectly triangular craft came from between the two lights.  At first they thought it was a plane but it came directly down the canyon they were looking out over, from SE to NW, and lower than the opposite ridge.  It flew at a steady crusing speed and made no sound except for the sound of air being pushed, like a hissing breeze. There was a slight haloed gaseous effect coming from the craft that made it difficult to observe with !the scope but didn&apos;t affect the nnaked eye.  A single spotting clear light shone out ahead from the middle underside of the craft.  What appeared to be windows also were apparent.  They both felt that if they could see it, it could see them and they felt like sitting ducks!  However they were not as frightened as the first time they witnessed a sighting. The way it cruised by reminded them of tourists driving through town.  They estimated it at approximately 25 yards wide.  As it passed two red lights, like taillights shone out from the back of the craft.  They waited for the noise but none came.  They stayed at the spot until dawn, viewing the two original bright lights.  These lights remained in exactly the same location and were so bright they could still be observed after daylight.  They finally got tired of watching and drove home.  Two interesting questions are posed by their two sightings in different wilderness locations.  Either they are simply fortunate to have been !in the direct paths, away from civilization, of these vehicles and their sightings are mere coincidences, or the crafts flew by them purposely.  In both cass they were entirely visible to any vehicle at a higher altitude from great distances away.  Also it seems outlandishly coincidental that they just happened on the particular routes of these crafts, when miles of alternative wilderness areas exist. It may also indicate a similar flight pattern of wilderness routing though it seems odd that if this routing exists to decrease sightings, no attempt was made to hide themselves from these two entirely visible observers.  The Dunn&apos;s are totally reputable men, from midland farm families, as down to earth as you can get!  They never even considered the possibility of what they witnessed until it was before them.  they still exhibit some fear as to the identity and purpose of the crafts and have not discussed or reported the events publicly. But they are now watching continually.  D!unn sighting one contains the report of their first sighting as well as their most recent land -based phenomena sighting.  They are taking me to the sights soon. I&apos;m looking forward to it!    wolf", "SUMMARY:  Saw a very large object 1000-1500 ft in diameter having difficulty.  Saucer shaped about twice the size of a quarter held at arms length about 2 miles distant.  Rotating  windows from left to right.  Saucer was wobbling very slowly for about 5 minutes.  About 20 windows observable.  Looking at object to west.  Reported to Pecatonica state police about 1 hour later and laughed at.  Reported to J.A. Hynek; NW University next dawith drawing sent in later.  I have had my son approximate these drawings with computer graphics.  It finally stabilized and floated away to the NW toward Pecatonica.  Only  a white blinking light remained after window lights were shut off.  Light appeared to be center top.  Also, no sound and other witnesses did not seem to be too concerned that they did not what this object was.  The wife and I know!Background will mildly rolling with numerous houses and apartments visable.  Object was at time below the horizon in a slight valley just to the west of the Bel-ford theater on IL RT 20 which runs between Rockford and Belvidere.  This object was extremely large and seemed massive-heavy but suspended in the air and wobbling slowly like when you spin a frisbee on a string. spin it slowly and then strike one side.  At the time I told Hynek&apos;s secretary that I thought that the windows measured about 20&apos; x 70&quot;. 20 wide - 70 high.  In retrospect, I underestimated these dimensions.  Probably more like 50 by 300.  At that time John Anderson from Rockford was running for president.  Haven&apos;t heard much about him lately. He lost as a third party candidate.  I am 49 years old now but it is still vivid in our memories.  Most people look us strangely when we mention it.  Neither of us have seen anything similar since.  We also called the Rockford Airport the next day and they said they had seen nothing unusual on rader the night before.  They said it was probably an advertising plane pulling a lighted banner.  Yea, right!  I have never seen an ad plane that makes no sound, flying around at midnight with a lighted sign the size of Commisky Park.  I just gave up trying to convince peiople.

It suddenly slowed to a complete stop before going straight up and performing zig zag maneuvers. It then shot off in the NE direction.  Within 45 minutes we observed 2 fighter jets flying in tight wing formation going in the same direction as the UFO.The ufo appeared to be a slightly flattened egg shape. It was a clear cloudless day, with only con trails from the airplanes in the sky. Sunlight glinted off the top and the bottom.  The object was heading toward was the Malibu, CA area.  The area where we were observing is comprised of hills and agricultral zones.  Because of the cooler temperature, all planes in the sky were leaving con trails, however the ufo did not.  I am unable to estimate how high, or how big the object was, although it did not appear to be all that high, or all that large.  The hill directly beneath the object when it stopped had sheep grazing at the time.  The speed the object moved was amazing, as were the complicated maneuvers it performed.  Approximately 45 minutes later we observed 2 fighter jets flying in close tight wing formation and heading in the direction the ufo had taken.  One of the gentlemen with me if familar with planes and fighter jets as his father was a lifer in the Air Force, and!he spent nearly all of his growing up years on AF bases.  One other interesting point, the ufo was going in the direction of Rockadyne, a company facility that builds and tests rocket engines. That is all I can think of at the moment. I am a scheduler/ dispatcher for a technical service and support department.  My educational back ground is 2 years of college, and working in the Customer Service and Support field for 23 years.  I am interested in ufology, although I am not involved with any ufo groups.  There were 2 men beside myself who saw the ufo.

The objects were &quot;lurching&quot; relative to one another.  They went directly over his head, so he felt that he had a very good look at them. Another person was also able to view the object(s) briefly.Prior to this sighting, he had given no credence to UFO reports.", "The observer was standing at the window of his high rise apartment near Pike Place Market, looking west and southwest.  Suddenly, he witnessed a strange &quot;light&quot; in the sky, which at first he thought was a beam of light coming up from West Seattle.  It looked like a &quot;flattened oval of soft red/orange light.&quot;  It made a perfect arc across the sky.  It covered 2/3 of the sky during its movement.  Then, the observer realized that it could not be a search light, for example, because it was above the clouds, and he would have seen the light passing through the clouds.  The light moved across the sky in a perfect arc, as if tethered to the ground.  It appeared to travel from east to west.The clouds at the time were high and &quot;transparent.&quot;The caller volunteered that he has a slight color anomaly in his vision, and he believes anyone with normal color perception would have found the light to be more prominent in the sky than it was to him.", "Father and daughter were driving through downtown Bothell, when the daughter called her father&apos;s attention to a peculiar, triangular-shaped object, which appeared to be flying toward them.

His wife saw it, as well.", "SUMMARY:  120-140 ft, X 35-40 ft, X 30 ft, triangler craft, metalic colored, 4 lights directly down the center with 2 strobes and 3 very large lights on the backOn or between Dec 27th 1994 and Jan 5, 1996 at 2100 hours, I went out to get my dog in from the back yard of my home, (6350 East Hayne).  He was in a playful mood and I began to throw small stones which he would chase.  As I was walking over to pick up a few small stones in the corner of walled in yard, I happen to grance up into the very clear, cloudless sky and noticed a darken object very low to the ground.  At first I could not determine if the craft was moving.  At this point it was quite some distance away, approx 1 to 1 1/2 miles.  I continued to watch the craft and it began to get larger.  I knew the craft was obviously coming in my direction.  I kept wondering why the aircraft had not turned on its landing lights be cause the U.S. Air Force Base (Davis-Monthan AFB) was only a few miles south of my home.  The base is almost directly south of my home the the Tucson International Airport is just on the other side (slightly southwest).  I immediately called the craft to!my daughters attention who had just come out to tell me one of my favorate programs had just come on.  We both stood there watching as the craft got closer.  When it was approximately 3/4 mile from us,  it&apos;s true shape became visible.  It was a triangle shaped craft, moving very slowly at approximately five to eight miles per hour.  It was approximately 75 to 100 feet above the ground.  It had no lights on the front of the craft at all.  I told my daughter that it was going to pass almost directly over us.  When it got to only a few hundred feet away, we began to see lights on the bottom of it.  There were four lights that were in a straight line down the middle of it that ran the full lenght.  The lights were spaced about 20 feet apart.  As it passed slightly infront and above us, we could see very clearly that the craft was metalic in color and did not have a smooth surface but appeared to have a plated surface.  I could see what appeared to be lines of rivits that connecte!d them togather.  The craft did not make a single sound, and after spending 18 years on active duty in the Air Force, I knew it was not something that was man made.  It I were going to guess at its weight based on its size as mentioned above---I would say approxmiately 80 to 110 tons.  As I passed by my daughter was the first to notice two stobes on the rear corners that were blinking very fast (much faster than normal aircraft), both were white lights and could only be seen from behind.  Even when the craft was at its closest point from us, could not be seen until the rear of the craft began to become visable.  It was at this pont that I could even more clearly see the previously mentioned plating affect.  I was able to at this point based on the visible edges of the triangle in my own mind determine the thickness of the craft .  The back of the craft had three very large lights , two approximately 10 feet in diamenter and the third much larger light between them.  It was abo!ut 15 feet in diamenter.  It may sound strange but the lights were not giving off a really bright light but definately light that appeared to be defused.  The lights on the bottom of the craft appeared defused as well.  The craft was close enough that a man with a good strong throwing arm could have easily hit it.  I know that this story sounds like something out of a science fiction book, but I swear it&apos;s the truth.  I will be more than willing to take any lie-detector test you want.  Feel free to contact me concerning this sighting.  I almost forgot--the following day after the close encounter, while in the restroom of my home preparing to shower or something i remember finding a blister about the size of a dime just above my left ankle.  There was no pain, and I only noticed it as I was taking of my sock.  I pressed slightly on it and rolled my index finger around.  It poped and I expected to feel pain but there was none.  I pealed away the lose skin and noticed that the ti!ssue that should have appeared red or pink was brown.  Normally, blisters don;t leave scars in a perfect circle--this one did.  The only reason I have taken this time to tell you about what we seen, is that I can&apos;t stop thinking about it.  I hope if have really reached someone who will take the time necessary to confirm my sighting anyway they have to.  Now I know for sure--They do exist and I don&apos;t care who says they don&apos;t.  That includes our goverment.", "SUMMARY:  Sighted while driving across the AlleyIt was about midnight and a UFO crossed the highway in front of me at very low altitude.

They were so low that had it been daylight I could have read any markings on the jet. The UFO glowed very brightly and was the color of fluorescentl ight tubes. This is all I know.

I was looking toward the northward end of the runway and saw a UFObut ny brother didn&apos;t see it because he was looking the other direction while putting the ladder in the truck. It zipped across the sky at around 400 M.P.H and was bright green, really bright and it wasn&apos;t a plane, it was crossing the landing approach pattern. It came down from around 1000 feet to about 200 feet, then speed extremely fast westward while hugging the groung,about 150 feet above the local houses and dissappeared westward toward the bay. The object, to my caclulations must have been at least 70 feet in diameter and was circular. I am a current student as well as my brother in high school. I have seen many pictures of ufo&apos;s onTV and on the Sightings UFO report video. It looked similar to a ufo that I saw on TV that just zoomed across the sky in Mexico City.There was not any noise heard and the sky was very clear that night, the first clear day in about a week after large storms.I am not sure if anybody else saw it, but there wasn&apos;t many people at the airport in the area that we were in, but some peoplewho live in the houses next to the golf course, which is at the end of the runway towards the direction that the object was seen,might have seen the UFO.

A telescope revealed a round shape.I observed what I took to be a satellite, until it shifted direction, and then stopped.  It was slightly brighter than the brightest stars in the sky, and not an unusual color.  It would hover for awhile, then move, sometimes appearing to spin in circles.  I first looked at my watch at 19:11, after having watched the object for perhaps 10 minutes.The object hovered in basically the same part of the sky for over three hours, at times appearing to drift, and then bring itself back to where it was before.  It often just hovered perfectly still, and looked like a star. It was roughly overhead of Alta, very high, a little  to the northeast.  Witnesses who saw it move included a member of the Alta Fire Department, a dispatcher for the Alta Marshall&apos;s office,And two members of the astronomical society at the Hansen Planetarium in Salt Lake.  They happened to have a nice 3inch wide telescope, and were photographing the moon.  With a higher powered eyepiece, the telescope showed the object to be pefectly round, with a darker round circle in the center.  I think the telescope was about 12000x, if I recall correctly.  The object was absolutely still in the telescope.I think the image in the telescope was consistent with looking up at the underside of a perfectly round flying saucer.  No lights were apparent on the object.  It appeared to be reflecting light from the sun which gave it the appearance of a star to the naked eye. Conceivably, this was some type of satellite being put into a fixed orbit, except for the erratic motion.  With my arm outstretched, it moved the length of my thumb, at the most.  I would like more information on types of satellites.  Personnel at the Hansen Planetarium weren&apos;t aware of any satellites that can behave like that.

This thing could go from horizon to horizon in just seconds.  It would fly just like a meteor, stop on a dime, then go in a completely different direction.  We all saw the craft become brighter,almost as if it were gaining energy, then shoot across the sky.  After doing several maneuvers, the light would become dim, then go out.

He advised we find out who owns the woods so no one would possibly file a trespassing complaint on us for entering the woods about a week after the event became known.

We decided to go there because it was very dark and it was basically a large field in which we could park our pickup.  We had binoculars and a mid-size telescope with us.  As we were watching the meteor shower, we all noticed moving, starlike points which changed color from white to red.  There were 3 such objects, and they appeared to be at an extremely high altitude (at least where commercial aircraft would fly).  They were mostly directly above us or at least 3/4 up from the horizon.  We were not certain of their altitude since there were no reference points.  Through binoculars the objects appeared to be executing extremely high-speed maneuvers (looping and passing close to one another) and they could accelerate or turn VERY quickly.  The telescope was impossible to use while viewing the objects because of their speed.  There is no way these were planes, helicopters, meteors, or flyin!g insects like fireflies (there are no fireflies that change color or live west of the Rockies).  I have no clue about what they were.  I would like it if someone e-mailed me regarding this, if it&apos;s possible.", "SUMMARY:  orange triangle metallic looking object sighted from windowI was sitting on couch and saw a plane? coming in the distance. No surprise since I can see many planes coming and going on the horizon from the Pittsburgh airport on clear nights. We have a good view of open skies on the hill and have watched little meteorite showers in years past. This orange light was coming west it came so close and descended heading north.  I thought it was a plane crashing to the groud a few miles from my home.  It changed angles as it turned and it appeared as a metallic bottom with a glowing orange haze.  At each point there was a bright colored light. As I ran out the front door to witness the crash I saw it quickly change direction and ascend toward the east.  It disappeared from sight at a high rate of speed.  I think it was some weird new stealth like plane or a UFO. I was alone when it happened. I&apos;m married and have a career and I don&apos;t want to be known as a nut. As I was searching the web to see if anyone else witnessed my siting I discovered y!our site.  Everyone I know was indoors at that time and I really don&apos;t want to ask my neighbors for obvious reasons. I&apos;ve done alot of soul searching on whether I should report this in any way and so here I am. If there&apos;s someone else out there I want them to know that I saw it too.  I know how I feel.

At the time,  I assumedthat they must have been aircraft.  But it&apos;s been a long time since then,  and I haven&apos;t ever seen any airplanes,or whatever, that even remotely resemble the objects I saw.I have just recently gained access to the Web,  and being amused by UFO stories,  I found my way to a couple of theUFO pages.  While browsing at Rutgers,  I ran across some reports of &quot;triangular UFO&apos;s&quot;, which made my hair stand on end.  Up to that time,  I had not heard of &quot;triangular&quot;UFO&apos;s.  Here&apos;s what I saw in late August, 1974 while Iwas in the backyard of my house in Campbell, CA (South SFBay area).I was laying on the ground, looking through a pair of 20 power binoculars.  My feet were pointed east, and the binoculars were pointed slightly to the right of straight up,  at about the one o&apos;clock position.  Something went through my field of vision, moving right to left.  I caught up to it quickly,  and saw two objects flying in close  formation,  one behind and to the right of the one in front.They were both the same size, shaped like equilateral triangles with straight edges,  flying point forward. Their color appeared to be flat slate grey,  against a deep blacksky.  There were no features, and I saw no lights, or glow of any kind.  They appeared to be illuminated by the citylights.  It looked something like this:left (north)-                       .if this diagram doesn&apos;t-             -                .line up, select a fixed-                  -             .font (like courier).

The craft in front appeared more steady than  the trailing one, and the distance between them fluctuated randomly,  varying from nearly touching, to a maximum of a triangle length.  When the rear one began to lag,  it would suddenly snap back to a comfortable distance from the front one.  My impression was that it looked as though they were being manually controlled by pilots, and as if they had very high power to weight ratio, and like they were somewha thard to control.I watched them for about 8 to 12 seconds.  During that time,they maintained a due north heading, and covered about 80 to 90 degrees of azimuth.  After I lost sight of them,  I waited for several minutes for any sound.  I heard nothing.The binoculars were 20x50, with a field of view of 157 fee tat 1000 yards. If you assume that the objects were about 100 feet long,  and took up about 1/3 of the field of view, then their altitude would be 2000 yards, or 6000 feet, and their speed would be 568 mph.  That seems pretty conventional,but I think I would have heard jets at that altitude.Furthermore,  what jets have a perfect equilateral sillouette?The closest thing I can think of (that would be flying in 1974),is the B58 Hustler.  But my view was clear enough,  that I could have seen the little bit of fuselage in the front and backof the delta wing.I probably blew the simple geometry I used for the altitude and speed calculations,  but I&apos;ve given enough facts that one could calculate height and speed for any craft of a given size.((NUFORC Note:  As the reader probably has noted, the formation did not survive the transfer from our e-mail program to our website.

But I am very good atj udging distance, adn have very good eyesight. I also feel that I am a UFO skeptic even though I am very intrigued. I don&apos;t believe that they were necessarily extraterrestrial space craft, but they were notjust a simple flare or &quot;plasma displacment&quot;.They could have been a number of different things. We have both tried to come up with explinations of the event and truely believe that that would be some what difficult toachieve. The way that they decended was thefact that forced us to come to that conclusion. It was a straight fall. But tookway too long to be a &quot;fall&quot;.

One saucer-shaped, silent, dull-metallic appearing object travelled over downtown Arcade headed nw about treetop height.Seen by many. Nellie Daully(town operator) receieved many reports.Late summer/early fall before dusk.Object as described passed over town headed in general direction of thr park (nw).The year was probably 1964 or 65-66.I was a toddler but distinctly recall the object passing overhead dissappearing beyond the treetops in the distance. My mother witnessed this, and my sister(3yrs older)-but sister doesn&apos;t recall.The area was a hotbed of activity in the 60&apos;s. My father a physician and formerly, an airforce pilot during Korean war recounts that many of the sitings corroborated ufos generally travelling northbound following rt98. Bray road is one of the highest elevations in the county and people living there and in the area of Lost Nations witnessed several objects. One physician Dr. Oestriche (now deceased) saw lights back in the field and found circular depressions when he investigated the next day. Krueggers, who still live there have mentioned seeing things also. It was so common and widespread knowledge, that people used to park up and do!wn Bray Rd. to ufo watch.

EST. I observed a commercial aircraft at altitude, traveling in a westernly or northwesterly direction.  I was initially attracted to this as the commercial aircraft was trailing a beautiful con trail.  I took my eyes off the aircraft several times as I was driving, but I continued to glance up at it intermittantly, and suddenly I observed another object following behing the first aircraft at what I would estimate at under 1 mile, although I cannot be certain of exact distance.  First observed second object as it began to glow brightly as if the sunlight were glaring off of it.  Second object appeared behind and just outside of con trail at what appeared to be same altitude and speed, and traveling in same direction.  Found it somewhat puzzeling that there was no sun glare off of first aircraft, and also that there was no con trail from the second object even though it appeared to be at same a!ltitude and airspeed as the commercial aircraft.  Also, this second aircraft seemed to be following much closer than any I&apos;ve ever witnessed within the local flight corridors.  With the recent events concerning military aircraft closing on commercial aircraft from behind and triggering the commercial aircrafts anti-collision warning system, and it struck me as being rather odd that these two were reletively near one another in flight to not have such systems activate.  I observed the second object for about 10 or 12 seconds as it appeared to reflect the sunlight, it then stopped reflecting light and the glare stopped, and I continued to see an obhject but could not determine shape.  Within a few seconds of the glare from the sunlight reflecting off the second object had ceased, I lost sight of the 2nd object.  I continued to observe the first aircraft and it&apos;s con trail as it flew off into the distance.  The best I can estimate, the first aircraft was approximately over or nea!r Gettysburg at the time I made this observation.  I&apos;m sorry to say that I did not observe any unusual flight characteristics such as phenomenal or unusual speed or course deviations.  When I stated a commercial aircraft I was inferring larger sized, it may have been a large military aircraft I suppose.  I just found it unusual that  one of two objects that were apparently at the same altitude and speed, one reflecting sun and one not, and with one apparently following the other, one with a con trail and one without, was a bit &quot;unusual&quot; especially considering there relative distance of seperation!

It hovered overhead then slowly moved to the right, then down, then leftand then up, to form a complete square.  It hovered some more than shot diagonally up and out of sight.I was 14 years old at the time.  It was Christmastime, cause I rember sitting next to our tree watching television.  It was dusk, so there was still some daylight left.  My father was sitting in our kitchen watching the birds outside.  I heard him yell for me to come see something.  I went into the kitchen and sat next to my Dad.  He then pointed out thewindow, up into the sky.  &quot;Watch that silver disc up there,&quot; he said.  The objectI looked at was not exactly round, it was kind of a cross between round and oval.  It was really high up but you could still see it clearly.  The color of it was silver, not unlike the way some jets look today.   As I watched the silver disc, it slowly moved to the right and stopped.  Next it moved slowly down and stopped.  Now it moved directly left and stopped.  And the last move it made was up and stopped.   At the time, I don&rsquo;t remember being really amazed by it, I just thought it was&quot;kinda neat&quot; is how I think I put it then! (chuckle).  As we watched the silver disc just hover in the one spot, it suddenly shot really fast diagonally up and was gone!  Later that night, after I had gone to bed, something woke me up.  I didn&rsquo;tknow what, but I had this strange sensation (not unlike dreaming).  I was being drawn to the back of the house.  So I walked slowly to our back door and pulled the shade on the window.  Normally what I would see is the silhoutte of our backyard trees against the streetlamp.  What I saw instead was a hugh, bright, white, light!   The light was so bright it was blinding!   I was suddenly startled, like waking up from a dream. I hurtled the shade down and ran back to my bedroom!

At one point it elongated itself and moved one point to another almost instantaneously.At 00:25 am on May 10, 1997, I was getting into bed and glanced out my bedroom window and noticed a large white &apos;star&apos; with a yellowish hue to it with a background of the black sky and other stars.   I remarked that I have never seen such a large &apos;star&apos; before.  It didn&apos;t twinkle as the other stars did, which make me even more curious.  Its shape wasn&apos;t circular, but rather more a square with concaved side.  (Discription of star shape:  Place a square on one its corners, and its axises both vertical and horizontial, take the circumferencial straight lines and cause them to become concaved towards the center-point where the axises of square meet. )  This was the shape of the &apos;star&apos;.After looking at the star for about ten seconds, it disappeard.  It reappeard several seconds later to the left of its original position.  The color had changed from the yellowish white to blueish white.  The size had also changed, it resembled more like a regular star size.  Intermittenly the blueish light would flash, although not at regular intervals.  Occasionally (two or three times), a small red light flashed (but not as frequently as the &apos;white&apos; light) This red light was also irregular in its flashing.  No blue light was ever seen as in regular aircraft lights.The light moved from its &apos;9 o&apos;clock&apos; position to the &apos;center of the clock&apos; position&apos; and immediately perform a 90 degree turn to the &apos;12 o&apos;clock&apos; position. in a fraction of a second.

(No red light flashing)The light continued this movement between the above four points, but never, while I viewed it, move to the &apos;3 o&apos;clock&apos; position.At one point in its movements, from the &apos;9&apos; to the &apos;center&apos; positions, the object seemed to elongate itself and be at both positions at the same time for only a fraction of a second, and then repositioned itself  from the &apos;9&apos; to the &apos;center&apos; positions.I decided to get my video camera, and after a quick search of two rooms, found it and returned to the bedroom, but unfortunaltely the light was gone, so I did not get it on video.Total time was about a 1 minute to a minute and a half.", "Summary : We saw two red dots of apparent unearthly origin.A friend and myself saw a small dot that was very hard to notice at first in the sky directly above us.

It would slow down and speed up and most oddly it would make turns of which i have never seen at the speed in which it appeared to be traveling.

If i had not been looking up i would have never seen this event.I was startled and amazed at what i was wittnessing .I had to move to the other side of the car very quickly because the dots of lights were moveing at a pretty good drift.

No lights, no sound, just a monstrous huge black vehicle.  My impression was it was like a rectangle.  We only new it was there because it was blocking out the stars (there were no clouds that night), that is what drew our attention to it, blocking out a large section of the sky and it&apos;s movement.  I have no idea how high it might have been although it was at least above 3500 feet.

We were all veteran cops as well as military veterans.  I was a combat air-defense control officer in the military and have somewhat of a good idea of what anything man made can accomplish in the air.

Appox. 8 lights on outer circumference of disk shape, only lights visible.  Rotation of approx. 6 revs per minute.  Object disappeared when last visible light turned off. Lights were approx, 30 degrees apart on outer surface leaving times when only 3 lights were visible.  Light appeared to be coming out of portals.  Structure of object not visible, only rotating lights.Departed Salt Lake Airport by car at 2200 MDT on I-80 westbound at 75 mph toward Wendover, Nv. At 2305 driver saw what appeared to be two close, low flying aircraft, one seen as two lights and the other seen as one light approaching quickly from S.E.  Driver told passenger to look up to see jets.  No noise or visual above so driver looked to S. E. again to see the three lights now flying parallel to vehicle.  Now three lights could be seen to be rotating with more lights being added  from the one and the other two disappearing.  The lights were on the outer circumference of a disk and were rotating.  Rotation was approx. three revs during a 30 second visual.  After about 30 seconds, and into the third rev, while only one light was visible, this light went out and although we looked and looked for the lights, they were gone.  We never saw another thing.  I called HAFB to check on night aircraft operations and determined the 388 TFW was in the general area that night.  I also !checked with the Salt Lake Airport Authority and found that a movie was being filmed, using a helicopter with a camera pod below, outside Tooele, Ut., approximately 80 miles west of our sighting.  I still have not been able to correlate these activities with what we saw.The driver of the car has 33 years experience as an ((deleted)) engineer with a T.S. clearance and in general, with logic, tries to explain unusual occurances away.

She had gone to the park with her son, and she noticed a glint of sunlight off an object, which appeared to be high in the sky, which was clear.  The object was moving from SE to NW, and it was very small.  Its color was either white or silver. At first, the caller, an amateur  bird watcher, thought it might be a bird, but she could see no flapping.The object went in a straight path at first, and it exhibited no contrail, and there was no apparent sound.  Suddenly, the object began to turn, executing a 180 reversal of course in 5-10 seconds. The observer walked in front of a tree, losing sight of the object for a moment.  She called it to the attention of other people in the park, who saw it as well. The object reversed its directionb, and suddenly began to climb.  It accelerated, and disappeared in approximately 3 seconds, or so. She added that the object had exhibited three speeds:  slow and deliberate; it accelerated somewhat; and very fast.

On the return drive back to VillanovaOn Rt. 202 North I noticed a bight object flying across the sky, It flew slowly accros my field of view, which was to the South, southeast, forapproximately 7-10secs.  The object then took off at a tremendous speed toward the south.  I continued looking for the object but I did not seeit anymore.  The object was metallic in nature and it had a high reflectance, much like a mirror.  The was a descernable size to the object whichwas approx. 0.25 degrees across and half that in height.

It was a verybright white ball of light which shot straightdown much faster than i&apos;ve ever seen anythingshoot straight down.  I have no idea how largeit was, but would guess based on theintensity of the light that it was probablyno more than a mile or so away. It disapearedfrom view behind some trees to the west (probablyabout 25 degrees from the horizon where i wasstanding). I heard no sound during or after seeingit.  There was no flash or sound of an explosion,which I would have expected given its speed,trajectory, and apparent proximity when it disapearedfrom view.The sighting lasted no more than a second, but madean impression on me.

It was not moving and seemed to be at the same distance the whole time.  At one point it turned into a  bright orange ball the same size as the bight ball of light. Then a few minutes later back to the bright ball of light. I watched for about 25 minutes altogether.  Finally it turned back into the orange ball and quickly got smaller and smaller until it disappeared about 15 seconds later.  Someone told me that the faster it goes from large to small is the rate of speed it is traveling at. I know for sure now that there is something out there.", "Summary : Rapidly moving blue-green in sky over fireworks spectatorsOn the evening in question, I was in the crowd near the Gateway Arch waiting for the fireworks display to begin at 2140.  At approximately 2115, I was looking up at helicoptors that were moving around the river and immediate airspace over the city near the Arch.  At about that time, I happened to notice an object, moving at an extremely rapid rate through the sky, almost directly overhead. The duration of the event was so short that I thought that it might have been some kind of meteorite or something similar.  The object was bluish-green in color, like a streaking fireball in shape, and moving east to west at a speed much faster than any aircraft, flare, fireworks, or shooting star/meteorite I have ever seen before.  The light gave off no observable sound, nor was there some kind of sonic boom or anything of the sort. I commented on it to my friend who missed it and wasn&apos;t interested in my observation.  I overheard others in the crowd in my immediate area comment on the light, so I&apos;m pretty sure that there are others who can comment on seeing the light.  I am writing this, only because I happened to see a report in the news today about a similar series of observations across the river in Illinois.", "Summary : Huge triangular shaped object.  Slow speed and low altitude.  Passed directley over my position. No sound except wind rushing past.  NE direction and never swerved, swayed, turned or changed speed. Light shown on ground, briefly.While coming home from working the 4-12 shift as a Police Officer, I noticed an &quot;airplane&quot; flying in the direction in which I was traveling.  After driving a few miles, I noticed that the &quot;airplane&quot; was still on it&apos;s course. It should have been far away by that time. I was curious, but soon forgot about it. As I was turning onto the final rode that leads to my housing plan, I noticed that the &quot;airplane&quot; was still there.The PLan where I lived was on the highest point in the area and as I got to the Plan, my visibility was practically unlimited except for some trees.  I could see the &quot;airplane&quot;better at this point and I suspected that it was a helicopter because of the slow speed.  The &quot;helicopter&quot; displayed a search type light at the ground and I thought it was a medical helicopter looking for a landing zone.  I&apos;ve seen helicopters do this in my capacity as a Police Officer, and I was worried that someone might have been badly injured in my neighborhood. While thinking these thoughts, the &quot;helicopter&quot; turned off the search light and continued in a straight line heading directly toward my housing plan.I hurried my vehicle to a point where I figured the &quot;helicopter&quot; would pass over, and I turned off my head lights. Then I shut off my engine and got out of the vehicle to get a better look at the &quot;helicopter&quot;. When I got out of the vehicle and looked up in the sky, I noticed that I was not looking at a helicopter, airplane, blimp or anything I could recognize.  I was looking at a triagular shaped craft with a light at each point, smaller lights were dotted underneath as this was my point of reference, and no strobe lights like a commercial aircraft would have.  The object made no sound, although it seemed to me that I could hear wind rushing past. Faintly, albeit.  The altitude was very low, a few hundred feet or less, and the speed was radically slow. The object was huge.the night was crystal clear and warm, and I saw it but can&apos;t believe what I saw.  It has taken me this long to report it.  I told this story to Mike Frizzell of the Enigma Project and he told me to write to you.", "Summary : The witnessed reported to me she saw a irradescent,green,cylindar object move horizontal across the sky going South to North.

I witness a small (star-sized) orange light travel roughly east to west(top to bottom of eyepiece) in about 3/4 of a second.  I immediately looked at that area with my naked eye, as did my husband, but we saw nothing.  Approximately 10 minutes later,my husband was viewing M42 with a 15-mm eyepiece.  He, too, witnesses a small &quot;yellow-orange&quot; light, traveling at the same apparent speed - although he describes its movement as &quot;erratic&quot;.Again, our attempts at immediate naked-eye confirmation yield nothing.  We continue to observe M42 in the hopes that we will see another light.  This time, we alternate: oneviews through the scope while the other observes M42 with the naked eye - at this point, we have ruled out satellites (&quot;erratic&quot; movement of the second light) and insects flying in front of our lens(none observed with naked eye - lights are in focus through scope - lights are visually quite small).  Approximately 10-15 minutes later (19:45), my husband is viewing through the scope,and I&apos;m watching Orion like a hawk.  With my naked eye, I witness a white light, again visually star-sized, &quot;come out&quot; of the bottom star of Orion&apos;s sword, travel in a small curve or hook, and then travel at a visualangle of about 45 degrees.  It moves in a straight line until it is approximately under the right star of the belt, and it simply &quot;turns off&quot;.  This takes about 2 seconds.The previous night, my brother and his friend were over observing M42 and Betelgeuse (19:00) and reported seeing &quot;shooting stars&quot; through the telescope.  My husband and I are amateurastronomers, and have seen meteors, satellites, airplanes - all of the &quot;reasonable&quot; explanations.  These three lights do not fit in with those explanations.  We have attempted over the past few months to figure this out, but cannot.  I can only say that we both have had an unshakably strange feeling about these observations, and I decided that posting this sighting might bring other observers of this phenomenon to us.", "Summary : bright blue-white oval light at high altitude, moving slowly S-NWhile observing celestial objects on very clear night, saw a bright blue-white light directly overhead.

Object was round and did not move.Driving West Bound on 164th St SW (6th Ave W cross street)in Martha Lake area of Lynnwood, WA and noticed a bright round object in the setting sun light.  It looked far off in the distance like out over the Pacific Ocean.  It looked large.  It seemed odd that it was large enough to block enough of the setting sun light to be visible and to aparently twinkle (emit its own light).  Intreagued I watched it intently.  It did not move relative to the horizon or the setting sun.  I then turned south on 13th Ave W past ELDEC (Crane) Electronics and lost sight of the object behind trees.  I then kept driving and eventually got to the Target store at Alderwood Mall (184th and Alderwood Mall Blvd in Lynnwood) and the object was still there and had not moved in the sky and still looked the same in terms of the light being emitted and the ability of the object to be seen through the brightness of the setting sun.  I got out of my truck and observed the object for approximately 2 minutes! and said wow it just isn&apos;t moving.  I went into the Target Store at 9:22 pm and the object was still there.

It was dark outside but the sky was complete clear except for stars(The moon was still below the horizon). I was looking out the window when I saw what appeared at first to be a low flying airplane, but the shape was odd. As it came closer I could tell it wasn&apos;t a plane so I grabbed a pair of binoculars from my closet and headed outside to take a look. By this time the object was coming directly over my house. It was a long hexagon shaped object with 6 large lights and several smaller illuminations. The two lights at the end points of the object were red, while the four lights that made up the center of the object were white. In the inner surface of the object were what looked like a smaller ring of lights, but the were very dim. These lights on the object were different from what a normal aircraft lights look like. First off, they did not blink. Second, the appeared diffused like the light from a LED, not the bright bulb type lights that you would see on a airplane. While the object was at a fairly high altitude I was able to see the actual body of the object. It was definitely a solid mass, hexagon in shape. I couldn&apos;t make out anything on the surface but it appeared to be a dark grey or black. The total time I could see the object was about 4 minutes. It didn&apos;t seem to be moving very fast but it velocity and direction were constant. The object also made almost no noise. I live 25 miles from Pittsburgh Intl. Airport so a lot of plane fly over head at a fairly frequent pace and you can hear the engine drone from miles away, but this thing made only a slight hum even as it flew away.

In other words,  the police chopper was not doing its typical circular patterns that is common to see when looking at a cop chopper, and it was not shining it&apos;s strong bright light on any thing on the ground.  A block later I got home and got out of my Jeep to find two neighbors looking at the object.  However, minutes later the bright light disappeared into the night sky.  Although, at the time I was a college student and it was a Saturday night,  I was not drunk or had any to drink that night.  I was sober and total!ly awake.", "Summary : Large bright red light, size of Venus at its brightest, observed over Spokane, Wa. at 1:00 a.m. on April 22, for about 20 minutes. Appeared stationary, then moved slowly upward and disappeared. No sound. No apparent explanation.Large bright red (not orange) star-like light (at first described as &quot;Mars&quot;, but was not) seen in northern sky at about 30 degree angle, at 1:00 a.m., on April 22, 1997 in Spokane, Wa.. Too big to be a satellite, and not blinking or moving fast enough to be a plane or helicopter. (It would have been too low to be a plane without some sound.)  No sound accompanying this event.  Clear night.  Full moon.  Light as large as Venus might appear at its brightest, but &quot;stop-light&quot; red.  No other object that color in sky.  Only faint stars in that direction.  Appeared to be stationary, but with continued viewing seemed to very slowly move upward and between two distant stars, about 5-10 more degrees.  Then as I watched, it was just gone.

At about a 45 degree angle we observed a flight of ???? moving from left to right in a formation.Upon entering my driveway I observed some objects moving across the northern sky from left to right at about a 45 degree angle. They appeared to be in formation. Some of the were trailing sparks...looked kind of like a childs sparler used on the 4th of July. There must of been 6 to 10 objects.

I was taking the dogs out before bed (I&apos;mnot exactly sure what the time was, around 2100 I think)and I looked to the north and saw 5 very bright white lightsin a triangle (or V) formation moving really fast southeast.Then they broke formation.  The light in the back and below(from my angle) slowed up.  Now I started to wonder what I waslooking at because most planes would keep formation or at leastbreak formation completely.  Never saw a plane with lights asbright as these also.  The group seemed to rotate 90 degrees tothe left and go a little south of Mingus mountain.  I was suprisedthat I couldn&apos;t hear them so I listened harder.  I did hear thesound of a faint rustling in the sky, not like a jet, but of somethinmoving extremely fast through the air.  The sound was a ways behindthem also and did seem to follow them.  I then started lookingaround at two other planes flying.  Sessna&apos;s by the sound andspeed of them.  Also by the red flashing lights.  I saw the lights fadeinto the distance and I headed back inside.  My first notion was whathas our government got up there?  New stealth technology?  Then whythe lights?  I also thought the lack of sound could have been some formof some top secret frequency cancellation system that the governmentis checking out.  But still, why the lights?It didn&apos;t hit home that these could possibly be UFO&apos;s until I heardpeople talking about it on Friday.  Then I knew I had seen somethingthat was definately unexplainable.

I was sitting in my patrol car at about 0300 hrs., when I noticed movement in the sky to the north. What I saw was a very large, triangular shaped object with off-white lights at each corner slowing moving from north to southeast. The craft could have only been maybe 300-500 feet high and there was absoulutely no sound coming from it. I watched in dis-belief and tried to make sense of it. I thought about the Stealth bomber, but wouldn&apos;t that at least make some sound? I could tell that this object was solid, as the middle of it darkened out the clear sky behind it. The lights seemed erie, not bright, but not dull, and they were steady, but also seemed to flicker. It took maybe two minutes for the craft to pass over me and as it began leaving my field of vision, I finally realized that I needed to follow it. I followed it for about another two minutes as it travelled southeast out of my city limits and Im not sure why, but I decided to stop my &quot;pursuit&quot;.

We video taped the object assuming that it was a weather baloon but not quite sure.  Over approximately a 30 minute time period we always had the object in sight but kept relocating in order to video tape it more clearly.

It was about 1,000 through 4,000&apos; feet in altitude.  Looked to be between 5-8mi away.I was driving west on FM 1960 about 5 mi.s east of FM 2100.  I had been working on a car and was at this time test driving it.  The event occoured at 20:47.  I was driving and looking at the stars since it was a CLEAR night. (visibility only distorted by minor upper- atmosphere turbulence)  I then noticed the object.  It caught my eye because of it&apos;s intense brightness.  I stared at it allowing myself to accuire a good sight of the object.  It possessed the likeness of a comet.  It was shaped as a &quot;tear-drop&quot;.  It turned out a tremendous light.  Even brighter than the moon on it&apos;s most radiant nights.  It&apos;s light was pure white with no distortion apparent.  There is a tall radio antenna with warning strobe lights situated on it; however, this is not at all what I witnessed.  The object, though described as a comet had none of a comet&apos;s properties; i.e.  A tail, haze behind the comet, small size and the other distinguishing features of a comet.  The object not only very brigh! t but also seemed to be very low (between 1,000 to 3,000&apos;) and able to acchieve great speed.  The object was headed west on about a 280 degree heading.   Although I was driving between 75-80mph it seemed to pull away from me unlike anything I have ever seen.  I attempted to try and keep up with it but I lost sight of it  when The trees alongside the road blocked my vision of the object.   Make note I live near an airport and I used to live near an Air Force base.  I know how planes fly and I know the acceleration an airplane can obtain.  But as this object was 5-8mi.s out.  For an airplane to accelerate such as this thing did it and to dissapear from my field of view it would have to have an extrodinary engine, acceleration rate, and exaust hider (afterburner, it would be needed if this were even to be tried).  I have NEVER seen such a feat.  This event escapes my mind.  I have been made fun of and discredited even by almost everyone, including friends.  Anything you could tel! l me would be GREATLY appreciated!!!! I have tried to find out if something was going on that night, plane problem, U.S. Military trial of new plane but nobody has said anything.  If you have anymore questions I can be E-Mailed at((address deleted)) I would like to try and resolve this matter. I am a very observant person.

Closes again and leaves no sign of existence.The following event has been something I have kept quiet about for almost one and  a half years.  It was not until I read an account on this site about a UFO sighting east of my area on 11-27-95 that I realized it might be UFO related.The  phenomena occurred on the night of 11-27-95.  At that period my wife and I would often walk around the hills of our small mountain town during the evening.   It was near 8 PM when we were ascending up a small gulch to the NE of our town.  I happened to look up the east hill slope and saw a large black area.  At that moment a light came on  in the area: it was a large hole in the ground about 50 feet long and maybe 30 feet wide.  It was slightly above us and about 170 feet away.   There was for a short time the sound of a motor, like that of an air-compressor.  The sound was a steady &lsquo;puut puut puut puut&rsquo; like a one cylinder engine.  The light illuminated the sides of the hole (actually it was very bright) and we saw the fresh surface of broken rock around the hole&apos;s sides.  As we continued to ascend the gulch I told my wife that it was probably the site of a new house being built.  I figured that it was a hole for a basement.  The light was bluish-white like that seen in !the older mercury vapor lights.  The motor sound only lasted a minute and once the light went off only come on again.  I assumed that the owner was in the hole doing work.  Other than wondering how such a hole was dug into solid sandstone I gave no special thought to the event.  I almost decided to walk over and look in but decided not to since the owner might not want me on his land.  We ended up seeing the hole from several heights (both from below and slightly above) and several angles as we walked on towards home.  Several months passed.  On 3-10-96 it was a fine Spring morning and my wife and I decided to go up and see how the new house was coming along.  As we topped the rise above the small gulch all that met our eyes was a smooth hillside covered with old weeds and grass with a few small stones.  Nothing appeared to have been moved for decades!  As a child I had read about such things, but that type of phenomena was one kind that I had refused to believe possible.", "This is a very delayed report: While stationed at the Alameda Naval air station in California. It was I believe early in 1979 when their was much publicity concerning the NASA &quot;Sky Lab&quot;. Much information was being given out via the media concerning the sky lab and it decaying orbit. It was being reported to the public by several radio and TV stations that sometime with a few days skylab would eventually fall to earth. I recall overhearing this on a late news segment. The broadcast also indicated that it would possible to observe the sky lab as it passed overhead. They news gave a general direction in which to look and a general time also. My now ex-wife and a friend went outside to attempt to watch for the ill fated sky lab. It was a very clear and calm night. There was no wind or other noises to speak of. We were watching the sky for about 20 seconds when from the northwest moved right overhead was a giagantic object. So large it covered the entire sky above us. The object was very dark possible either black (or it seemed to not reflect light). or opague. It had some very small dim white light placed in random order around its hull. It was completely silent. We heard no engine noise or any other noise for that matter. The object rotated approx 90% as it &quot;hovered&quot; slowly. it then moved off over the hoizon. As the object moved off we then observed the &quot;sky lab&quot; pass overhead. Which resembled a regular satalite as it passed", "Summary : Cluster of lights moving from West to East (I think) very slowly.  Similar to shooting stars, but much slower.I was driving on a well-trafficked road in Olympia (Division St.)  I believe this road runs North-South (I would have been driving North), although I could be wrong .  I noticed a cluster of lights in the sky, all of varying size, and all larger than stars.  There were more than five and less than a dozen, but I&apos;m unsure of the exact count.  If I was in fact driving north, then the lights would have been moving from West to East.  I was not the only one on the road at the time, and I know other drivers witnessed the event as well, because many were slowing down and craning their necks.  I also noticed some pedestrians pointing toward the sky in the direction of the lights.  I watched the lights for 10 to 15 seconds before they arced toward the ground as if they were falling, and disappeared behind some trees.  All the lights appeared to be moving at the same speed and in the same direction.  I am unsure of their color, although my initial guess would be white.  Also, my firs! t thought was that the lights were not aircraft lights, as in lightbulbs or some other electrically-produced lights, but were instead produced by flames or heat (which is why I compared them to shooting stars rather than planes).", "Summary : St. Charles, MO, before fireworks show.

It would move around the stars like as if going through some sort of maze.  I told my friend about it and we stopped the car, and stayed starring at it.  When it got to the point where we couldnt see it we drove ahead to see if we could keep watching.  We were both amazed at the fact that we knew this was something out of the ordinary.

I immediately thought it was odd and tracked it through the eye piece.  It must have been heading roughly due north since I only adjusted declination to track it. It appeared to be like an &quot;amoeba&quot; containing lights of red, blue and white.  It seemed there was distortion and the lights varied in position as if mildly bouncing yet constrained by individual points and still all part of the same object.  That described distortion was nothing like atmospheric and since I spotted the polar ice cap and terrain colors in a town near Houston, it seems odd.  I knew I was seeing something extraordinary and allowed my wife to look into the eye piece as I spun the declination knob at an appropriate speed.  Apparently I had only captured part of the object since she described the end section I had described plus a disc of lights numbering a dozen, half circle of red and half blue with two white lights!opposite each other outside of the circle.  Further, there were two fainter lights inside the circle and one outside towards the trailing section.  She reported sharper detail in some of the lights.  I moved back to view and had lost the object.  I scanned and found nothing.  We looked to the sky and saw nothing.  There was no noise.  We only got a few seconds each to look at it.  I&rsquo;m sorry I let my wife look since I may have been able to track it longer and get a better look.  I spent the rest of the evening tracking airplanes and could not get the same results.

It wasn&apos;t a plane or a satelite, I can say this with confidence as I live in a very tall building and frequently look at the sky at night through a pair of binoculars; and the cloud cover was too low to see any stars.", "Summary : LOOKED LIKE STARS AT FIRST THEN BEGAN TO MOVE IN ODD MANORMY MOTHER WAS DRIVING AND MY BROTHER WAS RIDING SHOTGUN AND LOOKING THROUGH THE MOONROOF OF THE CAR HE CALLED TO ME TO OBSERVE 2 STARS WHEN I LOOKED AT THEM THEY SEEMEDTO DROP OUT OF THE SKY THEY BEGAN TO SORT OF CHASE EACH OTHER WE WATCED FOR AWHILE AND THEN THEY STOPPED, WENT HIGHER INTO THE SKY AND HOVERED THERE LOOKING LIKE STARS", "Summary : I SEEN  A UFO WHEN I WAS ABOUT 13 YEARS OLD. THE YEAR WAS ABOUT1970,  IT WAS IN THE FALL IN COLUMBUS OHIO. AT FIRST I THOUGH I SAW A BLIMP WITH LIGHTED ADVERTISING (THE KIND THAT IS COMPUTERIZED) OFF IN THE SKY BUT IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE CLEARLY. A UFO WAS THE LAST THING ON MY MIND. BUT AS I STARED AT IT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS  ITSTARTED COMING DOWN TOWARD ME  FROM THE SKY AND HOVERED JUST IN FRONT OF ME  ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT WAS DEFINITELY A SAUCER SHAPE AND IT  WAS SILENT, IT WAS GOLD AND THE CENTER OF IT  LOOKED LIKE REVOLVING MIRRORED PANELS THAT NOW I WOULD SAY WERE SOLAR COLLECTORS BUT BACK THEN I HAD NO IDEAL WHAT SOLAR POWER WAS. IT WAS IN THE AFTERNOON ON A CLEAR DAY WITH THE SUN SHINING ON THE CRAFT FROM BEHIND ME SO I DEFINITELY SEEN IT IN THE BEST LIGHT POSSIBLE. IT JUST HOVERED THERE FOR A SHORT TIME ANDTHEN JUST FLEW UP AND AWAY FROM ME TO THE RIGHT  VERY FAST AND OUT OF SITE. AT THE TIME I WAS HEADED FOR A WOODED AREA WITH A BB GUN IN MY HANDS. I DO NOT KNOW IF THE GUN HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ITS INTEREST IN ME BUT I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN  THE REASON. IF I HAD NOT SEEN THIS I THINK THAT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THE UFO STORIES THAT WE HEAR OF. I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANY BEINGS FROM OUTER SPACE COULD TRAVEL SUCH A VAST DISTANCE BUT MAYBE IT&apos;S JUST BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION. SOMETIMES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SECRET MILITARY AIR CRAFT OR TEST CRAFT BUT I SAW IT OVER 25 YEARS AGO AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE IT SINCE. BELIEVE ME OR NOT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND ABOUT WHAT ISAW. I CAN&apos;T EXPLAIN WHERE IT CAME FROM BUT I CAN TELL YOU WITH CONVICTION THAT FLYING SAUCERS DO EXIST.

It caught my eye because of the straight line and how bright it was.  I was watching it and trying to figure out what it was, when it slowly started fading away, and then it was completely gone.

We were hoping to see a clear night so we could later come back and photograph the comet.We drove out to the airport farthest from town. The road going in is dirt, and scary, but he grew up here, where I am from the east coast of the states. To me, it was extremely dark out, even with the clear sky.When we arrived at the final part of the road into the airport, we were facing an south easterly direction. In front of us in the sky, were some objects flying from east to west, as best I could tell.I asked my husband to stop, and we got out and watched them fly just under mars and disappear. Later I discovered he had seen two objects closer to the horizon, flying west to east, and flying in a closer formation than what I saw. They were orange in color, and round in shape, but also very far away.They were also flying to fast to be the usual satellite, and too high up to be a plane.I&apos;d seen a light like that last year while looking up at the comet of 1996, while at a pit stop, so I didn&apos;t think much of it.There is a light at the actual airport that didn&apos;t give us very good viewing of the comet, so we drove back onto the road where we could see. We looked around, and decided to go back home for the camera as picture taking would be excellent, and saw a car comingtowards us. He started up the car, and we took off to home, when out of my window, facing mars, I saw the light returning from the west...just one. I asked him to stop again, I see it I said. As soon as I said it, the object turned straight towards usand I started to scream to him, oh my God, it&apos;s coming at us! They&apos;re coming for us! I was so scared, and it seemed to fly from a high altitude to a lower one, at which point I began to get very afraid, and I started to yell at it to go away, that we didn&apos;t want it here, and it couldn&apos;t take us.By the time he had stopped and turned off the car, the object was already speeding away up into the sky, and as he jumped out of the car, I saw the last of it disappear.It happened so quickly, and I was so afraid that we went home to calm down a bit....he still wanted a picture of the comet, and I wasn&apos;t about to stay home alone, so I went with him, and we saw nothing, probably because we were prepared with a camera this time!Just this past weekend, a friend of ours said they saw something similiar flying over Hinton, around three am, when he was driving back from Edmonton.I also note that an earthquake, unusual for this area, happened the morning before our sighting, and was a 4.2 (?) located just southeast of Jasper. I reported this to a an association up here called AUFORA, but I haven&apos;t heard anything from them. We also checked the flight log at the airport when we went back, andthere was no flight recorded, although there was a plane landed from out of town, and a few unoccupied cars.My husband and I are 30 and 24 repectively, and lead fairly normal lives. Both of us have art degrees, and are planning our first business venture as I write this.", "Summary : Woke up from sleep, out window over golf course saw dk grey hexagonal object possibly with something thin ( rope-like) hanging down from it , in the air.  Then slowly moved off to the east out of sight from my window.  No sounds heard.Was asleep in townhouse second floor bedroom with blinds open.

Could have been 5-6  objects clustered into one unit; or just one object.  May have had something hanging down from it (rope-like); but I was looking through open blinds that, of course, have cords that run vertically connecting them; so hard to tell.  Sat up to look more closely, and object slowly moved past upper left corner of window out of sight.  Today I heard about &quot;comets or space debris&quot; seen in sky here around 2115  last night.

It veered, in a wavering motion as if seeing it through heat, from side to side along its flight path, growing brighter then going dim or off at the apex of its pendular movement, then reappearing to the other side of its flight path as it grew bright again.  The movement along the path was reminiscent of a butterfly&apos;s erratic path, but this wasn&apos;t erratic. The four light panels/spots were also similar to a butterfly&apos;s in that the forward two were slightly larger or brighter than the rear two.  The object came from the east, continued west, and eventually veered to the N/NW.  This occured on a completely cloudless night at approximately 2335.  The sighting only lasted as long as it took the object to pass.  The speed required to continually make the turns it was making was what really caught my eye as not being any typical craft. No flying object in my experience flies or lights up like that one did. over; perhaps 5 minutes at most.  My best guess as to its velocity would place it between 200-300kts.

We are military brats so know aircraft. This was weird. My girls got scared because i kept saying that whatever it was it wasn&apos;t normal. I expected to see an article in the paper about it. A nova star? Perhaps it was the planets aligning that night? It had teh steadiness of a star or planet but it was very bright. At one point there seemed to be three interior lights, a little less bright. I thought it was my eyes but my wife and two kids saw it too. I went to California a week later and told a friend who said a similar light was reported in Santa Barbara on NOv 15 but it was reportedly a rocket launch.

Lights started to appear &amp; move at great speed in all directions &amp; angles. We counted at least 30 or more. It was like play, as there was no pattern to moves. They cavorted all around each other. This lasted 1 hour. Just before dawn,about 5 am, one craft broke away &amp; swooped down towards us at great speed.  It did a pass over our heads &amp; disappeared into the dawn sky very fast. It showed us a definate round flat disc as it came close.

Prior to the event I had said to myself that I travel this section of road when going to work but this was a different time of day. Felt very alert during event , as if taking a college final exam.The event lasted more than 4 seconds because I did so much thinking while it was happening. Estimate 14 seconds based on all my thoughts. I remember thinking during the event that this light was from a star that had been engineered by intelligent  life to improve the quality of light above the quality of sunlight. Just thinking this takes 3 or 4 seconds. My nephew was 15 years old and never had any dreams he could remember. His first dream he ever remembered was when he was about 23. I slept well that night. I am baffled by the event. It isn&apos;t logical. When I drive I sometimes look off the road for 2 or 3 seconds. 4 seconds would be a little dangerous and that is why I feel the event took 4 seconds. The light came on and ! went off instantly. My nephew&apos;s feet were positioned such that his toes were slightly pointing towards the toes of the opposite foot. His heels were touching his seat.

My first thought, Helicopter, but no sound was heard, from anything, when I think about it.approx (3) white smaller lights traveling with it. I&apos;m starting to wonder if we were looking at something that , maybe..droped us off?I know how that sounds. This is gut feeling purely.First, this is all in retrospect, accuacy would require meeting with ex-girlfriend due to my lack of memory regarding anything prior to that sight.Sholl Canyon Park, top of Glenoaks Blvd, in Glendale, CA. A park is there where we would go to spend time  together, ie, the view..a couple thing. I recall being in the middle of the street with her, walking uphill, it seems we both recognized it at the same time.  Three points of lights (all red) forming a triangle shape.  We were walking up hill maybe eastbound  facing the mountains, Mt Wilson to be more accurate.  What got our attention was my saying, &quot;shsss, I can&apos;t hear anything&quot;  Approx; (3) other white lights were in it&apos;s immediate vacinity. I say approx, because the Burbank Glendale skies are always lit up considering the Burbanks airport. My closest comparison would be this description. I though maybe it was three different helicopters flying in a triangle formation.  Being that the lights were lower that the top of Mt wilson, that tells me it was very close ( a few miles if that) Only no blinking lights that usually gives us a human identification. I don&apos;t know if yo!u could see through the center   because it was the same color as the backround mountains, which is black. Anyway we both stood like dazed children, lost in the middle of the street. And watched it move slowly north untill it looked like it vanish behind Burbanks city lights. not once did we here anything we could associate with what we know is in our skies.  And for some reason I dismissed it and labled it three helicopters., because if it wasn&apos;t three different light sources generating that triangular or greater than sign &quot; &lt; &quot;  tilt that about 90 degrees, so that the bottom light is where the rear propeller would be a single craft. If it wasn&apos;t 3 choppers, then it was truly massive in my eyes. No sound what so ever, no wind no traffic, no nothing but us talking and saying &quot;look at that!&quot; &quot;what is that&quot;? &quot;shhh, let me listen&quot; In retrospect, I wonder, is it a valid possibility, ...ok, hear it go..that we were looking at something that dropped us off?..I&apos;m not mental or at lea!st no ones labled me that, yet. I say this because, we simply did not have the excitement that I feel now. It&apos;s like remembering a faint dream, or just residue of a dream.

While the others were still inside I looked up at the stars for no particular reason. In the northwest sky, just above the big dipper I noticed about 6 orange amber dots in a V formation moving north above the big dipper. I told the others &quot;hey come check this out&quot;. One dot in the V seemed to be moving in towards one leg then back out, yet keeping pace with the formation. We moved to the backyard to get a better look. As this formation started to fade it seemed to rotate into a circle formation just before disappearing. The formation definitely seemed as though it was very far away (not in our atmosphere), and possibly leaving our planet. I have seen shooting stars and satellites many times before.

It was very visible against the Superstition Mountains. It moved slowly from north to south and back again in what appeared to be a ric-rac pattern. It was quite large, I agree with the others who put their arm up and measured with a closed fist. It appeared triangular in shape, I related it to a &quot;squashed&quot; pyramid. I saw three very bright white lights, one in each corner and one at the top of the  &quot;pyramid&quot;.  In the center was a very, very bright pulsating red light, bigger in circumference than the three white lights. I would describe the white lights as three powerful strobe lights.

At first it was a small orange body giving me the impresion that I was looking at another meteor but the object just got larger and brighter, after seeing the object grow in size and brightness it continued to travel across the sky with a slight wobble in it path (like viewing a object through hot air). This wobble lasted for about 30 seconds then it continued to travel in a stright line. Its speed also slowed down as it crossed the sky. As it passed overhead the bright orange glow started to disapate. This allowed me to make out a flashing light on the upper surface of the craft the light flashed about every second.

We were on the first floor of a building on the south side of the street.&gt;From our angle near the window, we could see over the top of the buildings to the north of our position.  People on the street were screened by the opposite buildings, and people farther inside the room where we were could not seeout over the buildings due to the low overhang of the window.Both of us, at the time, were in the Navy base stationed in San Diego.  Both of us held jobs in navigation. We were usedto using our eyes to identify far off lights. I have heard over the previous four yearsmany stories from veteran sailors, of many instances in the last few decades that ships have actually followed {or been followed)by UFO&apos;s on the open sea.  Before this happened, though, I was unsure of the truth to many of the stories.  Whilelooking to the north over the buildings across the street, I noticed two, bright red lights up in the sky.  What caughtattention is that one of them moved back and forth across the sky in an extreme fashion, though the arc of movement wassmall, maybe two or three degrees.  The speed with which the object moved was incredible.  At this time I pointed it out tomy friend  He also looked up and was immediately transfixed.  I am unsure of the exact length of time that we watched the objects, because the event was eleven months ago, but it was probably about sixty seconds.  During that time the two lights would hover for a few moments and then move in formation.  At the end, they both accelerated away at a very high speed. Aftertalking about it for a few days, we soon dexcAfter we witnessed this, we looked around to see if anyone else had been watching.  As mentioned before, we were the only onesthat had a vantage point.  We tried to think of any possible explanation for the sighting. We quickly eliminated jets orhelicopters, celestial bodies, or reflected light.  We had no idea what the lights were.  At the time, I did not really know anybodythat we could tell.  I recently bought a computer.  I soon found this site.

I noticed its approach and then realized that it had a unusual, triangular-shaped aircraft flying close and to the left of its tail.  This craft? was about 1/4 the size of the UAL plane, triangular-shaped, flat, light grey color. Why?On Feb. 17, I was returned from Chicago on a United Airlines flight to Ontario, CA at about 10AM in the morning. We were flying at about 32,000 feet and the weather conditions were very clear.  Approaching us from the south going north and a bit easterly, I noticed another aircraft flying beneath us.  I am no expert, but I could identify the aircraft as a UAL aircraft. What originally got my attention was that it didn&apos;t seem too far beneath our flight and it seemed so clear because of the lack of clouds, dust, etc.  Then, I noticed that something (another craft?) was tagging along with it, rather close and off the left side of the UAL&apos;s tail.  When I looked closer, I couldn&apos;t figure out what it was or why it was following so closely.  I am not sure of the model of the UAL aircraft, but the &quot;unknown&quot; flying with it was about a quarter of the UAL&apos;s size, triangular shaped, point forward (but the forward point was slightly rounded toward the tip).  Its color was a flat, light g!rey - not shiny as a usual, unpainted aircraft would be.  It was as though the two crafts were flying in formation - that close.I keep them plain in sight until they had passed completely beneath our flight.There is probably a logical explanation for this, but it seemed very strange to me and when I review the sight in my mind, it still seems strange.   Others on the plane may have noted it, but no one else mentioned it.  I was sitting in a row next to a window, just forward of the leading edge of the aircraft, by myself.  My husband picked me up at the airport in Ontario and I mentioned it to him right away.  He guessed maybe it was some kind of target or balloon, but it did have some depth to it, yet nothing on top that I could see which might be like a raised cockpit area, nor did it have any tail(s) or projections, nor any indentation on the back edge like I have seen on some experimental aircraft.  Strange color, too, not too noticeable in the distance and if it had not been so clear, it might have disappeared into the desert sands and dust.  If there is an obvious answer to this one, I would appreciate some feed back.  Thanks", "Summary : Giant white streak moving across the sky at a high rate of speed stopped and took a 90 degree turn and went straight up  and eventually vanished into the night sky.

It was low to the ground, sort of shadowing the top of the trees. In other words the craft was following the contour of the landscape. As it got closer the light divided into two lights of which they appeared to be some type of flood light. It also looked like shafts of light the farther away it got. It proceeded to come in and the closer it came to the road the lower it got. I was so amazed with the sight that I stopped the car and got out, my wife was in the car with me. I had completely cut the motor of the vehicle off. This craft was flying soundlessly over the road and us.  It was shaped like a rectangular box, with a slanted plexiglass looking windshield.

They were aprox 50 miles away travelling extremely fast thru a 90 degree arc in aprox 10 sec. One turned sharply right then sharply left back to its  original course. The other followed seemingly to the millimetre. Finally at about s/w they turned right &amp; disapeared into the distance. I rang the Victorian UFO Society who had received reports of UFO&apos;s in the areas we viewed 40 to 50 miles away. My son also witnessed them. Too fast &amp; cornered too sharp to be anything we Know.Just prior to closing shop I had been informing the boys about comet Hale Bopp which should be visible at the end of the month; this conversation natuarally induced me to look at the sky once exiting the factory. The first thing which I believe caught the corner of my eye from the N/W was the speed of the two objects then the colour. I stared at them trying to define what they were. My curiosity turned to astonishment when one object turned hard right. ( I then yelled to my son &quot; check out the pink lights&quot; which he sighted directly without assistance) the object then banked hard left to its original course. To further my astonishment was the second object which followed the first through its flight path seemingly to the millimeter as if they were playing follow the leader. The objects continued on their course until they were aprox s/w where they turned right and rapidly disapeared into the distance.1/ Due to comprehending(as best my mind can) distance to the nearest star 4.2 LY which may support planets  I have never really believed in UFO&apos;s. Now not so sure.2/I am an amatuer astronomer &amp; therefore familiar with the night sky; I know the differance between stars,planets,satelites,lights &amp; reflections,planes, balloons, distance etc. These objects were definately none of the above.3/I would estimate these objects to be aprox 50 miles away.4/Today I received notification of one sighting in Werribee &amp; 2 sightings in Melton verifying our sighting and placing the objects at the same time and flight path.5/They travelled thru an arc of about 90 degrees in about 10 secs aprox 50 miles away.Too fast for anything known to me.6/They were at aprox 40 deg altitude.7/ They cornered to sharply for anything known to me. Very direct 45deg right/45 deg left- no arc.8/Referring to a map with the information available it is possibble they did a Zig-Zag turn to avoid flying directly over Melton or another small town in that proximity.9/It was possible to see they were solid egg shaped objects emitting a pinkish glow.10/They were to far away for sound if they making any.11/Both I (age 40) &amp; my son (age 20) believe what we saw to be controlled flight, flying solid objects without obvious propulsion  outside the limitations of anything we know.", "Summary : A wedge shaped object flew over head of us as we stood on our deck in our backyard.

I was getting cold and it seemed like the eclipse wasn&apos;t really getting &quot;full&quot;, I was getting ready to head in and I noticed a very faint light, like a blur, kind of like when a search light goes across the sky.I looked back up and I seen 4 very soft or faint lights directly overhead and very high up.  I looked up with my binoculars to get a better look and I could see 4 lights, shaped like a triangle with 1 of the lights sort of trailing off the back right one, closer to it than the rest were to each other.  I watched them through thebinoculars for about 10 -15 seconds before they were out of sight.  The whole thing happened in about 20 - 25 seconds.  The lights were very faint sort of a hazy yellow color.  The sky at the time was crystal clear, about 10 minutes before the &quot;sighting&quot; the last of some clouds had passed by.  In comparison to any airplanes flying aroundtonight these lights were probably 3 or 4 times as high and 10 times faster.  I didn&apos;t hear any engines.  The whole thing is a bit of exciting also a bit of alarming, its the first time I&apos;ve ever seen something in the sky and couldn&apos;t figure out what it was.  It might have been military stuff but I don&apos;t think so, it was really very fast.I would just like to know what it was, I figure with all the people observing the eclipse tonight someone else should have seen it too.

I am still bewildered. I was at a friend&apos;s place discussing a future project. About 10:20 PM I left the building to go back home. I got out of the side door and walked across the parking lot. The sky tonight is fairly clear, except a few clouds here and there. Suddenly on top of the clouds I saw what I first thought a cloud moving faily quick towards the North. As it passed the small group of clouds it was actually a group of five circles in some V formation, with 4 of the cricles on the right side, and one on the left. They were, and I noticed, evenly spaced. The color was some sort of light gray, paler than the clouds. I look down then up and it was still there, moving at a nonchalant speed direction North. Wow! Whatever it was it faded in the sky as it moved away (not because it disappeared, but because of the distance). I ran back to  my friend Mike&apos;s place and tried to reach him but the intercom was dead (usual). I ran under is porch and yell! ed his name. He and his girlfriend ran down to see what was happening. After telling them and looking for a while (it had been gone for a few minutes by then) I ran upstairs and drew what I saw on an envelop ( 4 frames ). Don&apos;t take me wrong, I am not a hardcore disbeliever, but I tend to believe that everything can be explained (especially UFO cases) but this one is a little tougher. It was not a reflection on the clouds, it was on top of them (they were really sparse too). It was not an airplane, it was too high. I called places to find out what the ceiling was but I could not find a place that would report that. I got on the web trying to find something and I got here by curiosity. It was not balloons, it travelled to fast (when I say it, I mean the formation). The formation was going at the same speed throughout the experience. I don&apos;t know what it was! I need to find out what the cloud ceiling was tonight a top Montreal so I can make approximations as to the size of the circles. Also was there a radar somewhere that could have recorded this?

It then occured to me that it was in the wrong area to be either leaving or arriving at the airport. I then noticed that the lights which I had though were the wing tip lights, (which as you know blink red and green) were only white and that they were blinking in a circular pattern. There appeared to be a red light on the underside of the object which did not blink. The white lights were very bright and continued flashing the entire time that the object was visible to me. The object appeared to be cruising very slowly approximately 1 to 2 miles away. I could not hear any sounds coming from the object even though it is very quiet at that time of morning.The object appeared to be circular in shape but overall was similar to the shape of a derby hat with a domed section on top. from my vantage point I would estimate the size to be approximately 25 feet in diameter. As ti travelled I eventually lost sight of it as trees in the area blocked my view. I am a 45 year old male, I wear glasses and the other observer was my son who is a 15 year old male, he does not wear glasses. The entire sighting lasted approximately 2 minutes.", "Summary : It looked like a star that was moving across the night sky.  But it stopped and changed direction again and again.  It changed color and became up to 5 separate lights always moving closer to us.  Near the end we could see spotlights from the craft(s).  It disapeared straight up so fast it could not have been man made.We were all camping, and sober.  It was green at first and when it was clear it was not a star or satalite it changed into up to 5 lights.  They were all changing colors sometimes when forming shapes.  Squares with the bottm red and top green.  Then a diamond all blue then white.  We watched for 25 min. then our vision was blocked by a rock face.  We all discussed what we saw and decided if we climbed on top of this rock and we were able to see it again it was certainly not our imaginations.  we viewed it again from on top of this rock face for 20 min more.  We could now see spot lights coming from it- them...  It continued to change the shapes it was forming and color of the lights that were visable. The spotlights were changing color too.  It went back to a single light, brighter than it was befoe.  Then it changed in to 3 then 5 then 9 lights forming a hoop of white lights only.  No other colors just white.  It accelerated to the west and upward so fast that the hoop i! mprint of light was visable for atleast a full second after it was gone.  If it was man made I would like to meet the men who built it-them.  We were all pretty quiet for the last min or so just watching, but when it flashed away that fast all of us screamed at the same time in aknowledgemnet.  Witnesses I am sure ((Name deleted)) of Ft.

We were near Carter Lake in Loveland, Co.", "Summary : A single point of light resembling a satallitebut moving very fast and making instant sharp turnsunlike any known object can.Me and my brother were sitting on the dock at our bay house fishing. My brothers attention was drawn away bywhat he believed to be a shooting star.He pointed at it but i was unable to locate it due to partial cloud cover, and its dimmness. He lost sight of it in the clouds, but regained sightof it comming out from the other side of the cloud. At that point he noted that the object made a course change of about 20 degrees and continuedout of sight over the horizon. The object followed an almost perfect north to south course untill the change which was slightly more to the east.I was unable to see this object as it was moving so fast it was gone in less than 10 seconds. There was no &apos;tail&apos; on the object, nor was theremore than one single point of light. its dimmness was equivilent to that of a satellite reflecting the sun in the evening and reflecting the suns light.After he settled down, and finished explaining his idea about it being a UFO, we went back to fishing, both of us now watching the sky.  Less than5 minutes later, the object reappeared, again from the north. this time I was the one who spotted it first and pointed it out to my brother. He confirmedthat it was the same object he viewed previously. With both of us watching, the object started a series of right angle turns that seemed to defy the laws of physics.It made about 6 or 7 course changes overhead and continued towards the south like origionally, and disappeared behind our bay house. It AGAIN reappeared out fromthe side of the bay house low on the horizon to the south over the gulf of mexico. at this point it was moving horizonally and was moving extremely fast the entire way.By extremely fast I mean like a shooting star moves fast. We both watched it move horizontally about 30-40 degrees across the horizon, then it turned again, in a very sharpzero curve turn to a northerly direction. It proceeded across the sky making one final course change of about 10-20 degrees comming to an almost perfect north direction andproceeded out of sight into the clouds along the north horizon.I need to note here that it is uncanny how familiar it is to the looks of a satellite in orbit. We both had the perception that the object was VERY far away. With the exceptionof a few low clouds, it was VERY dark and MANY stars were visible. I think city lights (like from Houston 60 miles away) would easily have drowned out the light.its my personal view that the object was not in our atmosphere.Also, i emphasize that every single turn it made had no &apos;curves&apos; in them. If you drew a right angle, thats the path it was following.I would have been more skepticle of what we saw, but increadibly, there was a report the following monday (we saw it on the first saturday morning following memorial day)in the Houston Chronicle (June 2nd i believe) reporting that there were 16 reported sightings of a UFO from Galveston Island. This island is approx. 80-100 miles WNW of ourlocation.", "Summary : Neon light blue ball passing east to west across the skyRound light neon blue ball from east to west horizon in a few seconds", "Summary : We had just moved into our new home and could not sleep.  At approx. 3:00 a.m. I noticed a glowing object in the eastern sky at about horizon level.  It was far enough away that when it moved around, the telephone and electrical wires were hiding it.  My husband asked me if I saw it and I told him yes.  We did not have the camcorder or binoculars unpacked, but we did have the site from his telescope.  You could see that the thing was changing colors from white to blue to green.  We live very close to an airport (practically at the end of the runway) and noted that there was no airplane activity.  This is very unusual for Lambert Field.  The next night at about the same time my husband and a friend saw the same light, but this time there were approx 3 objects doing the same thing as the night before.  They were convinved thath what they saw that night was a UFO.  My husband said they were much more active thath night than the night before when we saw it together.  I do not be! lieve it was a star and we have discussed if it was possible to be some type of new aircraft that McDonnell/Boeing could be testing.

If the object were a helicopter or an airplane, we would have easily heard it.  The light was similar in size and shape to the objects that appeared over Phoenix 2 weeks ago.  At the time, we were both students In Brookfield.  I was 10 years old, and my friend was 11 years old.  We had gone outside to &quot;look for&quot; UFOs, but we were not prepared for what we saw that night.

I looked down toward the busy highway and saw this bus like thing above the highway. I squinted and looked again. It was still there. In this valley, there are many dogs but they were not making a peep for hours. A few seconds later the valley erupted with many dogs going crazy all at once. I told my girlfriend Ester to come out and look. I said &quot;do you see that thing down there?&quot; She said yes, what is that? I said I don&apos;t know.

I work the early morning shift and at this time of year the sun hasn&apos;t risen yet.  I have been watching the sky a lot lately due to some very strange looking airplane lights, we have had a great deal of air activity lately.  Anyway, was watching a regular plane flying in the North and then I turned around to take the unleaded gas reading when I looked up and saw an auburn red dot floating across the sky.  At first I thought it was a falling star, because there was no sound, but then it darted to the left, not slightly it was a very fast long movement, and then it just disappeared.

When the object(s) were directly overhead, the very pronounced vibrations or rippling effect taking place between the lights (in the triangular shape) was very pronounced. Also, the object(s) flew south and through the Lakeland Airport traffic pattern -restricted fly space.", "Summary : Triangualar shaped object hovering in place.VERY close to the road,and this was a busy highway with people in front and behind.At night.Slow rotation.It was stelth black in shape of a triangle hovering extremly close to the highway to theleft of us.It was right above some trees and a street light turning slowly clockwise.A red light was at each corner and a large white light was in the center.There were other lights smaller and scattered.It was definately an equalateral triangle.For some reason when we were driving by I noticed it and pointed it out to the others and they saw it but would not admit it was unusual.I kept saying it was something not ever seen around here .Strangely everyone in the car began to refuse to look at it as if it were not there,but I knew it was,and started getting agitated with me and telling me to hush.When I had first pointed it out to my friend he got really frightened or excited and tried with me to show the people in the front but then he got all quiet.When I asked why he had stoped he just told me it must be something else like a street light.I have perfect 20 20 vision and that thing was only as far away as a hundred feet.Im also an artist and have a photographic memory,i know !i saw something.The people in the car with me seemed to be in denial the whole time.Now when I mention it to them they dont even remember what happened,they look at me like Im nuts.I even triedto talk to them the next day after it happened and they had no idea or memory.I was 15 then and have no history of hallucinations.This DID happen.P.S.

My husband and I were traveling to Tucson in February 1991 on a very dark night.  At about 10:00 I noticed a row of lights in the distance.  I thought there must have been a house on a hill with all its lights on.  It looked like it was about a mile or so away.  As we approached it appeared that the brightness of the lights suddenly increased, as if the &quot;house&quot; had tilted.  We approached a rest stop, about 20 or 25 miles east of Quartzite, Arizona, where the lights were hovering.  There were about six white lights in a row.  Since it was so dark I thought they were some high antennas over the rest stop.  I could see no object, only the lights.  We had never been there before and were not familiar with the area.  There were also two smaller red lights in the area that seemed to be slowly moving.  Since our car was traveling at about 65 miles per hour, I thought they were also antennas, but !thought it was odd that they seemed to be moving.  As we passed the white lights, I said to my husband, who was driving, &quot;There are some strange lights up there.&quot;  He only had an opportunity to glance up and see the white lights, but since they were quite high in the sky, perhaps 100 feet, he only saw them momentarily. As we passed, I looked back, and there were the same number of red lights on the other side, which were blinking somewhat randomly, not in any pattern.  We continued on to Tucson, and I asked someone who was familiar with that road if they ever saw any odd lights at that rest stop, and he said he thought he had, so I dismissed them as antennas.  On the way home, we took at good look at that rest stop during the day, and there were no high antennas and no hills or mountains nearby.  We have been on that road several times since then, and once we took a frontage road near that rest stop and noticed there was a power plant about 1/4 mile from there that could not b!e seen from the highway.  Last February my husband and I again traveled to Tucson at night and stopped at that rest stop to get a few hours sleep.  The only lights we saw were some red ones on a low post that were more or less vertical, and definitely much closer to the ground than the ones we had witnessed that night.  We have mentioned the sighting to a few people but never have officially reported it.", "Summary : Driving around Witch Hill area of Banks Penninsula, passed strange. There were 3 lights, not completely certain of their colour, They were in a stationary position. There was another white light which zig zagged around the stationary lights, and this light would move from extremely bright to dim, this light merged with the stationary lights, then a white flourecent looking ball appeared and passed us, dissappearing below the horizon of the hill, none of the lights made any sound, I ran to get a closer look at the lights, the other two were insistant that we get back in the car and drive around the Penninsula to get a closer look, we never sighted the lights again. This was all close proximity, approx 100-200 m.I really wish we had a video camera with us that night!!!", "Summary : Hwy12 &amp; 113,8 mi.SE of TravisAFB./Color-bright,shimmering,&quot;traffic light&quot;green/Elev.-2k&apos;/Char.-Silent,mutate frm- rnd(dime) to lg (silv.$),stretchout in lngth ($bill),sep.to 2,back to rnd, fade sml(pin pt),strt overTom and Mary noticed this lightshow while traveling East onHighway 12 toward Rio Vista.They stoped where Highway 113T&apos;s into Highway 12 from aNortherly direction. 3 othervehicles were pulled over alsoobserving the phenomenon. Noneof the witnesses talked witheachother so no information wasexchanged.  Tom and Mary calledthe local paper, the DailyRepublic and a small articlewas written.No other witnesses have beenfound yet, however, CharlieGoodyear whom wrote the articlefor D.R. stated that he hadtalked to a Capt. Robert Kirbyat Travis. In his article hestates, &quot;Officials at TravisAir Force Base did get onephone call around 10:30 p.m.Saturday from an unidentifiedwoman reporting a mysteriouslight in the sky.  But airtraffic controllers and basepersonnel noticed nothingunusual, Capt. Robert Kirbysaid.&quot;  When I interviewed Tomhe stated, &quot;They couldn&apos;t havemissed it if they were evenlooking out the window!  Theywould have needed sunglasses!&quot;Charlie Goodyear checked withlocal police and sheriff&apos;sdept. and found there were noreportings of the anamoly. Ichecked with the local firemarshall whom is in charge of,and lives in, the range landswhere the incident occured.  Hestated he was not aware of theoccurance or anyone reportingit, but would call me if heheard anything.According to the witness&apos;sdescriptions, this light didnot move across the sky and didnot seem to originate from aphysical object, but simplyexisted as its own source withno density. No noise could beheard and it did not travel ormove from its active location.It would however, shift andtransform from being round(size of dime), then enlargingto round (silver dollar), thenwould stretch out &quot;like gum&quot; inlength (dollar bill), thenseparating into two. Then itwould come back together like around dime and would then fadeout to size of a pinpoint, likea TV tuner turned off. Then itwould come back repeating theprocess. Witnesses stated thisprocess repeated about 6 times.One time upon separation, thetwo lights  moved diagonally toeach other, like a &quot;chevron&quot;with 2 strips, shimmering likea reflection on water.Eventually when fadeing itnever came back. While cloudswere scattered through the skysthe area where the lights wereshowing contained none. Tomstated he frequents through thearea quite often and is awareof regular air traffic due tothe AFB, however during thislight show no air traffic wasnoticed what so ever.The witnesses were interviewedtogether by phone.  Tom is 52,and is a grocer&apos;s clerk.  Maryis 50 and is a purchaser for anintercom company.  Both areinterested in spiritual/psychictype information, but do notkeep up with latest gossip orhappenings in that regard.Mary stated she did not read orwatch the news reports, andthat as she did not even knowabout the comet, until sheasked Tom one night what shewas seeing in the sky. Bothhave had a light interest inUFO&apos;s but again do not keep upwith latest gossip etc...Together through the interview,they seemed to mutually agreeupon their story, as theyshared enthusiasm andexcitement about it.  Neitherwould speculate as to what itwas they saw, except that theyboth &apos;felt&apos; it was not aterrestial source orphenomenon. Both did not feelfrightened by the expierienceand talked about it as apositive expierience. Therewere no physical effectsreported.  Witnesses reportedaprox. 5 vehicles passed onHighway 12 during theirstationary 5 miniute viewing.They found it strange that thevehicles passed as withoutnotice of the event.

Populationwithin the sighting area issparse, probably 1 ranch forevery 2 sq miles. Communitiesclose enough to have possiblywitnessed the light show wereBirdslanding, Rio Vista, Dixon,and possibly eastern Fairfieldand Suisun.  All aresurrounding the proximitywithin 15 miles.  Birdslandingis the closest within 5 miles.Attempts were made to locateaddtional witnesses with nosuccess. Contact was madeeither in person or by leavinga note, with ranches in theimmediate vicinity of thesighting location.Birdslanding, a rural communityof ranches, is directly acrossHighway 12,  may containwitnesses.  Many events of thisnature, in the past, have beenreported in the Birdslandingarea.  I made contact with thepostmaster for this area andgave her cards with a requestfor contact if she heardanything.  She readily agreed.I went out to view the site andcheck for any natural sourceswhich may explain this event. Idid so on 4/21 at 23:00 to gainperspective with a similarnight environment. It wasobserved that radio towersexisted aprox. 15 miles NE ofthe sighting area. Thesetransmission towers are highand thin.  2 of them had lightswhich were greenish and wouldflash on and off.  Both towerswere aprox. 3 miles apart andwould alternatly do this in aregular sequence.  Whileconsidering this as a possiblesource it was eliminated whilereinacting their viewpoint.The towers were to far off inan easterly direction and theirproximity to the horizon couldnever have contributed to thesize and altitude of the event.Additionaly the descriptionwhich was given did not matchthe constant sequence in whichthese towers flashed.Daytime observation of the areawas also made. No otherpotential sources were noted.Witnesses will provide markerdrawings in a followupinterview in two weeks.  Thisalong with any further datagathered will be forwarded atthat time.", "Summary : While driving at dusk my daughter and I noticed an airplaine flying up in the sky w/ it&apos;s lights on heading in an easternly dirtection to Green Airport.  We were driving on route 1 heading north onto route 4 Just as we came to a location on rt.4 near a combination miniture golf/batters cages/golf hitting range that is when we noticed the airplaine w/ it&apos;s lights on.  In this same are there are no tall trees and the area has a considerable panoramic view.  The air plaine was a couple hundred feet in the air, and I had a view of about  100 to 120 degrees.  A friend of mine has informed that jet airliners go a maximum speed of about 200-250 mph.  I would assume that the airplane was going less than 200 mph if it was heading for a landing at green.  No sooner than I had seen this plane I then saw another plane above the 1st,  it was 2 time the hight of the 1st it too had its lights on and both had a triangular look to then. BUT as I watched both airplane&apos;s the 2nd passed the 1st as if it was standing still.  W/ in  5 seconds it was compleatly out of my sight as it to headed easterly direction. I would estimate that the other plane?!?!? was going about 10 time the speed of the 1st.  Even my youg daughter mentioned &quot;look at that dad&quot;I have a back ground in science/natural history.  I have seen the jets at the airshows in the summer at Quonsett base at the old sea-bees base.  The only time I have ever seen them disappeare that fast, they were close to the  ground.  I would estimate that both objects were about 1000 feet to 1/2 a mile away. Since it was dusk and dark I could not see  much except that both had a grey outline and both had their lights on.  dividing my windsheld up into 10 units by the time the 1st airplaine went one unite the second had disappeared.  I would basicly estimate that the 2nd object/plane was going 10 times the speed of the 1st. So if the 1st plane was going about 180 to 200 mph then the 2nd&quot;plane/object&quot; was going about  1800 to 2000 mph or more.  I have never seen a &quot;plane&quot; dissapear from my field of view like that in my life.  I have never seen a ufo in my life but because of the speed that this &quot;plane&quot;  was  going and that it dissapeared out of my viewing area w/in 5 + seconds I thought I should report this. I do not want to leave my name because I have heard about another person who has witnessed triangular and cigar shaped ufo&apos;s here in RI and that this same person who has recorded these ufo&apos;s, has since reported them on line.  I was also told that since this person reported these sightings several months later but use his own computer.  Later I was told that the ufo reporter was literally  visited by people in a white lincoln and the &apos;visitors&apos; were taking pictures of this persons house.  These visitors stoped the picture taking only after having their picture taken by the person who made the ufo reporting.  I was also told that the visitors inthe white lincoln had no plates on it at all, because they had watched it arrive and leave.  In fact on its way in twords this persons house, a cop had stoped the white lincoln and then left the lincoln alone. Depending who these people  in the white lincoln are be it &quot;men in black&quot; or &quot;government military personell&quot; I for one do not want my life subject to what ever hell these people put  ufo reporters through. All my daughter knows of ufo&apos;s is what she saw in the men in black video, I don&apos;t want her or myself subjected to anysort of &quot;interogation terror tactics&quot;.

The movements were smooth and not jerky or bobbing (like balloonswould do) then sped off to the south faster than any wind might propell them.  I waswishing I had a pair of binoculars as they grew smaller above a building to the south.When I first saw them circling each other it appeared almost as if they were linked bya tether since they moved in tandem, but then when their path became straight they seemedto be at a greater distance appart than if this were the case.  Strangely, a dark heli-copter was circling the area directly above the closest approach of the objects at the time.It performed a pretty tight loop that seemed to focus on the area and was quite low as well.I looked up at it only two or three times and didn&apos;t notice any markings.  It didn&apos;t strikeme as a traffic helicopter and was in the wrong location if it were so if they were doingtheir job.  After the sighting I pondered whether what I saw were ballons, but this possibilityjust didn&apos;t seem to fit.  I didn&apos;t notice any wind that could account for it and the windusually comes from the west off the coast.  These objects flew from north to south.  Asmentioned in the abreviated report, the first two objects were followed by two more on thesame path, but without any circling maneuvers.", "Summary : Round silvery disk quickly passing from W to E in a straight lineI was enjoying the weather from my second- floor apartment deck on that fine Saturday July 1, 1995 afternoon. The 2pm (PDT) sky was partly cloudy, mostly evenly scattered cumulus with a clear blue sky behind them. I am sometimes given to looking straight up into the sky in search of high-flying raptors or other soaring birds. As I looked directly overhead,I noticed something moving well above the cumulus clouds. It was a silvery object about the size of a dime held at arm&apos;s length moving in an unwavering straight line from west to east. I watched as it passed behind the clouds which were moving so slowly as to appear to be completely still. I would not want to hazard a guess as to its altitude or airspeed. My first thought was that it was simply a weather balloon. (In fact, I&apos;m still leaning towards that explanation.) As I studied it I wondered if it was in fact not silver, but translucent. It had a bluish cast but was darker around a well-defined edge and had no irregularities in its shape or surface. However, a few things didn&apos;t rest well with me. I&apos;ve seen weather balloons in flight before and this wasn&apos;t like either of them. This was perfectly round and had no visible payload. The others I had seen weren&apos;t nearly so symmetrical and were visibly balloons with something suspended underneath. Also, given that this object was well above the clouds, it would have been a *very* large balloon. As far as I know, there aren&apos;t any launch sites west of Portland used for such launchings. (That may just be my ignorance in this instance; the only launch site for high- altitude balloons that I know of is near Palestine, Texas.) I found it odd that it moved so much faster than the lower clouds, though of course the possibility of the jet stream comes to mind. I was also impressed that it moved in such a straight line. It covered about 30 degrees of the sky in 4-5 seconds. It disappeared behind a solid line of clouds banked up against Mt. Hood and the Oregon Cascades to the east. I have no idea if this was a *real* UFO or not. In fact, the most remarkable aspect of this incindent may simply be that I saw an ordinary thing in a place most people wouldn&apos;t ordinarily look--straight overhead--without some other motivation. It just to be odd enought to warrant reporting to you. Had I known how to contact anyone regarding this prior, I would have. When the UFO Center was on the news with the space junk reentry story, I knew where to go. If you need more info, contact me via email.

Went to investigate and then saw a large object in the eastern sky.  He called his mother who also went to investigate.  The first and what would also be the largest of the craft was the firstlight seen.  It was the brightest light we had ever seen in the sky except sun and moon.  The craft was triangular in shape with lights on the corners.  When it was right overhead, a small triangular structure could be seen on the underside.  It hovered for a while and then was approached by another smaller craft.The large one began to turn north west and the smaller craft followed.  The craft abruptly turned and went due north.  Then after they were overthe horizon, more of the smaller sized craft began to be seen from the south moving north.They appeared one at a time in approx. two minute intervals.

This had become our custom following a previous sighting I had seen alone in early August, 1995.  We live in Larimer County, Colorado, just south of the city limits of Fort Collins, approximately 2 miles from the foothills in front of Horsetooth Reservoir. We were positioned in such a way that our field of vision was to the south.  The sky was so clear that night that we remarked that the Milky Way was visible.  There was no moon visible at that time, although about a hour later, there was a full moon.For no apparent reason I looked over my right shoulder toward the NNW and saw clear skies.  Suddenly appearing in my field of vision was an object moving at what I guessed to be at cloud height.  There was no sound and the object moved fluidly toward the SSE, in the direction of Denver. The leading edge of the object seemed to be lit - possibly by the moon which had not yet risen but which may have been lighting the leading edge of the object from the east.    Also for no apparent reason, my wife turned her head and looked over her shoulder toward the NNW.  After having first noticed clear skies, the object suddenly appeared in her field of vision.Just at the moment that I realized what I was seeing, I said to my wife, &ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo;  Before I could finish the sentence, she responded &ldquo;God, I do.&rdquo;As we watched the object proceed toward the SSE, we had enough time to consider and reconsider what the object might be.  The object moved with the fluidity of a bird riding a thermal, but there was no evidence of any wing movement or a change in course that a thermal would create. The object was much too large to be a bird - at arms length it would take a baseball sized object to obscure its visibility.  The shape was reminiscent of the Batman symbol with a curving leading edge that almost made a half circle with a point in the center rear.  The object appeared to be more oval than round, wide rather than long, and the center point was less that half the radius of the implied oval shape.The object remained in our field of vision for 30-45 seconds, long enough to pick up, set, and focus a camera. (The prints came back black.)  There was enough time for the internal dialog of considering, &ldquo;Yes, I really see this - Yes, its really there&rdquo; to take place more than 4 or 5 times as we watched the object track directly overhead.  It then disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.  Our field of vision was such that we should have been able to track its movement longer than the object was visible.The object seen in the earlier sighting in August, 1995, was similar in size, height and flight path with the direction of travel being the reverse course, SSE to NNW.  The leading edge was illuminated by 4 rectangular blocks of light and the previously mentioned rear center point was not noticed.  The object also appeared and disappeared in the same sudden fashion at approximately the same positions in the sky.We would be interested in knowing if anyone else had observed this or similarly shaped sightings.  If so, please e-mail us at: ((email address deleted.))", "Summary : I was just about to goto bed and I looked out my window for some strange reason and I looked to the south and I saw this very bright light in the sky. The object was going up at a fast rate and when it went behind the clouds you could see the clouds! The object looked flat from a distance and it had no flashing lights on it to tell me that it was a airplane or heliocopter. It had two bright lights that were side by side with a small space in between. I opened my window and I couldn&apos;t hear a sound. I live in the country and there isn&apos;t a lot of noise that I hear besides crickets. It startled me a lot.

Then it got very bright and then it just disappeared.the object seemed very large and flat from a distance. There were two very bright lights side by side going upwards. no sound, no blinking lights to indicate it was a airplane or heliocopter. when it stopped, it was pulsing. very lightly.

We both witnessed the event for its duration and had both worked as National Park Rangers prior to this sighting.  I havn&apos;t reported this officially until now because I thought we were probably the only ones to see such a thing, and that few would believe us.  Recent news reports of sightings in that exact area promted me to write this in the case it could be helpful.  My fiance and I split up not too long after this event and havn&apos;t spoken since.  She could be contacted for independent verification, if someone wanted to do so.  She was really frightened by what happened and hence missed some of what I saw, but I think she saw the majority of what I am about to report.  The incidident:  I drove out cross-country to my favorite area in my 4Runner and parked it facing East, about 100 ya!rds from the edge of a long, low mesa extending North and South.  The landscape dropped off to the East towards the Little Colorado River and the Navajo Res.  We built a campfire near my lowered tailgate and began to enjoy the evening.  At one point, I was sitting on the tailgate facing West while my fiance was tending the fire.  I looked straight up at the sky, and in my peripheral vision caught sight of a blinking light.  At first, I just thought it was an airplane, but I noticed it wasn&apos;t moving at all.  Then, I noticed from 5-7 other blinking lights in the same general quadrant of the sky--and outstretched hand would probably &quot;capture&quot; the space they all occupied.  I think they were whitish blue, but they may have been light red (I&apos;m sorry, I really can&apos;t recall exactly) and were not blinking in unison.  None were moveing at all.  This is why I kept watching them and told my fiance to look at them.  Then, we saw a lazer-like pulse of light shoot from one to another.  I thi!nk I saw this happen 2, maybe 3 times.  Then we noticed a whitish yellow light--much like a distant headlight--travelling near the ground in the distance ahead (East) of us.  At first I thought it was a car or motorcyle--but I&apos;ve never seen any other person out as far as I went, and certainly never at night... About the time I was beginning to worry that it was someone travelling toward I light, it went up and then back down a few degrees offf the horizen.  It continued to repeat this as it travellied along.  Most of the terrain there is fairly level, so I started doubting it was a car.  I put out the fire and had my fieance turn off her headlamp (she was too scared to do so).  When I looked back at the whitish light, it was apparently moving in our direction--but I couldn&apos;t tell how far away it was...at one point I thought for certain it was only 50 yards in front of us.  But there was no sound at all, so I figured I must be wrong.  Then we looked back up to the sky to see if!the other lights were still there; they were.  But when we looked out to the East for the whitish light, it was gone.  Then I noticed the same bluish or reddish (I think blue) lights blinking in the NW sky!  They had moved from the SE to the NW.  And then, to the N, we saw the whitish light travelling along the ground again...going up and down periodically like no car or earthbound vehicle could have done.  I t was almost as if it was searching for something.  Then it disappeared and the lights in the NW sky were gone too.  We slept in the back of my truck and had a restless night&apos;s sleep.  It was the strangest thing I had ever seen (though we both did sight one UFO each when much younger).  I always wondered if the military was conducting some advanced lazer weaponry by sattelites--but this never does quite explain the white object hovering near the ground.....The next day, oberservations of the terrain in the directions we saw the white light made it even more clear that it!could not have been a vehicle.  Background information:  I was 33 at the time, and my fiance 29.  We both have bachelors degrees and some other training.  We were very healthy and didn&apos;t do any drugs or drink alcohol, etc.  We had each worked as National Park Rangers, and I was/am more of a skeptic than anything else.  I used to love to read the Skeptical Inquirerer!  Now I am more open to various possibilities, but I still thing it could have been some type of military operation.  I sure would like to know!

Saw the lights in the sky.  They were heading North horizontally arcoss the sky.  Very visible.  Other witnesses on the road in front of us thought they were UFOs bombs.  We didn&apos;t know, and we frightened.  When we lost sight of the lights it was not because they dissipated, but rather moved behind some trees and out of our range of vision.  Seemed to move faster than airplane, but much slower than shooting star. Local news is very vauge on what this could have been. Would like to find out more - what are the possibilities?  Wondering if it could have been a natural phenomenon, that no one has considered?  Could it be some military exercise, or experiment?  Mass in sky much larger than could be created by Russian rocket - mass would indicate debris from something the size of Washington State - can&apos;t think of anything man made that could have created that much debris in the sky, with the light so bright, rocket should have burnt out and dissipated.

As it began moving, I jumped out of bed and ran to the window watching as it rose above the tree level and house level.

On one night, these lights appeared to be performing some sort of synchronized movements, moving in large circles at antipodes from each other, and reversing direction.I just finished watching the special on the Discovery channel about the lights seen over Phoenix during March of &apos;97. I was impressed by the videos of the supposed &apos;flares&apos;, and was reminded of a similar occurance many years ago. Over the course of the month of January 1988, only on weekend nights as these were the only nights I was out, I witnessed in the western sky over Memphis, sometimes 2, and sometimes 4, bright amber lights similar in appearance, color, and &apos;texture&apos; to flames seen from a great distance. Each night after 0100, while driving south down Old Germantown Road, I saw these lights above the western horizon, in the direction of Memphis International Airport. Sometimes the lights merely hovered, or moved very slowly, almost too slow to notice movement, but on one occasion, my curiosity having been excited by previous sightings, I noticed two objects moving in a large circle, as though orbiting a central point- the circle being approxiamtely 3x the size of a fu! ll moon. The objects maintained a 180 degree opposition to each other as they circled, and once a circle was completed, they reversed direction to complete another circle, before reversing direction again. On this particular night (I cannot remember the exact date), I stopped the car to watch them, and sat parked for about 15 minutes before I got bored, having watched them perform 3 complete circles, so i continued on my way, sure that I would see them again on some other night. And I did, but never again were they so active as on that night. Since then I have seen similar phenomena which proved to be landing lights of comercial aircraft approaching over a great distance on a clear night: the same color and quality of light, the same apparent slow movement, but I have never before or since witnessed such a &apos;ballet&apos; in the sky. It seems remarkable and highly unlikely that any comercial or military aircraft could move with such precision being separated over so large an area as ! was suggested by the apparent distance from my vantage point, and even more unlikley that such aircraft could stop and reverse direction without slowing.  I have never before reported this because it seemed to me too weak a sighting to be of much consequence; I was never able to identify the objects as anything more than &apos;lights in the sky.&apos; But after seeing the Phoenix videotapes, I was amazed by the similarity to what I saw over those nights so long ago. These were not my only encounters during the same 12-month period, but it has been so long now, I don&apos;t that my information can be of much value. I am, however, interested in relating what I have seen, both in the sky and elsewhere, to interested scientific and documentary authorities.  If needed, i can supply photocopies of maps showing my position and the direction of the sightings.", "Summary : A loose formation of 3 orange non-blinking lights observed slowly crossing evening sky.A formation of 3 orange non-blinking lights was observed  11/02/97  18:50  Green Bay, WI  When first spotted by my mother[49], they were in a roughly triangular formation, moving slowly east.  She called for me to come outside and look at somthing.  I went out and watched them for about 5 minutes until the upper two were slowly enveloped in the cloud cover.  I went inside and got my SLR camera &amp; 400mm lens.  I went back out and looked at the remaining light, but the strong lens showed revealed no shape behind the light.  The other two lights now began to emerge from the clouds and the formation of the three was now close to linear and vertical.  I would estimate their distance to be about 2-3 miles.  I couldn&apos;t tell if they were making any sound because a helicopter was hovering 1.3 miles to the west, over the football stadium.  The orange lights had no accompanying aircraft-style strobes or red/blue positioning lights.  They did not move constantly, as a sattelite would and! the cloud cover was dense enough to obscure anything that high or faint.  I am 34 and I am quite familiar with the way civil and military aircraft move.  These lights moved similarly to helicopters, but had no regulation lights and didn&apos;t generate the sounds that a group of 3 military helicopters would make.  I asked a neighbor to look at them.  He did, but looked for 3 seconds, said &quot;Oh, airplanes&quot;, and went back inside.

I did not see Patty anywhere, until the beings parted for a split second, and i caught sight of them carrying her body out of the room, i was sure she was dead. i then directed my eyes toward the celing and saw an  object slowly and silently descending toward my stomach.  It resembled a very large needle, and it was then that i fainted.  i awoke in the morning laying beside Patty on the kitchen floor. We vaguely (at first) remembered what had happened.  We noticed three strange triangular marks on our bodies--one behind the left ear, one on our stomachs, and one on our lower back.  Now Patty and i feel that if we ever separate after this experience together, somthing bad will happen.", "Summary : Bright white object observed to the West at about treetop level, gained altitude and flew off silentlySaw a bright white object which appeared to be hovering at treetop level a few miles to the West of my home in Owings Mills Md. The light was pulsating about once/second, and was much brighter than any aircraft light I had everseen. After a minute or two, it gained altitude and flew off to the southeast. As soon as it stopped hovering, the light dimmed to a more normal level. As it flew off, I sawa blinking red light near the white one. Itwas too  dark to see anything of the craft itself.I initially thought it was a Helicopter with a searchlight, but it was absolutely silent.  We have helicopter overflights on occasion,both military and commercial, and, at thedistance I observed this object, they arequite easily heard. The neighborhood wasquiet, and I should have been able to heara helicopter. Also, if it was a searchlight,it was not pointed at the ground as one wouldhave expected with a helicopter.I am a 40 year old Electronics Engineer, and am a stable individual.

Hundreds saw it. The eve. news confirmed UFO.I was 13 at the time and was playing outside a church while my parents were in choir practice. It was dark. From the hill where the church sat, I could see the terminal station of the Sao Paulo subway system. Suddenly I noticed an orange light that changed intensity, sometimes changing to red. I called my parents and the other church members who came out to see. We were there for about 20 minutes. The location of the light was exactly on the path of the Sao Paulo International Airport (Congonhas) final approach. As airplanes would align with final, the light moved very fast and dissapeared, to reappear when tha plane had passed. Later that evening, channel 5 (Globo television network) reported the incident and interviewed several eye witnesses, who reported the same story. They also interviewed officials at the airport who reported an &quot;unidentified object&quot; on the radar screens at the reported location. Airline pilots also reported seeing the object. No further explanations w!ere given, and airforce officials declined to comment.The date is approximate, since I don&apos;t remember exactly when it happened. But it was around then.", "Summary : My cousin and I who were children at the time, watched a round, smooth, silent object which had a pinkish glow, come across his field from the direction of the Snoqualmie River.  It was about 20&apos;-30&apos; from the ground.  We were standing on his front porch.  It came in our direction and then stopped above a fruit tree directly across the driveway from where we were.  It was about the size of a VW Beetle, perfectly circular, with a triangular projection at the &quot;back.  My aunt had locked the front door to prevent us kids from running through the house.  I pounded on the door to get the adults to come out and see this thing.  My cousin said that when I started pounding and yelling, the object took off and streaked up over the mountain in the direction of the mountain (Rattlesnake mtn.), in the direction of Seattle.  Our parents brought us into the house and put us into different rooms and had us draw a picture of what we had seen.  Our pictures matched, and I remember that our par! ents believed that we had seen something.  The next day (as I remember it) my father told my mother that &quot;something &quot; was reported in the Seattle paper, streaking across the sky at about the right time for it to have been the thing we saw.  I was 9yo at the time as was my cousin.  We had both lived in Alaska and had watched airplanes and heliocopters landing near our home and knew that this was nothing like conventional aircraft.  It was perfectly silent; if we hadn&apos;t been looking we would never have known it was there.   It was completely featureless also. I remember people asking if there were windows or portholes or doors but we were firm that there were not.  We were very close to this object, no more than 50&apos; at the most.  It excited me and frightened me a little bit.  I thought that it stopped opposite us because it &quot;saw&quot; us.  I have never heard any other report of an object which looked like the one we saw.  It looked to me as though it had been manufactured, did not lo! ok like a natural object, was definitely not gaseous.  Anyone else out there ever see anything like this?  I am not sure of the date.  It is most likely that it was 1953 because I was still living in the Snoqualmie/North Bend area at the time and my family was visiting my cousin&apos;s family.  Interestingly and dissapointingly, my cousin does not remember the object as looking the way I describe it.  He now says it was silver and saucer-shaped.  It was not, and we agreed at the time on how it looked.  I remember being frustrated at not being able to really draw the way it looked.  I realize now that I couldn&apos;t replicate the geometrical precision of the thing.We were children of the same age, and had no background as such.  We knew nothing about &quot;flying saucers&quot; except that we must have heard talk about them because I remember explaining that it was not a &quot;flying saucer&quot;, it was round and had a tail.  My father was an employee of Seattle City Light and my mother did not work outside the home.  I was an only child at the time.  My cousin was one of 4 children,  His father was a logger and his mother was employed but I don&apos;t remember at what at that time.  We were semi-sophisticated kids in that we had traveled to Alaska by stemship with our families several times and had had the experience of living on the fringes of civilization as well as in the Seattle area.  Perhaps because I was an only child, I have an excellent memory and clear early memories. I realize that this is OLD information and not at all scientific but I don&apos;t know anyone else who has seen something like this so &quot;Up close and personal&quot;.  If I hadn&apos;t seen this thing! , I would never believe the reports I&apos;ve read about the objects other people have seen.  I empathize with the skeptics, it&apos;s just too fantastic.  But, since I have seen it, I can no longer doubt that there is something more to this world than we now &quot;know&quot;.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Summary : I saw  what appeared papers swirling high in the atmosphere. They changed into two huge white kite like objects which then turned into two blimp-like objects  which then began to fly southeasterly at the same height and rate as commercial jets, but were much bigger. As I began to lose sight of them, I called my husband on the west side of town (20miles away). He  saw what appeared as a shiny orb traveling southeasterly.Standing in my backyard, around 10 in the morning, I saw what appeared to be a jet in the northeastern sky. It was climbing very high  and very rapidly. Suddenly,in the northeastern sky I saw what appeared to be papers caught way up in the atmosphere . They appeared to be swirling downward. These &quot;papers&quot; took the shape of two huge white kite shaped objects  moving together. These then seemed to turn into  two huge white blimp shaped objects that were moving southeasterly one following the other at about the same rate and height as passenger planes. The sun was now striking them making them appear shiny. I called my husband who was on the west side of towm ( about 20 miles away). He saw  a shiny orb that seemed to zig-zag. From his angle he may hane been looking at the two objects  one flying lower than the other.

We were hypnotized for a minute than we screamed and ran home.See above.", "Summary : On this particular night my sister and I went out to our side porch to have a cigarette when she noticed something suddenly appear to the east.  An aircraft of some sort appeared suddenly, sped across the sky at an unbelievable rate of speed, and then vanished.My sister was the first to notice the object as she was scanning the sky to see if she could catch a glimpse of the Hale-Bop comet, when she grabbed my arm and told me to look.  I glanced up at the sky towards the east and saw what I thought to be a small airplane taking off from the local Sarnia Airport.  The craft was probably only about 300 or so feet off the ground, well below the scattered clouds.  It flew slow at first, and I noticed a very bright white light, which looked like it was coming from the side of the craft due to it&apos;s direction.  The light flickered very quickly a few times, went out and then came back on.  It was flying quite slow at that time. Then all of a sudden it accellerated, darted across the sky towards the west and Michigan untill we couldn&apos;t see it any more.  It looked to have four light type things, one at the front, back, and the side facing us.  The light at the side was a very bright white light, that looked like it was sort of pointed downward!  It was very loud and sounded like a gigantic jet engine roaring extremely loud. The lights on the front and on the back were much dimmer, and looked to be green.  Judging by the lights on it, it looked to me like it was sort of round or had very short wings.  What I mean is that all the lights looked as though they were exactly the same distance apart giving it a square or circular looking shape. As it flew further away from us there looked to be a cluster of about 20 small white lights giving off an enormous glare.  It looked like it was about the same size as a fighter plane would be.  Once whatever it was sped up it moved across the sky faster than anything I&apos;ve seen and within about 15 seconds was too far away for us to see.  Neither my sister nor I have ever seen what we thought to be an alien craft or anything like that. Particularly, I am a very logical and scientific person who needs to see something to really believe it.  I recently had an argument with a friend who was trying to convince me that there are such things as bearded ladies.  My arguement to her was that I would never be able to truly believe something like that unless I saw it with my own eyes in person, because how can you really know? My point is that if I wouldn&apos;t have seen it with my own eyes, I never would have believed it.  I am usually very sceptical of UFO sightings and stuff on tv because the stories always have to many holes, and of course I had never seen one.  I have a 156 I.Q. and have always been thought of as very clear minded and mature far beyond my years.", "Summary : A brite blue light appeared out of nowhere.

Going higher, a beam of light shone from the object until it disappeared.My son and I saw what looked like a very bright shooting star, going up and not down.  It had a very wide tail that was also very bright.  We watched it go up into the sky for a total of approximately 10 minutes.  As it went higher, the intensity subsided.  It was in the northwestern sky above the mountains.  It changed direction after going up for about 5 minutes.  It then turned to a more northerly direction as it got smaller and higher.  As we looked at it, my son and I both saw what looked like a wide beam of light coming from this object shining down to earth.  We couldn&apos;t see it go all the way down because the light was partly behind the mountains at that time.As the object kept getting higher, we also noticed a smaller light below this object, approximately 3 inches below, if using your fingers to measure.  It was moving in a northeastly direction and moved very fast and again, using your fingers to measure, it moved approximately 5 inches in that direction and then it disappeared.  The first object continued moving higher and then it too disappeared.We watched for a few minutes longer but could not see either object anymore.", "Summary : Two High School Girls see silver disk move over townMy daughters were at the High School playing field about 45 minutes before the start of a Football game when they looked up and saw a disk about the size of a dime held at arms length, (lower than the low clouds) move from the NE to the SW to W direction.  It moved slowly and the setting sun caused it to reflect light very brightly like an object of very smooth metal or glass.  The shape was that of a disk with a slight indentation in the center. It made no noise.  They have never seen anything like it before and did not really believe stories I had told them of UFOs I had seen before their birth.   I report this because I note that other sightings are being seen in the Wyo.&amp; Colo. area.  I also may have seen another one myself on about 8/4/97 just at sunrise, also over Lyons.

As we drove closer, we saw a solid object floating about 20 feet above the tree tops.  I pulled the car over to the side of the road and we sat staring at this glowing object.  There was a house within the field of view, the diameter of the object was twice the length of the house. The object was constructed in 3 sections, the middle section had glowing rectangular panels, the bottom section was massively constructed and we could see ribbing.  There was no sound, the trees did not move, this all happened at twilight.  After discussing what we were looking at, I started the car and left; the object was still there when we left.My pragmatic wife doesn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s but she does admit that she saw this object.

We have seen this once before in the same spot in the sky in late July. Of the two ships one was really bright and one was not very bright. The bright one was glowing a hot white color, and when viewed with binoculars, it had what appeared to be two rocket boosters, which were tapering off in width, and where at about a 120 degree angle from eachother.  Also a white hot ring seemed to be floating around the ship.  Sort of like some sort of force feild.  The smaller ship was keeping a constant distance from the brighter bigger ship. Like it was bing controlled by it. The strangest and weirdest thing thathappened though was this bright band of light that crossed the sky. It was like a twisted plane or ribbon, twisting at the left, and then ging straight across the sky.  Then at the right side or the end of it it looped and went up.  Then it dissapeared. &gt;From the beginning of the sighting to the end, the brighter ship moved down and over a little to the right. The smaller ship seemed to move a lot more.

Definitely not fireworks.I&apos;m an engineer.  See myself as a careful, objective observer.  Know planes, seen lots of meteors, fireworks, and the like. This brief phenomenon defied my logic. It was a light green &quot;fireball&quot; lasting about a second.  It showed a short-persistance trail (1/4-1/2 sec). I&apos;m 5-10 miles north of downtown San Diego.  It was south of my observation point, maybe 30 deg. above horizon.  It faded out at about 15-20 deg.  It may have been visible higher in the sky, but my view was restricted. The object seemed to be falling, moving towards the southwest.  It showed a straight, fast trajectory - like a meteor.  Quite bright but not extremely so. It left me with the distinct impression that it was generated within the atmosphere, that it was not a celestial event.  However, because of its motion and the characteristics of its luminance, it was definitely not fireworks.  It seemed like it could have been only a few thousand feet away.  Seeing a meteor is much different than was seeing this. Interesting too, it occurred right where I was looking, but not expecting anything.

At first I thought that the light could be a reflection from one of the navigation lights of the DC-10.  After watching the light for about an hour we decided that that wasn&apos;t the case.  It would change position and color.  We could simply tell that it was some sort of object. After a while, we would just take a look out the window every 20 minuets or so. Every time we looked out it was still out there. At one point we asked another passenger and a steward to take a look and they were amazed as well.  The light dissapeared when we started to overfly some shipping, probably about 200 miles from Ireland. After the flight we joked about the &quot;UFO&quot; that we saw, but we were still left with an unsettling feeling.

I believe it was big enough to cover an acre of land. It had one large middle light like a large bulb in the center and on the outer corners were two small lights. It hovered 45 minutes with no noise whatsoever. I stood outside and watched it for 45 minutes. The most amazing thing was the two lights on each point of this triangle then departed going opposite ways of each other and did some very strange things like loops and things and left the hovering thing there. These two little things that left the large thing were much smaller but they were like points of light. It then formed in a line and flew out towards the mountains but it was very unusual for something to hover for solong but the two points departing was really strange. I phoned this in at the center that night and no ! one has called me back. I can draw it and show you where it was. It was right over our pasture and not that high above ground. I thought at first sight it must be a plane going to land, but planes cannot hover for 45 minutes that I know of and things cannot just depart and :do their own little air show&quot;.

The object(s) were at approx. 20 degrees above the Northern horizon. Others in a car stopped to ask me if I saw them and told me they watched them for 1 to 2 minutes at the top of the hill to the South of me. They confirmed a yellowish orange color and the long tails.

I observed a huge, brilliant, &quot;bow-tie&quot; shaped object moving north, toward me, that looked like it was about 20 degrees up from the horizon.  It was too unusual a shape to be a plane or a helicopter and the lights were so brilliant that I stood observing it for 4 to 5 minutes.As it moved over the mountains, it seemed to explode into an enormous sphere of red, green and white individual lights. It stopped moving and seemed to hover above the horizon for 3 to 4 minutes.  Then in seconds, it seemed to twinkle out, first from the bottom of the sphere, finally to the top of the sphere.

The speed of the orange ball was so fast that it crossed the entire valley in less than a second.  All I remember seeing was an orange flash in the distant horizon.I am barely reporting this because this is the first time I&apos;ve ever seen this sight.  I have always remembered that night, and I marked it on my calendar because it really made me think and wonder what the hell that thing was.  Anyways, I think I was the only one in the tramway that actually saw the orange ball, but I know that everyone saw the flash. I know this because everyone was asking where the flash came from. Well, I wish I could write more, but I need to be going.  P.S.

Traveling east on I80 i started to approach the Mifflinville bridge. At 710 i seen this Large round bright green light flying above the river. i thought it was a plane cause the Bloomsburg airport was near by. I knew it could not fly above the river cause of the islands in it. the object was about 100 feet in diameter and was quiet.It flew above the water about 40 feet. By the time i got to the middle of the bridge the object made a hard 90 degree turn and flew over the mountain right above the trees. now going south. when i went home i told my father about it. he believed me. the next day in the paper was a writing about green lights seen in Washington DC at 715 pm the same night i seen my light. they said that it was a meteor. tell me this how can a meteor fly up a river then make a left turn before hitting a bridge and then fly over a mountain abofe the trees heading south in the direction which DC is in.

It drifted to the west, alternately blinking out and reappearing.  As I parked and got out of my car, it stopped.  I ran inside and got a pair of binoculars (Tasco 7x35mm). When I got back outside, the light was still in the same place.  When I aimed the binoculars at the object, it had three lights on it, two white and one blue. It looked like a helicopter, but I continued to track it as it moved slowly back toward the east. After about two minutes, four or five more lights appeared, two white and the others blinking red, orange, and blue. As it acclerated, I could make out a vague triangular shape which contained the lights. The object took up a good portion of the lenses of the binocs, and with the naked eye was about the size of a dime. There was no discernible sound coming from the object, and the rustling of nearby trees made it hard to tell if there was any noise. The! object continued to accelerate to a speed which made it difficult to track, and disappeared behind the home across the street from mine.

We listened to Artbell on his AM talk radio.  We just viewed what we thought were UFOs in the bay area and wondered if there was any news about our sighting.  We heard about the 9 PM Oregon, Washington, and Reno sightings of UFOs and this sort of confirmed our sightings and wondered if they were related.  We kept hearing about triangular shaped objects being sited so we were observing the sky.  The moon was unusually bright that morning.  When I got into Reno, I was headed south on Highway 395 toward our destination and I saw three dots of light that was about 30 degrees from the horizon almost directly toward the south.  The three lights looked like stars but were unusually bright.  I have been star gazing for a couple of years since my wife and I have been interested in UFOs.  I&apos;ve witnessed the landing of the Space Shuttle above the skies in Vallejo.  I also saw the Mir streak across the sky one evening when a local newscaster told me when and where to look for the Mir.  I tried to get a better view and get closer to the lights but the three lights moved toward the west and one of the lights went behind Mount Rose near Lake Tahoe.  We went climbing near Mt Rose about three weeks earlier so we were familiar with locations. The strange thing was the exact symmetry of the three points of light from each other as they slowly moved across the sky.  It seemed like they were guided exactly by the movement of the other lights.  We got out of the car and I took photos and I&apos;m not sure if they will come out.  I should get the photos back on Tuesday.  As my wife and I looked at the two lights as they hovered behind Mt Rose, the right most light flared up in brightness and appeared like it got brighter, then suddenly dimmed.  The lights appeared to me to about 100 miles south west of Reno, somewhere above the Sierras in California.  It could be deceiving and the objects even further out like hundreds of miles.  It is hard to tell unless someone triangulates the movements as I described them.  Now my wife and I and the kids are convinced that we are not alone in this galaxy.  The numerous reports of triangle shaped objects may have merit If I am correct, the object could be miles across and may be cloaked.   The tips of the triangle are the size of stars to throw off our perception and blend in with the stars at night.  Without a telescope, it was difficult to determine if  these were craft that were navigating and controlled by equidistance between each other or one huge vessel. We were excited and contacted the local TV news stations but no one called us back.  You are our only hope to describe this UFO.  Please advise what to do next.I am a Project Manager working for ((Name deleted)) Corp and have a scientific background.  This defies all logic and we are not sure if these were astronomic bodies that we were observing.

We had just bought a 74 Pinto from a welder on the job we worked at.  We rode home with him and drove the car back from N. of Mount Airy,  NC on Dec 31, 1986.  Andy was driving S. on Hwy. 52 when I saw 3 lights in a triangular formation ascend from the trees on the left side of the highway.  I pointed in amazement at which time Andy hunched over the wheel and saw the lights also.  They were about a hundred yards away and rotating as they ascended.  Andy slowed down and we stared at the lights for about 10 seconds.  The lights then moved rapidly east, kind of swirlinga bit before zipping almost straight up and completely out of sight.  At the rate the lights accelerated, it left us in a total state of shock. Since this occured on New Years Eve, we&apos;ve had a hard time convincing anyone that we really saw it and I never heard of any other sightings.  We used to talk about it a lot but people think we&apos;re crazy and heated arguments would ensue.  What&apos;s confusing to me is that no sonic boom or any kind of noise for that matter was heard or felt.", "Summary : We were at a local fireworks display.  Just before dusk, I looked up in the sky with my son and saw a large green object shooting across the sky like a comet, but at a much lower altitiude.

I didn&apos;t even touch the keyboard when she was hysterically yelling for me to come outside.  I ran outside as quickly as I could because I thought there was something happening to her. She pointed into the sky and told me to look at these lights.  It was clearly obvious that it was a craft of some sort.

These things appeared, from over the hills.  I was the first to see them, and it took me about 3 seconds to speak!  I said, &quot;What the hell is THAT?!&quot;  We all stood up to watch.  Then ran over to the crest of the hill to see if we could see them anymore.  It was an incredible sight.  They came from the West and were heading East.  There were 3 at first, then the last (smallest) faded.  They were beautiful!!  We sat there for another hour, dumbfounded; could hardly speak.There were 3, it seemed.  Each had 3, I think, bright white lights in front of them. I think there may have been something in between those 3 lights, but I couldn&apos;t see it clearly.  One of those 3 lights seemed to be a bit bigger and brighter than the other two. They each had these &quot;tails&quot; that were golden, and came out of those front lights like perfect rectangles!  I mean, the tops and bottoms were a perfect straight line, and there was golden glittery stuff in them.  The &quot;glitter&quot; was of different sizes, too.  Not all the same size.  And NO glitter was outside of those rectangles!  They were cruising right along, but not zipping by.  They were absolutely silent.  They followed the contour of the land.  It seemed they were about a mile away from us (very hard to judge), so taking that into consideration, with my hand as a guide, I&apos;d say they were about 6&quot; above the horizon.  The first two were overlapping each other, but the 3rd, and smallest, was behind a bit.  I could se! e it more clearly.  I thought about reporting it, but didn&apos;t know who to call!  Then, as one of the women was driving home, she heard on the radio that there&apos;d been sightings all the way up to Seattle!  The Oregonian tried to say it was &quot;Space Junk&quot;. A rocket!!

It was incredible.", "Summary : A very dim, round ball of light that moved at a very high speed across the sky--much faster than a jet, but slower than a meteorite.I saw, at midnight, a very dim ball of light.  I call it a ball because it appeared to be a small round object way up in the sky.  It was very dark on this Halloween night, and the sky appeared to be clear as all of the stars were shining.  This small round object glowed very dimly; I could barely see it.  It moved from the north to the south, from horizon to horizon in about 12 seconds, approximately.

Lights: 1 front, 1 on each side, 1 in back.My neighbor and I were standing half way down my driveway when we saw this object fly overhead due west.  The sky was clear with no clouds.  It didn&apos;t have any blinking beacon lights, and we could not make out shape.  The 4 lights were orange/yellow color, somewhat bright, and and they were positioned in the shape of a diamond around the object.  It was very low, compared to most aircraft that fly, at night, and made no sound.  We viewed it for about a 7 or 8 second duration, in which time it just flew over our heads and over the trees out of our view.  I do not know what the object was,because I figured that if it was airplane flying at night, it would have beacons, which the object i saw did not.  And it went very slow for the altitude it was at, which must not have bee more than a few hundred feet up.  To this day, i have never again seen an air-plane or jet fly at night with no blinking beacons and lights at the head, each wing tip, and tail.", "Summary : Follow-up to article in Chicago Sun Times 12/3/97 re &quot;Fireball&quot; in Will Co, Illinois 12/30.  Saw similar in Lake Geneva, WI 11/28/97 around 7:30pm.  Appeared to be an elxposion or electrical fire; presented with a huge red-orange glow that pulsated and flickered, but without sound.  Saw no craft, but noticed three electrical surges during this time period.  No reports of downed aircraft, substation fires or explosions to local authorities.  If you saw any similar display please report it here.After finishing dinner 11/28/97, a friend and I were watching TV in a condo on Lake Como near Lake Geneva Wisconsin.  There were suddenly three power surges/interruptions in rapid succession, but without any sound of explosive nature.  I got up to check out the electrical system, and noticed a huge pulsating red-orange glow to the northeast appearing to be just beyond the tree line near the lake.  However, no sound could be heard only the strange pulsating, flickering red-orange glow.  We went out to the balcony, but could not determine any more about the visualization.  We heard only one distant siren, but observed several autos heading down our cul de sac and on the roads nearby.  So we apparently were not the only ones to see this occurrence.  Since the weather was inclement, we did not got out to pursue this any further.  Unfortunately, we did not report this event to local authorities either.  I have since called the local police, but without any result.  I have contacted the Sun Times reporter in hopes of discussing his article and what we saw.  Possibly there is some reasonable explanation, but it seemed to be very strange and unworld-like!  The sighting in Will Co Illinois on Sunday 11/30 had similar characteristics.  The observer, a local businessman and pilot, reported seeing a brilliant &quot;fireball&quot; about the size of a full moon descend straight down form the clouds at about 125-150mph.  Within 20 seconds it disappeared. Authorities could find no evidence of any downed craft or debris.  Our experience was similar except that we saw no object/craft/etc and the color display lasted for about one hour.  The pulsating/flickering reached intensities that almost totally illuminated the night sky; then suddenly it would stop, start up again, vary in intensity, then flicker and pulsate wildly!  All without any sound!  My first impression was of some sort of electrical fire/explosion, space debris, a meterorite, or possible a UFO!  This event was witnessed by two adult males, approximately 50 years old, ! who had not been drinking, taking drugs, or otherwise mind altered!  One is a business man, the other(myself) a medical professional and student pilot.

They looked like missles, but they didn;t go in one direction. They would descend, go left, bo right, go back up, go down again, and disappear. To me what I thought it was, was the military testing missles. I got seven friends who all saw the same thing. The lights then flew south and disappeared.

As I looked at it it seemed to just disappear. It did not travel out of my sight but disappear and the night became dark once more.((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time of the event to 21:45.  PD))", "Summary : Man remembers seeing object with three revolving lights in sky in front of his traveling auto.  Object disappears, car lights go off and on.I need to point out that the following event  was forgotten for several years.  And the other person in the car at the time still doesn&apos;t remember it taking place at all.  But I do remember during a trip from Pasco Washington to Yakima Washington.My friend ((Name deleted))and I were heading to Yakima in order to get another load, I was moving to Pasco.  It was late at night and we were going a little over the speed limit.  When I noticed a object flying in front of me, just off the road.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, then I noted that it wasn&apos;t making any sound and the lights on the aircraft were unconventional in that they rotated around the craft instead of flashing in place.  There were three colors of lights, I remember blue and green with either red or white lights.  They were rotating from my left to my right on the vehicle, which appeared as a dark shadow against the night sky.  The object was within a hundred yards of me and was cigar shaped, roughtly 20 feet wide and 8 feet with no wings or any appendages.  It was flying about 20 feet off the ground  In an attempt to get closer I speeded up to 90 miles an hour and the craft stayed in relative position to me.  Suddenly, the ship instantly speeded off to the nort!h and disappeared over a hill.  It moved with incredible speed.Suddenly my head lights went out.  I took my foot off the gas pedal and started breaking my vehicle.  I pressed the pedal a few times when the headlights came on again.  I was going to excelerate when they went off again.  I continued to break and the lights came on again.  They came on again and I noticed a  field access road off the highway and not wanting to break down on the road turned into it.  ((Name deleted)) and I got out of the car and relieved ourselves by the car.As I said before, I forgot this whole event for a matter of several years.

Both objects would from hovering would dart across the sky and stop for 10 to 20 sec. and take off to a different angle and stop again. Both of the ufo&apos;s played in the sky for around 35 min.. The odd thing was that The ufo&apos;s would dissapear Around 3 min. before a commercial plane would enter the area. The next day in Wendy&apos;s 2 airborne division men in dress came in to eat. There is no air base near by.Around 1:05 am An obgect shoot across the sky and stopped in mid air. Usually there is 4 to 5 guests that hang around but this time there were just my roommate and I. A second object was spotted near by.  The ufo&apos;s from hovering would soot across the sky and stop in mid air. The objects looked like one of the clips from one of the earlier X FILES shows. Where the objects that were a little bigger than stars. would move in many directions and stop. The background was a clear night on the flat lands of Richmond KY . The ufo&apos;s would disappear minutes before a commercial airline would come through the area where they were at an appear later to put on a show again. Finally the ufo&apos;s darted off like a shooting star together to the west and would never appear that night. The next day we were at Wendys and 2 airborne division officers came in looking really tired from the night before. They didn&apos;t speak to each other hardly at all. They did look around the restruant at the people to! see who was observing them.

There was only one.It was around 8:00pm when I saw a huge football shaped craft flying between a house and some trees. It was bright yellow and moved rapidly in a horizontal motion. There was only one of them and I didn&apos;t see it again for the rest of the night. I was scared to I ran inside. It might of been out for longer, but I only saw it for one mintue or so.", "Summary : At about 9:45 PM, Friday June 6th, I saw a relatively large round orange/yellow fiery light glide straight across the sky from the NE to the SW. I was looking towards the SE. There was no sound. Several small airplanes also crossed over head that night, and those were quite loud. No light reflected on the low cloud cover, as did the many airplanes I saw that night, indicating it was very low in the sky. One could clearly see the airplanes white, red and blue flashing lights in distinct formation. What I saw actually became obscurred behind the trees in my yard at one point. It appeard to be only about 1 mile away, traveling over Bothell Way!The above description captures most of the information. I wish I had been more conscient of looking at relative surrounds to get a better idea of the objects size. I would say it was close to half the size of a lightbulb at 10 ft from the observer. I was very keen to observe the airplanes that night, to base my observations a the conditions and weather circumstances that night. It proved to me that it was definitely NOT an airplane, It was also not weather related. I do not believe it was an asteroid of some sort. There was no tail that I could see.I have lived in my house, where I observed this, for over 7 years. Occasionally airplanes on the horizon &quot;fool&quot; me into thinking they are not airplanes, when they come straight towards me, and their WHITE light seems unusually bright, and they dont appear to move. However, eventually they change course and I can see their distinctive colored lights and patters. In fact what I saw entered my vision from my left and crossed to my right. It never came straight at me. It&apos;s light was consistent in radiance.My background: I am a 32 year old female, and a graphic designer and artist. I will send you an illustration of what I saw. I may even be able to send you an actual animation, for that is also something I do for a living! I consider myself extremely open-minded to things of this nature, but to this point in my life I have never seen anything like what I saw June 6th!

As I walk past the patio door I look out and saw a inverted triangle of soft golden white light. It was moving at about 60-70mph north along the flight path for Reno Cannon International Airport. At first I thought It was a planes landing lights, but I saw No blinking transponder! I stepped out side and the city was unusually quite. I listened and could hear no engine or jet noise! That is when I knew it was no plane! The flight path Is about 3 miles from my house and I can hear every plane that lands or takes off, and I have watched hundereds of planes take off and land in the 33 years I have lived here. I watched it move from just over the Reno Hilton Hotel, which is about 4-5 miles south west of my house, untill It was just over the dark line of my neighbors house due west off me when it just blinked off! At that distance I would estimate the size to be about 100 by 100 ft. The sides of the triangel were equal and the golden white light was soft enough that the glow did not distort the shape of the object. It was flying level at about a thousand ft. I own a dental laboratory and am use to paying attention to small details. It had travelled about 5 miles from the time I sppotted it untill it vanished about 90 sec. later. It travelled slow and level, it did not turn, pulsate or do any thing unusual except blink off with out even saying goodby. I thought that was very rude. They have the nerve to fly over, get people all excited then leave with out so much as even a thank you.", "Summary : At 3:20 a.m. I looked out the peephole in the door, and I saw a white object in the sky outside my house. It changed shapes,ovals, triangles, diamond, and colors, blue, red, white, yellow. It lasted 20 minutes, then disappeared.At 3:20 a.m. I looked out the peephole in the door and saw a light outside. It looked far-away, it had trees in front of it. I had my brother look at it and he thought it was the moon. But I told him to watch it and he said it couldn&apos;t be since it was changing shape and color. I watched it and it kept getting smaller, then larger. When it got small it turned yellow and then it turned really dark outside. When it got big it started changing shapes an and colors, and outside got lit up. Then it disappeared. Then a couple minutes later, it came back and turned into a baseball field shape, there was a blue and red light coming off it. The middle was missing, like a ring. The object was white and lit up.

Six of us noticed it from a balcony at a party. I am a working daily journalist. With me were two Oceanside city council members. This object &quot;floated&quot; north for about two or three minutes, then stopped. After about a minute or so, it began moving back south-southwest over the water. Altitude was hard to determine, but it appeared to be climbing, albeit ever-so slowly. At one point, a small &quot;spark&quot; like object slowly fell from the main object. Through biconculars I was able to see four (4) distinct lights in a diamond shape. This object slowly faded from sight directly above our city&apos;s Pier. I honestly thought it was a balloon someone had set afire and let drift, but it wouldn&apos;t have burned that long and, because of our off-shore breeze, which was slight that night blowing inland, no balloon would have drifted p!arallel against the wind, then reverse course.

I focused in on it, and i saw that it wasn&apos;t a plane. it had red/orange lights on it, and around it. it was just kind of hovering, not moving like you see a plane. Then I lost site of it. I scanned the sky, and found it. It had shooted up at a very fast speed, and at a really steep angle. Now it was hovering over a field. I went inside to get my camera, and when i came back outside, it was gone. It never appeared again.

We had to go into town (approx 7 miles away).  I lived out in a very unpopulated area next to a Boy Scout Wilderness Camp.  Houses are several miles apart.  On the way into town about a mile and a half from my house I turn right to take the road to the Hiway into town and there sitting on the left side of the road, a road I drove at least twice a day for the past several years was a UFO.

Typical of a nitrided or titaimum applied finished metal.  Shape.  Clearly saucer like with rounded edges and viewing ports (round) at the top.  Lite smoke or steam from the grass was drifting up around the UFO.  The UFO seemed to be bathed in a glow, even tho this was around noon on a clear day.  The glow was almost ultraviolet, it seemed to be glowing around the edges.  We stopped and looked at it, it being about 30 feet from the truck, then we &quot;got the hell out of there&quot;.  We went down the road for about 3/4 of a mile then we went back and it was gone.  We got out and there was nothing but a large depression in the grass where it had set and the ground was warm to the touch.  As the days went by, I noticed the grass died in a large round area where the UFO had sat down.I have thought of this many times since 1964 and every once in a great while I see the guy who was with me, we have never talked about this to anyone since it happened.

I don&apos;t remember the exact date but I do remember the day and time. It was a Saturday evening minutes after 18:00, the field had just closed. I stepped outside of the &quot;old&quot; tower, which houses the weather office and flight filing services,to observe the twilight. It was very quiet as was typical for a Saturday evening after the field closes, no planes, no engines, no cars, you could hear a pin drop (almost). I was facing east looking at the mountains which are about 35 miles away. The objects or lights caught my eye to the south and I turned my head to view them. I saw three &quot;solid&quot; coloredlights traveling abreast, moving north, at a relatively high rate of speed, they appeared to be about 2500&apos; AGL and about 10 miles south. The two on the outside were red and the one in the middle was white (unfourtunately I am colored blind and cannot be 100% sure of the colors but two were definately dark and one was light). The objects wers solid coloredand appeared to be &quot;lit&quot; or illuminated rather than reflected light. I observed no strobes or marker lights of the kind you would expect to see on conventional aircraft and they were silent. I could not discern any particular shape or other features of any kind, they just appeared to be circular or oval.  About ten seconds into the sighting the red or &quot;outside&quot;objects seemed to jet or rocket forward at a tremendous rate of speed for 3-4 seconds then, just as abrubtly, resume their previous rate of speed. At the same instant that the red ones slowed down the white one, which had been in the center duplicated the maneuver, catching up and resuming it&apos;s previous position in the center.  This happened two more timesand by this time the craft were to my north and heading out of site. When they were abreast or directly to my east, they seemed to be about 5-7 miles away. At this particular site you can see about 75 miles to the south and about 100 miles to the north. The three things that struck me as strange were 1)The solid colored lighting with no detectable conventionalmarkings or lighting. 2)The strange and abrubt maneuvering. 3) The sound, there wasn&apos;t any. At the time I was a USN trained weather observer/forecaster with 10 years of experience. I had been working at this particular location for a little over two years and was used to identifing military and commercial aircraft of all types. I later asked a local resident, aformer WWII Army Air Corp veteran who still flew privately, if he had ever seen anything unusual in this area. He said yes but would not elaborate. I&apos;ve thought that maybe they were something from Dreamland or Area 51, which is reportedly just to the south of this location, approximately halfway to Nellis AFB.

We were just relaxing on the lake, it was quiet on the lake and were were anckored down so we wouldn&apos;t move.  The night was slightly chilly so we didn&apos;t go swimming like usual, but the stars were very clear, and everything was rather calm.  I saw something moving very fast across the sky at first I thought it was a shooting star because I have seen a number of them at that lake, but this did not dissipate like meteors do.  Then I noticed that it was making strange and sharp turns and jumps side to side, I alerted my friend who then quickly picked up on the sight.  He saw the strange jigs and jumps it was making and the speed at which it was traveling.  We were both amazed because we had never seen anything like that before.

The three lights jockey for position, speeding ahead, falling behind, and crossing over each other.My husband and I are working artists in the fields of traditional and computer animation. While meteor-watching in our backyard on the evening of Aug 12 he spotted three small lights moving just below the pole star.  I saw them, then, and we both watched as they moved, a little faster than a commercial aircraft, from north to south, where they disappeared from sight behind the hills.  The lights began in a rough line, from top to bottom, with the middle light slightly ahead of the others. As they crossed the sky, one would speed ahead, then fall behind as another sped ahead, and at intervals one would cross over another in almost a playful manner. The impression I received at first was that of a three-cornered object tumbling, but when the lights passed in front of stars it was clear they were distinct from one another and not part of a larger solid object, as the stars were clearly visible between the lights. The lights were about the brighness of the dimmest of the stars visible, and a warm yellow color. This same night we had observed several meteors and several commercial aircraft. These lights were at a lower altitude and exhibited vastly different behavior than the commercial craft we saw, and were definitely not meteorites, as they were neither bright nor fast enough and left no trails.", "Summary : 3 objects 90 ft. tall . observed from 270 ft. away. objects were 2 blue pyramids pointing into red ball, shooting shafts of white light from under .3 objects traveled in triangle formation  bottom two 25 ft. off ground. objects were very  loud,like waterfall.stopped for2min. when waved armsI was putting my puppies in the house when my wife and I herd a loud sound outside .

It vaguely had the shape of a giant iol rig, but had no clearly discernible surface despite the arc-bright lights.  A deafening sound of an electric generator, at possibly 90 decibels, with extreme low bass wave undertones was heard, but no down drafts, wind, jet blast or discernable means of levitation (moving wind) was observThe 150 ft tall, 30 ft wide craft, vaguely resembling an extremely brightly lit, vertically flying oil rig or wide-width broad cast tower, flew over our house at 364 Garret Circle, at 2:30 Am Nov 7, 1984, 6 miles west of Carrollton, Georgia. Initially the object rose up from a forest 100 yeards to the north of our house, and was spinning head over heels vertically in the air, making deafening rumbling and electrical generator sounds.  It was the deafening waves of sound and the bright lights that woke both me and my wife up.  I am a fairly prominent political scientist in my field, a two-time Fulbright scholar, a Ph.D. with long interests in astronomy, and my wife has a Masters in public administration.  I am a Scout leader, and a responsible college administrator now (1997).  My wife and I instantly woke up, flew to the front yard ard, and observed the craft cease spinning and it floated towards us 25 to 30 feet above the ground in a VERTICAL flying position.  You must imagine it is unreasonable to think that aerodynamics allow such a huge object to fly without wings, moving air, jet-blast, or any discernible means of propulsion, to fly vertically in position, but move horizontally at 1 to 2 miles an hour.  We watched for 10 to 12 minutes as the craft approached, passed over our pecan tree and house, clearing it by 8 to 10 feet, and floating south-southwest, it slowly disappeared over the horizon.  The craft was followed within about 100 ft by two approx 10 to 15 ft in diameter, red translucent and free-floating globes.  The large craft had immensely bright lights (as bright as an arc welders light), none of which were directional. The craft passed slowly over our front yard, from the forest across the street north, above our pecan tree, and our one story home, passing approximately 1 to 15 ft above the! house.  I could walk along with the craft across our yard slowly and keep up with it, until I hit our back fence line 70 yards behind the house.  I could easily see for several minutes the craft from no more than 20 feet below it.  As hard as I tried, I could not see past the bright lights to a surface of the craft.  This was extremely weird, since a street light illuminates the surface of it&apos;s pole, but these immensely bright lights would not illuminate the surface of the craft, which appeared as black mat invisible.  The lights were randomly distributed, with maybe 3 dozen lights, 5% red-colored.  I stress that the craft had NO WIND DRAFTS,  no down drafts, no jet stream or sound, no discernible flying mechanism -- just a 90 decibel level sound of electric whine as with a giant generator, and waves and waves of deep bass undertones.  The translucent globes had no discernible content inside, and were randomly floating behind the large craft, following it but not gaining on i! t, nor attached to each other or the large craft in any way.  They floated like directionally motivated soap bubbles, following the craft.  The craft was so near me I could have lobbed an apple upwards with a hand and hit it.  I recall being extremely intense about observing the environment, watching how the craft flew almost over our pecan tree, and cast moving shadows through it but did not disturb its branches in any way -- all to verify the physical reality of the observation.  My wife observed it with me, but for 1 minute moved into the house to flash lights from the porches at it to see if it would respond, to no avail.  She immediately came back out to observe it with me again as we moved to the backyard.  We kept confirming to each other we were awake verbally, but we agreed not to describe it to each other until we independently wrote a description up, with drawings -- without conversation -- and traded the descriptions to check each others observations.  The only dis! crepancy I can remember in our descriptions is that she thought there were a different number of red globes than I (I remember two, I think she recalled three, or one, but not two).  We were up discussing our reports to each other until one half hour later, we heard the drone of helicopter and airplan engines outside.  We went outside and coul clearly see that 1/2 mile to the east two black and low-flying military tyope helicopters, with forward looking light beams, were accompanying a low- and slow flying two engine plane.  They circled around our territory in a radius of about 1 mile, and criss-crossed once going from north to south and followed the trajectory of the crafts which had vanished.  We advertised in the Carrollton paper about a week later for other potential observers, but got no takers.  We interviewed neighbors, one of which was a pilot immediately to the north of us, but noone reported any perceptions or sightings.  We called the local sherrif&apos;s office, and th! e Carrollton police that morning to ask if anyone reported anything to them, and they said no reports were turned in.  At one point we gave an interview to someone who may have been connected to Mufon -- at least he was a friend of a friend who said he had connections with some reporting organization, but we never heard anything back from him.  We possibly could trace back who that person was, as he was a son of an elderly woman in our faith, who is now deceased.  We simply had NOONE to report the information to in those days of no internet or organized reporting networks.  I have read sporadically in the UFO literature, but have never run across a similar description.  I would be grateful to know of similar descriptions in a sighting.  The only ones that vaguely resemble ours are two reports in Alien Update by Tim Good by two UK couples in the early 1990s, but their sighting was of an orange colored rectangular (vertical) craft, and the description was not too close, or clear! ly written.  That night was slightly hazy if I remember correctly, with no winds.  We aver very curious to this day as to the purpose behind the military recon helicopters and plane.  I would like to request public anonymity, but I would talk to a researcher, as I am sure my wife would.  I attempted to use a camera, but I had no film in it at the time, to my regret.

The body was reported to be 3.5 to 4 feet in lenght with silver skin that was deteriorating (presumably over the winter).  The news sources reported that the remains had been taken to Michigan State University in East Lansing, Mi,for examination.  Suspiciously, there was never again any mention of this unusual find in the newspaper, on TV or over the radio.

My daughter asked if I had seen the orange object.  I told her that I had seen justa burst of orange light, and she stated that she had seen the light burst, and then saw it speed off down thelake.  She said that it was definitly above the water, because she saw its entire reflection on the water.  She also stated that she watched it for a very short period of time (approximately 30 seconds) and that it simply disappeared as it travelled toward the Caddo Drive area of the lake. She also said that she thought that it mighthave come up from behind us because it appeared to come from that direction, and that she had gotten a &quot;cold chill&quot;before she saw the object.

During this time the oddest thing about this, was there was no noise at all. There was no moon to backlight this so we could only see the lights. I thought perhaps because there was no noise that it might have been a pedal plane that I saw on the discovery channel once. It appeared to be about 1000 feet in the air.

Until today I was unaware of this.In the summer of 1956 my parents and I lived in Wyoming.  They decided to go to Yellowstone and it was there that I saw what I am telling you now.  Even though I was three I recall much about the trip because Yellowstone was such a special place.  I think my parents were probably very impressed so it stuck in my mind.  Anyway we had spent the night parked along the road, not in a camp ground or in a cabin.  My mother recalled that it had been a very spooky night, very dark.  As we left the park the next day we traveled south along a narrow highway.  We were in a black Hudson, and I was laying in the back window-well (it was my favorite place to ride on long trips).  As I looked up at the sky and trees I saw three objects coming up from behind us about 100 feet above us.  They followed behind the car staying in between the trees that lined both sides of the road.  I remember I had seen them as we were coming around a curve.  They looked like metal painted orange with yellow rib!s on their undersides.  Each was a disk about 20 feet wide and on top was a dome with a large glass or window.  In each was a human like figure.  One disk pulled away while the other two closed in on the car dropping to about 30 feet altitude.  The disk nearest the car tilted downwards at an angle so that I could see the pilot clearly.  In my three year old memories I recall thinking of the pilot in the lead craft as a HELICOPTER PILOT wearing dark sun-glasses.  My family at that time was too poor to go to movies and we did not own a TV, so the only thing I could relate the objects to were helicopters.  I waved at the pilot and he held up his left hand palm facing me and waved his hand kind of slowly back and forth.  I jumped down into the back seat and leaned over to tell my parents that there were HELICOPTERS behind us.  They looked out the windows but the objects were gone.  All I recall is that they didn&apos;t really question me about it much and dropped it.  This memory alway!s stayed with me and was never forgotten.  I didn&apos;t dwell on it but every time I saw our Yellowstone pictures or recalled the trip I also recalled the 3 crafts.  However it wasn&apos;t until I was about 10 that it suddenly dawned on me (being older and wiser) THOSE WERE NOT HELICOPTERS!  DO you know it was not until last year (1996) that it suddenly dawned on me that those guys might not have been wearing sunglasses.  Last year I did a little study and began to notice that appearances of 3 saucers with the outlines I had seen also seemed to turn up in other areas.  But there is more to my story.  neither of my parents recalled the incident (which seems normal since at the time I had told them it was helicopters and hence it wouldn&apos;t have been something to stick in their memory for several years.  Note: in about 1989 my mother called me in a panic one day to tell me a dream she&apos;d had (my mother almost never recalled dreams and claimed she never dreamed).  She told me that she had dr!eamed that a UFO was over her house and that beings were coming into her bedroom and surrounding her.  But she said she woke up to hear a real noise over her house: it was a National Guard helicopter (there was a helicopter training base north of town: Norman Okla.).  What I wondered about was the connection of the helicopter noise to the intense UFO dream she was having.", "Summary : A large white pulsating lightMy wife and I noticed a light at or about 9:00pmWe watched it pulsate.

It stayed stationary for a long period of time, about 20 minutes later I saw a second obect, same shape but appeared to be father away,maybe 3 times brighter than the planet.I wasn&apos;t constantly watching,but I know that by ten o&apos;clock the 2nd object was gone.

The flew nearly overhead toward the northeast.  They had an angular sizesomewhat larger than a quarter, there was no wayto tell the actual size.  I got the impression that they were distant because I couldn&apos;t discern any surface details.Their shape was most likely spherical, since the shape of their profile remained roughly spherical for the duration of the time I saw it.There were three of them, each on the vertex of anequilateral triangle with sides about twice as longas the diameter of the objects.  They glowed almostpure white with just a touch of bluish-purple.  Theymade a soft very high pitched sound like anultrasonic cleaner used for cleaning draftingpens.

Sunday night (6/21/97) at 11:15 PM we were in the back yard watching the sky. The first thing we saw was a dim light we thought was a satellite because we see them all the time. The odd thing about this one was that as we watched it, it would get VERY bright and then fade to a dim light about every 10 sec. It did not seem to be as high as we normally see satellites.

I then watched the object from my bedroom window.", "Summary : Green, luminous round object that had a dark vertical line (or absense of light)appeared suddenly descended and disappeared.It was midnight and we were driving on Northhampton Blvd and saw what looked like a green luminous round object that had a dark vertical line (or absense of light) it appeared to be falling or descending it disappeared after being visible for about 10 seconds. It never reappeared.", "Summary : Observed two objects. One with flashing multi-colored lights, the second, somewhat bell-shaped with two white-yellow lights. They hovered above us and appeared to be observing us.On May 10, 1997 we were camping in a remote part of Los Padres National Forest. Our party consisted of myself, my wife ((Three names deleted)). Our location was a campsite known as Thorn Meadows, approximately 20 miles west of the small town of Lake of the Woods, in Ventura county. The elevation there is approximately 4000 ft., the winds were calm, the sky was clear, the stars were bright. A crescent moon was descending. We had camped at this site on two other occasions and although it is very remote, this was the first time we had not seen any other people in the area all day.At approximately 10:45 PM, we were finishing cleaning up after dinner. We had a fire burning. ((Name deleted)), pointing to the northeastern sky, said something to effect of, &quot;Hey, what is that thing? I&rsquo;ve been watching it for a while and I can&rsquo;t figure out what it is.&quot; I looked in the direction he was pointing and I saw a flashing light, at approximately 50 degrees. At first I thought it was someone walking down the hill with a flashlight because of the erratic way it was flashing. I then realised that this could not be because there was no hill in that direction. After watching it for approx. 30 seconds, I realised two things: one, the flashing light it was emitting was rapidly changing color; two, it was moving in an unpredictable, erratic manner that could not possibly have been an airplane or helicopter. It was moving in a way that seemed to indicate it was searching for something. At that instant, I realised immediately it was not an ordinary aircraft. The object then changed dire!ction and came directly at us in a straight line moving at a high rate of speed which I could not quantify. The object then stopped in plain view, at roughly the same angle to the horizon. I found this very disturbing. Then ((Name deleted)) said, &quot;Look, there&rsquo;s another one.&quot; I turned my head and saw to the southeast, at approximately 30 degrees, another object that had, to me, appeared out of nowhere and was now hovering almost directly above us. This object was different from the other, it had two bright, white-yellow lights and seemed vaguely bell-shaped. Both objects were completely silent and up there you can hear a plane from miles away. I had the distinct but inexplicable sense that they were looking at us. I could not estimate the size or altitude of the objects, but the second object had a similar appearance to a helicopter hovering at maybe 1500 ft. In other words, it was clearly visible.I was quite frightened but ((Name deleted))was absolutely terror-stricken. She was completely resolute that we needed to leave immediately. Seeing the second object sitting up above us was all I needed to make up my mind to go. In seconds we gathered up the dogs, extinguished the fire and got in the truck and I drove as fast as I could down the dirt road. At one point, my wife saw the first object off to the right of our vehicle and believes it was following us. I did not see it and so cannot verify. Later I realised that we were in a classic abduction scenario and I&rsquo;m glad we left, although I wonder if I would have had it not been for my wife&rsquo;s urging. I also realise that if they really wanted us, we wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance. We spent the night in a motel room in town and went back early in the morning to gather up our things.Let me give you some background here for a frame of reference. I am a skeptical person by nature. In my youth I heard the stories of UFOs and thought, &quot;Well, that could be, but I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it.&quot; Then, a number of years ago I read Communion which led to my reading a few other books on the subject. Then I realised what was really going on. However, I am most certainly not one of those people that goes around trying to spot UFOs, in fact the opposite is true. After reading Communion, I hoped to never see one of those things. I have spent a lot of time looking at the night sky and have never, until now, seen anything that was completely inexplicable. I am convinced that there is no way these objects that we witnessed could have been some experimental aircraft. The way they accelerated, stopped, changed direction, I don&rsquo;t believe that a human would be able to withstand the g forces that would have been generated.", "Summary : Me, and two of my friends were outside late tuesday night, when we saw five lights in a pentagon shape. The lights started moving slowly to our right, and then went out, kind of like turning out a light.Me and my two best friends were sitting out in my back yard, because we wer having a sleep over, at around 10:00 p.m. We had got a nice conversation going, when all of a sudden Kim, one of my friends, pointed out toward the sky. Me and Megan turned our heads. Staring in amzement we saw five big, bright lights, too bright to be stars. We all noticed that the lights were arranged as the points of a pentagon. I belive that there was only one object. The lights moved rather slow to the right, then disapeared. It all seamed so fast. Right after that we ran inside, and started writting stuff down, like the time, the shape of the lights and other stuff. I remembered my dad, and my brother talking about a contest, and how they were stuck on a question. thats when I noticed this report place. I ran to the basement turned on the computer and came here.      My two friends as far as I know are very trust worthy.

Mcclellan, Alabama July 1977Solid overcast day. Objects glowed and details of construction could not be seen other than the fact they appeared to be saucer shaped and at a low altitude due to cloud cover. I watched them for approx. 5 seconds until they flew out of sight over the trees. I saw them very clearly, most amazing thing I&apos;ve ever seen. I don&apos;t know who else saw it because I didn&apos;t ask.  .", "Summary : A large solid noiseless object, possibly round, with four lights, passed slowly over a residential neighborhood in Marlette, MI.  It had two large steady lights, a yellowish white light trailed by a large red light.  Two small lights strobed simultaneously, one on each side of the craft.A large golden light was observed in the eastern sky at 23:35 pm EST in Marlette, Michigan.  The witness, a 52 year old professional, was frightened as she knew instantly that this light, coming towards her home, was not an aircraft.  Her son is an ET experiencer that has worked with Michigan MUFON representatives and has had several close-proximity UFO sightings himself.  He was out of state at the time of this sighting.  The woman, opened her doorwall to go onto her patio to look up at the approaching object but became scared and retreated back indoors.  She again opened her door to go out but again retreated indoors.  As this object slowly appoached she could distinguish other lights on it.  She heard absolutely no sound from it through the sighting.  As the object came nearer she could make out two very large steady lights that seemed to be structures lit from inside.  A large yellowish white light trailed closely by a large steady red light.  There were two small blinking lights, one on each edge at the 3 o&apos;clock and 9 o&apos;clock positions (she believes this was a solid round object although she could not actually see the structure).  As it silently drifted over the house at the speed of a small single engine aircraft, which is common in Marlette, she remembered her son&apos;s insistance that she should measure any object with her two fingers at arm&apos;s length.  The object was approximately 2 1/2 to 3 inches at arm&apos;s length.  She ran back in doors frightened as it passed over.  The sighting duration was approximately 2-3 minutes.  It should also be noted that her husband had reported a UFO to Michigan MUFON at the beginning of December.  His sighting was of a bank of approximately seven bright lights that hovered stationary at 35 degrees from his parked car and then vanished.  This occurred in Peck, MI.

It was dusk. As we neared afield, I saw a large saucer, grey with alarge white highly luminescent dome on top.There were what appeared to be portholes or windows around it. My sister was not paying attention as we sped past it but I started yelling &apos;Oh my God! Look over the trees! Seeit? See it?&apos; She said she saw a very bright object in the sky but could not quite make itout. By the time she looked up it was pretty much obscured. I turned the car around as soon as I hada chance to get another look, but it was no longer there.I have also seen instances of bizarre lights in the sky which appear to be above the clouds, and they make really odd formations. At first I thought they were searchlights that stores and discos usesometime, but the stream of light coming down from the sky that usually tells youthese are earth-based lights were notpresent. The formations these lights created could not have been made by aircraft.There were usually four to five lights.At some point, they would all convert together to create a single point of light and thensplit up again. I saw these on numerous occaisions when heading east on Route 2 nearConcord, MA, going toward Boston last year.On one occaision, my sister Paula also saw these.It is interesting to note, I guess, that Hanscom AFB is off Route 2 (actually, it&apos;s on2A), in Bedford, MA, which is just north ofConcord. I believe Dover AFB in NH is closeby as well.What took me so long to report these incidents? I did not know who to go to. I did not want to contact Hanscom for fear ofridicule.

They were so bright they made the evening sky illuminate.  The clouds were radiant from the lights.  They appeared circular in shape.The number of them changed.  The most at any one time was about 6.  They were circular in shape and appeared to be bright lights.  They would just appear and disappear for a few minutes.  There seemed to be others behind the clouds from the way the clouds illuminated although we could not tell this for sure.", "Summary : Low-flying, object prior to west to east moving severe storm on PA/OH border.I was returning home from work on a Friday afternoon.  A major thunder storm was approaching from the west.  Hozel road heads north from Swamp Road.  It then takes a 90 degree turn west for about 800 yards before intersecting Radio Road, which runs north.  About 300 yards prior to the intersection, I observed an object about 700-800 yards distant at tree-top level.  I took no immediate notice because there is a large blue-green water tower located in the general direction.  This tower, however, is only visible from Radio Road about 200 yards north of the mentioned intersection.  When I took deliberate notice, I observed a disk-shaped object with a small cylindrical superstructure centered on the upper half of the disk. This structure&apos;s top came to a point.  The object was silver in color but didn&apos;t shine; like lead. I saw no movement or heard no noise.  I glanced at the road then back at the tree-tops and the craft was gone.  This had taken seconds so I was not sure what had just happened (or if it happened.)  As I turned north on Radio Road, I glanced to my left, over a farmer&apos;s  field and again saw the object, this time almost totally below the tree-tops and on a sharp (45 degree+) angle (north side lower than south side of craft.) This was at about 300 yards.  From this point I could also see the water tower.  It was clear they were not the same object. The flying object did, however, closely resemble the top of the water tower in shape (definetly not in color or direction.) I turned my attention back to the road and once again, the object was gone.  Several months later, I was relating this story to my Brother-in-law and his girlfriend.  The girl got a little upset.  Talking to her, I found that her bedroom window looked out over this same field from it&apos;s northern edge.  She said she had occasion to witness bright lights coming from the field at night, more than once.", "Summary : A bright light with a long tail (presumed to be a meteroite) was sited moving slowly across the eastern sky, in a south to north direction. The object faded out and the mountain valley had the odor of smoke.My brothers were standing on the back porch, around 10:00 pm. One of them noticed a slow moving firey orange light traveling in a north to south direction in the eastern sky. He called it to the attention of my other brother, so both of them witnessed the site. My brothers noticed that our horses became excited as the intensity of the object&apos;s brightness decreased. The object appeared to burn out and the mountain valley appeared to become foggy. The odor smoke was quite strong and noted by others who had no idea of what had just happened. I, myself, witnessed the smokey odor and the fogginess of the mountian valley (as seen through the security lights at night). Because of the smokiness, we were concerned about the possibility of a fire, so we reported this event to the sheriff&apos;s office by calling 911. No noise was noted when the object disappeared, so we assumed that the object disintegrated in the air and that there was no impact. We believe this object was possibly a meteriote, and would like to report this to whoever would be interested. Please forward this report to the proper parties.", "Summary : Witnessed black, metallic UFO pass by airplane window at 28,000 feet.  Witnessed by several people in daylight.Friday, 10/24/97 at approx. 6:00pm (Mountain Time).  Continental Airlines flight #1807 from Houston to Phoenix.  Shortly after takeoff witnessed a black, semi-matte, metallic craft fly right past the airplane through the window.  It was traveling east - opposite direction of the plane - and was visible as it flew past for about 6 seconds.  Size and distance from plane couldn&apos;t accurately be determined, but it was incredibly close to the plane. It had a triangular upper half, but the lower half was rounded and dome-shaped.  This occured at 28,000 feet (the pilot had announced the plane&apos;s altitude only minutes before.)  3 to 4 other people also witnessed the object as it flew by.  It was daylight and it was clear enough to see the object had definate edges and form (i.e. it wasn&apos;t just a dark shape seen out of the corner of the eye.) The observer has had past training in local law enforcement as well as some FBI training, and would not be described as a typical believer in such things as UFOs.", "Summary : We saw 5 red lights, in a V formation, from the north to the south, in a fifteen minute period.Sitting outside my place of employment, I noticed red lights in the horizon, directly north of us. After noticing, I jokingly said, &quot;Hey guys, I think i see a UFO!&quot;  This was more of a gut fealing than a joke.  My four friends then saw what I was looking at. Since we were right by Skyharbor Airport, there were commercial planes flying East and West.  The red lights seamed to be lower in altittued and oblivious to the fact that it was flying directly toward commercial aircraft traffic.  They were in a V formation, three red lights in front, two red lights behind and to each side.  As they moved closer to us we moved into our parking lot.  There seemed to be no &quot;body&quot; to this aircraft, only lights.  When directly overhead, it was so large, it wouldnt fit it into direct vision, I had to shift my eyes to see the entire object.  At this time, we realized that this was not one object, it was five, or more.  The red light in back and to my right, was trailing slightly.  In talking !with my co-workers, some say the lights were red, and some say they were orange.  The lights slowly moved to the South, and then they were gone.  Then the following day, we saw the six o&apos;clock news ( at work ) and all doubts were gone, it was a UFO!", "Summary : 250 foot silver cylinderAt 1700 (Greek time) I observed a 100 foot silver cylinder very slowly moving horizontally across the sky.  It was metalic in appearance and about 1500 feet from me.

They appeared to be floating.  Atleast 10 cars were pulled over on the side of the road.  I knew my daughters and I were not seeing things.I picked up my daughters from a slumber party on FM 1314.  We travelled to Porter which is off of HWY 59.  My 11 year old asked &quot;Mom, oh my God, what is that in the sky?&quot;  I turned around at the Kroger right under the underpass.  She sounded frantic.  I looked and safely said&quot;Probably parachutes.&quot;  I drove back to 59 and proceeded to travel slowly on the feeder road going south towards Houston.  I was shocked and amazed at what I saw.  I looked around me and cars were pulling over on the sides of the road to see the objects.  There were about 15-20.  They looked like rocks or meteors floating suspended in the air.  I pulled over at a car dealership on the right and stared at them.  It was so unreal.  Like I was in a movie and it wasn&apos;t really happening.  One of the rocks looked very strange.  They were all at different altitudes and they were moving slowly towards the west/southwest.  I became aware of the fact that these objects could drop strait on our heads at any second,!so I backed out and left.  I turned around at the next exit.  By the time I got back to the spot and on the other side of the road heading north, the last of them could be seen just over the tree tops.  I headed up 1314 to Conroe.  I thought I could see them from the 242 loop, but no luck.  I don&apos;t know where they went or what in the world they were, but I would like to know if something like meteors can come into our atmosphere and float that way.  They appeared to be in 0 gravity.  With all of the others that saw I know I can&apos;t explain it away.", "Summary : ON THE 20 OF SEPT WE SAW BIG BRIGTH LIGHT IT CAME DOWNON SEPT.

It appeared black against the twilight blue sky. A faint sound like distant chopper sounds. I was looking at it with another co-worker and it came to a stop. Then it slowly grew smaller and was gone. But it wasn&apos;t moving. Almost like a cloaking device. I have never seen a UFO, and I personally think it&apos;s a bunch of BS, but this freaked me out.I have got to go, I&apos;m at work.", "Summary : A huge light that most of all seemed like those light-balls in the discoteques followedour car. We were alone at the road and when we stopped to verify it stopped too. It was not a helicopter &apos;cause there were no sound at all and it mooved almost 25 km. so it wasn&apos;t a light comming from the ground neither.We were 4 people comming from a practice session with our salsa band. We had to drive app. 30 km to get home and when we got out of the city the girl in the back saw &quot;something iin the sky&quot; so first we thought that there was a party going on somewhere. But as it was still there 5 minutes later we thought that it could bea car mooving with a light on lthe roof or something like that. But when we realized that it was a forest ti couldn&apos;t be that neither. Therefore, even I, who normally does not belive in such things, started to get nervous. We tried to stop the car to see if we could hear something but no sounds were there besides some birds. The sky was not cloudy but not totally free from clouds neither. There were som kindof fog. But it could not be a helicopter; if it were a helicopter I would have been able to see it above. An det light was not comming from the ground neither. We started the car again an drove app. 10 kmBut as it was &quot;following&quot; us we stopped the car once more. When we stopped the car it stopped too. It was always right beside us. When we passed through a small village we thought that we had lost it, but when we got through it rejoined us beside the road. We were driving from Fos sur Mer to Salon de Provence in South France. The singer who was sitting in the back (the girl who first saw the thing) claimed that she had seen exately the same ting in December last year with 2 friends as they were taking a walk in the forest. But it has only lasted for app. 10 seconds. This time the light followed the car for app. 25 km even when we took some sharp turns and when wh changed the road etc. it was right beside us.The Light:It was round but not like a circle. It was more like some small sqaures of light that was turning first one way and then the other in a smooth way. The center changed size all the time; it was like someting pulsing - like a heart. Around of the center there were the smaller squars of light og allwas turned in the same direction.It was like one of the best science fiction moovies ! It changed size, higth and speed. And it was sure that it followed us because wo drove app. 3 km through the city and made some very sharp turns. If it had been something from the ground id would have had to pass through a forest, a lake and one more forest. If it was comming from the sky it made no sound at all and it could see us even when we drove with the lights out. When we arrived at Salon de Provence it stopped following us and returned to where we came from.We were all affraid as it was clear that this could not be explained. Even the driver who is a non-believer was affraid.The persons in the car:  ((4 names deleted)).

An Air Force jet was in pursuit.  The metal object was at a low altitude, as if it were about to land.In 1971, when I lived in Spokane, WA, I saw a UFO.  I was finished with my shift as a Registered Nurse at Deaconess Hospital, enroute to meet my fiance.  We planned to see a movie at the Garland Theater on the north end of the city.  It was midweek, a Wednesday or Thursday, and the date may have been 6/10/71.As I drove north up the Monroe Street hill at approximately 3:50 PM (my shift ended at 3:30 PM), I had to put down the sun visor because a bright light was hitting me in the eyes.  When I reached the top of the hill, I stopped for a traffic light.  It was then that I noticed that the bright light was reflecting off a metal flying object that I can only describe as a &quot;flying saucer&quot;.  The surface of the object was metal, the color of aluminum or stainless steel.  The object was round, flat on the bottom, and with a sloped dome in the center.  This &quot;flying saucer&quot; was not high in the sky, but at a low altitude, as if it were about to land.  An Air Force jet of similar size was in pursuit of the UFO at the same altitude and close behind.I thought the jet might be based at nearby Fairchild Air Force Base.When the traffic light turned green, I proceeded on my way and lost sight of the UFO.  I have no explanation as to what it was, only that I have never seen anything like it before or since.", "Summary : &quot;Delta&quot; shaped group of motionless bright red lights sighted over Simi Valley, Calif.At about 9:25 p.m. on the evening of May 22, 1997 in the Southern California city of Simi Valley (about 25 miles NW of L.A.), while returning home from a Boy Scout meeting, my 12 year old son and I noticed an unusually bright red object in the Northern sky.  We pulled into the parking lot of a local school and exited our vehicle to get a better observation.  What we saw appeared to be not one but a &quot;tight&quot; group of perhaps 10-15 extremely bright red lights in the shape of a flat triangle or &quot;delta&quot; at about 330 degrees (looking towards the Big Dipper constellation).  The objects semed perfectly motionless and emitted a constant bright reddish glow.  We observed no blinking of the lights, nor any other lights of another color (such as white aircraft lights).  After approximately 4-5 minutes of observing these objects, they appeared to suddenly dim and then suddenly disappeared from sight as if they lifted vertically at an extremely high rate of speed.  We heard no particular !sounds during this event.   We then returned home and shortly thereafter telephoned NUFORC to report the event as aforesaid.   We have not previously observed such an event as this and are very &quot;impressed&quot; at whatever our sighting was.

A long wooden stair case led down the cliffs to the beach and the waves appeared to be in the cliffs&apos; shadow from Highway 1 headlights. I saw a series of lights glowing from behind the waves about 5 ? feet apart and 8 ? inches in diameter. It/they gave the appearance of portholes on the side of a submersible. I have no explanation. When they interviewed a CA lighthouse keeper on the radio (his station was becoming automated - and you had to walk through a tunnel to reach it) and asked him if in all of his years of watching the surf he had seen anything strange - he reported seeing the same thing -- with no idea what it could be!", "Summary : I called my name is Jim Asaro.Me and 3 friends went out to go to somones house we looked at the sky we saw a UFO it had four lights in a diamond shape and they blinked every once and a while when they blinked off you could see the disk shaped outline it was going incredibly fast it circled about 5 times each sighting was about 5 min. apart.then after it circled 5 times about 5 min. later we saw two of them they went so close we thought they were going to crash.we live near a airport but we lived here for 13 years this was no plain it went so fast and the disc shape it was no plain", "The caller and his work companion were driving to work on Route 15.  Suddenly, both of them saw in the morning sky what looked to be &quot;(a cloud of) liquid&quot; hovering in the sky.  It was reddish-green (?) in color.  The object (?) was extremely bright, it seemed to give off a high pitched noise, and it moved in front of their car, causing them to stop on the highway.   It appeared to be &quot;gigantic&quot; from their vantage point, &quot;as big as an apartment building.&quot; Other cars were slowing, as well, to look at it. The caller got out of the car and ran &quot;back.&quot;  (Away from it??)   Then the object began moving across the sky in front of their car.", "Summary : This happened A LONG time ago , but i am JUST now admiting it. It was about 10:00 Pm on Feb 23, 1993. Me and a Friend were in his Pool in his back yard and i saw a LARGE object in the sky about as big as a FOOTBALL FIELD !! it was far away about a mile then it turned INTO a SMALL red Ball then it shot up into the Distance. My friend Saw a little of it but i saw all of it.One night me and a Friend were in his Pool in his Backyard at 10:00PM on Feb 23 1993. I looked up in the ski and about a MILE away i saw a HUGE object in the ski that was about as big as a Football field!! It had blue lights underneath its hull that were VERY bright. Then after floating in the air for about 9 seconds it turned into a RED ball that was VERY small !!! THen it shot off into the Distance. My friend saw a little of it but i saw ALL. THe next day i was at another friends house and thier dad SAW the Exact SAME thing i saw that night and he Described it Exactly !!", "The caller and her three daughters were outside looking at the comet with their binoculars.  She looked at the Big Dipper, when she noticed an object moving &quot;fast&quot; across the night sky, which &quot;entranced&quot; the four of them. The object had a &quot;rounded triangular&quot; shape to the front of it, and it had &quot;twenty or so&quot; solid, distinct white lights on the leading edge of it.  It was larger than a clenched fist at arm&apos;s length, I.e. larger than a full moon.As the object moved rapidly to the south, it just seemed to disappear from sight.  The mother ran around the house to follow it as it moved south, but it was gone from sight before she could get there. They watched the object with binoculars, and all four of them drew its shape.", "Summary : A fast moving &quot;body of Light&quot; sweeps over us as we star watch in the Sacred Valley of the Incas outside Cusco Peru at an elevation of l0,000&apos;  The night was clear, cold and very dark (no moon).  The &quot;Light&quot; was seen coming from the southwest directly over a 600&apos; peak just in front of us.  It was bright white and seemed to have mass, but no structure was perceived by the two witnesses.  It was approximately a half mile in width and moving at a &quot;very high speed&quot; ...I had been asked to build a &quot;walking meditation garden maze&quot; for a large resort in the Peruvian Andes.  Upon completion of the maze I invited the owners and a friend for a small ceremony to dedicate the Classical 7-Path Labyrinth to the healing and well being of our planet Earth.  It was the last few days of late May around 9pm in the evening on a star lit clear night, no moon.  Following the short dedication ceremony the four of us stood watching the heavens, Maria del Carmen and I faced the sacred mountain &quot;Yawar Maki&quot; which juts up from the Urubamba river a few feet from where we stood.  She and I were looking up over the peak at the Southern Cross when suddenly a &quot;large body&quot; of fast moving light sped directly over our heads.  In fact both of us almost fell backwards as we followed the light with our heads craning backwards.  Across the sky overhead it moved and then just disappeared into thin air.  The two men were looking in the other direction and by the time they hea! rd our squeals and looked in our direction, the body of light has completely disappeared.  The entire event took not more than a matter of seconds.  This was neither airplane or lightning, this we know, what is was through is still to be known.  The creation of this particular Labyrinth is as a healing center for tourists and pilgrims visiting the ancient sacred sites in this area of the Andes.  In myth and folklore, the Labyrinth traditions tell of many unusual stories such as that of Scandinavian sailors who would use the labyrinth in a form of sympathetic magic to control the weather.  It is also energetically linked with the seven major energy centers in the bodies auric field, the tones on the scale, and the 7 primary colors in the rainbow.  Unusual phenomena has been recounted in relation to the labyrinth for the past 3,500 years and in fact the act of walking a labyrinth still seems to draw transformative events to the practitioner.  I and maria del Carman both feel thi! s ususal &quot;event&quot; and our walking and dedication somehow are united.  I have never seen a UFO but I came away from this experience feeling like I had seen something I could not explain by conventional terms.  Both Maria del Carmen and her husband, a famous British journalist recounted several sightings during the past year and a half they&apos;ve owned the hotel and lived in this part of the Andes.  They tell me these type stories are common and knowledge of &quot;craft&quot; is widespread and seen by many.  In fact, a lake just over the peak we had stood in front of  called &quot;Chequerec&quot; is known locally as the &quot;UFO Lake&quot; and for the past l00 years (and probably more) stories have been told of craft coming and going from the lake and tales of &quot;little green men&quot; etc.  After this experience I asked around to the native people, the Quechua.  Everyone had a story which was usually told in a matter of fact demeanor as something as natural as the sun coming up each day. Another Indian friend that I ! would describe as being educated, soft-spoken and extremely low profile, and who&apos;d lived many years at the ancient site of Machu Picchu recounted a story.  He claims to have seen up to l7 &quot;ships&quot; on one night last November 1996.  As he told it, he was guiding an American woman into the sacred ruins late after midnight (which is allowed with special permission) when they both witnessed a litany of unusual &quot;lights&quot; above and around the old city.  He said he&apos;s not seen anything of this nature in the past  seven years, and believed that they&apos;d (the star people) returned.  This site has been known in local lore to be a place of intense UFO phenomena throughout the ages.", "Summary : Adults + children sitting on lake bank awaiting fireworks,see a bright blue ball streak fast across skyline, decend andseemingly to go into lake, but no sound was heard orsplash seen.Family members, adults and kids, sitting on lake shore at dusk.The sky was begining to become dark, water infront of us, many trees across from us.We were watching the sky for the fireworks.Out of the northwest sky a brite blue ball assendedto streak north to south and then decend as if intothe lake.

Must have been enormous.  Biggest and most unusual thing I have ever seen.I am writing about a &quot;phenomenon&quot; that I witnessed that was unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seenbefore, so I guess it would fall under the description of a &quot;UFO&quot;. As a scientist with areasonable understanding of astronomy and meteorology, and with an equally good knowledgeof aircraft (both military and civilian), I can safely say that what my colleague and I witnessedwas something that I&apos;m sure would not fall into most of the easily explainable categories. On aclear night during the Memorial Day weekend (24th of May), I saw something that lookedabsolutely enormous moving across the sky in a westerly direction. Since all I could see werethe lights to this thing (very bright white lights), I couldn&apos;t make out the shape precisely.What was even more puzzling was that the lights seemed to move, ever so slightly, withrespect to each other, but it was definitely not a &quot;formation&quot; of any kind of aircraft like I hadever seen. Although I couldn&apos;t guage the exact size of the object since I didn&apos;t know whataltitude it was at (although I would guess it was pretty high), it appeared to be bigger thananything I&apos;ve ever seen flying before, maybe several times the size of a jumbo jet. There wasabsolutely no noise and it seemed to be moving very slowly. We were on a little stretch ofroad between Lake Tahoe and Interstate 80 and there were a lot of stars out, so I&apos;d be reallysurprized if others in the Lake Tahoe area didn&apos;t spot these strange lights, also. Have youreceived any reports of sightings like this in this part of the country? Because of my job, I amhesitant to &quot;go public&quot; with this kind of information, so I would appreciate it if you didn&apos;tpublish my name or email address. Please let me know if anyone is aware of any really strangemilitary exercises going on in this area.", "Summary : A bright light seen in the sky, when observed through binoculars seen as a bright light surrounded by three to five others, hovering and then moving to another spotMy friend and I were observing stars andsatellites after lighting our fireworks.After tracking a satellite for severalminutes, we observed a growing light in thesky.  It seemed far away, and looked likethe landing lights of a plane.  Werealized, however, that that was impossiblewhen we realized that it was not moving, andcouldn&apos;t be a helo that was hovering as itbeen there several minutes and was soundless.I am a pilot and would have been able toidentify whether or not it was a plane whenI looked at it through my binoculars.  Itappeared as a bright, central white lightsurrounded by smaller lights, not like thewingtip lights of a plane but completelyaround the central light, being of blue,green, and red color.  I noticed throughthe binoculars that the object would moveslowly, stop, then move again.

The event, as yet unexplained, shook a surface area 80 miles n/s and 100 miles e/w.  Military installations in the area deny supersonic flight by any of their craft, and, at least on this occasion, they should be believed. This was no ordinary jet boom.  In mid New Orleans, people went into the streets to look for signs of the explosion.

We thought it was somthing fun looking so ran towards it and it shot up in a zig zag fashion then disappeared. Later my mother found a circle of coffee can sized holes in the field. A family outside of town had a strange craft hover over their house near the same time.My cosin and I were both 7. We were playing in a small field behind our Great grand mother&apos;s ,on the north edge of town. I don&apos;t remember exactly when but we both became aware of a silver metal object in the field. I remember thinking it was a metal pig hut because my older brother showed me one in the woods and told me that the pigs had gone feral and they would kill me if I went in the woods. I guess that was his attempt to protect me! Anyway, the object seemed to shimmer with heat waves and at some point we saw that it was a disc about twice as tall as a car and 3 times as long. I seem to remember that I could see under it like it was hovering close to the ground. We were not afraid at that time and decided to run up to it. we were about 50 feet away when it shot up on an angle to the right and appeared to be the size of a nickle , barely paused then shot up again on an angle to the left till at appeaed the size of a small pea then shot up to the right and disappeared. I !don&apos;t remember leaving the field but I remember running into my gramma&apos;s house and being very excited. My cousin moved to Washington state in the 70&apos;s. In 1983 he came to our grampa&apos;s funeral and I asked if he remembered it. He did. My mother did not believe us until we went on about it for several days. When she finally looked there was a series of coffee can sized holes near where the object was. A woman who lived 2 miles north of town told that at about that same time she and her kids (around my age) were watching TV at night when they heard sound like roof shingles slapping and the kids ran and looked out the windows. The kids claimed there was something hovering over the house with colored lights but the mother wouldn&apos;t look because she was afraid. I as female and my cousin is male. As far as I can nail it down, this was about 1966.", "Summary : Saw bright green light, about 11:45 pass over head going to northeast.  No sound but radio was out for about ten to fifteen seconds.

We where standing in parking lot just out side of the Flag Store on Essex, side of Road.  My younger son, 19 and in college was remarking to other kids to look at what was coming.  He thinks it was strange because it was changing speed and jumping all over the place.  We had two Japanese students with us and they also say it was strange.  We had radio and car running and both acted up for about ten seconds:  radio went dead and car stalled.", "Summary : My wife and I witnessed a craft passing in front uf us that was close to a mile long.This boomerang/trianglar craft became &quot;transluct&quot; when it passed through the light of the moon.It was 8:30 pm., mst, 3/13/97, and I wasgoing to bed. I went to close the window,when three huge, white, bright lights caughtmy eye. A plane was crashing from SkyHarbor Airport in Phoenix, the angle andspeed would not allow a plane to survive.I ran to the living room, grabbed my glasses,and told my wife of 25 years, Get outside,NOW! Never said that before, in that tone.We were standing on our porch within 8-10seconds. This craft was 3000 ft. off thesurface. at least 1 mile in length. Thereis no doubt in our minds that what we wereseeing, was one object. It appeared to betriangular or wedge shaped. Three bright whitebeams of light up front, and 4-5 solid, non-blinking red lights on east side and rear.The moon at that time was at 45 degrees anddirectly facing us. I told my wife, &quot;We&apos;llbe able to see detail as it passes in frontof us, directly in front of the moon. As thecraft passed thru the light of the moon, thecolor of the moon changed to dingy yellow,and we could see horizontal &quot;waves&quot; as itpassed. These waves were similar to gasolinefumes if one to take the lid off of a gas can,and look at the reflection of the fumes. Thecraft was viewed by us from a straight linenorth to south. It never moved irratically,nor did it make a sound. It was totally quiet.Our viewing sight was approximatly 2 milesfrom the craft. We witnessed a plane in landingformation pass right over the object. It neveradjusted its course. It didn&apos;t see it. I toldmy story to MUFON on 1-15-97. We were on,&quot;Strange Universe&quot; on 3/31/97 as witnesses tothis great event.

For some reason, I didn&apos;t pay much attention to it. After about 45 minutes, I saw that it was in the same position, and had not moved. I looked at it with my 11x80 binoculars (on a tripod) and it started to move (at about 1&quot;/second) steadily parallel to the horizon (eastward). I do not know the exact date, but it was sometime in March and I told a friend about it the next day. A few weeks later, several very bright orange lights were seen to the south all over Eastern Ontario. My friend saw them (I did not) and said that they were bright enough to cast a shadow - his wife and several neighbours watched them for a few minutes. The Ottawa Citizen newspaper had an article about them (with photos) a couple of days later and claimed that they were flares being tested as Fort Drum, USA (about 70 miles due south of this sighting). When my friend&apos;s wife phoned Fort Drum, she was told that the Canadian Government was testing flares near Prescott!! (approx. 20 miles south of the sighting). On Aug 6, ~2300 hrs, the sky was overcast but there was a clear band over the northern horizon.

PD))", "Summary : When pulling out of my driveway headed north I noticed a stationary bright white light above the west horizon which suddenly sped off traveling north. I turned east off the main road since there was another vehicle behind me in order to view the object. I was putting my car window down when I suddenly saw an aircraft to the left and above me. It measured four to five palm breadths and was a metallic bronze color with a narrow nose/head and a short fan shaped tail.  It was relatively flat with a rectangular shape with two rows of red lights and two rows of blue lights on each side and a single row of red or blue lights on the tail.  It passed over in five to six seconds and no engine sound was heard.When pulling out of my driveway on 09/19/97 to go to work, I turned north onto West Ave. and stopped at the stop sign.  A bright white stationary light caught my eye which I thought was an airplane against the west horizon. I remained stopped at the sign because the light was so bright. As I watched it, it appeared to stop and start very quickly several times.  I pulled away from the stop sign when I saw another vehicle behind me only to see the object speed off faster than any plane goes traveling in the same direction as my car.  To view it better I decided to turn off the main road in an east direction, put my car in park, shut off the radio and was putting my automatic window down when I suddenly saw an aircraft to the left of my car and above me.  Thinking this was the bright object I had seen, it would have been necessary for it to have made a sharp 45 degree angle in order for me to have seen it so quickly. It scared me tremendously and I remember reminding myself that there were other vehicles on the road at this time and I must not be the only one seeing this. With my car window down I was looking out to see the bright light but instead saw an aircraft that seemed unusual, rectangular in shape, large, ( it would have taken four to five palm breadths to cover the length) but not wide, (it would have taken one=half a palm breadths to  cover the width) It was a metallic bronze/chocolate color with a narrow head and fan shaped horizontal small tail compared to the large rectangular body.  No white light was visible and there was no sound made by the craft.  It seemed to move slowly above me taking five to six seconds  to pass and was not visible in the eastern horizon afterwards, however the area is densley populated with homes and large trees. I was afraid it was some type of military aircraft that had gotten off course and flying so low, I thought it would crash into the surrounding homes. Two rows of eight to twelve lights which were circular and not revolving or shining a beam were on each side of the craft. Each row was single in color and one row was red and the other blue but I cannot remember the sequence of the color.  The tail also had a row of either red or blue lights but were perpendicular to the craft and only five or six circular non-beaming lights.  The body of the craft was wider than the sides and angled down like a single step to the edges.  The lights were beneath each edge although I could not see the entire left edge of the craft. After it passed, I remember sitting in my car for several seconds wondering what it was and what I should do.  Not wanting to be late for work, I continued east on the side street to LaGrange Road thinking any aircraft that big and that low I would be able to see when I was past the trees and houses.  However, it was no where to be seen.  I went to work and returned home at approximately 1600  when I contacted the Federal Aviation Agency only to be told that most of their personnel had left for the day and they had no reports of unusual aircraft that day.  I contacted our local newspaper - The Daily Southtown - and asked about any reportings. They informed me they got their information from the local police and they had received none.  Not wanting any to think I was strange, I tried to find somewhere to report this without telling the police.  The local phone numbers for the UFO agency were disconnected.  Although I am reminded daily of the event, only today 12/02/97 did I find the phone number and web site for the National UFO Reporting Center due to a report in the Daily Southtown about another local sighting  of unusual lights two days ago.  I would like for someone to explain that what I saw was an experimental military aircraft or I would think perhaps others on their way to work may have seen the same thing I did.", "Summary : Saw a dim moving light.  Thought I was watching a satellite.  Yellow light flashed brilliantly, then faded to near invisibility.  It was a clear night and I was out to watch the Perseid meteor shower.I am a university teacher who has lived in Bellingham for 7 years.  I am interested in UFO phenomena, but have never seen anything unusual before.  On the evening of August 10, 1997, I was outside at 11:30 pm watching for shooting stars when I saw what I thought was a satellite.  It was very dim, almost invisible, and I only noticed it because of the faint movement.  As I watched, the &quot;satellite&quot; suddenly flashed a brilliant yellow light.  The original light in the sky was barely a pinprick, but the flash was as large as my pinky nail held at arms length.  After the flash, the &quot;satellite&quot; seemed to disappear.  I could then make out faint movement and a tiny pinprick of light and then the object flashed again.  It moved in an east-to-west trajectory and flashed about every ten seconds until it went out of my line of sight.  I estimate that I watched the object for approximately 2, maybe 3 minutes.  I went inside, through the house, to see if it was visible from my front porch! (I had been on my back deck).  It wasn&apos;t.

The duration of this sound was also approximately one-second.

(N.E.).  I was approx. 70 nautical miles S.W. of the Hobart VOR. on the 240 radial.  At around 1900 CST, I observed what I thought at first was a meteorite, and wondered why it didn&apos;t burn up like they usually do.  I remember saying to myself, &quot;Gosh, I could of made a wish on this one!&quot;  Then I thought it was going to make it all the way to the ground.  When it got to my altitude, it suddenly leveled off, veered slightly to the north, then turned and came directly at me, still at what I, out of lack of a better term, will call &quot;meteorite speed&quot;.  I was in awe, and remember thinking, &quot;nothing travels that fast!!!&quot; After a few seconds in awe, I was terror stricken, as I realized the object was on a direct collision course. My reflex reaction made me bank the plane 90 degrees, and pull back hard to avoid collision. (As if my 120 mph airplane could possibly avoid something that fast!?)  When there was no impact, or wake, or anything else, I turned around to see what it was, but it was gone.  I immediately went for my charts to find the frequency to call ATC on, to see if they had painted a target, but was so upset, and shaking, I couldn&apos;t look at my chart and fly the plane at the same time.  As for the size, and relative speed of the object, I can only make an analogy.  I have already compared it to a meteorite.  Assuming a meteorite appears about the size of a kernel of corn, held at arms length, then this object went from that size, when I first observed it, to about the size of a beach ball, held at arms length, when I maneuvered abruptly to &quot;avoid it&quot;. I am a commercial pilot with ten years, and several thousand flight hours of experience, and am certainly used to seeing lights in the sky, and judging their speed and altitude, for collision avoidance. I live near an Air Force base, and am used to seeing, and sharing the airspace with military aircraft.   I can say with certainty, nothing the military has, goes that fast.      If anyone wants to check the radar tapes, my transponder was on all the way, so there should be a good plot of my course.   I departed Roswell, N. M., at approx. 16:00 mountain time.

It appeared to be one mile to the south/southeast of the campground. It remained &apos;flickering&apos; in a cross pattern, until I signaled with a flashlight, which caused it to abruptly change its pattern and speed; changing its location extremely quickly. and then coming back to its original spot and remain flickering once again. just above the mountain.The object appeared to be of a spherical shape, maybe 15-20ft across, from where it was observed. The object &apos;flickered&apos; rapidly and it moved in a tight, &apos;tic tac toe&apos; like movement, intensifying in luminensce as it moved. After 30 min. object was &apos;signaled&apos; with a small flashlight, to which the object reacted by flashing brighter and moving even more erratically; much faster and farther. After, it would come back to its original position. There were no changes in color,as far as the light is concerned.

It hovered over Downey (probably more like La Mirada) for a few minutes. Then it took off on a new coarse (NW - like Point Mugu). We were all sure that it was not a plane. The curious thing is that the arc it described on the sky seemed to maintain a constant speed as it approached the horizon.

We tried to hear a sound from the objects, thinking it might be helicopters flying in formation, but there was no strobe or red and green marker lights.  The formation of the five objects did not changeas you would expect from aircraft.  There was no change in spacing, no noise and it was as bright overhead as it was comming or going.  We could not tell how high the objects were, but while discussing what we saw the next day we realized thatwe might have see these objects while they were over Prescott because they started out red then changed to white while over Phoenix.

I stopped my vehicle and tried to understand what it was. As I watched, it began to change shapes, and flash as if the entire unit was a strobe light. I am a former member of the Civil Air Patrol (1Lt.) and I am very familiar with small aircraft, and this was unlike anything I have ever seen. The craft seemed to be observing the construction of the communications tower. Traffic began to build behind me and I had to move to another location 20 seconds away, however, after I moved it was gone. No aircraft I have ever seen from this elevated view point can move out of the field of view so quickly.I live in Allison Park in Hampton Twp., about 12 miles North of the city of Pittsburgh PA. On Friday July 11 1997, I was on my way home at 3:25 PM. I entered the northern end of Topnic Dr.(in Hampton Twp) and from its high elevation I looked to see how much progress was made on the new communications tower being built near the township Municipal building and as I made the turn onto Topnic I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. Looking due south, I saw the tower first. It was not far from being topped off. I could barely see the men working on the top section, but just off to the right, or to the west, there was a black object hovering, as if observing the tower. It was about 1500 above the ground and about 1/2 mile away from me and was so black it was if I was looking at a hole in the sky. It was sort of barrel shaped, and as I watched it hovering completly silent and motionless, it began to change shapes. It changed so many times that I could no longer tell what shape it wa! s. It then began to flash as if the entire craft was a strobe light, pulsing about every 2 seconds. I could see no detail in the craft, no lights or windows, just a black object in the sky hovering silently motionless at first, and then suddenly changing shapes, and flashing like a giant strobe light. I am a mature adult man, with years of experience in the USAF Civil Air Patrol. I live within the TCA of Pittsburgh International Airport, and I&apos;m used to seeing aircraft of military, commercial, and private origin flying in the area. I have never in my life, however, seen anything that I can even say comes close to looking like the craft that I saw on 11 July 1997. My vehicle was stopped in the middle of the road as I observed this craft, and a few cars started to build up behind me. I moved on down the road where I lost sight of it for 20 seconds. When I got to another vantage point, it was gone. From the elevation that I was at, no aircraft, balloon, or helicopter could have moved out of my field of view so quickly. I never heard of any other witnesses, but would like to know, if anybody out there can tell me, if there were any other reports of this sighting.

The more I have thought about this the more I knew I should write down what I saw. &nbsp; I was flying from Seattle to Dallas on Flight 18 Friday Nov. 14th. At about 6:35-6:45 P.M. Dallas time, about a half hour out of Dallas/Ft Worth we were high above thick cloud cover. There was a full moon out and the clarity above the clouds was good. As we looked out ahead and to the east (port side of the aircraft), I noticed few lights out ahead of us. I presumed they were other aircraft coming right at us since the lights did not blink like wing lights but as the head lights do at times. There were two such lights and they looked far off but being at night it was hard to tell just how far. I watched for a long time watching other aircraft with blinking strobe lights passing in various directions. these lights (the identifiable aircraft with blinkers) were much smaller in size to the constant lights. What started to seem strange was the fact that the original two lights which were constant began to appear to be closer the nearer we flew, not farther apart as it should be is! we were approaching them. Also what seemed strange was the fact that at no point did there appear any other lights such as a green (starboard) or red (port) lights with these two constant lights. I watched intently as I saw a normally lit and identifiable aircraft fly perpendicular to the main light on my left that I had been watching. The identifiable aircraft approached extremely close and behind this light. The light was not a distant star or light on a hill or a beacon as my mind raced to start to explain what I was seeing. &nbsp; The time span now is maybe 15 full minutes of watching these lights. We were approaching these lights which was apparent since the lights were now directly to the port side of the aircraft and no longer in front of us. As we continued on, and our approach to Dallas caused as to slightly alter our approach, these lights became directly to port from us and even closer and seemed to rise higher above the cloud layer than before. I had mentioned the lights to my companion several times since I first spotted them when I had described them first as two aircraft with their&nbsp; headlights on. At this point I saw a third light low in the cloud cover below these two lights. This third light was hazy as if slightly in the clouds and also seemed larger and closer to us. It had shape to it, almost like it was like a soft cube shape (a cube with rounded corners and puffed up sides. It was not just light). I was seriously questioning that these lights were anything I had seen before. I had made! several comments to my friend trying to explain what I was seeing since I knew they were not aircraft like &quot;these have to be beacon lights&quot; or &quot;maybe they are power lines&quot; always to be followed by, &quot;but we are too high for that&quot;. &nbsp; I said to my companion that she should look at the lights. Right about then, I leaned back as we passed the lights. My companion leaned over me and looked now back slightly aft and to port through the windows and said to me &quot;You mean those lights that look like a triangle?&quot;. I looked out the window again and now saw that indeed there was three distinct lights, not blinking above the cloud cover in a triangle formation. The third light had indeed come out and was well above the clouds. &nbsp; As we continued to move towards Dallas and begin our decent, the lights remained in a triangle formation eventhough we continued make a left turn towards the Dallas/Ft Worth airport. In other words, even thought they were in a triangular formation while we looked at them to port, they remained in a triangular formation as we viewed them to aft. &nbsp; Within a few minutes we were descending into the clouds and I lost sight of the lights. &nbsp; I have thought a lot about what I saw and discussed it with my companion who also saw them. These were stationary lights at our altitude during normal flight approach about 35-45 mins out of Dallas or slightly higher (with the exception to the third light) which would put them at&nbsp; least 25-35K feet. The lights were stationary since while we approached they were in front, as we continued they were to the port and then aft of us as we passed. There were initially two constant lights very far apart when first viewed and only slightly brighter and very much closer to each other 30 minutes later when joined by the third light from the clouds. the lights did not seem to move but were stationary though they must have moved since they were closer to each other after viewing them for 30 minutes than at first. &nbsp; I am a 42 yr old businessman in Seattle (your town). I work as a real estate broker. I was a concert promoter for many many years and have flown hundreds of thousands of miles. I have a good grasp of astronomy and can identify the moons of Jupiter with my binoculars and Venus along with my favorite constellations. I grew up with a pilot as y best friend and have logged hundreds of right seat flying in small aircraft so I have an appreciation for what aircraft look like at night and during the day. &nbsp; Though I do listen to Art Bell and have read many books on Roswell and a few about other UFO&apos;s, I am not a &quot;believer&quot;. I am a curious observer. With thousand s of hours of staring at the skies, of flying all over this country many times over during night and day, I have never seen anything that wasn&apos;t identifiable, at least after 5-10 minutes of viewing. These objects were viewed by me for nearly 45 minutes non-stop and I have no explanation that meets any test I put to it. I have replayed the tape in my head over and over. I keep seeing the aircraft passing behind the main left light. I keep seeing the two lights far apart and them seeing the triangle shape after the appearance of the third. I see the third boxy light shrouded ion the clouds then see it clearly in view above the clouds. These objects had to be moving, but in such a way that they seemed stationary. There were no additional lights associated with these white lights. there were no strobes with these lights. Whil! e other aircraft came and went from Dallas and appeared across the sky, these lights seemed to sit still. &nbsp; I had to finally admit I saw something strange and unexplainable with my resources. I guess in a way, I wanted to live in denial that I saw anything weird at all, but in the end, had to write this down and send it off as a statement of my very best recollection of what I saw. &nbsp; My companion is a person who works for the airline, does not wish to be involved but has flown extensively for the last 5 years in her porfession", "Summary : 5 lights in the sky east of columbia dipping rapidly, disappearing then rising again rapidlydate and time are approximate - i had, for the most part,", "Summary : UFO flying low over buildings.

The light came from over the trees to the east and moved  to the southwest diaginally to the west.

I&apos;m an amateur astonomer. Every meteorite I have ever seen was always white never any color, a small point of light, and faster and higher elevation than this object.  The color was a failrly brilliant (almost neon) light green, it had lesser shades of yellow and white.  It seemed like I could actually see a round object rather than the normal point of light.  It was geading toward earth at a 45% angle.  There is no way it could have burned-up as it was near ground level when it dissapeared to the NE behind Black Mountain.  It was the same size and light intensity when first viewed high up in the sky.  There was an alomost full moon at the time and the sky was still somewhat light from the sunset so it&apos;s even more amazing how bright and visible this object was, as the sky was far from dark at the time.By the way, I also witnessed the UFO&apos;s near Phoenix on 3-13-97 which I never reported until now.They were due south of here, I would estimate directly over Phoenix.  It&apos;s dark sky here as there is no city lights in this rural area 30-miles north of downtown Phoenix, but bright city lights in Phoenix may explain explain why my view was so good. Plus, I am elevated here at 2,600 foot level, on the slope of Black Mountain.  My wife and I observed the 3-13-97 objects for about 20 to 30-minutes.  They were in a quarter-circle formation with 5 objects to the right and 1 object to the left of center and seperated somewhat from the other five. They were much larger than a star or airplane lights.  The were round and glowing a steady white light.  They were heading very slowly from west to east, almost hovering in the sky and just barely moving.  They did not lose any altitude at all.  This eliminates them being flares or baloons like I heard the military said they may have been.  Plus they were flying in a well defined and steady geometrical formation. After about 15-minutes som!e of the objects simply starteddisappearing, almost light they turned their lights off.  After 10 to 30-minutes they all seemed to have disappeared from view.  It&apos;s not like they moved out of sight, butb they seemed to have simply &quot;blinked-off&quot;.  There is no way they could be airplanes, far too slow and almost stationary.  They could not be flares as they lost no altitude at all during the entire time.  Plus, I believe they were close enough to make out the object, rather than just a point of light.  They were all equal size round white objects, except the on to the left of center was seperated from th others and may have been a little larger than the other five to the right of center.  All six were flying in a quarter circle formation and curved in a perfect geometrical arch.There is no other explanation for this than UFO&apos;s.

We thought it might be shrimp boats(shrimpers fish usually in the middle of the night &amp; use irridescent green lights to attract the shrimp to the surface) but there were no boats on the surface of the water and the green area was far larger than shrimper lights. Plus, shrimpers as well as other fishermen do not usually fish off the coast of Pebble Beach,it is exclusive &amp; private. We kept driving, away from Spanish Bay, until we reached the Lodge. The green light was out of our sight as we entered the forest area. We were turnin! g to go home when I said, &quot;That light was just too weird, lets go see if it&apos;s still there.&quot; My mom was scared but we turned around and headed back towards Spanish Bay. About 22:18 the green light came back into view, underwater illumination that from a distance appeared to be a dome shaped structure laying on the floor of the ocean. We speculated that it was the lost city of Atlantis, it was really creepy, we were the only car on the road and we were both overwhelmed with a desire to turn around and head away from the scene. We continud a bit further, then we flipped a U-turn and began in the opposite direction again(I was  the passenger, with my side of the car facing the ocean at this point) Just as we accelerated to go, I looked out my window at the green dome, and this bright light beam shot out of the water and came directly to my window. I screamed and my mom hit the gas. We were going 81-85 miles per hour for about 10 seconds and the beam continued to shine in my window! , it&apos;s origin still the green dome under the water. I kept screaming and tried to climb into my mothers seat to escape the light, and suddenly the beam retreated back the way it came until it was back in the dome and disappeared. There was noise of some sort, like ringing at an almost inaudibly high pitch when the light was present, then it was gone when the beam retreated. We were both in shock, my mom drove home and I don&apos;t remember very much except talking to Pebble Beach Secirity with my parents later that night. I was severely disturbed by the incident, I couldn&apos;t sleep for about a week, and even then I slept in the same room as my parents. At the time of  this incident I was a senior in high school. I have since recovered, but I still have flashbacks. Needless to say I am now a firm believer in UFO&apos;s, as is my mother.", "Summary : Triangle shaped object with lights on each corner.

As I got parallel with it I noticed it was hovering about 300 ft. in the air.  It was triangle shaped with orange lights at each corner. Thought it was a plane so I continued on but then I thought about it and I realized that only Harriers hover I thought.  I thought it coulda been a stealth, but I don&apos;t think they hover either.

He gasped in disbelief when he (we) saw an approaching string of large white lights coming at us from the west heading to the east directly over the city of Jacksonville FL.  The row of lights (7 or 8) were evenly spaced and at the same hieght.  As they approached us they went straight up into the sky and while going up formed the shape of a large &quot;V&quot;.  The &quot;V&quot; continued to go straight up into the sky until it was almost completed out of sight when a flash of light from either the horizon or ground shot up at the formation in an waverly line followed by a second streak of light.  We all sat there dumbfounded by the sighting.  My cousin who is a pilot stated that the light formation was not that of any plane over the US. and the entire time the formation made no heard sound. We all three never really pushed the issue until I had seen film footage of the sighting over Phoenix this year and what was filmed was almost exactly what we had seen.  Now I believe.", "Summary : I sighted a rather large silver object,Oblong but not roundedit was visible for 5 sec.thengone in a blink.I was getting out of my car ina parking lot of a shoppingcenter.

I pulled up into the driveway. (This is a very rural area in Missouri.) I went to the door and knocked. My friend was not at home. I got ready to get back into the car and leave, when I noticed several  lights in the western sky. They were moving toward me at a slow but steady speed. I moved away from the car and into a field adjacent to my friends house. I could not make out what it was. There was no discernible silhouette, just several lights coming my way. The object then got directly over head and seem to take up the entire night sky. I then noticed that the lights (There were either three or five of them I don&apos;t really recall) seem to be attached to one large object. The lights seem to be facing towards the object instead of facing outward as you would expect. When I looked at the object I got the impression that this is what a blimp would look like if it had been flying at night with the lights turned towards the blimp. It seem to be just above my head, about two hundred feet or so.  I&apos;m just guessing. There was dead silence. I heard nothing that would explain its propulsion except the wind. Even though the object moved slowly I think it would have moved even slower if governed by the windalone. I  continued to watch the object until it disappeared in the eastern sky. This may have been a total of five to ten minutes. It never once slowed down or seem to veer from a straight course and seem to stay the same distance from the ground the entire time. I got into the car trying to sort out what I had seen, debating on if  I should tell anyone else. I went to eat a late dinner and then decided I would go and tell another friend of mine about the experience. I got to his house right at ten o&apos;clock. The local news was just coming on. Just before I had the chance to tell him about my experience. The first line of the news cast said  &quot; If you saw it, you weren&apos;t the only one.&quot; They continued to say reports had come in by the hundreds and that it had been seen in at least seven different states that night.  An investigation was under way. The next morning there was a small news segment about  scientiststhinking it may have been a gaseous cloud that had ignited in the upper atmosphere but it was still being investigated. On the day following the official report came back. It was a Russian Rocket that was reentering  the earths atmosphere. I have problems with all the above explanations.  For instance, Anything burning I believe would at least flicker. This was not consistent with what I had seen. The lights never blinked or seem to diminish in any way.  It maintained a slow but direct course and stayed the same distance from the ground the entire time. I have never seen a falling star or meteors do anything like that. If they had said it was a low flying blimp. I would have believed this before any of the other explanations, At least, before It had been reported seen in seven different states that night. But after hearing this. I began to wonder if there may have been more than one object roaming the skiesthat night.", "Summary : Extremely bright white cylinder looking object east to west direction saw from horizon to horizon through treesI was getting out of my hot tub, and had closed the cover at 0:300 hours on 07/03/97, looked up and saw extremely bright white cylinder traveling at a hight rate of speed. It was traveling in a very slight south east to north west direction..I own a compass. I first saw the object at the far southeast horizon through the trees. It was flying extremely low and seemed to pass over the subdivision I live in. I heard no noise what so ever. The best way to describe the size is if you hold a regluar size pencil at arms length, then it would be about that size looking at it from a distance. Called the local police to see if any strange thing had been reported. They said no. Called the airport control tower at Nashville, Tn (Brentwood is next to Nashville and I live about three miles from the Davidson (Nashville) county line.

My! house is in a very quiet neighbor hood. Planes can be seen on approach patterns from various view points from my house. Some far some fairly close. Hot air ballons and civilian and military helicopters sometimes pass over the neighbor hood.

Two people were witnesses This sighting was reported as very high and seeing only the bright white cylinder shape.The speed was reported as faster than an airplane at the same height.

The bottom part of the craft was bowl shaped with many lights like flood lamps.  They were evenly spaced and looked&apos; like there were hundreds of them.

My dad is currently military intelligence, and has, shall we say, some difficulty publicly confirming my recollection of this event.This is of course very troubling to me since he does acknowledge it in private (with me), so to share the story without his verification (since I was a kid at the time), makes me look like a liar, or at best possessing a false recollection of an ordinary event.", "Summary : At first I thought it was a firework.

Look like commercial aircraft but no movement.  Watch objects for a couple of minutes slight movement.  Decide to stop and look thru binochulars but objects disappear as car stops.My brother and I where driving to Las Vegas, NV for a family get together.  It was late afternoon around 3:00pm.  We were driving west on I-15 approx. 15 miles west of Mesquite, NV when I noticed what I thought was a commercial airliner off to the South and approx. 50-60 degrees up.  The sky was clear not a cloud anywhere.  The object was &quot;metallic&quot; or &quot;white/silver&quot;.  Like a jet when the sun is gleaming off it.  I continued to glance up at the object and I relized it was not moving and had no contrail.  I said to my brother jokingly there is a UFO up there.  He pushed back the sunroof so he could look.  As I remember it took him a little while to pick the object out.  Then another object though not as bright appeared. At one time I could see 3-4 at one time.  They would fade out then come back either were the where or close.  We remembered we had binochulars so my brother got them out.  The car was vibrating too much to tell what they where.  We decided to stop.  As we did ! come to a stop the objects disappeared.  We waited awhile since they had been coming and going out of view.  But, they never came back.  We proceded on our way did not see them again.  We thought they may have been jet fighters at a very high altitude so as to appear as no movement.  Or possibly military aircraft dropping flares.  The first object was the brightest and lasted the longest.  It was moving VERY slowly to the south as it faded away.  Did anyone else see these objects or simular objects in this area?  Since it has been 4 years ago my memory of it is&apos;nt as sharp as it was.  One strange thing I did&apos;nt think of at the time was there was very little traffic on the highway.

I do not think that this &apos;sighting&apos;, if that is what it can be called, will be of any use to you because it happened so long ago.  But I came across your website and thought, what the heck, why not record it here anyway.  It happened when I was a child (I have estimated Summer of &apos;79) and sleeping out on the beach in front of our summer beach house with a friend of the same age.  (This was in an era when it was considered safe to let children do that).  I was woken up by something, probably in the early hours of the morning when it was still dark.  I got up and stood on the beach and saw a round object with multiple, multi-colored flashing lights either on the water or hovering just slightly above it.  The object was approximately 20-40 ft. from the shore, and there was a sound associated with it; like a white noise, but at a low, soft pitch.  At the time I thought the object was a submarine.  Now that I know what submarines look like, and that they cannot come that clo!se to shore, I know that it definitely was not.  Also at the time I was certain that it was not a boat - having grown up around boats and spending every summer on that beach, I was familiar with the shapes and appearances of boats.  Well....that is all I remember!  Feel free to contact me with any questions.  I am not making this up; the object that I saw could have been a perfectly legitimate &apos;vehicle&apos; of some kind, or I could have a faulty memory.  Anyway, good luck with your research.  FYI:  I am 27, female, married w/ one small child.  I work part-time for a Seattle non-profit.  I&apos;m not particularly into UFO&apos;s or other unexplained phenomena, in fact I could be called a skeptic.

Heard it on the radio today (KMOX) and thought I would pass this along. I&apos;ll start by saying I am not a UFO fanatic, I don&apos;t believe in aliens or beings from other planets.

It was green, bullet shaped (like half a capsule.  A rounded edge, flat back.  No stream or tail). Streaked across the sky, and vanished about half way across.  It moved quite quickly, maybe I saw it for 2-3 seconds before it was gone. At first I thought it was some unusualy fireworks (but thinking it is very large).  Then it disappeared as a firework would, but with no explosion or fanfare.  Just gone. It was quite large, perhaps as large in sight as a full moon.

Yet.", "Summary : bright blue light going east to west went from horizon to horizon in less than 2 min at estimated alt of 35,000 feet indicating very great speed.", "Summary : six spherical objects with pulsating red and green lights, one constant white light at one o&apos;clock position unless object turns, then can&apos;t be seen.We will send an already composed description via E-Mail.  Do not wish to re-write description here, will send separately.", "Summary : During fireworks display I was looking at the sky and saw a blue/white disk-shaped object traveling east-to-west.I only saw the disk-shaped object for less than a second.  My view was limited by a patio umbrella.  When I got up from my chair for a better view the object could not be seen.", "[Diary of my Encounters This is the story I have known since 1979. In 1979 I was holiday ing at a place called Berowra waters on the South coast near Sussex Inlet with five friends&apos; one of whose father owned the caravan park where we stayed.This caravan park is on a cliff overlooking the pacific ocean and we would go to the beach everyday and spend most of the day their swimming, surfing and sunbaking.On this particular day I was standing on the shore with my friends father and mother who owned the caravan park when we looked towards the water facing south-east on a clear hot day( no clouds) and observed a black metallic mass that looked similar to an aircraft carrier on its side (approx length 1500ft long-200-400ft across) and slowly moving towards a cliff face which eventually hid most of the object but not before we discussed what it was and how something that big could stay airbo rne when it was apparently moving so slowly and not making a sound.The object was approx: less than three miles away travelling at two to five miles an hour and started to slowly move in a westerly direction over land, it seemed to take so long to move out of view that other people on the beach had by this time noticed what we were looking at and started to point in the air and their was approx ten to twenty people who saw the same thing up and down the beach.As owner of the caravan park numerous people asked them what it was and they responded that they didn&rsquo;t know, only that their was a Navy facility further down the coast, and Airforce Base at Nowra (ALBATROSS)The object (and it was a metal object)stayed in view for over half an hour from the time we first noticed it until it was lost behind the cliff face. We then proceed to climb the cliff to see if it could still be seen and their it was hovering for a considerable amount of time until a helicopter &amp; jet could be heard in the vicinity, and it slowly moved away, but not taking any notice of either helicopter or jet.In the meantime the southcoast radio station had been inundated with phone calls about strange bright white craft (and they did say craft, I was listening to the broadcast to see if anyone had reported what we had seen earlier) people described the objects, and up to ten were seen, as flying up and down the coast in pairs and one at a time, out to sea, and close to land, as being as bright as the sun, and reflecting the sun, and travelling very fast and occasionally turning back towards the way they had come. When I heard this I remember thinking that this was not what we had seen as the objects were to small, (the size of a houses I seem to remember) not the size of an aircraft carrier as we had seen a few hours earlier. The reports on the radio were the same day, only hours apart from our encounter.My impression was that this was a controlled event as this was winter holidays and the weather was so beautiful that thousands of people were at the beaches up and down the coast, the two people who were with me, and, owned the caravan park were well known in the area ,he was on the local council and had lived in the area all of there lives, and even had a street named after them, and were very honest and humble people who had never seen anything like it in their life, they were also aware of the military bases locally and had seen experimental aircraft before fly over the region, including Jets. I was seventeen at the time I am now thirty five and this was a very close sighting of a very immense object that moved extremely slow and showed no signs of external movement, but it had what appeared to be rivets or welding on the bottom on the side which faced us.At the time I really thought that this was not anything which had been manufactured in Australia and never once thought this was from outer space, now I&rsquo;m not so sure.Conclusion : Large black mass the size of an aircraft carrier: Moved slowly without sound: Stayed in view for a considerable amount of time: Was seen by numerous people: Weather was hot and cloudless: Other objects were also seen: Radio station reported strange craft seen up and down the coast: Object and smaller objects made of solid material: Reported to authorities: Was highly unusualThe Next time (also 1979)In the same year a few friends of mine decided to go to a lookout near Baulkham Hills  in the west of Sydney which was about to become a new suburb, the time was approximately 7.00 - 8.30 PM in summer, (daylight saving ) late November and was a clear night with no clouds, we had been their for a short time when I noticed three circular bright red lights moving south (coming from a northerly direction) in a controlled movement, they were approximately less than five miles away and at that distance appeared to be quite large, about the size of a average house and were moving in a orderly fashion and in no hurry, they were moving in a triangular motion, travelling about 3-10 miles an hour.They did no abrupt moves and stayed in the same formation for a long time (20-30min) before they seemed to reach a point near Prospect Reservoir, and one dived towards the ground at a tremendous speed, one left skyward at high speed, and the other one just seemed to dissolve into the night. We turned the radio on and 2WS, which is a local radio station reported that they had received phone calls from people asking what the lights could be.I asked one of my friends who was there, recently, did he remember that particular night and he described the exact things I have just explained, and he said that they seemed to be under some kind of control and maybe connected to each other as they did a peculiar pattern as they moved across the sky, but the same pattern right across the sky.Conclusion : Three Bright Red Lights with some kind of shape (circular): In a fixed formation (triangular): Seen by five people for a period of at least 20 min: Was reported on the radio by others, independent people: Disappeared  within seconds of each other: Cloudless viewing.Eleven Years Later (1990)I had just returned from Florida, in the States, earlier in the year and had recently lost my job and found myself with time on my hands so I decided to be involved in this new craze which was sweeping the globe 3D images.I managed to find a job in the city (Sydney, Australia) and was working selling 3D posters at Central Railway Station, literally. This was around Christmas 1990 and they were very popular, on this particular day which was a Monday I was just about to go to lunch when a rather tall gentleman of about 6ft 10in, tall, and with large features, long White hair and looking very much like an American Indian, remarked to me that his friend thought  that the brain was similar to a 3D image and the universal acceptance of these images had some kind of lost meaning which we were about to grasp again after a very long time.He then brought up the subject of his friend who had worked for NASA as a photographer and had a very high clearance in the military and had been asked to photograph the inside and outside of a Circular craft which had somehow come into the possession of NASA. He told me in no uncertain terms that his friend took photos of the objects door and as he moved inside and looked  back towards the outside that the door was now twenty to thirty feet higher and the inside was of immense size, yet from the outside the door and craft were rather small, he also me about the underground  nuclear test explosion which was apparently detonated to contain alien forces who had Killed up to 25 scientists and 44 military elite who had complained of human abductions, we had talked so long that I missed my lunch break, and I was working 12 hour days so what he had been telling me had taken nearly one hour, a friend of mine who had come into to see me stood their for the whole time and told me after!wards that what he had just said was really over the top but very interesting.The next day a Tuesday I was sitting in the top floor of a double decker train at 6.30 in the morning on my way to work, the train had just left Strathfield station when I noticed in the distance, a shape like a plane that seemed to be banking towards the train, I was looking for markings and wings as I thought it was a plane making a turn towards the airport when it suddenly approached parallel to the train and proceeded to pace the train.Most people who were on the train were asleep and I had an urge to wake them and say look out the window at this silvery disk shaped object which had by now slowed considerably and was now only one mile away and slowing down as we slowed down as we approached the next stop, the train had just slowed down for track maintenance when I noticed a tower between the object and the train, by the time we passed the tower which was about thirty feet across, the object had disappeared from view, as if someone had turned a switch and the object had just disappearedConclusion   : Strange encounter with person with Indian like appearance: Told me about something which I had heard years earlier underground: Observed a craft of no known origin the next day: Had seen it disappear before my eyes on a clear day: Was definitely metallic and polished silver - reflected the early morning sunlight: Had no markings whatsoever: No exhaust or smoke at all: Was seen for 10-15 minIn early (1993)Near the middle of April I was at a friends place in Blacktown ( 25 miles West of Sydney) we had just been outside and had seen a bright red object shining in a westerly direction at a very high altitude and not doing the normal flight you would expect from any aircraft, this lasted about five minutes before we lost it behind a tree, there were three of us, at about one hour after this I decided to go home, the time was about 10-11 PM.I lived about three miles away and on the way home had a Incredible encounter with multiple craft over Blacktown (where I live) it started when I reached the top of a hill on Locke St and was stopped at a set of traffic lights and noticed directly ahead less than a mile away a Huge Object, and smaller craft above the main one, the lights changed and I proceeded down the hill past the local hospital, and as I rounded the corner I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing, their above the road less than five -hundred feet away I saw two objects- One, the bigger of the two had lights of different shades and colours which moved around the base and middle in a fast movement so that the lights seemed to catch up with each other and I could see what seemed to be railings inside the craft, the lights which were luminous colours-Green-washed in purples and yellows with a touch of Blue. There seemed to be a bright light coming from inside the large object.The object above the larger one had to be large also but wasn&rsquo;t doing anything other than sitting above the other one, I slowed down at another set of lights and saw a elderly gentleman who was walking along the footpath and I was going to wind down my window and ask him to look up at the Objects but thought  he might have a heart attack so I didn&rsquo;t say anything, while I was waiting for the lights to change they started to slowly move away over the hospital and I thought to myself that I was going to chase them ( the objects) at that very second as if they had heard what I had thought they accelerated to a brisk pace and I turned around and started to chase them, as I drove up the hill and turned east down Bungarribee Rd I stopped my car which overlooked a disused quarry and got out I notice two more objects hovering above my head at no more than 200ft above me, I then looked East and about half a mile away noticed another two cigar shaped objects the same as the ones above my!head, I then looked to the south and saw another object similar to the one above the large object that I was chasing and saw the two craft I was chasing moving at a slow speed in a south-easterly direction, in the direction of Bankstown Airport about fifteen miles away.While I was watching them both move away the two above me were still there not moving at all, I was out of the car and could almost touch them, they made no sound and seemed to just hover without any wobbling or movement, I continued to watch all seven objects for the next hour or so until the first two disappeared in the vicinity of Sydney and seemed to be moving in a large arc around the panoramic view I had (that is moving from south to east to nth east before I lost sight of them) I then noticed that the two smaller cigar shaped objects to the east had come down a bit lower and were near a radio tower 2WS and soon they too had mysteriously vanished, the objects above my head had begun to move away slowly and I saw that they were staying close together and moved slowly towards the horizon until they too had disappeared.I decided to go home and ring up the airport where I had seen the original two craft head towards, when I arrived home I had to move my mothers car under the carport, but, when I tried to start the car it wouldn&rsquo;t start, I finally gave up and got out of the car and looked up at the sky and the first craft I had seen with the revolving lights was directly above our house and was moving very slowly south back towards the location that I had first seen it, It was the same craft except I now had a better look at the whole Object, It was Large about 200ft in diameter and when I looked up was moving quite slowly almost as if it was waiting for something to catch it up. It then moved out of site and I went inside and rang up the airport who rang me three days later and asked me what I had seen and told me to ring the Airforce base at Richmond which I did and the person I talked to said that they had heard nothing about what I had just described.I left a message for my mother that her car wouldn&rsquo;t start and she rang the NRMA which is road service in New South Wales and when he turned up the car wouldn&rsquo;t start straight away and he said that it was a flat battery even though it was a new battery and the car had been driven less than four hours earlier that night.Conclusion   : Seven Objects seen in the space of a few hundred feet from each other: Coloured Lights seen emitting from around the Largest Object: Objects seen to Hover from a close distance: Seemed to hear what I was thinking: Some kind of railing seen inside large object: Bright White Light seen emitting from inside: Travelled right around the Metropolitan area: Somehow drained the power from the battery of car: Seen directly over my house so object had to of flown in a 360 deg arc around Sydney and surrounding areas: I had chased the first two objects which had been hovering over road near the HospitalBedroom Visitors 1994I had just arrived home from a friends place and was lying on the bed looking at the ceiling and looking out the window at the stars when I felt a sharp pain like a pin being stuck in my toes, the first thing I thought was that a white tailed spider had bitten me as there was an increase in these type of spiders around the house at the time.I felt like I was frozen and wanted to yell out but didn&rsquo;t want to disturb my mother who was asleep in the other room, I was wide awake and had only just put my head on the pillow seconds earlier thinking about tomorrow and things I had to do, when I felt the presence in my room and sounds from the foot of my bed, I couldn&rsquo;t see anything, and I still couldn&rsquo;t move at all and it was then that I felt hands around my feet where the pin prick had been and I could only lift my head slightly and I saw five small figures looking at me at the foot of the bed (they had came out of my wardrobe) and I could see that the wall where the wardrobe was now different and looked like the inside of a giant hanger which went back into the wall a considerable distance.There were two small entities standing at the end of my bed and one had stuck me with a needle in the toe and one was holding my ankle and examining my ankle area, while this was happening I thought that I hope my mother in the next room doesn&rsquo;t wake up and disturbs these entities as they might panic and hurt her, or she might panic and something bad might happen to her, then what seemed like a few seconds I noticed three more figures coming out of the wardrobe and stand at the foot of the bed and proceeded to stick something in my leg, I started to feel able to move again, only slightly and lifted my head off the pillow and saw right into their faces and they looked back with curious looks on their faces but never stopped doing whatever they were doing but they knew I was looking straight at them and I was wide awake.They were not trying to intentionally hurt me and I felt no fear and I could remember everything that they were doing and I was aware of  being awake and this was not a dream, I tried to communicate with them, I couldn&rsquo;t talk, as no sounds came from my mouth, but I could hear my voice from deep down from within.They were quite solid, long arms but not abnormal, smallish heads not extremely large, more like small children feeling around, playing, around 3-4ft tall, dark greyish in appearance with lizard like scales, and the skin seemed the same colour throughout the body as far as I could see, and I could see just below their knees, they had a almost sad look about them and there was definitely some kind of rank as one or two ordered the others around, not with words or telepathy but they just seemed to obey without answering, and these other two stayed in the background moving around the room and observing, occasionally looking over to see what was happening.They still had hold of my ankle and reminded me of well trained doctors with nurses helping them, this was a real event, on one occasion one stepped back into the wardrobe to retrieve something and came back with it in its hand and I noticed that it had three large type fingers that seemed to be too large to do anything intricate yet here they were doing things to me with the skill of a surgeon, I felt no pain except for the initial discomfort of a pinprick in my toe, I heard no voices only muffled sounds and yet I could tell that this wasn&rsquo;t going to be a adverse experience.They wanted to look at my legs and feet and didn&rsquo;t come near my face or touch any part of me except my toes and ankles, although they had direct contact with my eyes. They seemed to me to be quite aware of my feelings and as they continued  they would look my way to see if I was in any discomfort and all looked when I thought of my mother, before they left I noticed they looked back at me as they went back into the wardrobe, one at a time, in a very orderly fashion, and the last thing before they vanished the wall came back to its original distance and the hanger like area which reminded me of inside a large ship gradually disappeared in a cloud like vapour.It was then that I felt the sensation of my foot and toe and I immediately jumped up and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and could see that I was wide awake and when I checked the time it was less than three minutes since I had arrived home, which was impossible as I had made something to eat when I first arrived home.It was then when I heard my mother talk that I realised it was all over and I have since sold the wardrobe and painted the room and had a inbuilt wardrobe installed.Later in the week I went to a friend who has a paranormal interest and he took out of my toe a small black object that wasas hard as a needle and was giving me quite a bit of pain.Conclusion : Five Entities in my bedroom: A small metal as hard as a needle was found in my toe: I was wide awake the whole time: There was eye contact and concern on their part: I saw a kind of entrance to another dimension: Some type of medical procedure had happened: Two entities in charge of procedures: Grey in appearance with skin that was like a mold: They knew what to do and had me paralysed from the neck down.: They also had a sad look- the kind of look when you say goodbye to someone you have feelings forEarly (1996)I had just came home and was going inside to  get my telescope to look at Jupiter and the Moon when I looked west and saw a fast moving object which I thought was a white aeroplane that looked like a wireframe, until I saw a smaller object either come out of the original object or came up alongside and seemed to refuel while all the time the other object was moving at a incredible speed. They stayed together for approximately 15 seconds which was a long time considering it travelled across the horizon and out of sight in that time.I rang Bankstown Airport and they told me to ring Richmond Airforce Base which I immediately did and was put through to the officer in charge of aircraft dispatches who told me that no planes would refuel over residential areas Ever and especially not at night. I know what I saw and that was a low, very high speed object with a smaller object that was seen to pace and be refuelled in mid air at about 11PM at night earlier this year 1996.Conclusion : High speed Object wireframe in appearance: Smaller Object seen to pace and be refuelled by larger object: In view for a short amount of time: Incredible speeds for both craft: Large Craft was white in appearance: Smaller Craft seemed to be see through.JUNE LONG WEEKEND (9/6/96)Sun: Time: 9.25-9.55This happened on Sun long weekend of June this year I had just dropped Lloyd who is a friend of mine at his place and he was taking his things inside when I noticed three orange/red/yellow lights pulsating and slowly moving high in the sky above Blacktown. They were in a large Triangular shape from three to five files apart, the top light of the triangle stayed in a constant spot as did the bottom left light, the light on the bottom right though moved away and pulsated in and out and disappeared on occasions and then reappeared slowly moving away from the other two until it completely disappeared from view. The other two started to slowly move away with the bottom left light going higher and the top light moving across and over the bottom light, moving east and moving very slowly, the other light moved away at the same speed going north-east and very slowly. We decided to ring a few friends who have cameras and videos and after a good half hour with the objects still in sight !I decided to go home as it was getting quite cold. We were looking through high powered binoculars and their appeared to be a solid object behind the light. As I drove home which is about two miles away I could see the remaining lights from the car quite clearly and thought that when I arrive home I would have a look through the telescope. When I arrived at my house both objects could still be seen very easily by the naked eye and through the telescope I could see that their was a light in the centre of the mass which was causing the brightness, I watched both for a considerable time until the light that was moving slowly to the north-east had stopped and had taken on the appearance of a star and was now acting as though it was stationary so I turned my attention to the other light which was now over the Windsor area travelling north-west but was still in sight for a considerable time before it was just a blur and by which time it was  icy cold, I turned the telescope again to!wards the first light and it was just sitting there stationary as a star would look, I then went to bed and when I went to work the next day I asked Lloyd if they took any pictures and he proceeded to tell me what happened later that night in front of at least seven people.After I left his friends turned up but the objects had been gone for a while before they turned up, so they went to another friends place just around the corner and this is three different accounts of what happened next starting with:", "Summary : While on vacation in Washington, DC, standing in front of the White House, my 8 yr old son captured something very strange on our video camera. The object appears in 7 frames of a standard 30 frame per second VHS tape. I am not experienced in these matters. I have had the tape digitally analyzed and the object appears to have a definite form and reflects sun light as if it were metallic. It was pure accident that we caught it on video and did not discover it until we were back home viewing the vacation tape.This is an interseting video. I would appreciate some assistance in presnting this to media. please call.", "Summary : saw news clip of what the USAF said were flares form a jet on a 5 pm newscast here in Bos. MA on 7/25.  My wife said there was clearly a round shape to what she thought the lights were afixed to within the amature video.  Did you see the broadcast?  It surely did not look like flares.  Just thought you may want to try to take a look at the film.  It was on our channel 5 here in Bos., MA. Thanks, ((name delete))   ((e-address deleted))", "Summary : Enormous object to star like size in a flashI was carrying my 3mo old daughter accompaniedby my wife and 5 or more strangers were nearbyDusk waschanging to dark, the area was well lit, welloccupied by people, and somewhat busy asMission Beach is at that time of year.What appeared to be an object on fire overheadsoon became an large,dark,round object thatseemed to loom above us in silence with whatappeared to be lights around its exterior.the object was either the size of a city blockand close to the ground 500-1000ft or it wasincredibly huge and much higher in elevation.I started to walk away because of fear formy infantdaughter but stopped to look back, when I didit instantly disapeared until my wife pointedit out to all of us as a tiny star like objectmoving quickly south (faster that a fighter jet)It then stopped abruptly and a object bestdescribed as; lite, no lite, lite, no liteflashed across the sky westerly in a straight- - - - - -line, then it resumed its fast flightdue south and faded out of sight.That evening there were reports of strangelites off shore facing west.The strangest co-incidence to this story isthat the San Diego Union reported the nextmorning that a main electrical sub-station ineither the Phillipines or the Marshall&apos;s hadbeen scorched and burnt and shut down - causeunknown, that previous evening.Further, a similiar sighting just two+ weekslater in a major Florida city came up with asimiliar result i.e; a scorched &amp; burntsub-station.I&apos;ve got an extensive radar and aircraftand missile background and not easilyled or fooled. This was strange and we&apos;vekept it to ourselves until now.Thanks to you and Art Bell, I&apos;m talking.", "Summary : blue light traveling due west ended in red flash appeared to be close overhead. I think it was space junk or meteor due to similar sightings over a broad area.Due to the fact that the object was on a precise east to west trajectory, in line with the earth&apos;s rotation, I would guess that it was probably space junk burning up in the atmosphere.", "Summary : I have video of strange light in SE sky over central NY 21:30 est 03/22/97", "Summary : I was coyote calling on top of a mountain at night, and the sky was dark with clouds. A red flickering light came down through the cloud cover, at first I thought it was a red beacon for a tower that was on the hill but then realize they were behind me and this was out over the Interstate 5 freeway. It moved around in a lazy manor the faded away... gone. Others on the freeway must have seen it also, there was alot of traffic at that time.The object was a red light that was flickering vary fast, it was on the bright side but not like a fire, but a light. It was not going on a set course, but wandering about the sky. The cloud cover was not to high, may be 1000 feet over my location on the hill. I heard no sound and after it faded away, I packed up and drove with my lights off until I reached the old ridge rout road. I was shacken alittle. May have been a military craft? I don&apos;t know.", "Summary : Two bright lights appeared over the neighbors house and seem to go back and forth, stand still and pulsated at the same time.  They looked like fireworks in the sky.My name is ((Name deleted)) and I saw a light rising from somewhere behind my neighbors house in the sky.  It did not act like an airplane but before I called my children to come and witness it I stepped out the door and watched it rise rapidly straight up into the air.  I called my four children out to watch with me. At first we only saw one and then another one appeared over another neighbors house--what really amazed us was how they seemed to be pulsating in a pattern together.  They actually looked like fireworks in the sky when they were doing this.  Everyone I saw who was walking down the street I pointed it out to them--(they thought we were nuts).  I was talking to my Office Manager at work about it off and on while she was at work.  We tried to call the news stations but nobody would listen we didn&apos;t have a video camera so we couldn&apos;t take pictures.  One of the objects stayed pretty low and started heading off behind some trees, we decided to follow after a minute to see if w! e could still see it.  It was in a holding pattern over a main street, it stayed there for at least 20 minutes then  it took off it made other planes in the sky look as if they were standing still. One of my children wrote about it in her journal right away but I held off until Sunday.  It was a wonderful and exciting sight.  I was really upset that nobody would listen to us in the news media and when the news came on later we heard it was &quot;space junk&quot;, Who are they trying to kid?", "Summary : I was laying on the sofa looking out the window at 2:00am with the Moon and Mars in the sky and all of the sudden I saw an orange-red ball whiz between the Moon and Mars. I am an amatuer astronomer and know for certain it was not a meteor or satelite and it was moving too fast to be a plane or other form of aircraft which I am familiar with.It darted across the entire sky from my viewpoint.  I am not saying it was a ufo but I cannot identify what it was.  I have been looking at the sky all my life and have never seen anything that looked like that.It was orange-red and round.  I cannot judge how far it was awaybut it was really fast. Whenever I get the chance to view the stars I am and have never seen anything like it with my naked-eye or through my telescopes.I have always believed in life other than on our own planet because we are just a grain of sand in the desert compared to the universe, so it would be concieted to say we are the only life in the universe.This is my first real sighting of something I can&apos;t explain.", "Summary : White, spherical object moving in a NW trajectory, silent, moving extremely fast.On March 10, 1997,went outside after lunch for a brief walk.Cloudless, clear day.  Looked up and noticed a single, very white, round objectmoving from east to northwest (this is a coastal area of VA).  At first thought itwas baloon, but quickly realized moving much too fast and straight.  No vapor,exhaustor noise whatsoever.  When first observed, appeared to be about the size of a shirtbutton held at arm&apos;s length.  Disappeared within 8-10 seconds.This area is close to Naval air stations; very familiar with various conventionalcraft.  Nothing like this seen before.  Was very round and bright white.I am a 46 year-old health care executive.

Small rotating object seemed to join large object which decended blow treetops, resembled a formation. a week prior during daylight another object witnessed by 2 people in two different places seen suspended in north sky, very bright, and quiet and floating, not like a plane.The small object with the rotating lights seemed to linger in a general area of the sky and spin around, soon after we saw it, a large object came from the northwest and the small object seemed to disappear, whether it joined the large objectwe don&apos;t know for sure. the large object was very brilliant in the shape of a cross with 4 bright lights accross the back and 3 bright lights up the center (a bottom view), we were traveling north and the large object rapidly disappeared below the treetops to ourSoutheast. The week before I and my daughter who was going home from work 10 miles away, saw a shiny cigar or flattened oval shape, very brilliant in the north sky in broad daylight. I watched it and so did she, it didn&apos;t seem to be going anywhere and didn&apos;t make any noise.It just sort of drifted in the sky,and appeared quite large.My daughter was in Baraboo heading northeast and I was standing outside my home just looking at it for at least 3 to 5 minutes.", "Summary : I&apos;m 15 years old and this happened about a year ago but I just found this place to submit it.

I woke up and found that my fiance was sitting at the table in our travel trailer. I called out to him and he told me to come here, quickly. When I got to where he was, I saw bright lights out by the road, coming towards the meadow.  They were approx. 1/4 mile away.  We watched as they hovered about 20&apos; above the road and moved back and forth across the road.  This is desert area and the nearest house is about 4 miles to the north. This object was coming from the north east direction, moving somewhat south west.  When it reached the bottom of the meadow, it turned, raised in the air slightly and headed due west straight across the desert.  It was very bright and moving quickly.  In a matter of minutes, it covered at least 10 miles and then just disappeared.  The object appeared to be very large in size -- maybe 30&apos; tall or more and about 20&apos; across.  It was almost triangle shaped, with lights along the bottom, on the sides and on the top.  Where the object was spotted, there is nothing but sagebrush and there is no chance that it was any type of vehicle known to us.  There is no road out that way, no people, no houses, etc.  After the object was gone, my finace confessed to me that he saw something similar to that the previous year when he was at this same ranch helping with the haying, but he didn&apos;t tell me because he was the only one to see it and didn&apos;t think I would believe him. straight across the desert.  I watched until it was about a mile out in the desert and I could still see it clearly, then, all of a sudden, it tilted upward slightly and was gone.", "Summary : Ball of fire moving up the Columbia River.

I ran in the house to tell others, they too came out to see fire ball. My friend was also with me. I called the radio station and they said that it was a weather ballon. (Yah right!) We didn&apos;t have a camera which I wished I did have one. All I have is memories of the fire ball that movied horizonally up the River and out of sight, never burning out.

It appeared from behind the large pine tree.  We were looking East, it moved from North to South.  It was sort of shaped like a slanted T.  It had little orange cicles along it.  It was very dark.  It was an outline, really, with circles on it.  It changed shape, which frightened us.  It glided very smoothly.  It was too low to be any kind of aircraft, too quite too.  It made a slight pulsing humming sound.  It eventually disappeared out of view.  We stayed outside.  A few minutes later another one flew by.  It was sort of H-shaped.  The circles blinked lighter and darker, and some blinked on and off.  It came from the same place and moved the same.  It gave a high-pitched beeping sound.  It followed the other&apos;s path and was out of view in a few minutes.

I live in a penthouse where I have a wonderful view of the Santa Monica Mountains, the ocean and the city.  On a clear night, as this was, I can see very far.  I often sit out side to relax and look at my surroundings.  It is not uncommon to regularly see helicopters and planes from my view, especially with LAX so near.  This particular evening I saw what I thought to be a helicopter and it  really caught my attention.  I noticed that this helicopter was silent and usually they make quite a bit of noise.  I was looking at the object that I believed to be a helicopter and there was a direct light that it was shining  on the mountains, like a spotlight,  and moving low towards the ocean.  It was in a two to three mile distance of me, which is common for most of the helicopters in the area.  The light that I was watch!ing closely, without suspicion, disappeared, leaving puffs of smoke.  This was a trail of smoke that I had never seen a plane or a helicopter leave before.  The smoke was thick as if the object that it was coming from had been idled there for a long peroid of time and it had not been.  A few seconds later the object took off with enormous speed, heading north to the sky.  this is when I realized that the object could not be a helicopter at all.  Within seconds it was &quot;parked&quot; next to a star, very far away..  It probably reached its location next to the star in under five seconds. It was a clear path that it took and  it was as if it was trying to camaflauge itself  next to that star.  Then I saw a flashing red light that was actually  revolving.  From the distance where I was I could see the object and  I could tell that it was revolving with a red light..  A few seconds later it took off so fast that I could see it going north for about two seconds but it was going so fast th!at it just disappeared.  That is when I realized that I had seen a UFO.  I immediately called a friend and left a detailed message on her voice mail, as to not leave out any details and record it while it was fresh in my mind.  The next day I had to go out of town and did not know of your service until now.  I feel very relieved to have reported this and hope that someone may have seen something also.I have lived in California for a little over a year.  I moved to California from South Carolina for a job.  I am twenty four years old and am fairly concervative in my beliefs.

I thought that i was observing this as a bright light low on the southwestern horizion, and made a comment about it to the driver of the vehicle i was in. i reached in to the back seat to retrive my 8mm video camera when i turnd around the sight was gone, this seemd strange since star light fades out, any way i kept looking in the same area when i saw movement next to the mountain on my left.  I could see somthing in the air above the side of the mountain only because the trees were reflected off the bottom of the craft.  as i begain to video tape and try to get it in focus which was difficult because the camera was new to me and i had it on auto focus, and had to take it off auto focus.while all this was going on it flew over us at what i estamete was a 1000ft then it stopped above and to the right rear of my field of vision and it flew back into the light of the morning sun and was once again lighted ! brightly, and i was able to focus and begin recording.you can see the saucer shape and see it travel very quickly away and over a hill.", "Summary : We have constant sightings up here and have video with sound recorded over the Portland area.

In the midst of these lights a small line of 6-8 bluish-white smaller lights suddenly appeared; the lights flashed in sequence from left to right 3 times, then suddenly moved very quickly off to the West and disappeared.  Approximately 30-45 seconds later, the bluish-white lights reappeared in approximately the same position as the first time and repeated the flashing and movement; then reappeared just to the west of te original location repeated this once more.  About 30 seconds after the last repeat, the orange lights simply disappeared.

After passing thru a trarric lite i noticed a glimmer off to the left hand side. I looked over thinking it was a jet or plane of some kind. The sky was clear with unlimited visibility. It didn&apos;t look like anything I had seen before. I pulled over to the shoulder of the road and watched it for a couple more minuts. It seemed to move slowly in a nothern direction and the suddenly vanished. I can&apos;t say what way it went. It just vanished.The sky that morning was 100% clear. At that time of day ther is not much traffic on the road. This part of northern N.J. is covered with more trees and less popopulated the areas closer to N.Y. It was a long silvery shape that didn,t seem to be moving at first. After I stoped i could see that it was moving very slow. And then it just vanised in the blink of an eye. It was easy to see thet it had no wings or a tial section like a plane would. I live next to a small airport and have a fair idea of planes.

That Saturday evening I was going outside to see if there were any remains of the Halle Bopp comet.While star gazing, I saw two objects.  They were round in shape and bright white with blue haze encircling them in color.  At first I only saw one, it was darting forward in an unimaginable rate of speed.After watching about 30 seconds the second object zoomed up behind the first and they were going the same speed for about 10 seconds.  Then the second object stopped still, while the first jetted around at different angles in front and behind the second.I then saw both objects start and stop several times.  Then the first one stopped then went straight up in an instant.  The second object then went forward until it disappeared.Im not sure what these two objects were, but I do know that there are no aircraft or weather ballons that I know of that could have moved at those angles and speeds.I dont want to sound like a kook, but I am curious if anyone else had witnessed this event.

A mass sighting of UFOs over Costa Rica, C.A. was reported on CNNs web site this morning.. you might want to check it out.I&apos;m sending the article: Unidentified Flying Objects Spotted Over Costa Rica. Itar-Tass 26-DEC-97 MEXICO CITY, December 26 (Itar-Tass) - The Costa Rican mass media reported on Thursday that unidentified flying objects were spotted the day before in the country&apos;s air space over Golfito district, which is 330 kilometres to the south of San Jose. However, TV cameramen were unable to film them as they did on Monday. On December 22 cameramen from two local television channels filmed at least a dozen &quot;flying saucers&quot; in the sky south of the Costa Rican capital. Before the eyes of hundreds of people, they made zigzag maneuvers for several minutes. Flight controllers of the International Juan Santamaria Airport counted &quot;approximately fifty thousand traces&quot; of their movements. Some car drivers stopped to watch the phenomenon. According to Ufologist Carlos Vilchez, most remarkable is the fact that these UFOs appeared in daytime, that they were seen by hundreds of people and were filmed by TV cameramen. He also expressed the view that an influx of UFOs into the air space of this Central American country could be expected within the next two months. About ten &quot;saucers&quot; were watched by hundreds of people over San Jose exactly one month ago. They flew over the city for several minutes. They were also filmed by TV cameramen. Scientists have not found any explanations for this phenomenon.", "Summary : My wife alerted me to a strange light in the sky. &quot;A ufo&quot; I was indoors - I replied &quot; Oh yea...hmm&quot;She insisted I com and take a look.Looking north, north west slightly, a very bright objectmoved in a somewhat eratic manner.

Slowly moving north and slightly west.I drove to a location with less light obstruction - within 5 min it had moved rather far away. Traveling north and slightly west. My guess in the direction of Ashfork or even Kingman. There was a 2nd object traveling in the same direction as well.When we first spotted it it seemed to nr VERY close to us.The eratic motion, change in intensity, ruled out an aircraft.Last spotted around 23:15 hours headed north north west as I said.Shape: oval in nature.Color: white changing to orange then staying orange.As it traveled toward the north looked like smaller sattelite objects assosiated with it at times.

Was moving slowly down and had no trail like a meteorite. Object was about three times as bright as large as the planet Venus.", "Summary : I sighted in daylight between 1 and 8 small, bright, round objects high in the sky over a period of 7 hours that flew from north to east in usually in three&apos;s in various patterns(triangular, stacked, linear).I first spotted these bright, white round or oblong objects (they resembled a bright star)at 9:30 am on Sunday August, 17, 1997  in the morning. I noticed one such oject  flying from west to east  above and behind a blimp which was traveling slowly in the opposite direction. I viewed this through a a glass door overlooking downtown Philadelphia, PA from my fifth floor apartment building. The sky was clear blue. I opened the door onto an outside porch to view the flying bright object unobstructed. There were two other objects on the right flying east. They were not flying terribly fast, but they appeared to be flying in a triangular formation. I sighted such objects from 9:30 am until 4 pm. They would continue for the most part to appear from the north and fly east. There would be anywhere from one object to eight objects in the sky at once, moving in and out of various flight patterns (triangular, stacked, linear). They usually flew in three&apos;s in a triangular formation. Somethimes two would fly very close together, and then move apart. Sometimes two would fly as a double on top of one another or next to one another. At 1:30 pm I saw as many an eight objects in the sky at once. I was walking to the market a few blocks from my apartment building. When I reached the store I could see above the store  moving from north to east approx. seven or eight bright round objects. They resembled a bright star, like venus. There was, however, at this time one object that appreared brighter than the rest and its upper portion flashed or blinked. Next to it appeared an object that was smaller and appeared a dull red. That object moved east and disappeared. Three of the other objects moved north and four others moved east. By the time I returned home, I could see two objects stacked on top of one another flying east. These objects were small. It is hard to guess at what altitude they were flying. I would say at least 30,000 feet. Objects would appear out of the north and fly east until about 4:00 pm. At least one or two was always present in the sky. Then they tapered off and by 4-4:30 pm, there were no objects sighted.  My roommate saw the objects as well and was baffled. It was very strange since it lasted such a long period of time. I called one of the local news stations around 2 pm, but nothing was reported on the evening news. The objects were not very large, the size of a star, like venus. They were very bright, white in color. They moved with a strange fluidity. That is what caught my attention initially. They would move together and apart quite rapidly and in and out of various formations.There is an airport that is nearby and many planes could be seen while the objects were visible. But the objects and a plane cou! ld not be confused because of the objects movement. They moved with an agility that I have never seen a plan demonstrate. I am a native of the Philadelphia area for the past 30 years and am very used to seeing planes. These objects were different. They were not random lights because they seemed to moved in very purposeful, logical  formations and repeated these patterns often. Their speed was much  faster than your average commercial plane, but they did not streak across the sky or anything like that.  Sometimes the formations(triangles, lines, stacked) spanned many miles, sometimes they were closed in. Usually they would expand and contract the formation or move out of the formation into another one. There is an Air Force Base in New Jersey, McGuire Air Force Base, perhaps 50 miles away. But these objects did not resemble any miliary aircraft that I every saw.", "Summary : My girlfriend and I report seeing 7 lights in a boomerang shape object going east flying very slowly.

We were at a mall about to go underground to the theatre.When we saw a bunch of lights flickering like a strobelight&apos; with colors of green,blue,red,white,and yellow.We got as close as we can to the object,which was about 200 yards.I got out of the car because I could not figure out what this object was. I could not see a shape just a form of a boomerang that was 50 yards or more wide.It lasted about 15 seconds then trees and buildings blocked our view.There is no way we were the only people to see these lights,they were to bright and the object was to big.The mall we were at was Windsor park mall in the city of SanAntonio next to a smaller city called Windcrest but still Bexar county.It flew over a major street called Walzem Rd.,That&apos;s how I know we were not the only observers.My girlfriend and I only saw it for about 15 seconds but it was going slowly to the east and we were facing northeast. The sun was !just going down behind us, so we were facing the night sky. That&apos;s why we could not see a structure I guest, unless it was 7 different objects flying in a perfect formation with no sounds of engines. I THINK NOT!

From my perspective, it was consistent with the theory of space junk burning on re-entry.  I say this because about 100 initial lights gradualy faded out until only the few brightest remained, and they too faded. Some other observations: * I saw point-lights only, without 2 dimensional shape * Multiple colors, blues, reds, golds, and whites * Two major clusters, the larger one above the smaller * Parallel, straight line path, of all lights, no relative lateral motion between the lights, but some traveled faster than others. My advice to folks who want to label this an object of extraterrestrial origin:  Better make sure your theory holds that the object burned up.", "Summary : Well what happened was when I was about 5,  I was coming back from a trip from my grandparents. I was looking out the windown and it was very dark. I suddenly saw a object it had lights with a circular pattern It had multiple colored lights mostly Red White &amp; Blue. When I returned home I went over to the tv and turned it on. There was a news report of about 5 sightings of a ufo flashing red white and blue lights.

Westnedge a bright red flash illuminated the whole sky, the ground, everything in the truck, it was like a flash of bright lightning.  The flash was so bright it lit everything as bright as day in red. It originated from the forest to our right, my view of the actual object was blocked by the truck but my friend said he saw something like a beam of light shoot from the ground into the low clouds as it traveled up it seemed to split up into different parts and travel through the clouds.  There were some low clouds around the area that were kind of thick but the whole sky was not covered, there were many parts of the sky that were clear, no thunderstorms or anything.

Headed by slightly larger singular spherical lights which lead each group, these were seen by a waitress, four in the party, and the Taxis driver on his arival. When we arived at our destination, some 15 mins away, the lights were still visable in the sky, we do not know if they were the same lights. They were traverling in an east to west direction and we watch them pass overhead until they disappeared from our veiw at approx. 1-25am.As of above.We reported the event to the magazine &quot; U.F.O Reality &quot;.", "Summary : Obj. travelling n/nw at satelite altitude. intermittent (irregular) brilliant white bursts, faded to pale yellow.  2nd obj  w/same m/o as 1st. .  Binocs &amp; t-scope.While stargazing my friend Ron and I observed a brilliant white flash to the south of us.  This was two or three minutes after having sighted a satellite passing from south to north. After an interval of perhaps 15-20 seconds we both observed a second flash and were able to make out object with naked eye.  Appeared very similar to satellite that had just passed.

At first, the object was headed due north, then, at about 80 degrees (almost directly overhead) it veered about ten degrees west, then continued in a straight line n/nw.  During its traverse trained his telescope on object.  He has done this many time with aircraft and can make out the navigation lights of such.  This had no visible navigation lights.  The glow, or i!ntensity of light at dim stage, and the comparison to satellites we have observed would put this object at satellite height. No tail observed.  Both of us have seen many aircraft at night and are familiar with what a strobe looks like at great altitude.  This was far more intense and the intermittent nature was not like A/C strobes.  It appeared to accelerate at burst and slow down with dimming? Weird. As the object was about 10 degrees or less from dropping out of our view in the N/NW, a second object appeared to the west of the first at approximately the same distance and displayed the same white burst behavior.  Alternated bursts with first object.", "Summary : Observed a number (3 - 5) of white/yellow lights hovering (suspended) approximately 7 - 10 miles away.  Observed streaking object leaving one orb and traveling at a high rate of speed in a horizontal manner and leaving a &quot;tail&quot; or &quot;trail&quot; behind (much like a meteor, but in a straight path).  The lights extinguished quickly with no fading of &quot;fizzling-out&quot;.I have been observing these &quot;lights&quot; since approximately August/September, 1996.  I live approximately 4 miles north of Buckeye and in an area that is in a diaganol line approximately 15 - 20 miles south/southwest from Luke Air Force Base.  The first night we observed the lights back in the fall, they appeared due South of my home.  There were three large orbs and were yellow/white in color.  I called to my roomate to come and see and she observed them at that time.  We concluded they were flares of some sort.  However, they disappeared very quickly, as if a switch had been turned off.  A few moments later, they appeared, all at once, in a location several miles to the west of the original sighting.  We were not at all convinced that these lights were unexplainable, and we were mildly curious.The second sighting was perhaps a week later, with the same type of behavior.  This time, however, I retrieved my binoculars and both my roomate and myself wathced the lights for several minutes.  It appeared that there was heat emanating from the orb...we thought it might be smoke, but it appeared more to be like radiant heat.  We assumed that if it was a flare of some time, it would gradually burn out, but once again it exstinguised itself very rapidly and we did not observe it again that night.In visiting with my new neighbors, I asked whether they had seen these lights and they had not.  However, a week or so later, once again they appeared (in the same location), and I called them and had them come outside to observe with myself and my roomate.  They confirmed the sighting, and also thought that perhaps it was some type of flare.  The also observed the heat radiating from the orbs.  They disappeared as before.I am not a very good judge of distance or size, but if I were to estimate the size of these object in relation to the night sky, I would say they appeared to be the size of 1/2 dollar piece.  They have appeared in numbers of 3, 4 and in a configuration of 3 with 2 to west side.I remember two other occasions in which I observed these lights and began to feel that it was some sort of Air Force exercise or some other explainable phenomena.The night of March 13, 1997, I was driving from Phoenix, west on I-10.  I had left town at approximately 7:45 p.m., and am guessing it was around 7:20 to 7:25 that I began to notice the lights.  I remember thinking that the lights were in a different position that I had observed them before.  They were more closely situated near the Estrella Mtns (west side) and seemed to be moving.  Before, I had only observed them being stationery.  It did not really dawn on me that they were moving until I turned South off of the interstate and began traveling south.  I realized that the lights had moved to the location I was used to seeing them...approximately 20 miles west of the Estrella Mts.By the time I was within one mile of my home, I began to sense that these lights were moving much more erratically than I had previously observed.  They had moved even further west (it was approximately 7:25 - 7:30 by this time) and suddenly I saw the streaking object seemingly coming from one of the larger orbs (there were 3 at this time) and move VERY rapidly horizontally across the sky (to the northwest I believe).  It seemed there was a tail of sparks or matter coming from this smaller object and I can only compare it to a meteor, although I am certain it was NOT a meteor (it moved in a straight line and then went out very quickly some distance from the orb). I ran into the houseand summoned my roomate, but by the time we went outside, all signs of the objects were gone.I began asking people at work back in Aug/Sept if they had seen any of these lights.  I suppose they thought I was a bit touched, but now that this major sighting has occured, they are remembering the days I came in with details of what I had seen the night before.  I wish I would have known how to contact someone back then.I am a Data Processing Assistant (15 years) with a large school district in Phoenix.

They were flying in a straight, direct path heading northerly.  Bright white lights, long tails of light that appeared to dissipate and then return; almost as if there were streaks of smoke or haze along with the lights.  Seemed to be three or four large ones and several small ones all flying in the same pattern.  Didn&apos;t appear to be a meteor shower as the flight path was not headed in a downward gravitational manner.  Shape was difficult to distinguish.

No surrounding light.  I Awoke out of a sound sleep, went to the window and was looking out when I observed a round, large object with visible bluish-green lights around the bottom of the object.  It was charging back and forth and up and down at a very fast speed.  At that time I woke my husband to view this, and we then both witnessed a second, idenically shaped object approaching the first one.  Together they would go up and down and after a minute or so they both took off at a very high speed.  I called the local police station and asked if they had received and reports on strange events in the shy, and the officer stammered and him- hawed around and finally said &quot;no Ma&apos;M&quot;  I could tell he was obviously not telling the truth.  Also the friends we were staying with had had a more spectacular experience about 10 months prior to this one.  They had a greenhouse, and one night as they were potting plants a large round object hovered over them, above the greenhouse.  At that time they became immobilized.  After a couple of minutes, this object soundlessly lifted off and flew away.  At this point our friends were once again able to move.  Out friends at this time were mature, 50+ people.  They were honest and never would have made anything like this up.  The wife had told me the story, only after making me promise never to let her husband know she had told me.  He rightfully thought that at time, people would think he was crazy.  They have both now passed on so I feel free to relate their experience.", "Summary : Young couple witness large glowing craft streak across the night sky, as if it were &quot;exiting&quot; the Earth. Craft was followed by a trail of pearlescent light, objected started in NE hor.streaked to about 1/2 way across hor. Then apparently flew straight out of the earth! Without a trace.  It took a total of three quick &quot;oh my gods!&quot; and it was over. Definitely not a comet!On October 15, 1995 my boyfriend and myself were on our way to meet some of our friends. It was roughly around 10:00-10:15p.m. We realized that we were a bit early to meet them so we decided to just drive around for a while.  The radio in the car was on but very quietly.  We drove around for about 10 minutes or so and then decided to start heading to meet our friends.  We were traveling north on Senexet Road in Woodstock, CT.  I was the passenger, my boyfriend was the driver. My eyes were suddenly drawn to a small glowing light, seemingly the size of a street lamp, but much brighter.  Almost as quickly as I noticed it, it started heading in a southern direction (towards us). It&apos;s speed was phenomenal, never in all my years (26 to be exact) have I ever seen anything in the sky (day or night) travel at such an incredible speed. The closest that this ball of light came to our location was within about 1/2 mile.  Upon reaching that point the object appeared much larger than I had originally thought, it was then that I realized that this was not a plane, helicopter, meteor or comet.  All of which I have witnessed before in the night sky.  If one were to get close enough to be able to measure the size of the object my guess would be that they find it to be probably close to a 1/4 of a mile long and about half as wide.  Once it reached the closest point that it had come to us,it came to an abrupt stop. Then, in less than a second, it turned, as if effortlessly, 90 degrees toward the west and continued at the previous rate of speed until about half way across the horizon.  It then again stopped abruptly and turned another 90 degrees, this time to the north and as quiclky as if it had never stopped it took off, again this time it appeared as if it left the earth completely!  Once the object made its first turn towards the west we noticed that it had an incredibly long, pearlescent colored trail of light traveling behind it.  This was perhaps the most striking thing that I remember about the object.  It was the most beautiful yet strangest light we have ever witnessed. The trail of light, judging by the distance and size from our location appeared to be atleast 15 to 20 miles long!  And as bright as the daylight!  We didn&apos;t tell that many people what we had seen for obvious reasons.  When I finally contacted a U.F.O. investigative firm, They said there was a bright meteor in that area around that time of the month.  I told the guy he was nuts, that I know a meteor when I see one.  I said to him,&quot;besides, meteors fall down, not up! And they don&apos;t travel at speed in excess of thousands of miles per hour!&quot;  He asked how I knew how fast it was going? I told him that in order for that object to travel from one end of the horizon to the middle of the horizon and then out of the atmosphere in less than 3 &quot;oh, my gods!&quot; it had to be traveling faster than anything humans have thus far invented. For a plane to travel the distance that this object traveled in less than 5 seconds, it would take about 20 to 25 minutes!  When the object made its first turn and we saw the trail of light for the first time, I had the most incredible tingling sensation come over my body and my eyes started to water and my muscles all felt tense, my boyfriend experienced similar sensations. We are both in our mid-twenties have two children, good jobs and absolutely no reason to make anything like this up.  Feel free to post this event, I am no longer worried that people will think I&apos;m crazy.  After all, maybe I am crazy, but I&apos;m definitely not STUPID!  I know what I saw was without a doubt a U.F.O.", "Summary : Saw an orange, round object in the northern sky under clear conditions. Object was flickering in brightness and was moving very slowly through the air. It appeared something was falling from the bottom of the craft towards the earth.the UFO was witnessed by three other people and myself. We were standing in front of my friends place of employment when one of my friends looked up and said &quot;what the hell is that?&quot; The three of us looked up and saw what appeared to be an orange ball slowly moving across the sky. At this time, a customer came up and saw what we were looking at and said the same thing. &quot;what the hell is that.&quot; My first impression was that it was a plane that caught on fire. But by observing it more. It appeared to be moving too slowly to be an airplane. Right about this time, we all observed what appeared to be projectiles coming out from underneath the ball traveling down toward the earth. The object then started to dim in brightness and get brighter again. It did this several times. I then assumed it might be a flare but it was traveling in a straight line. the object stayed visible for about 2 or 3 minutes before it slowly faded from sight.

I figured he was lying. He became deathly serious, and told me that if I did not look, I would regret it forever. His tone scared me, so I looked.Up in the 3 am sky was a smoothly moving object. It was the size of my right thumbnail on my outstretched hand.The object was perfectly silent, a rounded, smoothly contoured equal edged triangle. It appeared to have either a dome shaped hollow or protrusion in the middle bottom. There were no lights, seams, markings, or details whatsoever.It appeared as though cast of one solid piece of material. It was the grey of stone, and was visible by virtue of the reflected glow of city streetlights upon it. It moved in a perfectly straight line, with no &apos;point&apos; of the triangle facing the direction of travel exactly. Near the zenith of our view, it suddenly altered direction without curving or slowing down.One second it was going one way, the next instant it was moving about 35 degrees or so another way. It contined on this slow, smoothand straight new path, until it was lost to sight behind trucks parked near us. I saw the object go past telephon and power lines, it was above and behind them.My friend and I decided not to speak about it, but instead to immediately go inside the house, and seperately draw and describe the event on paper, then exchange the papers.We though this would let us know that what we saw was &apos;real&apos;. Our reports to each other, when finished, were identical, except for one difference.I had thought the dome on the bottom was a &apos;hollow&apos;, not unlike the &apos;dimple&apos; in red blood cells, while he thought the dome protruded outwards from the rounded shape. I ascribe this to the difficulty of percieving an unfamiliar contoured shape in reflected light from distance.The event lasted approximately 4 minutes in total, from the time I started looking, to the time the object glided silently beyond our vision.During the event I measured the object with my thumb, and closed my eyes briefely to see if it would still be there when I opened them, it was.The sky was perfectly clear, and the stars shone brightly. Our shared yard was surrounded on all sides by large trucks, houses, a fence, and trees, making for a perfect viewing environment,with no directly visible light sources to spoil our view. I was 13 years old at the time, my friend was 14.I have never forgotten this sight. It was utterly unique. I have no feeling or impression whatsoever about what the object actually was. It could have been anything from ship to lifeform to paradimentionalprotrusion to shared, perfect hallucination. Any of these explanations are equally fantastic. It simply...was. Featureless, solid, grey, and oblivious tothe way objects are supposed to move.I have not seen anything else, since. I have certainly seen nothing else like it.It taught me a few things: one, that during a genuine sighting it is utterly impossible to hope to realistically describe thesize of a UFO, as there is no yardstick by which to measure it, save one&apos;s own arm, or a nearby object. Against the starry sky,such a thing could have been any size (within reason) and almost any distance away. There is litterally no way to tell.Therefore I discount the tales of folks who claim to know the distance and size of an utterly unfamiliar object.Lastly, I feel a little cheated. In the years that followed this event, I have heard many tales of UFO sightings, all with fancy lights,weird sounds, strange feelings, and so forth. My sighting was not so spectacular, just a blank, seamless impossibility,moving silently. It did at least move in an impossible manner, which is at least something!I cannot remember my friends name after all these years, alas. I hope that this report may cause him to contact me,so that I can reminisce about this event.", "I live on Burnaby Mountain and noticed a large, well lit flying wedged shaped object flying very low over my house without any noise. It was flying at a fast and consistant pace, heading towards the North East. It startled me as I caught a glimpse of it from my bedroom window, as it&apos;s unsual to have jets fly that low over my house and usually there is the accompanying sound. There were many lights outlining the wedge shape. They seemed to be about the same brightness although some appeared to be reddish while others blue. It is hard to describe something that is so unusual, as I don&apos;t have any frame of reference for it. It definitely appeared to be travelling similar to aircraft, as it travelled in a consistent and fluid manner towards the northeast and out of sight within a minute or so. I was listening to the radio at the time and heard the announcement that some space debris had been reported flying over the lower mainland. While listening to the Art Bell show on Sat. Nov! 22, it was requested that anyone who had a close view of the object send in a report. I hope that this report will be helpful. I am curious as to why the media reports stated that the debris fell into the pacific ocean, as the object was heading away from the ocean?", "Summary : Witnessed a Barbell like object that rotated irratically, changed directions several times, and finally dissapeared.I just found this web page, and when I saw the report logs, I excitedly went to June 1995. There is a report of an object seen on the 7th in another state that is remarkably similar to what I observed on June  1995. The other witnesses, who were my co-workers did not report this event, as we did not know how to go about doing so. The following is an account of what we saw. The details are not hazy in my memory, as they are burned into my mind- they could never be forgotten.I work at a Bungee jump tower in Golden CO. I am the supervisor of five employees that run the jump tower each day. At 6pm, one of my employees remarked how the clouds in the sky, when observed from the ground with the backdrop of the tower, made the tower appear to move.(the wind was blowing the clouds) I looked up, along with another employee, and noticed that this was true. Gazing at the sky behind the tower, something caught my eye. At first I thought it was an airplane, as it appeared to be at the same altitude as a plane taking off from DIA would. But then it abruptly changed directions. I pointed this out to the other employees. We then observed the object for about ten or fifteen minutes. The object was reflecting the sunlight, and therefore was flashing in the daytime sun. After five minutes or so, it appeared that the object was getting closer. We could then tell that the object appeared to be a metallic shaft with two round ends, like a barbell. The flashing was cau!sed by the object rotating irratically, and wobbling back and forth. I suggested that it was simply two mylar balloons caught in the wind, but then we noticed the same clouds previously mentioned, and the object was moving opposite these wind blown clouds, ruling out the balloon idea. Then, after approximately seven minutes of observation the object changed directions and headed back the opposite direction. The object did not seem to be getting closer at this point, but we then noticed a faint greyish foggy halo surrounding the object. At this point two customers came to the jump, and inquired as to what we were gaping at. They observed the object as well. After a maximum of fifteen tense minutes of observing this anomoly, the object changed course abruptly, went behind a small, thin, transparent cloud, and dissapeared. I would appreciate any information regarding this sitghting, i.e. whether the similar sighting in your log is of similar circumstances. Since 1995 I have been w!rithing to get this reported, and am very grateful for this service.", "Summary : Man walking dog sees tire-shaped object w/windows. No sound, no animal reaction.1997 040X 1400 D Fairhope, AL, US FINAL REPORT The following was obtained by telephone interview with the witness on April 21, 1997. The sighting took place on or about April 5, 1997 in Fairhope, Alabama (Baldwin County) at 2:00 pm (central time). The witness reported this sighting to the Fairhope Courier and to Clompton Jones of MUFON. The details reported to those sources varies from those reported to this writer. This investigator cannot account for those variances. The witness stated he was walking his dog on the streets of Fairhope on a Saturday afternoon, although the witness, when pressed, could not remember the exact date. He believes April 5 to be the approximate date. The witness reported the weather as &quot;sunny and clear,&quot; with a breeze. The witness stated he was walking west toward Mobile Bay. As he was about to cross the street, the witness observed the object west of his position (in front of the witness), at an elevation of approximately 30 . The object was reported to be &quot;the length of the Fairhope pier&quot; from the witness, and was drifting very slowly to the north. After viewing the object for 30 seconds to one minute, the object continued to move north and disappeared behind foliage. No sound was reported. There was no reaction from his dog. The object was described as &quot;generally tire-shaped,&quot; round, light greyish-beige in color, with a row of 8 to 10 square black windows with a blue frame around them. The apparent size of the object was reported to be the same as an object one inch long held at arm&apos;s length. No other external details, appendages, etc. were reported. This case was initially investigated by Ross VonVolkenburg (MUFON). Duncan Crow obtained a telephone interview with the witness and submitted this report.", "Summary : Large, black, diamond-kite shaped objectI was looking up to view the comet from my driveway when I saw an object approaching from the Northern horizon.  Its speed was at least 500 Knots and it seemed to be accelerating as it passed directly overhead. It was  at about 2500 feet AGL and climbing. Its heading was 170 degrees.  It appeared to be at least 400 feet wide and 700 feet long. Its size and speed were difficult to judge because it was totally silent and it traveled from the Northern to Southern horizon so quickly. It had a faint purple glow along its leading and trailing edges, and had a series of luminous red-pink box like sections along the belly at the front. I&apos;ve been trying to convince myself for the past five months that it was some top secret aerospace plane prototype.  I have never seen anything like it, and I am fairly familiar with aircraft.

She noticed some lights in the sky, which she said were in the shape of a kite.  When she told me to look, I  saw what looked to be a large triangle in the western sky.  As the lights moved toward us and toward Houston, I realized there were around 10 to 13 individual amber colored lights flying in a perfect &quot;V&quot; formation.  They were going extremely fast, and seemed to be at a very high altitude.   They passed to the south of us, and as they neared Houston,  started shifting positions.  Once over the downtown area, we started losing sight because of the lights of the city, but the lights appeared to stop.  As soon as this happened, we bolted for the video camera. On our return, we could no longer see them.  The  time from sighting in the west until they were over downtown was around 30 seconds or so.  I did some rough estimates of speed based on where I thought the!y were at first (Sealy??).

Noticed 2 &quot;stars&quot; that were moving together at the same speed.  They traveled for about 3 seconds and then they both dimmed away.Upon looking into the sky in a S-SW direction I first noticed 2 objects that looked like stars or satellites moving together at the same speed.  They were high up in the sky at about the 10-11 o&apos; clock position.  They were moving about the same speed a satellite would appear to be moving.  They were bright white and moved in a downward westerly direction and then somewhat rapidly dimmed out completely.  Then I noticed a brighter star about a full moons distance away from the last position of the other two.  This was was much brighter and slowly moved in a downward westerly direction and it also slowly dimmed out and dissappeared.  I made a few calls to 911 and the FAA and no one had hear anything about this sighting.  I then called the King 5 TV news tip line and talked to a lady who said that they were just starting to recieve calls about some weird lights in the sky. She contacted me later in the evening -9:30pm- and told me that qiute a few people called in to report this.

The first and last lights were colored red, others were white.  No vertical stabilizer or wings.The object was moving south to north at about 200&apos; AGL.  It was a long (B-52 length) tubular shaped gray object with 6 or 7 oval shaped lights about 3 times the size of a commercial plane window.  The first and last lights were red in color, the others (middle) were white.  There was no vertical stabilizer (tailfin) and no visible wings.  The sighting was planform (from the side) so it is possible there may have been wings of some kind washed out in the bloom from the lights.  It was low to the ground at about 3/4 - 1 mile moving with no visible propulsion (exhaust) and made no noise.  We noticed it as it was abeam (closest point of movement) us and watched it as it moved North over a ridge.  It was moving relatively slow (about 80 - 100 kts reflecting back with my current experience) and was in view for about 3 minutes.  The aspect of it never changed; meaning the lights were visible pointing at us.The sighting took place near a remote cow-camp near the Idaho, Oregon, Nevada border back in Aug of 1976.  It was about 4:30 pm, 3 hrs before sunset with a high (about 25000 agl) scattered layer of clouds.  The observers were myself and my brother, age 7 &amp; 5 respectively, my father, age 50 at the time, and two Piahute Indians, one about 35yrs old and the other was 8.  The sighting was in the vicinity of IR-300 (Instrument Route) which is frequented by AF B-52&apos;s which is what we thought it was at first.  My father was a high school counselor with a masters degree and the older indian was a high school english teacher with a BA.  With the recent uprise of UFO ism in America, my father prompted me to submit this and helped me fill in the gaps of my young memory, which is still quite vivid.  I myself am now a carrier pilot in the Navy and have exhausted any skepticism that I had growing up of what I actually saw.  Much of which came from the two Piahute Indians I was with who ar!e extremely superstitious and would not talk about the sighting, nor acknowledge what it was at the time.  My younger brother, now 25 has a slight memory of the sighting as well.Sorry this is so long coming.  Just got internet.  Can draw picture if interested.", "Summary : Driving west on i-80 ufo was hovering about 100 ft off ground less than 50 ft from interstate.It was about 200yds in diameter and the underside was very visible.It was very dark grey or black nonreflective material.There were two geometric sections of square windows? that were each 5 x 3 in a concave portion of the body.One section of six of the same size on a convex portion separating the two above sections.Also there was a larger (8x8)square section of very intense white light in the center section.In a 40mph side wind it was motionless and silent at about 100 ft off the ground.Also the CB in my truck would not even key up for the next 5 miles and the fm radio would not work.Also the military may already be aware of this since I saw a helicopter at 5-10 mi west of the ufo.the ufo was still there when I left.The outside shape of the ufo although basically a round shape the edge curved in and out about every 50ft and was perfectly contoured so there was not a flat spot on the entire underside of the ship.To a casual observer the whole ufo could be easily missed as the color blends well with the night sky along with its motionless and silent hovering.There was no activity that I could see on ,around or coming from the lighted apertures.(windows or engines?)The ufo was close to an overpass that did not connect to the interstate.There was only one and I was a little apprehensive about walking up closer and we were on a tight delivery schedule.", "Summary : &quot;V&quot; shaped black object with 5 lights, passed directlyover our house in Phoenix and didn&apos;t make a sound. It&apos;s shape was that of a carpenter&apos;s square set at about 60 degrees, each arm about 300 feet long.My 10 year old son and I had just arrived hope about 8pm and as he waited in the car for me to come around and open the door, he was looking towards the Northwest to see if the comet might still be visible, when he saw a grouping of lights. I looked and what I saw was what looked like at first a pattern of 5 lights in a half oval on its up side. I thought it was a blimp with lights on it. It seemed to be floating but I noticed it was coming directly in our direction. My son went in the house and got my wife, my 13 year old grandson and my 18 year old daughter, to come outside. We all watched these lights approach. Whatever it was it was moving rather slowly. As it came close it no longer had an up-oval shape, but began to look more lie a &quot;V&quot; of 5 lights, with one light in the center lead point and two lights on each side. The angle of the &quot;V&quot; was not very sharp, maybe 60 degrees.As we stood there watching we were completely flabergasted because it was going to pass directly over our house.  And it did. It passed directly over head maybe a thousand or so feet overhead. Our house is up on the side of a mountain in the Northeast part of Phoenix and we can see pretty far to the northwest and southwest. When it passed overhead we all were looking at it and talking. For one thing, it seemed to float over us and it made absolutely no detectable sound at all.  We were trying to imagine what it was. It certainly couldn&apos;t be a group of aircraft flying in formation, because the lights remained absolutely fixed in relationship with each other. As we looked up we could see through the middle of the &quot;V&quot; but each arm seemed to be flat shaped like a ruler, and rather long from the first lead light to the tip lights, maybe a couple of hundred feet or more. It was huge.The kids got a little frightened, I suppose because we had no explanation for what we were seeing. We watched it continue to fly towards the southeast until we no longer could see any lights.My background: I am 54 years old, in perfect health. I have a Masters Degree from Columbia University Teacher&apos;s College. Formerly worked for IBM as a systems engineer. More recently worked in the electronics repair industry in management. Presently executive in a manufacturing firm. My wife is a secretary at St Mary&apos;s Catholic High School. My one daughter is an honor student at the High School. We live up on the side of this mountain and are always looking at the sky, so if we&apos;re outside not much is going to go by without us seeing it. And we all have never seen anything like this.", "Summary : Ice blue object, resembling an &quot;&lt;&quot; flying south to north", "Summary : First appeared the disc over building on campus at dusk, then a sonic boom from air base 50 miles away. Craft zoomed up until it became star size. Cigar craft appeared with 13 craft flying at sharp angles in and out of cigar craft. I watched with campus police and hundreds of other students until after midnight. A friend called home and the base had gone on alert. Photos were taken by other students. Next day local paper was full of the sightings.Not sure if this was ever reported .The first craft was disc shaped with dome on top. Cigar shaped craft was several hundred times the size of the craft. Remember its been some time since I witnessed this event. Has this been reported by anyone else?", "Summary : A small UFO we chased in a Piper Cherokee plane.  Object led us in a circle then passed below us.Four of us (3 pilots) just had landed at the Gogebic County Airport, and while taxing back toward the hanger noticed a flashing yellow light about 2 miles southwest of the airport.  We took off again on runway 27 and headed straight at the object.  It continued to flash a yellowish white light in no particular sequence.  As we approached it, it headed east (our left).  We turned to follow it, but it kept staying off our left wingtip.  It led us in a complete 360 degree turn.  It then headed east along a range of hills.  It entered the landing pattern for the airport at 800 ft above ground level.  We followed it.  It completed the downwind pattern, but after turning onto the dogleg, instead of entering final approach, it veered at a 45 degree angle and passed underneath us.  We were at 800 feet above the ground at the time, in the downwind leg of the landing pattern.  When we finally got turned around, the object had disappeared.  Witnesses on the ground with whom we were in !radio contact with claimed the object passed above us, then just zoomed upward at a steep angle and disappeared.  We knew the object passed beneath us.  The object appeared to be a yellowish-white light about 5 feet in diameter.  When it passed below us, it did not appear any larger and there was no sign that it may have possibly been larger.  Three of us in the plane were licensed pilots, one a commercial airline pilot.  Witnesses on the ground included the airport manager, a local government official and two other pilots.  This encounter was reported to the University of Colorado UFO study which was the offical reporting place at the time.  I received a letter from the project coordinator, Mr. Robert J. Low on March 8, 1968.  He stated that the report would be included in the their active file.  I was informed a few days later by the airport manager, that he had received a telephone call from the University of Colorado asking for more details about the sighting, which he pro!vided.  He was also asked about us, were we creditable witnesses, etc.  He stated that he told them that we all were good honest witnesses.  I never heard anything more about this other than a small article in the local newspaper.  I was wondering if you have ever had any reports similar to this one.  If you have, please advise me of them and where I can read them.  If you need any more information, please contact me.  I have the letter from the University of Colorado and several other items concerning the sighting.", "Summary : Small distant white light floating about the east side of Grand Rapids during the night.  Flashing green and red lights, not much movement, but aparently a UFO because it was gone less than an hour later.  Had small movements, but kept generally steady and remained in the same location for over a half hour.The object was a white light with green and red flashing lights.  The white light appered to blink on and off, or just different brightness.  Well I was sitting at a local school at about midnight when I looked up and noticed the flashing lights.  When I began to study it more, I noticed that it was not a plane because it wasn&apos;t moving.  I thought that I saw it moving up and down swiflty but not more than just a little, so maybe my eyes were just shifting.  Then I thought that it was just a star blinking.  So I called the police department, and they told me serveral other people had reported the same incident.  Well, I wasn&apos;t sure then.  I got a friend and showed him, he didn&apos;t believe that it was a UFO, he said it was just a star.  So I gave it up, I mean who would believe that I saw a UFO anyways.  So I went on AOL for a while, and I went back out to check it at 2:30 am, and it was gone.  No trace of the object anywhere.  How many stars can disappear like that.  So I came ! here to report it as soon as I was convinced. As far as I know, there was only one object.  I only saw one that is.  And it really didn&apos;t have any shape.  I mean it did look like it was very far away.  A coulpe of things, there was another star on the west horizon, which the police thought I was seeing, and it wasn&apos;t it.  And there was a meteior shower tonight, but It wasn&apos;t that either.  So people might try to say I&apos;m seeing things, but I know what I saw. I&apos;m an 18 year old male, fresh out of high school.  I&apos;ll be attending college in the fall.  I&apos;ve always belived in UFO&apos;s, in fact I think that they aren&apos;t friendly.  They might be nice, but why would they be so secret in learning about us.  I&apos;m not mentally retarded, in fact I graduated the third highest GPA in my class.  I was not drunk nor high on anything.  My friends will prove that to you that I&apos;m not into that junk.  Well, I&apos;ve said enough, believe if you want to.  But be prepared whent he truth comes out, I think you&apos;ll be shocked.", "Summary : As I was travelling west on 135th. St. between Antioch and Pflumm, I Noticed to my left a trio of lights which were strobing.  The lights were in a diamond shape, two ruby red lights at the upper two corners, and a brilliant white at the lower point.  The white light would pulse twice, then dim, and then the red lights would pulse and then dim.  The object was travelling from the southeast to the northwest.  My vehicle was travelling about 45 m.p.h. and after watching the object for about two minutes it passed over the road just in front of me continueing its course.  This was not a plane.  I observed no green marker lights.", "Summary : Mass of lights moving simultaneously from west to east.I was driving west on 196th St SW,in Edmonds, when I noticed a mass of bright lights in the sky to my north.  I could not identify what they were.  At first I thought they were a squadron of helicoptors flying in formation with their lights on.  I immediately pulled over and got out of my truck.  I looked up and saw the mass, moving very slowly to the east.  It looked to be about 3,000 feet off of the ground.  There was no engine noise. It moved at a steady pace until it got to the tree tops to my right(east) and then dissappeared.  I have seen many meteor showers and this was not like anything I have seen in 15 years of living in the desert southwest.  The lights did not arc.  They all moved in unison and steady.  They did not change course.  Today, the official explanation from the Pentagon, is that it was a &quot;Russian rocket&quot; which crashed into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington.  Why was it heading towards eastern Washington?  If it was space junk, it would have had to be enormous.  It covered about 25% of the visible sky. Which makes me think it was lower.", "Summary : Large object at above 50,000 feet:  est speed around 3,000 kts:  diamond design. no visable trail:  est 300 x 300 feet.

Incidentally, as a commercial pilot, I have flown this route from Oklahoma City to Roswell, NM about 50 times.   Nothing like this has ever happened before. On the afternoon of Oct. 29, 1997, I flew my three teenagers from Shawnee, Ok. to Roswell, N.M., to attend their Grandmothers funeral. (My ex-wife&apos;s mother)  I dropped them off at the airport, had my aircraft refueled, and departed Roswell at approx. 1600 Mountain daylight time.   (ROW tower should have the exact departure time in their logs.  My aircraft registration number is N9229A) I climbed to a cruising altitude of 9,500 feet, and settled in for the three and a half  hour, non-stop flight back to Shawnee, Ok.  The sun set about an hour later, and left me with a beautiful, star lit night, tail winds, and no turbulence.  Two hours into the flight, at approx. 1900 CDT, and about 10-20 miles north of Childress, Tx.,  (I was at 70 DME southwest of the Hobart VOR, on the 240 radial) I saw what at first I thought to be a &quot;falling star&quot;.   I was amazed that it didn&apos;t burn up in the first second or two after becoming visible, while traveling from an extremely high altitude, nearly vertical towards the ground.  I remember thinking to myself that I could have made a wish on this one!   The object descended vertically until reaching my altitude, when it suddenly leveled off, and while traveling from east to west, still at what I would have to call &apos;meteorite speed&apos;, veered slightly to the north, before arcing back to the south, on a direct collision course with my! aircraft.  I remember at this point, saying to myself in awe two or three times, that nothing goes this fast!!!    As the object approached my airplane at very high speed, it appeared to grow from &apos;shooting star size&apos;,  until it was about the size of a beach ball held at arms length, when I in a panic, banked hard to the right, (taking the object out of my field of view) to avoid a &quot;collision&quot;.   I never saw the object again after that.   I wanted to call Fort Worth Center (ATC) to see if they had &quot;painted any targets&quot; in my area, but was so shaken up by the event, that when I tried to find the frequency on my charts, it was simply too overwhelming to look at the charts, and control the airplane at the same time.  I was about 60 miles west of Altus AFB, so it is possible the control tower saw this same object.  I&apos;m certain it at least streaked from east to west that far.", "Summary : Trianglular lighted object sighted over Austin Texas 6-14-97 at 11:20 pm.Seen from the intersection of Hwy. 71 and Hwy. 620, near Bee Cave.

It was covered with rows of lights, mostly white lights and a few red lights.The two bright white lights appeared at night outside my house.  Then they turned across the backyard. It was very quiet.  Then when I went outside and looked up into the sky I saw rows of much smaller white lights mixed with a few red lights near the middle.  These lights were all moving slowly together as though they were on the bottom of a very large moving object. The shape was elongated but it appeared to have wings on each side in the middle. The lights covered this base and wing surface area. I felt that I was looking up underneath the object.  It slowly and quietly moved in a straight line right above the trees across my backyard and my neighbors backyard.  It moved at the same speed until it disappeared.

First thought: shooting star but much too large for placement in sky.Saw very bright flare-shaped light in sky.  Very like flare from a firework.  Then, realized it was way too large for how far up in the sky it was to be any flare.  Then, thought it was like a shooting star.  Again, too intense, too colorful (yellow/orange) and did not have trajectory I have seen with real shooting stars.  It also stayed in the sky longer than shooting stars.  The flare shape elongated to almost a line, still quite colorful and bright, and it was covered by cloud formation.  When it emerged (15 seconds approx) later, it seemed to be a single light! Small! No sound (although I have no idea if sound could be heard because I don&apos;t know how to really estimate how far away it was).  Then, it rather slowly continued east and went behind another very thin formation of cloud coverage.  I never saw it again!  The sky was clear except for this very thin cloud formation.

I was attending the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas starting 4/5/97- I believe it was Tuesday the 8th, about 8pm, I looked out the window of the Flamingo Hilton and saw what looked to like a dark piece of paper caught in an updraft. It shifted erratically in a descending pattern and at times almost disappeared from view when it was &quot;on edge&quot;. As the object moved lower and it became framed by the backdrop of mountains I came to the conclusion that it was much farther away than I had initially thought and well outside of the city.  I tried to reassess the scale of the object, but found it difficult. At a guess I would say the object was 15 or more miles from the city and looked like a windblown piece of construction paper at 100 feet. The scale of horizontal and vertical shifts in trajectory also took on the appearance of a much greater distance and considerable implied ! speed. The object dissappeared from view perhaps 10-15 seconds after initial siting. Perhaps 2 or 3 minutes later 2 sets of dual vapor trails emmerged along the horizon and as they reached the point where the object appeared to have descended the planes (these were obviously planes and what looked to be military planes) forked out in opposite directions. I mentioned it to a couple of colleagues in the airport the next day on the return to Seattle, a woman in line overheard me and suggested that it could have been a Stealth aircraft. Could be- my impression was that if it was &quot;a plane &quot; it was only a piece of it- perhaps a wing. I am not convinced that I saw a &quot;flying saucer&quot;. But by any definition it was an unidentified flying/airborn object that evoked a military response.

Out there at the lake you can see a lot more than in the city. While looking up into the Eastern sky, I saw a flash of light about the size of the moon, but about as bright as a 1/4 moon. Instantly after the flash, what looked to be a shooting star came streaking out of the flash. It shot across the sky for about 1.5 seconds and stopped instantly. When it stopped, it was about as bright as an average star. After it stopped, it waited for about 1 second and began traveling back the way it came from, at about the speed of a satelite. Me and my famiily saw this, and we can not explain it. It wasn&apos;t a shooting star, because they don&apos;t stop and go back slowly. It wasn&apos;t a satelite because of the way it acted.

There were two parallel primary bright objects with multiple bright objects following, much like one would expect of a comet or a shooting fireworks display. The tails were reddish in color extending quite far behind and again moving parallel. Low on the horizon the tails were perhaps the width of my palm (4&quot;) at arms length. The tails seemed to get shorter as the objects moved toward us. The objects were moving very slow, about the speed of a plane about to land, from a West-Southwest to a East Northeast direction. It seemed to come over Tiger or Cougar Mountain and disappear just to the north of Mt. Si.  They started very low on the horizon and moved up and over my shoulder. I had the distinct impression that I was watching something burning up.  My comment was it looks like a sattelight breaking apart and burning up, but again it was very low on the horizon. The tail was reddish but gave the feel of a headlight piercing fog.  However the sky was exceptionally clear. Observer(s): Male 48, Female 45, two children 13 and 11.

They were travelling down Lyman St. in Westboro.  They had passed a hospital on the left that leads into a large cornfield.  Mary looked over first and noticed the strange object.  It looked just like a light tower with a vertical galvinized metal pole in the center and bright strobe-type lights on either side.  Mary was more curious than scared and she asked ((Name deleted)) what she thought it was.  ((Deleted)) dismissed it as a light tower but ((Name2 deleted)) insisted that it moved.  She slowed the car down and it was indeed moving.  ((Deleted)) started to get nervous and told ((Deleted)) to keep going.  It started to get closer to the car so they sped off.

From the corner of my eye, I spotted movement through the branches of the tree beside the garage, about twenty feet from me.  I turned to get a closer look.  There were no outside lights on, nor was there any light from the house spilling onto the paito or garage as none were on at the time.

I watched the object for about 1 to 2 minutes until, well frankly, I became scared shitless.  I ran into the house to wake my mother so she could see the object, but by the time we got outside it had gone.  I said nothing about this to anyone outside of my family until Thursday night at work.  When I did talk about it at work, expecting to get laughed at, I found an older man who claims to have seen an object similar in description.  He saw it on his way home from work on the same night between 11:00 and 11:30 pm.  His sighting was about 10 miles WSW of mine, though he watched for about ! 20 minutes.", "Summary : our web camera captured images of a strange craft hovering and moving over torontonone of us saw this live, only two days later when we looked at the mpeg movie that automatically gets compiled every nightwe then went back to the archive of still frame jpegs to confirm that what we were seeing was real", "Summary : watched a cylindrical, clearly metallic, resembling shiny aluminum, somewhat rounded object hovering on nearby hills, moving pendulum-like in and out of sight over top of the hill, at about 2000 feet at most.

Object aparently disappeared but witnesses perceived very fast movement upward, in a northern direction. Event happened when I was about 12 or 13 years old, in 1966 or 1967, maybe thirty years ago. I just want to know if this kind of object or similar sighting exists in your archives or database.  It not only was  real, is a vivid image that for 30 years I been wondering about. I don&apos;t want explanations, I am not an ufo believer, but I have seen what I have seen, nobody believes it really, but for me this is not a matter of faith, is just something I saw as a boy and can&apos;t find no explanation for it.

That decision led to the most thought provoking and unexplainable incident ive ever encountered in the night sky.  I-10 just west of Tonapah AZI noticed an unusually bright, white light directly ahead.  I wondered what it was. It was brighter than the stars, and too high for a tower light, no skyscrapers in this area, mentally I eliminated what it wasn&apos;t.  Ithought I was moving towards the object, but in fact it was moving towards me.  Maybe it was the Hale-Boppcomet, but no traveling light.  I thought I would soon discover the origin of the slowly growing white light.I had been watching the object for a good 10 minutes.  Im not sure whether I blinked and missed something orthe object just moved up very fast.  I could see that the bright white light was a cluster of 3 lights.  Itmoved to the far left as if circling and moved out in front but below the cluster object.  I assumed thiswas something examining the larger object, possibly an USAF jet.  My mind curiously questioned,if the smallerobject is a jet what in the world could the big thing be?  The smaller craft (size of a tack)  stayed out frontfor a while.  Then it moved around to the right.  I assumed it was making a full circle check of the light clusterwhich appeared to be the size of three lined up golf balls, intensly bright lights.  The smaller craft was a fewinches in the night sky, to the right and due south of the cluster when the lights turned off.  I watched the smallcraft make a wide ark turn to the right.  It headed south towards Mexico,towards Barry Goldwater USAF base. I checkedmy watch 8:25pm I watched for a good 20 minutes.  Not until the lights abruptly shut off had I allowed myself to thinkof this as a UFO mystery. Where was the noise?

I have logged over a million air miles in my occupation overthe last 14 years.  I am very good at spotting 727&apos;s to 747&apos;s or DC-9&apos;sto DC-10&apos;s.  I know commercial aircraft. Was this one? No way. Secondly,I also lived near Offut Air Force base in the 70&apos;s and frequently takemy kids to airshows at several airforce bases.

I once installed the equipment that I now sell.I am more like a sales engineer. My daily routine is technical anddetailed.  My reputation involves making reliable and sound informativedecisions, statements, and judgements.Obviously, I am somewhat skeptical.  I have tried to rationalize in mymind what I saw that night.

I saw some lights in the sky and he thought they were lights on signal peak. I pointed out that they were very huge and yellow colored. They almost looked like the flares that the military shoot off for their night drills.They showed no movement, there was no smoke trailing from them, and the ground did not appear to be lit up from them. WE kept watch up until we got in to town. Sometimes we could see them from his house on the edge of town. Other times they would be gone. Occasionally one light would fade away or the object turned. Unsure if all lights were on one object or were actually three objects. We were watching them before they were on the news. The lights mostly just seemed to hover. Did not observe them leaving the area, so unsure as to the capability of speed or manuvers. Have seen many objects in the past make very fast sharp turns that known aircraft are not supposed to make. This pa!rticular sighting, the object  seemed to be either in a wedge formation or triangular shaped.From five miles out of town the lights appeared larger than than the street lights we could see in town.Once in town they appeared to be as big as a basketball.My co-worker and I both work for the Dept. of ((Name deleted)).", "Summary : FLASHING BLUE AND GREEN LIGHTS ACROSS THE SKY AND THEN IT DISAPPEARED IN A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT.WE WERE DRIVING HOME AFTER SHOPPING IN VERMONT WHEN WE GOT INTO TWIN MOUNTAIN, WE LOOKED UP TO THE SKY TO SEE BLUE AND GREEN LIGHTS THAT WERE FLASHING RIGHT IN FRONT OF US IN THE SKY.

Quit appearing after the Mar 13 incident in Phoenix.Over about a two week period I noticed a single light in the sky at about the area of the estrella mountains south west of Phoenix. I thought it odd because I am not aware of any roads or power lines in the Estrella mountains. The light was a yellow light similar in appearance to a low power sodium vapor street light. Observed at about the same angle that the peak of the highest peak of the Estrella mountains would be from my observation point. (I had concluded that because it did not move that somehow someone had installed a street light on top of the Estrella Mtns). I did notice that it would occaisionaly fade out and later reappear in the same spot. This light was last observed on Mar 12 the day before the mutiple lights observed across Arizona. The yellow light description of the multiple lights reminded me of what I had been observing, so I double checked the angles from various reference points where I had observed the light and consistently found that that the locatio!n where I had rembered the light being was further west than where the mountains are located. This would place the light in open sky rather than on one of the peaks.I did observe this light on several different nights at various locations several miles apart. The object&apos;s aparent location was consistantly in the same area which would place it approximatly 20 miles south of Luke Air Force Base or about 20 miles ssw of downtown Glendale at an altitude of about 1000 ft (comparable to the nearby mountain peaks).Despite looking for it, this light has not re-appeared since the major event of lights here in AZ", "Summary: four spots of light in a pointing config. moved E. to W. without fading.  Lights didn&apos;t seem &quot;twinkling&quot; or shooting-star like.  Didn&apos;t look like searchlights-too far up.  During the Perseid Meteor Showers.  Seemed like they didn&apos;t fit in up there!I went out that very early morning to specifically watch the star showers.  Living  in an apartment complex, there was a mostly dark area away from the lights where I laid out on the grass with my blanket around me; my head towards the south and my feet towards the north.  In this position on my back, it was dark enough to provide a spectacular view.  I had gone outside about 12:15-ish a.m. 8-12-97, so this is how I guess-timated the time of this event at about 12:30a.m.  Before the event happened, I watched the usual stuff, and the meteors were coming at about 2 or 3 a minute.  Then, suddenly an unusual configuration of four spots of light, with three on one side and one on the other side, (like it was pointing) start in the east (it just appeared out of nowhere) and moved somewhat smoothly and quickly to the west; straight across without fading!  It (the configuration) didn&apos;t look like it belonged up there; it seemed so out of place!  1.)  They certainly didn&apos;t look like a! group of searchlights.  They were too high up.  2.)  They didn&apos;t have the appearance of &quot;twinkling&quot; or comet-like (no tails).  3.)  The light spots were white and slightly blurred on the edges, but anyone watching wouldn&apos;t be able to miss what I saw.  These spots were in a definite arrangement or pattern, and I didn&apos;t see nor hear any plane or other recognizable shape that would tell me otherwise what this thing was.  It was an event of some sort that made me sit up, take notice and start thinking, as never in my life did I ever see anything like I saw that night.  I had actually sat up to say aloud to myself, &quot;What in the world was that?&quot;  The configuration was definitely moving (purposefully so) east to west.", "Summary : Three &quot;oval-shaped&quot; objects, in formation: one in front, one directly behind, one &quot;above&quot; and behind the second one.

As the three objects moved together across the stars behind them, I could see stars &quot;beween&quot; the objects, indicating it was in fact three objects and not one. The objects appeared to be moving at approximately the same rate as a passing satellite.  The objects were in view for approximately 30-40 seconds, then they passed behind some high, thin cirrus clouds and we lost sight of them.

On one Saturday evening just after dark  The black, arrowhead-shaped ufo was hoovering silently as it casted a cone-shaped beam into the neighbors back yard. We couldn&apos;t see what it was shinning on as it was behind the crest of the high-ground behind the house where the cattle were kept. I got out of the car which was stopped in the middle of the road and looked over the roof at the ufo in astonishment. It was completely silent. It had a light at each corner underneath and the beam came from the bottom center of the craft. Apparently, we were spotted too, and the ufo turned the beam off. Then it proceed at a low speed (approx. 5 mph) to the west. We were observing the ufo eastward from Davis Ridge Road at first. It came almost directly over us. It was about 80&apos; off of the ground. It continued west and we turned the car around and followed. The road ran north and south though, and b! y the time we were heading west coming off the ridge we saw it descend below a ridge to the west of us. We saw it no more. The whole affair lasted about 15 minutes. Everyone in the car saw it. We all had gotten out to see it before we jumped back in to pursue it. I got the impression that the occupants of the craft could care less if we saw it that night, as it seemed to be in no hurry for the most part.", "Summary : Large, oval object with 2 small flashing red lights and 2 large steady white lights, 150 to 200 feet in air above a barn right next to Wing St. Object was hovering perfectly still.I was driving down Wing St. just after sundown and saw in the distance 2 small flashing red lights with 2 larger white lights above the red lights. The white lights were spaced farther apart than the red lights. As I got closer, I saw that the object was perfectly still. The white light beams shone straight ahead into low clouds. The object appeared to be about 150-200 feet in the air (very LOW). It hovered above a barn in a borderline suburban/rural area. The shell seemed to be made of metal, riveted together (very industrial- looking, Star Wars-like). I did not stop my car but drove to my destination about 3 minutes (1 mile ) from the site.

The object simple appeared in the sky, and was traveling from the Illinois bluffs towards St. Louis, Roughly E to W. All people noticed the object, half saying it was a meterorite, the others saying it was part of a fire work that had strayed. Niether of these two theories would work because 1) the object was very low as compared to other meterorites we had seen, and 1) we set up about 2-3 miles from the fireworks display therefore no stray objects could have traveled that distance.", "Summary : Three soft dim lights passing over head at a fast rate of speed in a vee formation.It was during a Sting concert in an outdoor amphatheater in Eastern Washington that I noticed three very dim lights appear in the sky flying in unison.  I was listening to the music and watching the sky looking for shooting stars (we didn&apos;t have great seats, but the music was great) when I noticed the lights.  I pointed them out to my girlfriend who was also looking for shooting stars.  At first I thought it was light reflecting off of low flying birds since they were moving so fast.  But they stayed in such perfect formation I quickly discounted that.  I came to the conclusion that it was a high flying military plane (no sound, so I assumed military) that was reflecting in the lights of the concert.

It was approximately 10:09 p.m.  Suddenly all the dogs in the neighborhood started barking and my husband went outside to see what all the commotion was about.  He ran back in the house yelling for me to come and look.  I went out on our front porch and looked up into the sky to where my husband was pointing.  There was an object in the sky to the north, it was heading south.  At first I thought, so what, there&apos;s an airplane in the sky.  Then the object stopped and hovered in one place, it then slowly began to move back and forth, from north to south, then south to north, north to south, south to north, for about 8 or 9 minutes.  Suddenly the object shot straight up into sky then stopped and hovered. At this point I began to get the chills.  Suddenly three rays of white light shot out from this object in a downward direction.  The object continued to hover for another minute or so, then the !beams disappeared and the object began to move back and forth again (north, south, north, south).  The object then came directly toward us, heading south, and flew over us.  Until it was directly over us  there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  When it was directly over us, you could hear an engine-type noise.  When it was directly over us, it appeared to be an airplane, but I have never seen an airplane move the way this object moved.  Nor have the dogs in my neighborhood ever barked at an airplane.  It was bizarre.  What the heck was it?  I don&apos;t know how far away it was.  I would say it definitely was not as far away as the stars or anything, guessing I would say maybe about 1500-2000 feet in the air.We live in a semi-rural desert area.

The freeway runs parallel with state highway 61, the two roads are about 1/4 mile apart where we seen it, so it must have been about half way between interstate 35 and state hwy 61, about 1/8 mile from our truck. The freeway had alot of traffic, some one else had to see this, who would be playing in plane at this time of the evening, in the winter ? I thought plane only had one or two lights? I am only reporting this now because I have just learned about you and I am a big ufo secptic, but I also learned about a week later my in-laws, who winter in Phenoix, seen something really strang in march, which made the news. So I wanted to know if anyone else had seen what we seen ?", "Summary : bright object, star like, motionless, thenrapid acceleration to SE/SSEInitially appeared to be a star...thentook off extremely rapidly....I have had numerous experiencesrelated to being touched and then takenfrom my bed at night and being lifted andtaken thru windows, walls..I have alsohad one extreme encounter where i heardthem ask me if i wanted to travel and thenwas lifted up into a bright white light.Call for more details. and i will write withother info...eventually..", "Summary : I was riding down a main Street named Paul. I was with my mother and i happened to look at the sky and saw a sliver bowl shaped craft about 25ft wide 15ft in height craft. I tried to show my mother but she couldn&apos;t see it. I have seen this craft many times before. By a cloud formation. But i was afriad to say anything.", "Summary : Seen a object in clear sky.looked like comet coming from south to north.lost tail half way across skyI am an amatuer astronomer. I have photographed two comets.Spend many hours observing sky. this night i was setting on a bench with my dog Buddy looking at the clear night stars and jupiter,listening to baseball game on radio when a noticed what apeared to be a comet to the south headed north. It looked as if it was moving at satelight speed. I  know comets dont move like this but that is what it looked like. ASs it moved to the north the tail begain to fade to nothing.", "Summary : My wife and I were just on our way to bed when I noticed this Bright light to the back of our property. At a distance of about 1 mile away and at least about 300-400 feet above the treetop line, just true north of our house this object was slowly moving on an westerly direction. It resembled an upside down funnel, rounded on the edges and the top of the funnel was rounded also. Looking at this it had 3 eggshaped oblisques attached to the bottom of the cone evenly spaced apart and rotating at different intervals. As they rotated they went from a bright yellow to a sharp orange. The main vessel consistently stayed at a bright yellow. My wife who also observed this, very quickly layed back down in bed and quite frankly told me that she did not want to talk about this at all. Our vision is good and this was no plane or helicopter or weather balloon.", "Summary : Two amber lights moving at the same distance apart beginning at one end of Redding and ending in the north eastern direction above Redding.  The lights dropped another WAY brighter light that was white to the ground.  Then the most awesome part was that they just disappeared.  My husband, self and six year old daughter witnessed this.While driving East on Lake Blvd. in Redding, my husband pointed out a set of two lights that were not normal in formation nor in appearance for an airplane.  They were, from where we stood, approximately a quarter of an inch big each, amber in color, moving slowly north by north east?  When we pulled over to the side of the road after the first minute or so we realized they were not airplanes nor were they any other conventional type of air vehicle.  These were two lights going next to each other, approximately two inches apart, in unison as if hooked at the middle.  We could not differentiate if they were indeed hooked or not, but if hooked together by something this object would have to have been huge.  While sitting there freaking out at these lights, seeing them not blinking, or anything else, moving slowly, they headed north.  After a period of approximately 3-5 minutes, the further away of the two lights moved upward and dropped a giant white light from its bottom an!d this light was five times the size of each of the orange lights and dropped to the ground completely.  It was a huge white light that was so bright that it hurt our eyes.  The two other amber lights, still virtually in unison went out at that point and one popped sort of red for a second as they went out then disappeared completely.We are awestricken!  It seems that even though we stood near our car atop a big city hill gaping and screaming it&apos;s a ufo that nobody else stopped, however, someone had to have seen these...they were too obvious.", "Summary : Bright blue-green ball.

It had at least 15 lights .  no sound, it was traveling north bound right in the air traffic area of Sea-Tac planes. Trees obstructed our view, by the time we could see it again, it was gone. We have never seen any thing like this before.  My husband , who was in the army/airborne, said he had never seen any thing like it before as well.please let us know if anyone else saw it!I just sent a email to you, I gave you the wrong date!  We saw this on Tues night 05/06/97,  my husband just remembered that the lights were of different sizes, one large very bright light in the center, he also said that he saw what he thought to be a helicopter about 30 sec after we could no longer see the ufo, this helicopter ( non military type, more like a Bell helicopter) was moving very fast, and appeared  to be leaving the area, as fast as it could go!", "Summary : At 20:15 Pacific time on 2/23/96, while out on balcony with telescope, looked west, south west,and saw 3 triangular shaped objects with an pale orangish color. No lights. No sound.While out with telecsope on 2/23/96, looking at Orion nebula, I glanced up from the eye peice, and towards the west, south west, saw 3 triangular objects.They were a pale orangish color, coming east, north east, from the Santa Monicaarea. They made no sound, and moved fairly fast. Stayed in tight formation, one at point, two trailing. No visible detail.I thought it might be fighter planes, like a Stealth fighter, since president Clinton was in Santa Monica that night, but there was no sound. I thought perhaps the color was due to sun reflecting off the craft,but the Stealth are black, not bare aluminium, and no sun reflects at 20:15 in February.", "Summary : A disk shape object was spotted by my Dad while he was relax ing the back yard. He called to me sveral times .I thought he was pulling my leg. So I went to investigate. When I got there he said look up so I did and I spotted what looked like something very shiny drifting in the sky. I ran upsets got my 10x50 binoculars. Came back and found the object traveling South .I looked through my binoculars and could not believe what I was seening. I kept staring at it and its details. I never have seen anything like it. It was disk shape, it had a lower compartment to it , the lower compartment was smaller than the disc itself .the lower level had like &quot;plates&quot; or doors or slots to it.  And as it moved South it swayed or rocked  slowly from side to side as though it was hitting turbulance in the air.

We were arguing and she was sitting in the front passenger seat yelling at me.  I looked out my front windshield and approx. 100&apos; ahead of me and 100&apos; high I saw what appeared to be &apos;3&apos; rows of stadium type lighting.  The lights were all white, but not bright enough that you couldn&apos;t look at it.  At first glance I thought nothing of it.  I blew it off as stadium lighting or some kind of neighborhood lighting.  I then turned back to listen to what my girlfriend was saying.  Suddenly, it hit me...There is no lighting in that area.  The only thing in that area is a vacant field. (approx. 1 square acre). So I quickly turned my head back toward the lights and said, &quot;What is that!?&quot;.  Before my girlfriend could turn her head to observe it, the lights disappeared.  It was as if someone turned off the light switch.  I was frozen with disbelief.  I didn&apos;t say anything or take my eyes off of! the spot.  I didn&apos;t even say another word.  My girlfriend kept asking me &quot;what?&quot;, &quot;What was it?&quot;, &quot;Talk to me you&apos;re scaring me.&quot;. I didn&apos;t talk. I just slowly got out of my car, walked directly to the spot where I had seen the lights and looked up.  NOTHING was there I MEAN NOTHING! I was standing directly below where I had seen the lights and nothing was around me...no poles...no lights...nothing. I proceeded to tell my girlfriend what I had seen and she blew it off as some sort of stress related hallucination....However, a couple of nights later we were in her driveway and I was giving her a hug.  I had my back to the &quot;SITE AREA&quot; and she was facing it.  Suddenly she says, &quot;Did it look like that!?&quot;.  I turned quickly, but just as the last time it was gone.  Before I could turn my head.  She reacted the same way I did.  She was frozen and couldn&apos;t speak.  She walked over to the same spot as I did and looked up in awe. She said, &quot;I saw it.&quot; &quot;I saw what you told me about the o! ther day and just when I asked you about it, it disappeared as if someone had flipped the light switch.&quot;........What did we see??  Was it listening to us??  Was it trying to monitor our behavior?? For years I have been telling people about what I had seen.  To this day, noone has been able to explain it.  This is the first time I have gone public with this.  I am extremely credible and didn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s until that night. I was a Tampa Police Officer for 2 years and  Tampa Police Dispatcher for 4 years.  In fact I was a Police Dispatcher at the time of my sighting.  My girlfriend and I are no longer together,  but she was a Deputy Sheriff and is currently a detective for a local security company.  Has anyone else ever heard of this type of UFO?

Emitted a beam of light in a horizontal sweep of the sky.  Darted horizontally, vertically, and diagonally across the sky.I was out looking at the beautiful Montana sky one clear night, when my eyes caught an unusually bright star.  I thought nothing of it, but when I turned to look at the same spot again, the &quot;star&quot; had moved.  Then I looked at it from the corner of my eye.  It started to move again, but as soon as my eyes focused on it straight on, it stopped, like it had never moved. I stared directly at it, and less than five minutes later, it started to shake.  Then it darted across the sky, where it stayed for a few seconds more, then took of in another direction.  All together I watched this &quot;star&quot; for over an hour and half.  It had no regular flight path, and stopped, accelerated, and turned much too quickly and precise for any conventional aircraft. The longer I watched this, the more I began to notice.  It would change from a bright yellowish-white light to red, white, and blue lights.  It would also dart across the sky, change direction, and emit a faint white beam horizontally, in a 360 degree sweep of the night sky. Sometimes the light would get brighter, then slowly fade out and disappear, only to reappear in the same spot a few minutes later, like it had never moved.  Just last week, on May 12, I was standing on the top of Big Mountain, a ski resort here in Whitefish, and witnessed the same thing again.", "Have been told could be ball lightining, I checked definition definitely not.  It was a red ball type of  light,  aproximately 3 times flashed off. Travelling at a very high speed approximately 6 fist lenghts off horizon, quite high.  It did a triangle flight pattern and proceeded to the north west  of sky area, did three sort of circular small patterns and went into atmoshpere,    It was a clear sky, was admiring stars for about 10 minutes prior.  Today is Feb 24, 1998 and I can still remember it clearly.  I was quite taken aback!!!  did some calling around to planetarium and observatories and they did not take me seriously, some said could be ball lighning.  What surpised me most was how quickly it would change direction.  Zooming from one end and quickly shifting flight direction.  I screamed for my friends to come out of the house but time did not permitt.  Their is a small single engine plane  airport in area somewhere but I could not understand what flight pattern I was seeing especially as it flew up into atmosphere. It did not disappear into distance ( i.e.east or west) but in altitude. Seem to originally come overhead of Kitchner to south east over to Cambridge then to Waterloo direction back to cambridge over toward Kitchner direction   then in Kitchener area its 3 spins  small circles like spirals and then shoots strainght out into atmoshpere (space)..  I mention the towns to give you indication of how I observed it in  its flight pattern", "I observed a light that I thought was a airplane. As I followed it for a few minutes I looked away few 1 second max. .And when I looked back where the object was it was no longer visible. At first I thought I lost it behind a tree that was obstructing my view. But Iwaited and the object never came back into view even when I moved to different viewpoints . It was very clear that night and I looked all around and there wasnt a    plane in sight. The object had dissappeared without a trace.I went outside to walk my dog when I spotted the light. It was about the size of half a penny held at arms length. It was yellowish-orangish in color. It made no sound or smell. It was moving at about the same speed a commercial airplane does. I spotted it in the southeastern sky and it was moving in a southwesternly direction. It was visible for about 2-5 minutes before it vanished. It was a very clear sky that night about as clear as it gets around here. I think its altitude was about 100ft to 200ft. It was oval or almond shaped. I thought it was a airplane until it dissappeared. This is my third sighting all in Southgate comunity in Glen Burnie MD.. My mother witnessed the second sighting (two craft). This sighting was only seen by myself.", "Summary : Two objects rendevous at the moon.Just a fifteen year old stargazer. I was on my deck watching the moon which was in a straight up southerly direction when a star like light approached the moon from the south and stopped beside it on the southeast side it was a full moon. I was so excited I got my mother and next door neighbors to come out and view it. While they were looking at it I decided to go through the apartment to see if anything else was coming and sure enough it was another star like light from the north. The second light approached the moon and stopped beside it on the west side. The two lights stayed by the moon for at least five minutes and then de- parted in their north, south routes. These objects were brighter than the satelites I&apos;ve seen and moved at an even steady pace. A police report/newspaper article was filed.", "I saw a glowing green sphere cross the sky horizontally east to westI  had just re-entered I-95 southbound from exit 3 near greenland New Hampshire, when I saw a green glowing sphere cross horizontally from east to west.I first saw the object in my drivers side mirror and then in my passengers side.The object appeared to be about the size of a baseball.I was driving a tractor trailer and immediatly turned on my cb radio and I was shocked to hear at least four other truck drivers had witnessed the same event, a green glowing sphere. I had also seen a strange looking airplane about twenty to thirty minutes prior to seeing the green sphere. The craft resembled a plane in nature but had strange x like wing pattern. I saw this x wing like plane first and dissmissed it as blurred vision from being on the road too long. The x wing type plane was seen through my front window while exiting I-95 at exit 3 to go the truck stop. I saw the green sphere getting back on the same exit, and thats when I began to question the first x wing like plane. I am not sure about the first plane like craft because it caught me off guard and happened quickly. The x wing craft appeared low to the ground and looked as though it could have been making a landing approach, again another reason why I had brushed this incident off at first. I did not have the cb on when I saw the first object, so I am not sure if it was seen by anybody else, or if my eyes were playing tricks on me. The green glowing sphere however I am sure about and had confirmed by speaking with other drivers who had also seen it.", "THE OBJECT WAS A LARGE RED BALL OF LIGHT. IT WAS DESCENDING SLOWLY, STRAIGHT DOWN.We were driving along in my father&apos;s truck, when the light was noticed. It was a very large red glowing ball of light, traveling straight downward at a controlled speed, as though it intended to land. There were no other lights visible on or near the object. We observed this for about ten minutes before it finally disappeared below the horizon. I later spoke to a friend of mine about it, describing what we saw. He said it could have been a Chinook helicopter flying under simulated combat conditions. Since the sighting took place at night, there is very little possibility that it could have been a blimp. Also, there are no vertical takeoff&#x5C;landing airplanes in the area. The only local airports are Hobby (civilian), Bush-Intercontinental (civilian) and Ellington Field(joint-use). The only witnesses that I am aware of were myself, my mother, and my father.", "It was a triangle of lights. There was a big light at the top and three little ones under it.

Light began to dim then we assume it climbed in altitude and disappeared within 2 seconds", "Large triange craft composed of 3 large white globes glided low over hiway in front of truck.  It searched the ground with beams of light.My husband and I were traveling at night from Quartzsite to Prescott Valley.  We saw a large lighted object approach the hiway from our left.  It traveled extremely slowly, to slow for something that size to stay in the air.  It appeared to be about the size of of an army tank and was absolutely silent.  As it approached, we stopped in the middle of the road to watch it.  It glided so slowly over the road right in front of us.  It was very low, only about 3 stories above us.  It was a triangular craft composed of 3 round globes of white light.  It was very bright, but it did not hurt your eyes to look at it.  It was like looking at a soft-white light bulb.  It crossed the road, and when it got to the other side, it suddenly shot 3 wide beams of pale blue light down to the ground.  One from each globe.  It actually lit up the ground.  You cound see the cactus, rocks and all details.  It then started to sort of mosey back and forth as if it were searching the ground with the lights and looking at things.  Once or twice it slowed to a hover, and then almost as if disinterested, it sped up to a slow glide again. As it moved away from us, it just seemed to turn off all lights and disappeared.  We were amazed.  It was as if we just witnessed a miracle.  We finally continued on toward home.  As we started to climb into the mountains outside of Prescott, we pulled over to make a roadside rest stop.  We got out of the truck, and looked back down toward a little batch of houses down below us.  Suddenly a huge white globe of light just sort of &quot;turned on&quot; and just hovered over the town.  It was fairly high above the houses.  Then a small red &quot;dot&quot; just came out of the top 1/3 of it, and then flew around the big globe in a random pattern.  We watched it for about 8 minutes.  Then the red dot flew back to the same place it came out of.  Then the big globe just turned out like a light bulb and was gone.  My reality changed immediately from a UFO believer to a UFO knower.", "a small group of lights flying in a birdlike formation slowly across the sky in a northeast direction.I saw a small group of lights floating slowly very high up in the air in a northeast direction. I was standing in a parking lot with one other person. As time passed the object changed shape as if it were an amorphous blob floating across the sky. I noticed this because I looked up to see what was making a loud noise and saw two military helicopters fly by travelling southeast. I noticed the blob at the same time. The blob was a group of small white lights. Then I saw what looked like a shooting star starting slightly east of the object. It went over the object and dissappeared and then the object itself faded away. I am a 24 year old married female and the other witness is an 18 year old male. We both work for a delivery service.  I think the shooting star was the object as it was leaving because immediately after i saw the shooting star the object faded away.", "Flash of the brightest light ever, fire colored, tail twice as long, travelling west to east,horizontally.

I was 7 or 8 minutes from home and out in the country. To my right up in the clouds I thought I saw a light. All of a sudden the sky lit up with lightning. At the point where I saw the light, Aball of light the size of the moon flashed on for 2-3 seconds then went out. I was thinking that a plane might have gotten struck by lightning. I know that lightning can do some strange things, and I did`nt think anything of it, til I got home, where my wife was freaking out about a disc shaped object she had seen in the soutern sky not more than ten minutes earlier. It was in the direction I was coming from, and it had been ten minutes earlier that I saw what I saw. I only saw a light and then the flash, She said that what she saw had a line of lights around the bottom. It moved back and forth over the tree line then blinked out. I`ve never seen a ufo to my knowledge. This is the first time for my wife too. I`d love to think that what we saw was alien. Thank You ((Name deleted))Already described in the above description.", "It changed shapes slowly and was spinning slowly and it was creepy.They kept changing shapes, and spinning slowly, and the entire time, as you would see at a concert they were shining bright lights all over, but not steady, they were waving them all around. And the entire time stuff like the forks in the kitchen were sanding on end, my sons 4 wheeler wngine cut off, the air conditioner cut off and would turn back on until the left, then it turned right back on after they left, and wee were watching t.v. and it just started flipping through all the channels, and my daughters radio also started flipping through all the channels, both were electric, and the lights were flashing on and off. It also landded in the back of our field. I guess because the crafts were almost overtop of our house. The looked silver, but they kept lighting up with neon colors. Well, the viewers are our neighboors and my family, we all have jobs, high paying jobs, and this is just unusual, I would think I was crazy if everybody else hadn&apos;t seen it! Unfotuanatly I don;t have a video camera, and my neighboors wouldn&apos;t turn on, then once the left he tried turning it on and it turned on.", "As I was leaving in my car from a building I happened to look up into the sky and noticed 6 hovering things.  I stopped my car and got out to look.  I couldn&apos;t beleive it.  I also saw a police car down the block with its flashing lights as if in response to this sight, I don&apos;t know.  I went back to the building to get some input from other people.  By that time the things had moved but were somewhat seeable if you looked.The objects were all the same size and were a gold/yellow color.  More of a blazing fire color.  At first they were just there, it a semi circle and I thought we were going to get attacked.  Sounds crazy, I know, but that&apos;s why I went back to the building I came from.  I was somewhat frightened but I really wanted another opinion on this.  It didn&apos;t help that a police car was up the block with its lights on.  One other person from the building saw what I saw.  Others tried to look but couldn&apos;t see anything.  As far as my memory will recall, it seems they would appear and then not appear, because they weren&apos;t easily seen after I went back for other opinions.  I must also add that after that event, throughout Long Island skies, I noticed these yellow color &quot;planes&quot; or things that would distract people while they were driving.  This thing would catch your eye in the sky as you&apos;re driving and you couldn&apos;t help watching it.  This may have caused some accidents.  Lasted about 2 weeks. A brief description of my background is that I am of sound mind, a mom of 3, and work for a living, like everyone else."]
