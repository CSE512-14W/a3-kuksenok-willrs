["Light&apos;s in the skyAs I was waiting to start my shift I was sitting on te dock watching the planes flying over head into cincinnati northen KY airport, mind you they have a flight line that is east to west, that puts them right over my place of work. Nothing was going over head at the time because planes make noise, then I just happen to look up looking north east and I saw two bright lights for about 5 to 10 secound&apos;s, but I heard no sounds like a plane would make then they just went away, also it was a clear night! star all over the place this was my first time ever seeing something like this.((NUFORC Note:  There was an Iridium flare at 19:57 hrs. on this date, but it would have been in the western sky.

Above the Lufthansa which was banking northward toward Logan Intn Airport from the east, was another, higher altitude aircraft heading in an easterly direction.Farther up, above the higher aircraft I noticed what appeared to be an orange light.  It wasn&apos;t much more than a speck in the sky and I&apos;m amazed I had even spotted it.It was very high up but seemed to be reflecting the sun&apos;s light making it appear as an orange light.The sun was on it&apos;s way down but the sky was still bright.  Nothing was giving off that orange glow when the sun is setting, not even the higher altitude jet-liner which was just white(no vapor trail).The light appeared to just be hovering.  I sat and watched for maybe 30 seconds when I had decided to run in the house and grab my 30X Spotting Scope and alert my brother to what I was looking at.We both got outside and the light was still at the same spot in the sky.  As I tried to get a better look at it with the Spotting Scope, it began to slowly move NNW which caused me to have to jump of the back porch to keep it in my sight as I feared it would go behind the tree overhead.  My brother was having a bitch of a time spotting this thing by the way.As I wormed my way through off the deck, the object stopped just at the edge of the leaves of the tree, luckily, since I was nearly pressed up against the house trying to get the thing in my scope.Once it stopped, I managed to get it in my scope and saw it to be a cylindrical object, orange in color, possibly from the sun reflecting off of it.At this time I had my brother jump of the deck as well and used the leaves as a reference point for him to look and then he finally caught sight of it.Seconds later, it slowly drifted off to the NNW and dissapeared behind the tree.I ran out to the front yard but failed to find it again.I was thinking it to be possibly the International Space Station but, to my knowledge, the Space Station doesn&apos;t stop then move on again,,,does it?  Would it even be possible to see the Station during daylight hours?((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  The ISS is sometimes visible during evening hours, but it does not stop.

The same information was brought to our attention by Mr. Ryan Layton, MUFON SSD for Utah.  We note that many of the facts cited in the initial sighting report, do not seem consistent, and we have called that to the attention of the investigators.  For example, if an object passed within a few hundred feet of the observer while traveling at &quot;2,000-3,000 mph,&quot; the resultant sonic boom would have blown the witnesses off their feet.  Instead, the witness reports no sonic boom, and in fact reports that the sound heard was quite mild.

It was low and kind of hummed, it didn&apos;t make too much noise.Sighting Event Details:Description of object /s :  We were traveling home last night when we saw several objects in the sky, much too large to be a jet, plane, or helicopter. They were in a V formation and slowly moving and hovering into straight lines and then back again. Couldn&apos;t tell exactly what shape the actual object was. I am not one to believe in UFO&apos;s or anything, but now I can&apos;t deny what I saw. It was not of this world, or maybe it was the government testing something, either way it was strange and there wasn&apos;t a logical explanation of what I saw.  Suddenly, one shot straight up into the air and looked like something going into space. but it didn&apos;t, it flew right over our heads and appeared to look like a triangle. It immediately changed directions, nothing that I know of can go at that speed and change from right to left so quickly. The other lights were still there, they had an orange glow to them.  We stayed for an hour and watched these strange objects. I know someone else had to have seen what was going on, I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn&apos;t making it up.  Now there is no doubt in my mind that we are not alone.I do feel suspicious about the whole thing, i thought we were completely alone in this universe, but now i have a strong conviction we are not.Phenomenon visible for how long?: we stayed to watch it for an hour, but went home, it could&apos;ve gone on longer than that.Direction of Object: It was going west then east then north. it changed directions rather quickly.Height / Altitude of Object: maybe a few hundred feet, but pretty close to the ground Distance of Object:  Object came within 500 feet - 3 hundred feet or maybe a bit more, it seemed really really close to us.Estimated Size of Object: Unknown - can&apos;t be too sure Speed of object:          1000 - 3000 mph Object solid ?

Objects were straight north from witnesses location.They were driving for 5-10 minutes seeing the formation, before stopping their car. They got out of their car next to a field and witnessed the objects for another 45- 50 minutes, before leaving. The object were still visible when they left.They noticed one other person / car was stopped on the side of the road looking at the objects.The Main formation was hovering, at a few hundred feet. lights were all orange.  One object was bigger than the others. middle object.  5 to 6 objects seen- then there were three. two objects seen leaving formation. thats when they witnessed the high speed maneuversOne object shot off - Object that left formation went straight up then south over our heads. when the one shot over it was had smaller blue lights, along with the orange color that made up the whole color. and had a Triangle shape.It was definitely alot faster than a aircraft.  Note: witness does not have a great sense of speed being that it was at night.Another object went west then east. making a 160 degree turn instantly.At arms length what size were these objects?   &quot;Two fingers in size or bigger.&quot;Witnesses seen other aircraft in vicinity.  witnesses looked at other aircraft (planes) and said &quot;that is an airplane and thats not an airplaneThere were No clouds.

We noticed this light come up from the ground in a northerly direction.  The light was quite faint and obviously about 7-10 miles away.(The reason it caught our eye was because there had been a lot of police helicopters in the area, the weeks prior to it due to a rising crime rate.  Knowing that if it was a police helicopter and it came overhead they would probably call the ground troops to get us out of the locked park) The light went from side to side and up and down and we still thought it was a helicopter.  Then suddenly two more lights rose from the ground and the first one shot up at a tremendous speed.  The other two start moving eratically too, so we carried on observing for at least an hour, some of the lights disappeared, but as soon as they did another few came from the ground.  By now we had ruled out a helicopter and maybe thought it could have been a Harrier jump jet. Some of the brighter lights had smaller lights shooting out of them at very fast speeds, then flying upwards and disappearing.  There was also on only two occasions a blue searchlight type light beamed down to the ground in a cone shape.  However this light was ommited from absoltely nothing and quite some distance from the moving white lihts.Suddenly one of the white lights got really bright as if it were pointing towards us. So we paid attention to that one, it started moving slowly to the right and then stopped after it had got considerably closer to us.  It stayed hovering for about 2-3 minutes then jumped upwards, darted downwards and from side to side.  That then made us realise that this was no conventional aircraft of any known kind.The light then got even brighter and started moving in our direction, as it got closer we could see that it had two round shaped bright headlight type lights at the front and flashing red and green lights on the bottom.  The carft did move as if it was finding it difficult, tilting from side to side.  It was about 100ft above the ground as it passed over our head so we got a real good look, it was a shiney dark yellowy coloured matchbox type shape, with a pyramid or roof shape on its underside, the flashing green and red lights were on the peaks of the roof shape.  There was no sound apart from a strange wering sound.BUT To top it off as it past over our heads it morphed into a green tailed and green passenger window lit 747 at the same height off the ground(around 100-200 ft), a plane at that height makes a massive amount of noise but there was still none. Once the UFO had changed shape it gained altitude and almost completly disappeared within seconds.We bothed looked at each other and were speachless, also as we walked home there were thousands upon thousands of white star lights in the sky moving around almost like the underside of the spaceship in Independence Day the Movie.I have submitted this report to a British site some years ago and forgotten the address, the reason for saying this is because I drew a picture and attached it, but can&apos;t attach it to this one.", "Fast moving object , possible cigar shapeEarly in the morning while walking into work I was looking up at the sky since it was clear with many stars out and noticed a small, fast moving light in the North-East portion of the sky.It was bluish-white and at first I only thought it was a satellite when all of a sudden it made a dive towards the ground while at the same time making a sharp arc down and to the left, nearly reversing it&apos;s direction of travel. I would compare it to watching a kite dive at the ground, this moved extremely fast. I had the impression it was large and had a blue-white light in the center with two elipses illuminated at either end, it seemed to have a possible cigar shape to it. While making it&apos;s dive and turn it just faded quickly.The whole event lasted between 3-4 seconds, I was stunned at the speed this object moved at.I am not positive on this time frame because I hesitated to report this but I am quite certain that what I saw was out of the ordinary and also similar to another California report for September.", "Large very bright circular light spanding much of the countryside.Bright light hoovering over flat lands elevation unknown.

My back yard is quite big (80 meters long) and we cannot see the back wall from our window unless it is a very bright night.I waited for him in bed and paid attention to what was happening. He stayed at the window for about half an hour and I noticed that it was dark again and the birds had gone quiet and the dogs stopped running and barking. He went back to bed and told me what he had seen: our dogs were barking to the back of the yard, sniffing around the trees tracking something and our doberman was barking to the top of the wall. He looked up ready to take his gun to make some noise, for he thought someone was trying to invade our property. Then he looked up and saw there was a &quot;person&quot; standing still on the top of the wall. As he said he thought it was a person but our wall is about 2.5 meters high (+- 8 ft)and the person was as tall as the wall. He got so astonished that all he could do was stare. He said the person might have noticed being observed and walked very lightly to the corner of the wall and did not jump, just walked off the wall as if walking off the stairs in a house. Right after that, he said, it went dark again like someone turned off the light ( I noticed that too ). In the morning he talked to some of his friends (military) who later confirmed (unofficially, of course) that several people, including military people, reported the unusual brightness of the sky from different points of the city.((NUFORC Note:  Date apparently is approximate.

(AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico.The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara.&quot;The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly,&quot; said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara.The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said.Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show.&quot;We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early,&quot; Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets.&quot;Suddenly we&apos;re getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is,&quot; Gabel said.The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile&apos;s accuracy and reliability.((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS))", "While driving home, we saw 8 white lights flashing in a formation for about 5 minutes.The object was moving slowly over the Idaho/Oregon boarder.", "Seeing this object so clearly and not able to describe it as I would like to convey what  we were seeing is difficult.I was standing in my driveway and happened to look up.An object was stationary in the sky over some treetops.

Shortly before the Villlage of Oak Creek my 10 year old son who was in the back seat said &quot;What is that thing in the sky?&quot;.  I said it was probably a plane but he seemed insistent so I strained my neck to look where he was pointing.  At that time I noticed what appeared to be a shiny metallic-like object that seemed to be halfway between a round and disc shape.  It was high in the sky, about where a small plane would normally fly.  It was not moving, just hovering.  As the road I was on is very winding I couldn&apos;t keep my eyes on it for very long at a time.  My son, however continued to observe it for at least 4 minutes.  It didn&apos;t appear to do anything except hover high above the rocks until I looked up the last time.  Then it appeared to get physically smaller and smaller over a period of about 15 seconds until it completely disappeared.  Shortly after this I stopped in the Village of Oak Creek to get a coffee, all the while marveling with my son over what we had just seen.  After about 5 minutes we proceeded to get back on the road at which time my son said &quot;There is is again&quot;.  It had moved position slightly and seemed a bit lower this time.  A jet plane flew almost directly over it at that time and it gave us a bit of perspective as to the size.  It seemed to be about a quarter of the size of a large plane.  Once again, it just hovered and did not make any movements. (or sound that we could tell)  We continued to watch it for another 3 or 4 minutes (myself in between looking at the road of course)and because of the enormous rocks and cliffs around Sedona we then lost sight of it.  UFO sightings around Sedona are known to be a bit &quot;common&quot;.  I have personally seen many &quot;strange&quot; lights in the night sky but have never seen anything during the day.

I really did not see any kind of craft at first and I just stood there looking at this cloud of white and orange light and after a while I did see a round orange light a very small light which appeared to be a half inch to an inch in diameter. While I looking at this phenomenen I thought to myself that perhaps it was the moon behind that cloud or maybe some kind of solar refraction but the time was considerably past sunset and also I looked up into the sky to my left and the moon was there.  The lighting in the cloud has the look of the sunset on the horizon except that this light was considerably above the horizon and there was also white light in other parts of the cloud.

I stopped to look up at the Orion constelation and find a star that usually appears to be flashing red, white and blue this time of year just bellow and north of it...I dont know why i do that... it is just is interesting to me.  This time I saw something that has permanently changed my mind about all the UFO stories. Just the south of me i noticed a VERY faint pumpkin orange glow and thought i was going to get to see a meteor start up as i turned my head slightly i realized that there were 5 very square shaped glowing patches in a v shape heading north slightly south and east of were i was standing. I intently tried to focus my sight on this and realized that as they were moving the stars behind were blocked out in a very black v area behind them and that the faint orange squares were more rectangular and bent over the leading edge of a wing like structure...try as i might i could not get any other visual ques as to the exact shape of what was going by right in front of me. I was trying to get an idea of the trailing shape but could not because as the stars would reapear behind it they seemed distorted, like in a mirage, by wave like disruption of the star light. I stood there fixed in total disbeleif of what i was seeing! As it passed almost over me and in front of me it made NO SOUND what so ever! I would guess that it was was about half again bigger than a stealth bomber(which i have seen flying over head at the Air Force Academy graduation twice, only about 40miles from here) and about 1500 feet off the ground, I had the impression for a second that it was a stealth bommber gliding but it was a little too big and there is no where close in that direction for it to glide to. as it passed to my left the orange glowing patches became almost impossible to see on the bottom edge of it and became smaller as though they were on the front edge of a wing but still absolutely no sound! I couldnt keep an eye on ! it after a few more seconds since there were no more visable stars in that area to see it blocking them. I stood there for 5 to 10 minutes looking all over trying to see if it would come back, but it never did. I would guess that it was traveling about 2 to 3 times faster than the C130s we have fly over us all the time and was about twice the wing span. I couldnt tell any thing beyond that it looked generaly like a flying wing since there was nothing but the 5 orange patches and the blacked out shape behind them. The orange patches were extremely faint, less bright than the stars of Orions belt, as if they were reflectors instead of lights, but i cant figgure out what they could have reflected since it is still pretty dark at 5:30am.

We first thought the lights were airplanes but they weren&apos;t moving. Then we noticed three other lights appearing. They were in a curvy pattern similar to an S lying down. Then they formed a triangle with the very brightest of the lights at the top and two at the bottom and the other two at the sides - only the two on the sides turned into angled slashes - looking like very short, pinkish contrails from a jet. Later, all of the lights seemed to disappear except for the very brightest light, which turned into the contrail looking slash and seemed to move to the left and later disappeared.

There were hundreds of cars on the road so I&apos;m sure there were many who witnessed this besides the four of us in our car.Anybody else see this??((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found him to be unusually sober-minded and credible.

On a Friday night in August My Father,(An Episcopal Minister), mother, brother, the Bishop of Massachusetts, and I were returning home from a 7:00 PM movie in Exeter New Hampshire. It was aproximately 9:00 PM. We were driving along and suddenly saw a light in the sky over the mountains. My father pulled over to the side of the road so that we could get a better look at the light. At first we thought it was a spotlight shining on a cloud. But when we pulled over and stopped, we got a better look at it. It was a saucer shaped object. It was stationery, several hundred feet above a mountain. There was no sound from the object. One edge of the craft was tilted down toward us, and we could see across the top of it. In the middle of the craft was a very bright white light that seemed to pulsate and change colors slightly. From a bright white, to a reddish and yellow. Around the outer edge of the craft were bright white lights also. They too seemed to be pulsating, and changing colors slightly. White, yellow, and red. We watched the craft for a couple of minutes as it stood still above the mountain top. There were scattered clouds, and the craft illuminated the clouds closest to it. Suddenly the craft went from a dead stop, to completely out of sight in about 2 seconds. It took off upward in the direction of the farthest side of the craft, which was higher than the side facing us, and at about the same angle that it had been in while stationery. We all didn&apos;t know what to say or do. We pulled back onto the road and continued home. There was very little talk about it on the way home, but my brother and I kept saying to each other, &quot;I don&apos;t believe what we saw&quot;. &quot;It was a UFO&quot;!At the time I was 12 years old and by brother was 10.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was dark, and the sky was clear albeit for a slight haze.Shortly after changing to white the objects formed two cirles and emitted trails of sparks as they descended out of my field of view, ie., behind buildings as I walked.Despite having lived near airports, both military and commercial, I had never witnessed anything similar.A possible explanation occurred to me a week later, and I made a few email enquiries.This sighting turned out to be a parachute display team, with flares, operating in darkness for the benefit of the attendees at a local agricultural show. It had me foxed.I&apos;m English, and I&apos;m pretty sure that parachutists don&apos;t perform at night in the UK, but laws here obviously don&apos;t prohibit such activity.I hope this sighting may be of interest as it could perhaps explain a limited number of other sightings around the globe?

We work on the State Campus which is located southeast of the Albany International Airport but within aircraft takeoff and landing patterns.  We were checking out the sky, discussing how unusual it looked with the different kinds of clouds.  Suddenly from the west we notice something bulleting across the sky.  It had a very narrow vapor trail which was so thin that I briefly thought if the puffy clouds were cotton balls it would pull them together like thread. It was also strange in the fact that the trail failed to scallop like the vapor trails of the jets we saw only moments before. The object made no noise.As it shot more to the northeast it was going to be blocked by the corner of my building.  I went down the steps just in time to catch a glimpse of the object.  It appeared to be football in shape only a bit longer and slightly deflated, with at least one fin on the top and bottom.  Its color looked dark metallic gray.  The air around it was a bit funny; gave the appearance it was traveling in a fuzzy bubble.Since the military has been active in our area since 9/11, I thought maybe it was something new they were flying so I didn&apos;t report the sighting.  I missed the orginal FOX report but my co-worker told me about it the next day.  When I didn&apos;t see any followup a week later I wrote FOX email info line to make an inquiry and report that we had seen the object.

PD))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Dear Mr. Davenport:Thank you for your quick response.  While my report stays the same in every other detail, I failed to check a calender when submiting the date of our sighting and it wasn&apos;t the 20th.  My co-worker and I work Monday-Friday.  Ours took place during  the week, the day of the evening report of the Oct 20 object by FOX to the public.   I do know that for sure as my co-worker came in the next day all excited because he had heard the report of the original object on the news the night before.  He said that FOX had done a report on the object we saw (last time I listen to him).  I didn&apos;t see the broadcast and couldn&apos;t  find anything on it until I found your site yesterday (I was using the wrong search word on FOX).  I apologize for this inaccuracy. However, it does not change the facts that I have otherwise reported.You asked if the object made any maneuvers while we watched it.  No.  It was the vapor trail that first drew our attention to the object shooting like a bullet across the sky.  It wasn&apos;t until I ran down the steps and the object changed directions (from traveling due east to NE) that I was finally able to briefly get the shape.  Since we couldn&apos;t really see it before and I now could, I had the impression  that it tipped a little and  I was looking more towards the top of the object rather than the side.  It was just so fast I only got a glimpse.  The whole experience was almost surreal in that something that big should have made some sort of a sound but didn&apos;t.  Yet the vapor trail and its funny, fuzzy bubble around it told me it was really high up and something &quot;different&quot;.I have been thinking about its vapor trail and the way jet vapor trails look.  This object appeared to be more seering the atmosphere than putting out exhaust..You ask if what I saw was like what the reporter filmed.  His object appears to look more like a walking stick.  Ours was a bit fatter and the fins a bit broader.  It looked as though the reporter&apos;s object devoured half of itself, just that much fatter.Ever since 9/11 when the hijacked plane turned right over us we have been sky watchers.  I have a window seat at work and  can tell when something is going on at the airport, note the flight pattern changes and every type of plane that takes off and lands, including the military.

Just as suddenly, a bar of lights appeared out of the front of the cloud, looking much like a photographer&apos;s light bar, with extremely brilliant lights.

Earlier in the evening (from 10 - 11pm) we watched an impressive display of the Northern lights. I fell asleep on the couch and awoke around 3am Sunday and decided to take my sleeping bag and pad onto the deck to fall asleep under the stars. While stargazing I noticed what appeared to me as a satellite tracking from south to north. Upon further observation I noticed that the object was being followed by two additional lights of the same size. All three were equidistant forming a very distinct triangle pattern. The lights were about 1.5 - 2x brighter than the surrounding stars. Lying on my back they appeared to be about one hand width distance from each other from my perspective. The lights were white only with no accompaning marker lights such as those on an airplane.I grabbed binoculars from the house but was unable to focus on the target objects. I continued to follow the objects with my naked eye as they tracked steadily to the north. The lights held the distinct triangular pattern and faded into the horizon. I have seen many satellites in the past but never three in such a distinct formation. I became motivated to file this report after talking to several friends and realizing that it seemed quite odd for three satellites to be moving in what appeared to be formation. Additionally, I am accustomed to seeing satellites much earlier in the evening. An interesting side note is that after the sighting I observed two brief flashes, similar to a mirror at a great distance reflecting sunlight. The flashes were quite brief but 3-4x brighter than the stars. These occured about a minute apart from each other and were overhead in the area through which the objects had passed. At this point i was all set with skywatching for the evening and promptly closed my eyes and eventually drifted off.((NUFORC Note:  We are aware of the U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; satellites which currently are in orbit, but they are not in a polar orbit, to the best of our knowledge.

This occurred in a brightly lit meadow near the summit of Mt. Shasta at about 4:30 in the afternoon. The light was intense, pure, and very small (about dime sized). It appeared in front of the trunk of a Spruce tree not more than 100 feet away, slightly above head level (about 6 feet up). The light would slowly transition from one solid color to the next, and then it would remain an intensely bright pure color for about a minute before slowly transitioning to the next color. I approached the tree and examined the trunk, limbs and foliage. I could find nothing that could have emanated that sort of light. I toyed with the idea of pitch oozing slowly out and while solidifying changed the reflected color, but the pitch I observed was cloudy white and in huge dried clumps. The pitch was to the right of the location of the light I pinpointed while using binoculars (I observed the light with the naked eye and binoculars). I had a camera and didn&apos;t use it; I couldn&apos;t see the light in the viewfinder. The light could only be viewed in one direction, and as I approached the tree, the light would disappear.

Here is the whole boring story:I was asleep in the meadow when I opened my eyes to find a red light shining into them. I closed my eyes, thinking &quot;Oh its just a reflection from tensile on the tree&quot;, thinking better of that, I reopened them to find the light changing from red to orange. I sat up and thought that was strange. When I sat up the light disappeared, so I lay back down and discovered that the light was directional. I had to be careful how I moved to keep the light in view. The &apos;now orange&apos; light was intense and pure and I couldn&apos;t write it off as a reflection. I stared at it for awhile, enjoying the beauty of it; then it started transitioning to yellow. Well that really piqued my curiosity. As the light grew in intensity and purity to a very bright lemonyellow, I took out my binoculars and isolated the position on the tree where it appeared to be coming from. I stood up to investigate but discovered that I was ill. I had a hard time going to the tree as waves of nausea were sweeping over me. As I approached the tree, I lost sight of the light as I was no longer in it&apos;s line of site, for the moment I was sure that an examination of the tree would yield the answer. At the tree, I couldn&apos;t find anything that could cause it except for maybe pitch, but the pitch was in the wrong location and none of it was fresh. I went back to my original position on the ground and found the light transitioning from yellow to green. I admired the green light for awhile and tried to take a picture of it, since I couldn&apos;t find it in the viewfinder I gave up. I tried again to find the source, to no avail. When I returned again to my original position, the light had transitioned to blue. Again I tried to approach the tree this time keeping the light in sight, but as soon as I&apos;d get close, I&apos;d loose the light. When I returned to the original position to regain it, the light was gone. Although I said the whole thing lasted 5 minutes, it could have been longer.  I had time to sit and stare at it, take out binoculars and stare at it, run back and forth to the tree, and finally tried to get a picture of it. The camera I had was just a digital camera-not my camcorder. My camcorder would have been able to zoom in on the light no problem as it has a fantastic zoom. The camera I had with me doesn&apos;t have a very good zoom. I regret that I didn&apos;t take pictures anyway, as it may have shown up in the picture. At this point, my guess would be pretty far out at to what it could be. I have the impression that some unseen person or thing was standing there shining lights in my eyes.((END FOLLOW-UP))", "A brightly lighted round aircraft, traveling at a fairly slow speed and  a low altitude toward Lake Michigan, clearly seen.Lying in bed, at the above mentioned time or approximately at that time or slightly later, I was gazing up at the skylight just above my bed, when a very large lighted object passed directly over the skylight.  It seemed to be round diffused light with a tiny bright possible light source. It was very bright and seemed to be traveling at about the speed of what an airplane might be traveling when it was approaching a runway for a landing. Having only seen this object for a couple of seconds, I&apos;m only guessing at its size and altitude.  It seemed quite low and I&apos;d estimate its diameter to be the size of the length of a private single engine airplane. It had no defined edges as the edges were more or less glowing similar to what a bright light bulb might look like from a distance.  I live approximately 2-3 miles from the edge of Lake Michigan and the &quot;craft&quot; was flying from the East to the West which is the direction of Lake Michigan from my home.  Interestingly enough, and the reason for my filing out this report, someone that I work with saw something the same night down in the Douglas, Michigan area. Her discription was nearly identical to mind.  Same bright, large object moving from the East toward Lake Michigan. She also lives quite close to Lake Michigan.  She had another experience in the past, but I don&apos;t think that it was very recent, but it did involve a &quot;craft&quot; over the Lake Michigan area shoreline down in Douglas, Michigan.  Douglas and Norton Shores are probably 55 miles from one another.  I have never seen anything like this in my life and my first thought was that whatever this was was heading downward toward the lake.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My wife and I were out star gazing as we always do when weather permits.  There had been a lot of overcast the past few weekends enabling us to enjoy our hobby.  This evening was a little cloudy but not bad so we were not going to miss it!  We set up as quick as we could and started gazing.  As I said it was cloudy so when the clouds were over head we would take a break, sit and have some coffee, smoke, whatever.  During one of are little breaks my brother-in-law came by to talk, so he sat outside with us.  Later around 0030 or 0100 it happend something we never thought would, as I looked to the sky to check the cloud cover I seen a pitch black Triangle moving very slowly across the sky.  I pointed to the sky and asked donnie to look up when he did he couldn&apos;t believe it.  I yelled to my wife who was getting coffee when I told her to look up she did and droped the cups.  I hurried to get the camera pointed and snaped some shots.  It was heading SSE very slowly and did not make a sound the entire time,  It was very close to the ground as well I say that because the clouds helped to define it&apos;s shape, because it was below the clouds.  When I started snaping pictures It changed direction from SSE to ENE and was gone just like that.  We saw no lights at all from the second we first seen it till it changed direction and left.

It traveled too fast for a plane, too slow for a meteor (shooting star), and seemed bright and fuzzy around the edges, a bit orange colored.

My estimate would be that it was late January or early February.  I was outside in my hot tub.  It was between the hours of 2 - 4 am.  I first noticed an object moving as it blocked my view of the stars.  I turned of the jets on my hot tub and stood up to get a better look as steam was rising off the surface of the water.  It was at an altitude much lower than a craft of that size should be and as it approached I saw a dark triangular shaped object with no lights and it made no sound.  I saw the lights from the interstate and city reflecting from the bottom of this object which helped to define its shape.  It appeared to be following the route of Interstate 15 coming from the north and going south.  I live fairly close to the interstate.  My guess was that it might be some kind of experimental military aircraft, but who knows.I am just now sending this in as I read an article on rense.com about a man who saw this same object and I wanted to confirm that I have seen it as well.  When I mentiond it to a couple of my friends, they looked at me like I was crazy.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in February 2002 so that the report sorts to that date.  PD))((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))Dear Mr. Davenport:Regarding reconstructing the date:  Unfortunately I cannot give you an exact date and time, as I said, I did not document this.  I do remember that it was quite early in the morning as I had finished studying - again between 2 - 4 am.  I generally do not bring writing or recording materials out with me when I sit in my hot tub and I do not have a clock outside.  I guess thinking in hindsight, maybe I should.  I just remember that it was in the first quarter of the year.  I don&apos;t think this happened before my birthday, which is January 31st, because I don&apos;t remember mentioning it to friends at my birthdayparty.  It was a completely dark night around the time of the new moon.  I had a two-week break from school during the Olympics and this happened after a long night of studying so that would exclude February.   That leaves the time period around the new moon in March.  The weather was still quite cold as steam was rising from the surface of my hot tub.  Sorry I can&apos;t be more specific on that.In answer to your question about why I waited so long to report:  I did not report this at that time because I was not sure who to report this to.  The local police are somewhat less than concerned and professionally responsive (At least in my past experience with former next-door neighbors who had vicious rottweilers and juvenile delinquent teenagers, on one complaint the cop told me to &quot;bake them some cookies&quot;.) about normal everyday complaints so they were not an option for me to report a UFO sighting to.Look at it from my perspective: I had never experienced anything quite this freaky and before andI don&apos;t know anyone who has, to ask for their advice.    I was trying to process what I had seen in my mind and I guess I rationalized it as some sort of experimental military aircraft as it somewhat resembled the stealth bomber only larger.  I also live within close proximity to the Salt Lake International Airport so I am aware of normal flight patterns.   Numerous aircraft, although none as large as this oneflying at the lower altitude, fly along the I-15 corridor. I am single, I have no roommates or family, and I was alone at the time this happened.  As I said, when I told some of my friends they looked at me like I was crazy and from that, I perceived that they did notbelieve what I was telling them, so probably no one else would.  I know what I saw that night.  When Iread the posting about the recent sighting of this object by a gentleman in Salt Lake I wanted to onfirmthat this thing does indeed exist.  That is what prompted me to report at this particular time. In conclusion, now I know who to report this to and am aware after looking through your site that several people have seen this object as well.  I won&apos;t hesitate if I see anything in the future as I have now bookmarked your site.  I found your website address through the article on rense.com, which I read today, September 28th.

As we were driving down the road just outside of Mercier I saw what appeared to be really bright stars in the distance.  After a few minutes I asked my husband &quot; Are those airplanes up ahead, or really bright stars?&quot;  Considering that tonight was overcast and no other stars were visible in the sky he resopnded that they were probably helicopters looking for pot fields.After about 5 minutes the two lights ahead in the sky changed posistion.  The one that was higher up, and to the right remained in the same place, but the lower one to the left began to move westward at a fast pace.  Now we were very curious as it was moving far too quickly to be a helicopter.  Our 8 year old son who was in the back seat pointed out another one to the right of our vehicle visible from the passenger side. ( the other one was still immobile in front of us)  While we were stopped at a light ( around 8 pm) the one on the passenger side slowly flew over head.  I unrolled my window and stuck my head out for a better view...what I saw gave me shivers...this was no plane or helicopter.  The object was triangular with lights at all three corners.I have seen thousand of airplane and helicopters at night, and never have I ever seen light formations such as these on an aircraft, nor have I ever seen an aircraft first be stationary in the sky then move quickly such as these.  We saw them for about 10 - 15 minutes, and there were about 5 different craft in the sky at the time...all of this same type though we only saw two of them fly directly overhead.  My husband, son and myself all saw the distinct triangle...and my husband swears he could see the sky through the center of the triangle.  This object appeared to be larger than a 747, and flying quite low for us to see it&apos;s shape so clearly.  There was not a star in the sky as it was over cast.After we crossed the Mercier bridge and passed the  Dorval airport we saw many other airplanes ...some flying directly overhead...and I did not see anything that looked like this triangular object. ( Not to our surprize as I had previously mentioned it moved like no other aircraft we had ever seen.)  Our son said it might be  a stealth bomber..which I refute due to the fact that it was much larger than the stealth...much more triangular, had lights and as far as I know Stealths do not remain stationary in the air.Surely someone else has seen these lights...when we were stopped at the lights there were many other cars around, but noone seemed to be gazing at the sky.....Once we got home my husband and myself decided to  do a little investigation on the internet, apparently there have been a few sightings in Quebec along the St. Laurence river ( one even in the exact area we were in ) most involving triangular, or chevron shaped anomalies in the sky.Is the Canadian government testing any aircraft ( at night ) that would fit this description?  Or are they as I fear ( I&apos;m a big chicken) U.F.O&apos;s? In the hopes from getting feed back from people who have seen these aircraft, or at the very least know more about U.F.O&apos;s than we do, we are posting this account on pertinent web sites, and sending it out to some local enthusiasts.", "there were 4 of them and when the last one connected  with the third one they looked just like the leader .I went to my father-inlaws to cut down a tree.

It was very bright and was traveling extremely fast.  It was at this point I stopped the van (there wasn&apos;t any traffic in my lane).  As I watched the object soar through the sky, I tried to see if it could be one of Langley&apos;s aircraft, but the object disappeared as it was traveling from NE to NW.   There was no trail that I saw behind it, it just disappeared mid air.  I was shocked.  I still can&apos;t believe Isaw it all.  This did however occur and I immediately called Langley AFB/NASA to ask if there was any type of testing or flights in the air.  They assured me there were none.

(AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico.The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara.&quot;The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly,&quot; said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara.The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said.Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show.&quot;We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early,&quot; Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets.&quot;Suddenly we&apos;re getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is,&quot; Gabel said.The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile&apos;s accuracy and reliability.((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS))", "The craft began as a white triangular shaped craft with luminescent orbs around the periphery.It then changed it&rsquo;s shape to that of an old ship.

There were other noises accompanied by the propeller sound one was a steady humming (vibrating) noise and the other was a static-electricity sound (like an electrical zapping sound) that was louder than the humming but not as loud as the propeller sound.

At its maximum the cloud was maybe ten or fifteen moon-widths across. The speed did not seem all that fast.Gradually the bright centre burned out. The phenomenon must have been very high up because it remained white throughout although the sun was well below the horizon. Also, given the height, the white mist cloud must have been really enormous. Parts of the trail became red (presumably as they sank lower) but one part was also green/turquoise.

I was awakened suddenly, startled, wide awake. At first, I lay still, trying to discern if someone had entered the house before I made any move. Then, in the doorway between the boy&apos;s room and our bedroom, (there wasn&apos;t any door), I saw a glowing white bright orangish globe floating about 4 feet above the floor. It appeared to be so hot, it was almost totally white. I opened my eyes as wide as possible, then slowly sat up. The object emitted a low hum and when I sat up, it conveyed a mental threat of electrocution to me if I moved any more. I felt it scan my children with beams that I don&apos;t think I conciously saw. Two boys were in the room it was in and it scanned my pregnant belly, then a child in another room. It seemd to convey that it discounted the child in the other room, a girl, but took note of the 2 sleeping boys and the infant in the womb, telling me that the baby was a boy. Then, it began to &apos;glow down&apos;, turning from white to bright ornage, to a faded dark orange, becoming transparent, then to gray and out. Then  got up, looked around, saw nothing, laid back in bed and almost as quick as earlier, fell asleep. I had placed a large chest of drawers between the boy&apos;s room and ours, it had a large mirror facing me. We lived in a corner house in the city then and light came through the venetian blinds and the kids claimed it bothered them.

As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets.&quot;Suddenly we&apos;re getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is,&quot; Gabel said.The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile&apos;s accuracy and reliability.((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS))", "strange contrail in the northwestern pa. sky over lake erie.i was driving east to hit the interstate 79 southbond when i saw a huge contrail in the north east sky over lake erie.it was going east at a high altitude and at arms length it was about 2 inches long and 3/8 of an inch wide.i could not see what was making this as it was going at an angle away from me.the strange thing was that the contrail had a wavy or swirling appearance to it and to see that at it being so high in the sky was a bit odd.as it moved the contrail stayed at the same length and left no trailing residue.as i pulled onto the interstate and headed south it disappeared over a range of clouds in the eastern sky.i never saw a contrail that looked like that and was wondering what would make such an odd looking one.((NUFORC Note:  Our suspicion is that the witness may have observed a rapidly dissipating contrail, which maintained its apparent length, when viewed from ground level.

I overheard a radio transmission originating from the vessel &quot;Flight&quot;, made to the U.S. Coast Guard group Moriches, Long Island, New York. The master of the sailing vessel &quot;Flight&quot;, attracted my ears to pay attention; by hailing the universal distress code &quot;Mayday&quot;. I immediately followed the channel shift to Channel 22 alpha, which is a standard Coast Guard working frequency.  The master of the sailing vessel &quot;Flight&quot;, initially established his line of work, and also the fact that he was in the company of a veteran pilot with thirty years experience. To the best of my recollection, he reported seeing a silver cigar shaped instrument, fly in from the North, heading South, at approximately an altitude of two to three thousand feet, stop, and turndue east, and propel itself out of visual range at an astonishing speed. I was listeningintently to this conversation as I often due to interesting FM radio conversations. The one thing that struck me, is that, being the sensitive individual that I am, and having monitored countless thousands if not hundred of thousands of Radio conversations over the years, I could not help but sense the fear in his voice. This certainly did startle me.  I have a wordly mind, but had never actually heard anything quite so peciuliar. If anyone would like to talk with me about this, I can be reached through this agency.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length on two occasions with this individual, and found him to be exceptionally credible.

(My home is located near a small airport, berz-macomb.) When i first saw the object i realized that it could not be a plane or a helicopter, due to the size of the light. From my view the light was as big as if i was extending my arm and looking at the tip of my pinky finger. It was a constant bright white light, with no other lights around it. After watching it proceed from left to right on my view of the sky, it suddenly changed course and dissapeared rather quickly into the horizon.", "Bright white disk, stationery for ten minutes, and then in an instant disappeared completely.I was at the San Leandro Marina and stopped walking to watch a FedEx plane land at nearby Oakland Airport.

Then in an instant disappeared.  Completely gone.  This should have been visible from the control towers at Oakland and San Francisco airports.  I don&apos;t know what it was, but it definitely was not an airplane or blimp.", "Sighting of a possible beam or tether directly connected from the ground to an aircraft at an altitude of 2,500 ft.Looking to the South from my 2nd story kitchen window, what I first observed was what appeared to be a blue/purple beam, which was wavy in shape, but completely linear in direction. This beam had the appearance of a thin streak of lightning, yet was relatively dim. It appeared to be fluorescent in nature, as opposed to lighted from any external light source. The beam was very clearly connected to the ground, approximately 1/4-mile south from my location. Upon first sighting the beam, it was angled away from me at approximately 60 degrees from the horizon, facing Southeast. Following the beam upwards, it grew dimmer with distance, becoming invisible to the eye at approximately 200-300 meters. Upon following the beams upward trajectory, I spotted an aircraft flying at approximately 2,500 ft. in a North to South trajectory, with seemingly normal exterior lights: 2 white strobe lights, with 1 steady dim red light between the 2 white strobes. The strobes were blinking together, at an interval of 2 quick strobes in rapid succession separated by 3/4 (.75) second between bursts. The strange beam appeared to be literally connected to this aircraft, although at that distance I could not confirm this due to the beam becoming too dim at that altitude. The reason I say that the beam appeared connected to the craft is this; as the aircraft passed overhead from South to North, the angle of the beam changed precisely with this movement as though it were tracking the aircraft or being emitted from the aircraft to a fixed ground location. I lost sight of the aircraft several times, but needed only to follow the path of this beam upwards to relocate the aircraft&apos;s position. The angle of the beam changed from and angle of 60 degrees facing South East, to 90 degrees straight up, to an angle of 45 degrees facing North, precisely in unison with the aircraft as though it were a tether of some sort, attached to the aircraft and fixed to the ground. The aircraft proceeded to fly in its linear trajectory to the north, until at s! uch a di stance as to be no longer visible. The beam remained pointing to the north in the direction of the aircraft&apos;s last visible position, for several minutes preceding the aircraft&apos;s departure. I observed the beam as well as the aircraft through my binoculars. At this higher magnification, the beam appeared unsolid and quite wide. The structure of the beam was wavy, similar to the structure of lightening, although its path was ultimately perfectly linear. The beam maintained a constant luminosity, and did not appear to be changing shape, despite its wavy, electricity-like appearance. The width of the beam was comparable to a toothpick held at arm&apos;s length, and was blue/purple in hue. The closest comparison I can think of to describe this beam would be a semi-transparent fluorescent tube. It was also comparable to a thin, focused beam shining through haze, although it was a clear night. I have ruled out the possibility of some sort of physical tether, i.e. kite string, for the following reasons: 1) The apparent size was far too thick - a tether seen from even as close as 1/4 mile away would be nearly invisibly thin, were it any less than 6 inches in thickness. 2) The linearity of the line was absolutely perfect - it was not sagging earthward as would be expected with any sort of tether, even under extreme tension. Yet it truly appeared to be anchored to the aircraft above, as well as the ground below. After observing the beam and aircraft for 1 minute and it became apparent that their motions were somehow unified, I awoke my wife from bed so that she could verify what I was seeing. She was easily able to see the beam, which she said appeared to her like a high-flying jet plane&apos;s vapor trail, but aiming directly into the ground at a very close distance. After the aircraft had left, and the beam had ceased movement but was still visible, I decided to leave my home to try and locate the point where it contacted the ground. As soon as I was on ground level, my vertical line of sight was too narrow and the su! rroundin g lights were too bright so that I could no longer see the beam. I quickly returned to my second floor window to verify it was still visible. It was, so I again left my home and drove in my car to approximately directly below and a bit closer to where I suspected the beam to be. The drive was approximately 1 minute. I searched the sky for an additional minute, and then returned home. I was away from home for no longer than 4 minutes. Upon returning home, the beam was no longer visible. In hindsight, I should have remained at home and kept the beam in sight. But my curiosity was too great, and the beam disappeared sometime during my 4-minute search away from home. The total duration of this sighting was approximately 8 minutes, from the moment I first observed the beam, to the moment I left my home to search for its source. At no point was any sound audible. I am an amateur astronomer and aviation enthusiast, so I am constantly observing the sky and local aircraft with a telescope and binoculars, but have never witnessed anything abnormal until now. My father is an international pilot, and we have discussed the many highly strange natural phenomena that he observes regularly during his flight paths over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Arctic. My understanding is that this phenomenon is completely unique, so I am extremely curious to learn if any other similar observances have occurred elsewhere.", "This was, an-honest-to-goodness solid object, not my imagination. Really! I wish I had had my camera.I saw a flaming torch-like light. I, at first, thought it to be an airplane on fire. It streaked accross the sky from west to east. (south east direction) It was traveling very normanl like a plane would until I saw it as close as 90 feet above my head. It looked liked a cone shaped re-entry vehicle similar to early space flight of the 1960s.When I saw it that close I saw its color change from orangeish to cold hard grey steel moving at snail pace. I thought it might be a bomb. It made no noise and no one got out. It must have crashed near the freeway by the Van Nuys postoffice on Sherman Way abd Haskell in Van Nuys, Ca.This is my experience and it is most definetely not a joke.

We took the Mattawa exit from I35 and were headed due east.  The road probably is about 3-5 miles long until it meets another paved road at an intersection.  Anyways, we were both chatting about the fair and in a relaxed state, when I noticed due east in the sky above a large brilliant bright light.  My friend assumed it was venus, but it looked so low and to big to me.  I drove straight on the same road and we stared at it for about 2 miles straight.  Then I stopped at the stop sign and was preparring to take a left as it is the route home, and just as I stopped the Circle began to move due north across the sky, it moved quicker than a plane, and was such a bright light.  It&apos;s motion was not jerky however, it moved very quickly and fluidly to our left (north) and after 5 seconds we lost site of it due to large pines in our obstructing our view.  I looked at my friend and he looked at me like did we really just see that.  I then took the turn left, and drove on the road towards Finks Berry Farm, and on the way we still couldnt see the circle until we drove about a half mile on the road to where the trees end and a large open vield is present.  I slowed down immediatley cause to our suprise the circle was suspended over the field and looked relativly closer and lower than previously.  It remained in sight for at least 5 seconds, because once again we looked at eachother in amazement, and then back at the circle.  Suddenly the brilliantly light object shut off its lights, much like a  flash light, it was light the light sucked in quickly to a focal point, and I could still faintly make out the structure as it was a very stary night.  We both talked later and agreed that after it&apos;s lights we&apos;re cut off we could still make the outline of a metallic object reflecting light from the heavens, we saw the body of the craft/or whatever it was,, for less than 5 seconds, and then it was gone.  I didn&apos;t see it move or anything, it was! like th e lights went out, but we could still make out the outline of it, and then suddenly that just disappeared.  It was the strangest thing in the world and I still am fixed on learning what the hell it was.  I havent seen any strange objects in the night sky since, and I don&apos;t know if I want too.  Me and my pal talked about here and there throughout the school year, and our conversation always consisted of man I&apos;m glad you were with, and we know what we saw and we can collaborate that it was real.  We also both agree that what we saw was not a shooting star, because it moved slower than that and it hovered..... It was so odd, I just wish I had a camera on me, but it seems like things like this happen when we&apos;re off guard.  Just some quick facts about the area where we saw the UFO.  The carlton county area is a farm area, with many cows and other barn yard animals.  It is an extremely rural area, with woods and some rolling hills, but mainly flat.  Me and my friend also realized that the point in the sky where we first caught sight of this bright light was in a due line with the road.  Interesting thing about this is that at the intersection where I stopped, the craft was roughly a quarter mile ahead of us, and before it moved it was positioned directly over a dirt road in an abandoned area.  See the road is paved in all directions at the intersection except east, or in other words right in front of us.  This is important I believe because there are cattle farms and an abundance of dear near the area.  I&apos;d like to say what we saw was an illusion, but damnit it just wasn&apos;t, I know what I saw and so does my pal, and for the rest of my life I will never forget that night.", "Chevron shaped craft flying towards north-western sky between Binghamton and Ithaca, New York.This is an update to my earlier report on the same object(s).  After speaking with my friend who was also present at the time of my sighting, she believes the date was more around 1989.  The weather was warm enough that we were not wearing jackets. We wre just leaving my parents home and were joking about the UFO reports that had been in the news lately.  When one of us looked up we were shocked to see the very thing we had just been joking about.  As stated before, the object moved from the south-eastern sky towards the north-western sky.  It was low flying, slow moving and utterly silent.  All lights were white and remained so for the duration of our sigthing.  They were led by a single light, trailed by a 4-5 other lights forming a &apos;V&apos; shape.  No apparent craft shape could be seen, only the somewhat hazy lights.  The object was below cloud level and flew directly over our heads and seemed very large.  My friends guessed about as wide as the width of a football field.  As it passed over us, it continued straight and steady on its course then the lights proceeded to go out in what appeared to be a random order.  As soon as the lights were out, we had no idea where it went.  ~ Less than 20 minutes later this same evening, my friend and her parents reported the exact same thing happening again.  She lived at the time about 3 blocks west of the original sighting.  She told me it was of the same shape, size and light patterns and moving in the same way and the same direction as the sighting we had shared.  ~ Later reports in the newpapers claimed that officials said that helicoptors or military craft was in the area at that time and that is what everyone was seeing.  Helicopters flying in formation seemed to be the primary explanations, which I don&apos;t buy for a minute.  Silent, low-flying helicopters?  I don&apos;t think so.  Huge stealth aircraft moving at a snail&apos;s pace from one military base to the next?  Maybe, but still seems a long stretch of the imagination to me.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I live on a fairly high floor of an apartment building, facing the city of Harrisburg.  I was eating dinner and looking out my bedroom window, while also talking to my sister.  A bright yellow (almost planet-looking) light appeared in front of my eyes as I glanced out the window, and then just as suddenly, disappeared.I was curious as to what happened, and told my sister to check out the sky.  We both stepped closer to the window, and on the horizon, we both saw the same type of light appear a few inches away from the one I saw initially.  There were three other lights that did essentially the same thing (blink in, stay in plain sight for approx. 5-10 sec., and then dissappear).  About 15 min or so into seeing the yellow lights, a red light appeared to the lower right of the yellow ones.  It then proceeded to split into a triangle of three identical red lights, and then all simultaneously disappear.  The red formation occurred a few times.  During the second red light formation, i called a friend who lives about two miles further down Front St. in Harrisburg, and has access to the second floor.  He was able to see a red light, from his vandtage point, at the same time I was seeing it.  While the red and yellow lights were blinking in and out, there was a white light, that streaked from right to diagonal lower left (approx. 2 inches in length).  The streak occurred in a split sec. and was the only one we witnessed.  While all of these fairly steady, planet-looking lights were appearing, and then disappearing (not streaking, or fading, or even twinkling), there were much smaller (star-like) lights which were zig-zagging across the entire visible expanse of sky.  Initially, they looked like very distant airplanes, until they started erratically bouncing up and down, back and forth, and any which way.  My sister witness these &quot;bouncing stars&quot; as well.I have a steady job, friends, and family, all of whom will concede that i&apos;m pretty down to earth.  (i&apos;ve kept two cats alive for at least a few years).  I do have a fairly liberal view of the world in general, and tend to accept a lot, but not without some proof.  I can hardly believe what I saw, but I&apos;ve witnessed almost as strange instances in the past.  The friend who I called on the evening of the 18th was the one who checked out this web site, and I felt compelled to send in this info. since other sightings in PA had been reported.  There was apparently a news report this past Sunday (the 22nd) stating that some sort of Airforce testing (flares in the sky so they could test heat-sensitive missiles) was occurring this month.  Whatever.  I &apos;ve seen flares in the sky.  They linger, and fade.  These lights DISAPPEARED!!!  I&apos;ve also seen airplanes turn course in the night sky (they don&apos;t just disappear).  Whatever these lights were, I&apos;ve never seen exactly what i saw on the night of the 18th.  I hope there are those out there who will take credence in (at least) three witnesses of a single event over a bull story from our fabulous government.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from Pennsylvania for this date.

PD))Wheatland-Douglas 1983 CattleMutilations UFO&apos;s seen.While an undergradute student at the University of Wyoming, I had a job working at the University stock farm out in West Laramie.  My co-worker and I were called into the state veterinary labe which was across the road from the stock farm.  We were sworn in as livestock brand inspectors and were told that our intructors were told reschedule any quizzes or exams becasue we could be gone for up to 3 days.  So far, everything is legitimate our supervisor tells us that if we want to quit we can quit now but we had to tell him by the next morning - the pay was excellent.  We both acepted and were given physicals again including one for whering respirator gear.  On and off we were told to go to a ranch and pick up some diseased (brucellosis most of the time or bangs) or dead cow.  Later learned the normal crews were swamped with other cases, this where it gets weird.  These other cases were cattle mutilations and in 1983, WYOMING and COLRADO had their fair share.The incident that stand out occurred in April of 1983.  The first was near Wheatland, Wy. and there we picked up cows that had the skin from the jaw peeled back or the uterus lkiterally extracted out - with out any blood!  Oddly there were no strikes from scavengers or predators, what stands out to me and scred the hell out of me on this one was that there were 5 dead cows laid out neatly, no foot prints like they were dropped.  The affected meat was grey like it was cooked and the cutting was not done by a scalpel becasue I had seen and assisted in too many operations to note that.The other time occurred near shirley basin where there used to be a uranium mine.  this was scrub brush country, the rancher had 2 bulls that were castrated.  He admitted to us that he had seen it take place a couple of days before.  There was a &quot;helicopter&quot; black in color with a spot light, his horse was getting nervous so he decided to get over to his folks place and on the way would check some pens where he moved the bulls, before got there he saw the helicopter there withe the light on a bull and literally lifting by the beam, the bull swivelled by its nose at the lightin apparatus of the &quot;helicopter&quot;, the &quot;helicopter&quot; turned into a large black heel shaped object and humming as it lifted the bull over the ridge, he heard some screams from the bulls and it came back and did the same thing on the other two bulls.  When he made it to his folks place his horse settled down.  He mentioned what he saw to his Dad aand Mom and they said look at what coming over our way and it was the big black heeled object, his dad wentto the truck and got a rifle out and took 3 shots at it!!!  The object wobbled and then sped away east.   These people were terrified, if it had not been for insurance they would have been screwed, these were prize bulls, now worthless. We had to drop them and bring them in.The last day on the job there were some US ARMY veterinarians at the lab - very hush hush you and my friend and I were debriefed (interviewed) about what we saw and heard from the rancher.  I aksed them waht was that the rancher and his folks saw and their reply was that it did not happen and that we were sworn to secrecy as livestock brand inspectors.  I got pissed off at one of them and they said they would arrest me if I did not shut up, I am by nature a very tempermental person and can turn mean quickly which is why I have no time for joking around.

We pulled over on exit 34 to get a better look and realized that the sphere had split or there were actually two together. One went west and the other went east, then began to zig zag as it turned east by south-east. After that it quickly faded from view, but not apparently from traveling too far away. Since we were right next to an interstate, we didn&apos;t hear any sounds from it.((NUFORC Note:  The object the witnesses observed was not the ISS, which passed overhead at 19:08 and 20:44 hrs. on this date.

Straight ahead of me and about 45 degrees above the horizon a spot of light appeared, streaking straight down toward the ground.  Then it flashed brightly as if it had exploded, but then continued on its dowaward path unitl it got within about 15 degrees of the horizon.  At that point it faded out and disappeared.This entire event lasted only about a second. I just happened to be looking the right way when it appeared.  The object was white in color and left a straeking trail behind it.  There were aircraft in the skies over Dallas, and this light was much brighter than the lighes of air traffic and was traveling much faster.I almost expected to next see an explosion on the horizon, but there was none.  At first I feared that might be a rogue ICBM.  (Shows you what kind of times we live in now.)  When I saw no explosion on the horizon, I decided it must have been a meteor.Thinking it must have been a huge meteor, I turned on the AM news station to see if there were any news reports of the incident.  There were none.  I thought that I would certainly read accounts in the newspaper of many people observing the object--especially since it was so brightly visible in the middle of a big city.Surely scientists must have detected such a large object entering the earth&apos;s atmosphere.  And surely earthquake sensors must have detected the impact.  But over the next few days I saw no media reports at all.It may have crashed into the earth in the next county, half a state away, or into the Gulf of Mexico.  It was not a flying saucer, but it was certainly unidentified, so that makes it a UFO.  I have looked at reports posted on this site and I&apos;m amazed that nobody else near Dallas has reported seeing this bright object.", "UFO Orb ReportTonight 9/20/2002, at approximately 7:49 PM Central time, I had stepped outside and I observed what appeared to me to be a &quot;orb&quot; type UFO that was almost directly over my house here in Elk City, Oklahoma. (100 miles west of Oklahoma City on I-40).I noticed the object was perfectly round, and it was extremely bright- almost too bright to look at directly at first. I also noted a unusual white &quot;florescence&quot; to it. On closer examination with my 10 x 50 binoculars, it appeared to have 2-3 internal lights of some kind that were clearly visible, similar to a hot air balloon would have. However, it was not a balloon. No other details were noted. It flew in a westerly direction roughly following I-40 toward Amarillo.After it flew from overhead, and at about a 45 degree angle to the horizon, it started to rapidly change colors to a yellow, then a bright red and finally to a deep blue-purple internal glow that it maintained until it disappeared.I was able to estimate the object to be at about 5,000 feet, and moving at about 25-30 miles per hour, and it was moving steadily to the west.At the time of the sighting we had a SE wind at 5-7 mph.The object was in sight until about 8:15 PM when it &quot;winked&quot; out as I was watching it through binoculars. It went from about a 80 degree overhead angle to about 20 degrees above the horizon in that time. At it&apos;s closest it was about 1/2 the size of the full moon, or about the size of your thumb at arm&apos;s length.I have eliminated weather balloons, planets, stars, aircraft and blimps as a possible explanation. I did notice Venus in the southwest sky about 10-15 degrees above the horizon. The object did not resemble Venus or a star. There were no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.", "Bright light falls from skyIt was around 9:30 pm, I took my dog outside and while I was putting him on his chain I saw what I thought to be a falling star, but it was too big and it had a big bright firetrail behind it, not like any other I had ever seen in my life. It seemed to come straight down, it was a very bright object and the trail behind it was a yellowish, orange with multi colors. It looked like it was going to hit the ground, but then it flashed , like a camera flash, and then there was nothing, no sound, no smoke , nothing. I was stunned by what I had seen. There were no reports of anything falling from the sky on the news. I still wonder what it was.", "it had yellow , orange ,and red lights in the middle .it was very fast and my friends and i saw it with binoculars((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; witness elects to remain anonymous.

It has what appears to be a removable disk, or plate, that measures six and one halve (6 1/2) inches across containing eight (8) small threaded holes and a larger threaded hole in the center.  I have never attempted to remove this part.  It has a gray metallic coating resembling a very hard Teflon like material.  Because of it&apos;s weight I assumed that it was constructed of steel, but was surprised to discover that it is not attracted to a magnet.History:  The object was found in the woods of North Alabama in the mid 1980s.  It appeared to have fallen a great distance as it was embedded in the ground (red clay) with only a small portion visible.  Soon after it&apos;s discovery, I contacted the U.S. Army at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL and gave them a description of the ball and my name, address and phone number.  I was told that someone would contact me, but never heard from anyone.  I then called NASA and gave them the same description and contact information.  Never heard from them.  I later called the Huntsville Police Bomb Squad division and was visited by two officers just minutes after calling.  After inspection they told me that it was probably secretly manufactured by the government as it had no markings of origin.  They had seen other stuff in the past including circuit boards with no markings that turned out to be such.  I asked them if they thought it could be alien.  They both had a big laugh and explained that this was impossible as it contained screws.... as if screws could only be a human invention!!  They wanted my permission to take it with them, but I decided against it as they explained that they were going to destroy it. (Their policy was to destroy any thing that they could not identify!).  Anyway, I have had this thing ever since and have never found an explanation.  Many people have seen it (I kept it on my desk as a conversation piece for years.) and have offered a few theories:  A simple weight, Time Capsule, Device used for tracking purposes, part of an aircraft and etc.  Some even believe that it may be of alien construction!((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object is not UFO-related, but we would be interested to know what the object is.  We will encourage the owner to measure the threads on the machine screws, in order to establish whether they are a metric or English thrread.  PD))((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))Dear Mr. Davenport:Thank you so much for your interest and reply.First, to answer your question... Each of the screw holes, including the center hole does not admit a view of the interior.  The center hole terminates in the plate itself, while the other eight bores through two layers.I have not attempted to remove the &quot;Door&quot; of the Sphere.  I think mostly out of paranoia of the unknown content.  Could it possibly be radioactive, or maybe booby trapped with an explosive?  This &quot;Thing&quot; has never been x-rayed or monitored for any sort of emissions.  I would rather leave this to professionals.I have noticed, though, that it appears to have a hollow space.  If you strike the side with a hard object, it responds with a &quot;ping&quot;.  Striking the side opposite the &quot;Door&quot; results in a thud.  This also leads me to believe that it&apos;s far too intricate to be a simple weight.Thanks again((END FOLLOW-UP))((FOLLOW-UP))HelloThanks again for your interest.  Please feel free to use any correspondence that may help unfold this mystery.  I am eager to learn the origin of this &quot;Thing&quot; and very curios as to it&apos;s content.I have no clue of the type of metal the sphere is made of.  I can tell you that it has no magnetic draw.  This surprised me considering it&apos;s weight.  Obviously it is not steel.  There are a few places where the coating has been scratched.  These happened over the years that it was in my possession.  It was absolutely pristine when it was discovered and sustained no damage whatsoever from it&apos;s fall from the sky.  It was found embedded in red clay (the consistency of modeling clay).  So, it had a &quot;soft&quot; landing as opposed to hitting rocks or gravel, etc.  Most of the existing scars were produced by hammer blows or other hard objects.  Once a friend actually slammed it onto his concrete drive way in attempt to crack it open.  The only result was a cracked driveway!I have not had access to any Geiger counters or x-ray devices, but I will try the Film trick.  Thanks for that bit of advise.Sincerely,((END))", "Bright non-blinking Light/Lights Hovering . scanning local Forest area .

One would hover over the trees, and then dip into the forest floor and remain there for over 10 minutes. The light is so bright that you could see it through the foilage.The other light remained over the tree tops and remained stationary for several minutes, then moved right in a straight fashion over the trees.   Then it would change direction in mid-air and move left-wards.Then it would raise upwards and shoot up fast into the Universe while the other light remained on the forest floor.

It has lots of prairie-like fields, and Wetland areas with coyote, deer and bear,herons, and other waterfowl throughout the area.I have to note that i&apos;m not confusing these lights with the planet Venus that is brighter than the other stars..

(AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico.The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara.&quot;The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly,&quot; said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara.The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said.Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show.&quot;We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early,&quot; Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets.&quot;Suddenly we&apos;re getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is,&quot; Gabel said.The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile&apos;s accuracy and reliability.((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS))", "I don&apos;t know if anyone has reported this to you or not.

(There is a high 8 ft. fence on alley and next door house; garage and back of house make up other two sides).Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement of a light.  This light was about 3-4 inches in diameter, single light, moving in a slow circle; my left to my right side.  I looked up to see if there was an airplane/ helicopter, or anything shining into the backyard.  No!  I got up from the swing, and went to the top of 4 stairs to see if anyone was focussing a mirror into the backyard, or using a blashlight, or checking me out with binoculars.  No to the top of four stairs to see if someone (from the Condos across the alley) was focussing a mirror into the backyard, or using a flashlight or checking me out with binoculars.  No! I sat back down and watched this light move around in a slow circle, about 3 feet from the swing.  I watched for about 5-10 minutes.  What caught my interest is: at the time of the day, on daylight time, this part of the yard, garage are in shade.  This light then srarted out of it&apos;s circle -- going left to right, across a wooden trellis fencing on the side of the house (3 feet high) and continuing .  Then this light deviated and started back right to left, then changing back and I was focused on it totally, as this circle stopped at 2 of my potted plants, with herbs in them, and then continuing on.  What REALLY caught my interest was when this light started out of it&apos;s circle and begin to enter the open garage side door.  The light changed tactics and moved two feet of the left of this garage door, and two (2) prominent eyes shaped like oblong spheres, stopped and looked directly at me.  During this time of my concentration and these eyes looking at me I felt a sense of uneasiness, as if those eyese were assessing me.  I later said to myself....&quot;It was like a Mexican Stand-off&quot;!  I have no idea how long these eyes focused on me!  And suddenly the eyes, the light was gone!  I will say again, that this part of the garage/yard were in complete shade.  There is a rather large tree in the corner of this backyard that shades this area.About myself.  I am 72 years old, a college graduate, and a former teacher.  I have never particularly been interested in UFO&apos;s or read much about them.  I know what I saw, and I can&apos;t explain it.

I have recently completed what is known as a class in &quot;Community Emergency Response Team&quot; which necessitated taking over a month&apos;s training in Disaster Preparedness, as one focus.  Unfortunately, after I had visited this Assistant Fire Chief, someone from that office, called my son, whose&apos;s telephone number was on his business email address.  Basically, the call was to alert my son, that I was &quot;spreading rumors about this town,and this person thought my son should know what I was doing!  The idead!  If I had listened to my son, and his bridge buddies (many of whom are former teachers in this town), I would have published that email in the local newspaper.

I looked up because the sun glinted off an airplane very very high in the sky.  Below it I noticed a very dark, but not totally black, object moving southwest slowly in a straight line. It looked small - because of the altitude, I suppose, though I had no context to determine its true size or altitude.  Holding my arm straight out and up I&apos;d say it appeared 1/4 the size of the nail on my little finger.  It was a dark rectangle, almost a cube.  It appeared to tumble slowly once in a while because sometimes I could catch a glimpse of blue sky as if it were not just a cube, but a very thick U shape.  Hm, that sounds weird.  Maybe it would be better to say that the solid shape had a bite out of the edge and I could see the blue sky through it when it presented that face to me.  It did not reflect light, it had no wings, there were no lights on it, and I couldn&apos;t hear it.  There was no trail.

Then it appeared to stop, though it could have been going due west and only appeared to stop since I was looking west by then.  Then after 15 seconds or so, it very slowly, slower than it had gone southwest, started going north, though it may have only looked like it was going so slow if it were actually going northwest.  It was slowly getting smaller.  At that point the bus came and I stopped watching. I thought it might be a weather balloon (not that I&apos;ve ever seen one) but the shape was not round and unless there were upper altitude winds blowing straight southwest, the line of travel didn&apos;t seem consistent with a balloon drifting around.

It must have been hovering at least 250 &ndash; 400 feet above; it totally obscured a huge cloud and had to be at least the size of an aircraft carrier.  It had multiple rows of lights (I would estimate 12-15 rows). The lights ranged in colors from a pale yellow all the way up to a deep dark purple.  The lights pulsed in a unique symmetrical way, yet some how it seemed to follow some sort of code.

I spotted the helicopter before I reached exits 9A and 9B, and found it to be hovering between exits 9A and 10.  I believe the town would have been Dennis, or extreme western Brewster near Underpass road.  For at least 5 minutes I could make out the helicopter hovering perfectly still in this same spot at this same altitude, and this seemed strange to me in broad daylight with little apparent reason for its presence.  However, not far down the road, perhaps just before Exit 10, on the horizon, (I was headed East on Route 6 during this whole event) I saw an oddly shaped craft that I first assumed was a fighter jet.  This wouldn&apos;t be out of the question given that one of the largest Air Force bases in the Northeast is on Cape Cod.  However, the lack of any sound, the velocity, and size of the craft did not match up for what would be a fighter plane, and since there was no airport in the immediate vicinity, its altitude seemingly ruled out the possibility that it was a plane at all.  I immediately thought back to the helicopter, and wondered if perhaps it had been observing the same thing I did because it seemed to be in an awful hurry when I first saw it in Barnstable (the town, not the county) and it was headed in the exact direct (or very near to) the spot where I saw it.  This lead me to believe that it wasn&apos;t a plane at all, and that, even if I sounded completely crazy, I should tell someone what I saw in hopes of finding some simple explaination.  I&apos;ve not contacted any authorities on the subject because I feel as though security may be so tight that no information may be had on the matter at all given the proximity! to the anniversary of 9/11.  The object I saw was moving south slowly at what must not have been much more than 300 to 500 feet above the ground, perhaps even less. It appeared to be metallic, but did not shine, which as I think about it, is rather odd given the lighting conditions (the sun was behind me shining directly on the object I witnessed)  It was a matte gray color, much like the paint job on a fighter jet (hence my original confusion) and did not have a memorable shape or profile other than being long and giving the impression that it had facets, or was possibly even a delta wing of some sort like the F-117, however this aircraft is not gray, so I knew it could not have been what I saw.  It also was not a blimp, because it was too small and moved to fast, besides being the entirely incorrect shape, and was not single-engine plane of any sort, as it was too large, and did not have any of the recognizable features that a plane of this type would possess.

Moved in a south by southwesterly direction at approximately 150kts.  Appeared to be about 1500 feet AGL.  Made no sound, though it appeared close enough to be audible if it had jet enines.  Left no contrails.  Observed maintaining straight and level course for about 5 seconds, then rolled right to a 45 degree angle which caused the downward lights to shine brighter, as they were directed more towards the observer.  After 1 second, object then rolled left back to a straight and level position.  Object never appeared to change course or altitude during this rolling activity.  Lost track of object due to distance and the horizon.  Event took place near the intersection of Highway 13 and County Road 42 in Savage, MN while facing westward, and up at about a 30 degree angle.  Background was a dark sky with a few visible stars, including Orion in the east.  Highway 13 was illuminated, but obscured by a small hill in front of the observer.  Slight glow seen over the crest of the hill from these lights, as well as the columns of light from        Lake        to the west.  Object was just west of Highway 13, but certainly east of        Lake, as it was observed passing in front of the beams of light from the casino.  Observer is a pilot and is familliar with the air traffic around Minneapolis International Airport, about 20 miles to the northeast.  This object did not conform to any recognizable aircraft lighting or flight patterns around MSP.  No navigational lighting, beacon, or landing lights were observed.  Object could not have been part of the air traffic pattern from MSP, as it was far too low.  Also, the sudden rolling activity seemed very uncharacteristic for commercial aircraft.  Lack of sound and contrails is very curious.", "UFO&apos;S in Brooklyn New York broad daylight sightingOn this approximate date me and a few co workers where noticing the clear weather and the migration of monarch butterflys when i noticed my partner looking upwards.

When I looked up towards the north sky I&apos;ve seen a multitude of shiny oval objects moving in formations. Now this was a clear day in broad daylight in a Brooklyn New York area so i was amazed. These were true UFO&apos;S  flying at an approximate hight over 25000 feet and in perfect formation. Soon others were flying into the so called formation. The entire time was around 15 to 20 minutes.

I also live ((deleted)) to someone that knew him well.There seems to be a lot of cover up and misinformation surrounding this case.My friends ((deleted)) works with Todd Sees father. ((deleted)) is related to the ((deleted)) of Todd Sees. The ((deleted)) best friend and Todd&apos;s son were part of the search party, and helped retrieve the body. They are the only eye witness (I&apos;ve found) so far as to actually viewing the body.The dogs never picked up his scent. nor found his missing clothes. &nbsp; The body was found on Monday night at 9pm. So he&apos;d been out in the heat and humidity for 39!/2 hours. He should have been swelling from body gasses at that time. But he was emaciated (as per the ufo report. This has not yet been verified).The 4 wheeler was at the top of the ridge. His body was found face down, 25 yards from his house. He was wearing only his boxers. There was a spot on his right forehead that was showing signs of decay, the rest of his body was intact. He was holding his throat (suffocating?) An allergic reaction to bee venom, could have cause his throat to close and he might have suffocated (but no bee stings found) And why call in the FBI for bee or snake bite? He had a red rag tied around his right arm and there was a dead rattlesnake beside him. They expected to find puncture wounds from a snake bite, but there were no puncture wounds any where. If he&apos;d been snake bit... there would be a good sized blackened area of necrotic tissue, surrounding the punctures. &nbsp; As far as snake bite goes; This was a strong, athletic, 38 year old male. Rattlesnake venom, would most likely NOT have killed him at all. He would have been able to find his way home in time to get to a hospital. With snake venom, he might have had some nervous system problems... disorientation, tremors etc.The report that I heard yesterday was really bogus; &quot;We think he was stung by bees, but because his body was so decayed you couldn&apos;t see welts from the stings nor find venom in his system.&quot; His body wasn&apos;t decayed.. and a toxicology report has not been filed. And if he were being stung, why would he remove his clothing? I&apos;d jump on the 4 wheeler and head down hill.There are two conflicting reports about the one shoe. UFO report says it was in a tree. The police report says beside the 4 wheeler. Why would he take off his shoe, (maybe so he could remove his bibbed cammy pants?) But if he did this, why would he leave the road? This is a very wooded area, hard to walk through. The road would lead straight home, yet he chose to take to the undergrowth and forest. There were no keys, no other clothing found.When my friends ((deleted)) asked questions of Todd&apos;s father, ((deleted)) told her that everyone was told they COULD NOT SPEAK ABOUT IT. &nbsp; ((deleted)) says his father, the wife, the son the friend (who both saw the body), are not talking and are still just &apos;stunned&apos;. I was told they&apos;re acting very strange.. no expressions, just scared and emotionless. The father did say that they don&apos;t know any more than the general public.Now... here&apos;s the worst thing; &nbsp; If he was stung by bees or snake bit... why were special agents (they say FBI) brought in? Why did they take over? Why was no one allowed near the body? AND... no one was called to identify the remains. No one, not even the wife was allowed to view the body. There was a funeral, with a closed coffin. NO ONE WAS EVERY ALLOWED TO SEE THE BODY. &nbsp; The family has said they doubt that there was a body in the coffin.As for the reports by the local farmers, and the fishermen on the Susquehanna river: Pennsylvanian&apos;s are VERY simple people. They don&apos;t like change and they live very simple lives. I haven&apos;t found any one, in the 3 years since we moved here, that has a belief in ET&apos;s, UFO&apos;s etc. They would just laugh it off if that were ever suggested.

At approximately 12:05 in the afternoon I went to the curb to take out the garbage.  I heard the sound of an airplane overhead, and I looked up to spot the airplane as I often do.  I saw the airplane travelling along the usual course that I see airliners take, but before I got back to the task of taking out the trash I spotted a strange, small bright light in the sky.  The light was about 45 degrees from the horizon in the northwest corner of the sky.  At first the light looked stationary like a star, but then I perceived it slowly moving towards me to the east.  The object moved very slowly, almost imperceptively.  As I continued to watch the object, it became clear to me that it was moving to the south.  At this point, the object seemed to start moving slightly more rapidly, but that could have just been my perception.  The object seemed very far away and appeared to reflect light much like a star or a satellite.  The object appeared to be circular to me.  About five minutes into this encounter I ran inside to get my phone and called my neighbor who was out running errands.  As I talked to him I continued to watch the object travel south at a steady pace.  Approximately ten minutes into the encounter my neighbor came home and I pointed out the object to him.  He admitted that he found it strange.  He suggested that it was a balloon, but a balloon would not reflect light like that.  Could I have perhaps seen the space station in orbit? This is not the first strange encounter I have had with unidentified objects in the sky.  Please contact me if you can provide any explanation.((NUFORC Note:  The ISS is not visible during daylight hours, under most circumstances,  and it certainly is not visible from the ground for 15 minutes.

I first spotted it in the sky southwest of us heading on an eastern path, which would have put it going from over Puget Sound towards Lake Washington, over the small cities of Shoreline and Lake Forest Park, just north of Seattle.  The moon was out that night so we compared the size of the object relative to us and it was about one fourth the size of the moon.  There were two airplanes to the south of us that appeared to change course and follow it to the east.  We saw the red &amp; white flashing lights from the planes, but never saw any flashes from the object that was quite a bit larger in the sky than the airplanes.  Just before it went out of site over the trees to the southeast of us, it just vanished, like someone turned off the power.

However the lights appeared to be disc-shaped and flat with a pale white glow to them more consistent with lights that might be built into the underside of a single craft. There were no usual red or green navigational lights or strobes at all. This group of three white lights would just fit behind my thumbnail held at arm&apos;s length or slightly larger. They seemed to slip through the air silently without reguard to their relative positioning along their lateral axis and were far off the normal flight paths of either high altitude passenger jets or of local air traffic. The spacing of the lights remained consistent throughout the viewing. I do not know if anyone else in Santa Barbara saw this.

I never liked to tell the story because people looked at me as if I were crazy. The only reason I feel compelled to write about it now is because I happened to watch the show Sightings yesterday and I saw something that made my hair stand on end! Here is my story: I was coming home from a date with my boyfriend on a spring night in 1985. It was around 9:30pm. We lived in a rural area of Ashland, Ohio and were driving down a country road to get to my house. When we first left his house, we both noticed a big orange light in the left corner of the windshield. It was much bigger than a star but smaller than the moon. We were very curious but continued to drive and observe it. We both had the distinct feeling of being watched...It did not seem to move and remained in the same spot for at least 2-3 miles. Suddenly out of nowhere, it moved just as fast as lightning..until it was directly over our car. I can tell you that there is no plane in this world that can move as quickly as this object did. At this point, my boyfriend decided to stop the car to see it more closely..we stopped on top of a hill and this object was right over the car...It came down slowly and the lights consumed our whole car, the neighboring fields and the road...It was probably the size of half a football field. It was shaped like a triangle and had lights at each corner. It also had a light coming down from the center of the bottom of the craft. We stood there frozen on the road for what seems like an eternity as this thing just hovered over us. There was absolutely no sound or wind whatsoever. Then, just as quickly as it appeared, it shot straight up into the clouds. All you could see where lights disappearing in the clouds.This is my story and I am finally glad to get it off my chest. I am not crazy and I know what I saw. There is no mistaking something that is no farther than the top of a rooftop.

The light climbed into the atmosphere and the jet continued to trail, with both shortly leaving sight.  I went back outside at fifteen minutes later and noticed two small objects in the vicinity of the starting point of our initial sighting.  They seemed to hover a small distance away from each other, and slowly floated upwords.  The first one climbed to high to be visible.  At that time the lower one stopped, seemed to float back down at a 180 degree direction, the headed back towards where the first one disappeared.I began a group called the Northern New York Paranormal Research Society.  I have been investigating many occurences like this, and this was the oddest I have seen.  I have not been able to contact any Air Force bases, or Fort Drum, which is in the direction that we witnessed the objects.", "Bright stationary object momentarily visible in late daytime sky behind drifting cirrus cloud in otherwise clear sky.While out mountain biking in Morgan Territory my friend and I, both avid sky watchers noticed a small bright object at 45 degrees above the horizon (near celestial equator), due south by southwest from the top of Morgan Territory Road.  The sun hadn&apos;t set and there was ample daylight.  The light was perfectly motionless and appeared brighter than any normal celestial object (including Venus).  It was not Venus or a satellite.  It was as bright or brighter than Venus at it crescent phase.  We didn&apos;t have binoculars but after 3 minutes or so, it faded and was lost.  Sitting and using a branch as a reference point, no discernable motion was evident.  It was first noticed visible through a cloud (cirrus) and would have never been seen except for the momentary interest of the cloud.  The cloud moved east, but the object didn&apos;t.   We were certain it was celestial until it disappeared.  I&apos;ve found no record of any similar object in any of my web searches and I am a amateur astronomer familiar with most bad identifications of &quot;possible UFOs&quot;.  It was clearly not a planet or any routine aerial phenomenon.  It was not a geosynchronous satellite flare because it was too bright - these are reported but never as daylight objects - these are night sky telescope objects.  It wasn&apos;t an Iridium flare because it was stationary.  I&apos;ve seen those and the international space station in orbit.  It seems it could be include possible a very high altitude balloon (but seems that it would have remained visible or would have drifted), or it could be a bright, but previously unknown celestial event (such as a nova) but much shorter lived (gamma ray burst?), or ... some other unknown aerial phenomenon.  It would have been unlikely for a casual observer to notice it because of the relative brightness of the sky and small angular extent.  It wasn&apos;t until I gave a very explicit set of location information (relative to the cloud shape which attracted my attention) that my companion even could see it.  His observations were consistent ! with min e.", "if was as if the stars were flying across the skylooking into the sky this evening, i thought i&apos;d spotted a satelite(which is very common) when i spotted another couple following it, i called to my mother, who is visiting, by the time she came out (1 minute) the sky was filled with at least 200 flying objects, that looked like the whole sky was on the move, heading westward they looked like stars flying across the sky, all the lights varied in brightness i guarantee this was an overwhelming experience, but i dont Know who to contact", "Two unknown daylight lights observed high above DenverWhile picking up mail at a downtown Denver post office I glanced up and saw two bright white oval lights high in the sky above Denver.  They were slightly to the west, about 5 to 7 degrees to the west and slightly south of the east-west axis of nearby Colfax Avenue.At first I thought they were planes but were not moving as planes would, almost stationary. I pointed out the high unknowns to a postal worker and two other regulars who pick up mail at the p.o. back door. Over the next few minutes we were busy receiving mail and kibitzing, but periodially looked up at the unknowns. One observer thought they were balloons.  Their height was undetermined but some observers saw a plane in the vicinity (no contrail) which seemed to disappear as it apparently lost an angle for reflecting its image from the sun in the east.Over the next few minutes the lights seemed to move closer together and more easterly (closer to being directly overhead, but still a few degrees to the west). At about 9:08 a.m. when we looked up one of the lights had disappeared and other was a few degrees more to the south. When we looked up around 9:10 a.m. the second bright circular light had disappeared.The FAA in Washington was contacted about 1 p.m. by me and I was referred to the Denver FAA office. The &quot;watch officer&quot; I was referred to said no one else had reported anything unusual ove Denver air space.  He was unaware of any balloon launches. (I had earlier contacted someone I know at the Weather Service and they said their balloons are launched hours earlier and expressed doubt the objects observed were theirs). The Weather Service said if their balloons &quot;pop&quot; the instruments descend by parachute.  No parachutes were observed after the bright lights dsappeared.The NUFORC was contacted (which the Washington FAA office had suggested as a second contact number) and I was asked if I knew of wind direction and force aloft over Denver at 0900 It was suggested the Denver FAA office would have that info.  I contacted the Denver FAA office a second time to try and obtain this information as it wuld help determine if the unknows were balloons - but my second transfer to the watch officer was answered by automatic voice mail. So I referred to my earlier call, apologized if I was being a nuisance, and asked for wind directions and force for three elevations above ground level and left my work number. As of 18:30 MST my call had not been returned.  (I now know more about what to ask for when initially contacting the FAA).This  sighting could have been the launch of two balloons by unknown researchers but until wind conditions are determined this sighting will be inconclusive.", "Elongated pyramid-shaped ufo seen flying in the country.The elongated pyramid-shaped craft was flying from north to south, approximately one half mile away.

At first I thought it was a train (there is a track approximately 1/4 mile from my house). After about thirty seconds it became clear that it was a helicopter. I thought at the time that it was quite strange for two reasons: first, I don&apos;t remember seeing any helicopters at the lake before, and two, it was dark.A friend and I ran down my steps and into the clearing near the water. We then saw that there were two helicopters flying very low and fairly fast. There was enough ambient light that we could clearly see the silhouettes of the helicopters. It was several seconds before I noticed that they appeared to be chasing two &quot;points of light&quot; that were traveling equally as low and fast, staying about 750 feet in front of the helicopters. They were moving independent of each other and the helicopters, but there was no &quot;silhouette&quot; of any kind associated with the two objects that I would estimate as being 3-5 feet in diameter.My friend works as a project engineer for a contractor.

There were lights that were headed in one direction and turned on a dime and headed in the opposite direction. I personally witnessed not one, but TWO objects that were moving so fast they appeared to be meteors (shooting stars)...that is how fast they moved. I couldn&apos;t possible describe them as they were just a blur. Military jets came out for the occasion and circled the area. I certainly can&apos;t state whether they were part of this anomoly or checking it all out. They normally fly over during maneuvers, but not at night. There was one jet that flew a complete 360 and then a second. It was incredibly busy out here tonight and oh so strange. I would love to get this on video, but don&apos;t know what to use to capture this activity so that it is visible. I might add you CAN hear the planes.....there were a couple over the 30 min period that WERE planes and then the military jets. But I would say there were thirty to fifty objects that made no sound, made no sense as far as movement and of course the strobing lights. I just can&apos;t imagine that one would see thirty to fifty planes in the air within a thirty to forty five minute period. Curious.Just FYI and for the record.

Object seen straight overhead -followed to horizon.  6:14pm ArkansasMy wife and I arrived home from work between 6:11 and 6:14 PM (Central) I looked into the sky straight up and slightly northeast. I saw a commercial air plane flying East at high altitude. The plane was leaving a dissapating contrail.I saw a very white object that I first thought was a lone white crane (bird). I thought it was this type of bird because it was so white. The sun was obviously upon it. At first sight it also seemed to be &apos;flapping&apos;.I have to rule out this object as a bird. Due to several reasons:  1. The &apos;flapping&apos; was very irregular. 2. The &apos;bird&apos; reached the far horizon in 60 seconds. 3. It was still visible through the haze of the horizon, towards the sun. (No bird could reflect that much light.) 3. The speed it reached the horizon combined with its altitude. 4. Odd pattern of flight.I rule out an aircraft. 1. No contrail.  2. Obviously different when compared to the airliner we saw at the same moment in the sky. 3. Path of flight was SE with several fairly rapid curves more easterly then more southerly then back to the SE. 4. The speed of the object.  5. The apparent &apos;flapping&apos; which now can only be described as &apos;shape changing&apos; as it went into the horizon.I rule out a satelite in orbit, or the space station, or space shuttle.  1.  The sky was still blue and the sun shining. Only something the size of the current space station could have reflected so much light.   2. The path of flight was not a staight line.  3. The space shuttles have been grounded for months.Across the street from me two spanish speaking gentlemen also witnessed the object.

The small lights roughly the size of a small magnitude star were bouncing around on the horizon.  Shortly thereafter we observed 5 bright lights flying over us in a V-Shape.  They were identical to that of the Phoenix lights which were videotaped in March of 1997.  The V-Shape lights flew from the southeast to the northwest towards Las Vegas.

We were in Central Park in NYC and I was laying down in the shade looking straight up in to the sky. I noticed one object that looked to be circular and white, I thought it was a satellite or maybe a planet. I didn&apos;t think much of it until I noticed that it had not moved for several minutes. I pointed the object out to my friend and asked if it could have been the planet Venus since sometimes you can see it during the day and it obviously was not a satellite since it had not moved. As we were both discussing it we noticed that it had started to move. Then my friend pointed out another one in a different part of the sky. As we looked around we started to see more and more. We watched as the slowly moved in different directions and at one point three of the objects formed in a shape of a triangle (probably several miles apart) and then slowly moved back into a straight line and then went in completely different directions. The most interesting event was when one of the objects looked as though it completely changed form and turned from a sphere into a longer thinner object. This object moved at a high rate of speed across the sky in a movement that  could most closely be described as  &quot;sperm-like.&quot;  Due to it&apos;s speed, this object was only seen for about 45 seconds before it moved out of sight.

Acceleration and deceleration of craft was great.I was on holiday in Egypt, at the top of Mt Sinai, viewing the sunrise. In the twilight before sunrise I noticed a single, fairly dim white light, which initially appeared to be a star, in the direction of the sunrise position. The light then began moving left to right to left in a mainly horizontal plane. The movement seemed quite random, i.e. the object did not appear to be travelling toward any particular destination. As an example of the motion observed; the craft would sometimes move to the right, stop, then continue moving to the right. Other times it would move to the right, stop, then begin moving to the left.The speed of the craft varied, from a slow drift, to a speed so great that it is difficult to explain how this speed was achieved. The craft accelerated extremely rapidly, from an apparent standstill. The craft also decelerated to a stop almost instantaneously, even after it had just accelerated to a great speed. This rapid motion was all in a horizontal direction.This went on for 20 mins or more. All the while, the craft was very gradually drifting higher in to the sky and to the right. This was happening at the same time as the sun came closer to rising and the twilight became brighter.When the sun rose, the craft seemed to disappear by fading away. I am not sure if this was caused by the brightness of the sun washing out the light from the craft, or if the craft was in fact moving further away.I estimate the craft was 10-20km away, and at least 10,000ft altitude. I take these estimates from the fact that the craft occasionally disappeared behind clouds.

I mistook it for the planet Venus. It seemed that the light was shining through clouds or fog. The brilliant light faded but a cone of light remained looking exactly like the sky does when the full Moon is about to rise. In fact, for a moment I thought the cone of light which radiated about 10 degrees above the horizon was the full Moon. Naturally the near full Moon was rising directly behind me in the East about 10 degrees above the eastern horizon. Also about 15 degrees due south on the horizon the planet Venus shown like a beacon. The light I saw and the resulting cone or mountain shaped light was not the Moon or Venus. I wonder if it was a rocket launch or something... the light remained in the western sky for 10 minutes before I left the scene where I had parked my car to observe this highly unusual light.

I was just enjoying the beauty of the sky and clouds when I noticed off in the horizon a silver oval, barely visable, but flying at the same speed as our plane. I leaned closer to the window across my husbands lap to get a better view. I told him to look but he could not see anything. I kept trying to point it out. He accused me of making a scene. I watched and wondered if I was seeing a UFO. I sat back and thought about it, and when I leaned over to look again I noticed another aircraft flying towards the silver oval. This other aircraft looked like it was painted in military camouflage. I tried to tell my husband again, but he was scorning the idea. The clouds began to cover my view so I could not see anymore.What makes this odd to me is this....Earlier this year I had a dream that I was chasing some sort of aliens that were jumping and swimming along the coast. I was running along the beach with a flashlight trying to get a better look at them. I never did catch up to them.After seeing the UFO I went camping with family on the beach 2 weeks later. I heard something out in the water with headlights. I grabbed a flashlight and it was deja`vu. I was running along the beach with a flashlight chasing something that was in the water.

We were in what is called the Croom section of the Withlacoochie National Forest, and all three of us are university instructors. We were lying on lawn chairs around a campfire and I looked up to see what appeared to be a huge (football-field sized, perhaps) chevron-shaped formation of red lights. The other two witnesses didn&apos;t seem concerned, but did remark, as I did, that it was &quot;odd.&quot;  It was either one very large object or 7-8 small ones, but my best guess is one large, black or dark gray object moving very slowly overhead, absolutely silently.  The red lights were around the periphery, from a point at the front and widening toward the back. One witness suggested helicopters, but I pointed out that I didn&apos;t think they&apos;d be flying in formation with no lights but a single red one, at night, over the forest. The object(s) moved slowly (I don&apos;t know which direction--we were in the woods, at night) and disappeared.  It took probably 15-20 minutes. The next morning, one of the witnesses (my husband) and I went out birdwatching; I left him to finish by himself (too many blackflies) and he disappeared. That is, it took numerous searchers on horseback, rangers in trucks, a helicopter, and--finally--a tracking dog to find him at about 21:00 hours that night. He said he took a nap in the woods, and was slightly disoriented and dehydrated when checked in the ambulance afterward. He still won&apos;t discuss what happened to him that day, although he appears to have suffered no obvious aftereffects. My own interest in UFOs goes back to my childhood. The third witness has since moved to a different town and we&apos;ve never talked about this.((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE))Dear Mrs.((deleted)), Thank you very much for the most interesting report!!  I do not know what it was you witnessed that night, but I agree with your assessment that it almost certainly could not have been a conventional aircraft. Is there any possibility that you could reconstruct the precise date of the sighting?  For example, do you have a record in a bird-watching diary, fuel receipts, or something along those lines, that would permit you to establish an unambiguous date for the event??  Is there any possibility that the sighting could have occurred in March 1994? Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport((RESPONSE))Hello--I can get an exact date, but it might take a few days.  We went with a large group of &quot;horse people&quot; (the campgrounds are primarily used for horseback groups) and one is still a friend of mine.  I&apos;ll track her down and ask her, but it definitely was April.  There was a short mention in the local news about &quot;local man missing in forest,&quot; that sort of thing, and really, by missing I mean gone.  What I forgot to mention in my first message was that when they found him he was 25 miles away.  Oh, and it&apos;s &quot;Croom,&quot; not&quot;Groom.&quot;I&apos;ll start tracking down the date for you.  Thanks for the respons--and feel free to get in touch if you need to.  I can probably volunteer some time, as well, to your organization.

I&apos;ll be in touch.((FOLLOW-UP))I&apos;m afraid no one else will be filing any reports on this one.  The woman in question doesn&apos;t know what we saw that night--she was at a different part of the camping area and has never mentioned anything &quot;odd&quot; about that night to me.  My husband is an entirely different story. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to find that he has a history of such experiences (we&apos;ve been married 13 years and I&apos;m 50), but he&apos;s very much in denial, both about his personal experience and the experiences of others. &quot;Skeptic&quot; is an understatement.So, no--no investigators or counsellors for him.  Hard to tell what he recalls of that day (and night), because, although we&apos;ve made reference to &quot;the time you got lost in the woods,&quot; that&apos;s as far as it goes; he simply won&apos;t explore it, and I don&apos;t push it.  I&apos;ll just add that my ex-husband and I had a number of incidents before we divorced, and it does seem to run in my family.

There were bright orange, very luminous but the source of light could not be seen, the were rectangular, almost square with rounded corners. They each had a small flame in the back. They were large and were flying at a relatively low altitude about 1000 ft I would say.They were quiet (no sound), flew from one horizon to another in less than 2 minutes.There were flying all at the same constant speed, in a very organized way. They were flying in rows of 5 or 6 and basically were forming a matrix like unit. There must have been 3 or 4 dozens of them, may be more. They were hard to count because of their constant change of position of the trailing fleet elements to the front of the fleet.The most striking thing was that some of the ships in the last row would come out of the fleet perpendicular to the fleet, still moving at the same pace as the fleet, move forward with amazing acceleration, and get ahead of the pack sideways inward  to form an element of a newly formed first row. Basically the trajectory was linear and never did it curve, but rather changed directions at right angle! The next few, I kept observing the sky and there was a lot of activities. One time I saw bright spots moving in the daytime sky.

I saw a flash or light that appeared to be at a very high altitude. The light would flash rather brightly every 1-2 seconds, as the object moved across the sky at a very high rate of speed. The object flew in a straight path with no unnusual maneuvers. What really got my attention was the intensity of the light flashing, and the high rate of speed of the object. I am a licensed commercial pilot, and I am familiar with the flight characteristics of both civilian and military aircraft, and I am not familiar with any aircraft that can travel at that rate of speed. The flash of light was different than the high intensity strobes you see on aircraft. It was more like a yellowish/red pulse. The object was not visable between flashes, but it was amazing the distance that the object traveled between flashes. The object traveled from the west to the east, and the trees finally obscured my vision.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Thank you for your interest. The object (light) was moving from the West to the East. The object appeared to travel in a straight path. The speed of this object makes me doubt that it was a satellite, or other debris in orbit.

I was shocked to see it reappear much further away from where I had originally seen it.I have had two other unusual sightings in the past, so I am kind of keep an eye out for unusual activities in the sky. One of the sightings was in the 1980s when I used to fly a considerable amount. We were flying a Piper Navajo to Key west late in the afternoon and we witnessed an unknown craft of rather large proportions at 10000 feet. It was partially obscured by the clouds but seemed to be stationary. It was definitely not a Lenticular cloud. The sighting was very brief. The other sighting that I had was in 1997. I was traveling on Hwy 278 Near Savannah River Site in South Carolina when I saw a glowing object maneuver at low altitude at a slow steady speed, and abruptly shoot straight up into the sky. Again the sighting was very brief.  This about sums it up. Thank you for your attention.

It happened within a year of the summer of 1990.  Event occurred mid-afternoon on a bright, clear summer day over the city of Victoria, B.C., Canada.  I was in a backyard, in the city, looked up and noticed, flying directly overhead, apparently very high up, an object.  It flew right over the city.  It was roughly football-shaped.  Both ends were the same, and more rounded than a football.Its shape was approximately a marriage between a football and a watermelon.  Oblong.  It looked sort of like a pod.  Very symetrical.It had smooth, distinct, well-defined boundaries.  Definitely an object - a craft - and obviously artificial.  And it definitely had no wings.Its surface appearance was a light...dull...silvery...metallic.  But...  I dunno.  The surface seemed to my eyes somehow...a bit odd.  Not blurry.It was quite clear and distinct.  And yet...I couldn&apos;t seem to see the surface of it clearly.  So it confused me some.  I wondered: what was I seeing? The object was flying too high to make out any surface detail.  It appeared to be featureless.  I saw absolutely no evidence of any wings, nor windows, nor anything that would have allowed me to know that it was some sort of aircraft.It was utterly unlike any aircraft I had ever seen, or ever have seen.  And it was *really* moving.  In fact, it startled me, how fast it appeared to be flying.I said, to two other people who were with me, &quot;What is that?&quot;  I pointed up at it.  They both looked up, and they both also saw the object.One of my friends suggested that it was a &quot;cruise missile&quot;.  (Like he could immediately see for himself that it was not an airplane or a jet.) (Some cruise missile testing has been conducted in Canada, but I doubt that any such tests have occurred over Vancouver Island.) I said no, cruise missiles are long, like cigars.  That is definitely *not* a cruise missile.  It looked to be totally the wrong shape, and far too large to be a missile, and it was also flying way too high, and travelling too fast.  Usually cruise missiles travel close to the ground.  The object I saw was at very high altitude.Several things about that object have left a lasting impression.(1) It appeared to be flying very high.  I would estimate that its altitude was likely several kilometers.(2) It appeared to be *big*.  I guessed that it was probably approximately the size of a small house.  I got the impression from observing it that its body was much larger than the body of any aircraft I&apos;d ever seen.  I&apos;ve been around Hercules transport, and even flown on one.They are quite large aircraft.  So I konw their size.  The body on this thing looked to be a lot fatter than a Herc&apos;s.  This is guessing, as you can understand, because I was seeing this thing from a considerable distance.  But right above me, on a clear day.  Its size would naturally depend on its distance.  But what my brain was telling me was: it was big, and very high up.(3) It was also really moving.  I guessed that it was probably travelling at approximately Mach 2.  It was in sight for only about 15 seconds.In that time it travelled all the way overhead.  It was just racing across the sky, at several degrees of angular travel, per second.It was definitely *not* a meteorite.  No glow, and it looked definitely *constructed*.  I could see it very clearly.I saw first it when it was almost directly overhead.  I was just stretching or something, looked up, and bingo.  I&apos;d say it was moving at about 5 degrees of arc per second.  Fast.If the object I saw was at high altitude - several kilometers up - and it did appear to be, very high up, that means that it was going pretty fast.Probably supersonic.(4) It was totally silent.  That struck as me as strange.  I was listening intently for some engine sound, or possibly even a sonic boom.Because I thought it was probably flying faster than the speed of sound.  So I naturally expected to hear something, maybe even a boom.But I heard: *nothing*.  Just silence.  It didn&apos;t make a sound.  I heard from it not even the faintest whisper of an engine.  Just silence.So I thought: whoa.  That is pretty weird.  Why can&apos;t I hear that thing? And I was really pondering then.  There&apos;s this...high performance craft of some sort, flying high up, probably at close to Mach 2, yet it is *silent*.And I wondered, how can any aircraft move that fast, apparently supersonically, yet make *no* sound? I kept listening.  I heard no engine sound; no boom, no anything.  It just seemed so strange.But it also *looked* weird.  Like a football.  Something with no wings.  Flying.(5) And no contrail.  No hint of any conventional engine.  It was flying along like it was propelled by magic.For those several reasons - its apparent size (big), its shape (weird, round, no wings), it&apos;s apparent altitude (very high up), its apparent velocity (fast), but especially its acoustic stealth...it all kind of spooked me.  I thought: wow, whatever that is, it&apos;s *really* different.  If it&apos;s some sort of experimental aircraft, some new kind of jet, that a human pilot is flying, then it must have a pretty wickedly *different* engine in it.  Powerful, for one thing.Because it seemed to be really travelling overhead, and effortlessly.  I&apos;d gues that even the most advanced scram(?) engines that are capable of pushing an aircraft that fast, or faster (even to Mach 5), must make a lot of *noise*, yes? I kept wondering, as I stared at it, what kind of airplane looks like a football, has no wings and is *silent*?  I just kept staring up at it in awe.Now, bear in mind, I am a skeptic.  I think a lot of the reports are due to either intoxication or imagination or are just bull.  But my report is sincere.I have attended university and I have worked in a scientific field.  (Earth physics.)  I have studied science.  (Physics.)  I&apos;m a very logical person.  I do not believe easily.  I always want *evidence* before I believe something.  But on that sunny summer day...I figure that I got some evidence, with my own eyes.  Enough.  I saw something really strange in the sky.  Enough to warrant a report, I think.To this day I have a lot of difficulty believing that what I saw that summer day, about 12 years ago, flying high overhead, was designed and built by humans.  Because every time I&apos;ve seen an aircraft flying overhead - even if it&apos;s flying at 35,000 feet - I can always *hear* something.Always.  I used to listen to jets flying over the North Pole, way up.  Intercontinental jets on their way from South Korea to Europe, or the other way, over the pole.  (We were on their flight path.  I was posted at a weather station up there for a while.)  And I could always hear the jets flying over, no matter how high they were.  Even when one was just a tiny dot in the sky.  Even then.  Always.  And I could always see wings on it.  Moreover, I could always see their contrails.  Hot gases condense, cool, and form clouds behind the jets, when they&apos;re high up.  Hot gas plus cold air leave a trail.  But this thing left no trail.  Apparently very high up, in the atmosphere, yet no sound from it, and no trail.  No wings.  An absolutely quiet football, passing quickly right overhead.  It was rather spooky, in fact.And perhaps more importantly, the many jets I&apos;ve seen fly overheard - at approximately, apparently, the same altitude - were not moving nearly as fast as the thing I saw that day appeared to be moving.  Jets travelling at around 35,000 feet and at roughly 3/4 the speed of sound move across the sky rather slowly.  They just kind of creep along.  They move at maybe one degree or so of arc per second.  Ballpark.So it takes them about a full minute from the time you can first see them until they are out of sight.  So call that 180 degrees, from horizon to horizon.  Divide that by 60 seconds, that is roughly 3 degrees of arc per second, give or take.The object I saw that day covered about 90 degrees in only about 15 seconds.  That&apos;s roughly 6 degrees per second, or twice as fast.If it was indeed flying at the very high altitude that I thought it was flying, that means that it was travelling at something like 1200 or 1400 miles per hour, or almost Mach 2.  Almost certainly faster than the speed of sound.  Should be a shock wave from that.  So logic told me, that thing should create a sonic *boom*.  I knew it had a powerful engine, pushing it - it had to be, to go that fast - so I should hear some sort of sonic bang.  And if was flying at a *lower* altitude than I thought it is, then it should definitely be able to hear its engine.But what did I hear?  I heard nothing.  I heard absolutely *nothing* from it.  Not a blessed sound.So I was getting kind of weirded out about this, you know.  I was trying to make all the pieces fit, logically, in my mind, and they just wouldn&apos;t fit.I had no way to objectively know that object&apos;s true size or altitude or speed.  And I realize that they all factor together.  If I was wrong about its altitude, then I&apos;d be wrong about its speed, and also about its size.  But I saw it very distinctly, quite clearly, for a good many seconds, and I was studying it.  I think my gut instincts are pretty good.  My hearing is pretty good, too.  I did not hear a whisper from that thing.Not a whisper.  Just silence.Then after it was gone, I began to reason it out.  (Or tried to.)  OK.  I just saw something that had no wings.  Definitely no wirngs.  Yet...it was flying.OK.  That&apos;s pretty weird but...a high performance jet that has no wings....  Hey, they make them every day.  In fact, there are some craft we&apos;ve built that have hardly any wings.  (For example, the space shuttle has hardly any wings.)  This thing that I saw - I am sure - had no wings at all.None.  A flying football.  But also....  No engine sound.  Ergo, no engine, either.  And to me, that&apos;s altogether another matter.  No wings is one thing.No engine is...whoa.  Over the line.And that is why, despite my healthy skepticism, I have some *doubt* that humans built the thing with no wings that I saw that day, high up in the sky, and moving very fast.  It bothers me.  I still can&apos;t make all the pieces.  Unless we didn&apos;t build it.  Then...everything fits.Years later I read and heard about an object that apparently flew right *under* (and close to) a British passenger airliner, as it was crossing the Atlantic Ocean.  At some considerable risk to his career, that pilot bravely (and officially) reported a UFO that I believe was of similar size and shape, to my object.  I believe he reported something that was shaped approximately like a watermelon, or a football, i.e. round? And *big*.  Bigger than his airliner.  And he said it was also travelling a lot faster.  He estimated it was moving at least twice as fast as him.It just whizzed by him.  Now that would mean that it was moving faster than the speed of sound.  He was going maybe 500 or 600 mph, so it was going roughly 1,000 or 1,200 mph.  Maybe even 1400 mph.  He said it passed right under him! So he expected to feel some turbulence from it, but in their statements, he and his co-pilot both said that they felt *nothing*.  Not even a bump.They also reported that they heard *nothing*.  That the object that passed by them was silent.Now, I believe that pilot indeed saw what he claimed that he saw.  After what I saw, I believe him.  And it&apos;s occurred to me that that sighting (a fairly respectable sighting) - by two professional airline pilots (who had a lot to lose by reporting what they saw) - matches up reasonably well with what I saw with my own eyes, from a distance of several kilometers, about 12 years ago.In both cases, it was something *big*.  It was round, and fast, and silent.  I think *I* have seen that one, too.  Maybe I saw the same craft, or type of craft, as they saw.  There is bound to be some overlap in the appearance reported, if they are real.  If at least one is real.Whatever it is, I know - for pretty sure - that it&apos;s something approximately as big as a house, and it can move very fast - definitely supersonically - and yet it evidently does not disturb the atmosphere around it, and therefore it makes no sound.  Somehow, it just slices through the air without creating any turbulence or wake or chaotic vortex behind it.  It can move faster than sound, without creating a sonic boom.  Its propulsion system Is, I can verify, dead silent.  Now...you tell me, please, what sort of aircraft we (humans) have built that could possibly fit that description.Because I&apos;m not aware of any.  And I suspect that not even the U.S. military are aware of any.  Unless they do know, about those things, and they&apos;re keeping their mouths shut.  Maybe to keep our sensitive brains from overloading.  :) I suspect that it will be a very long time before *we* know how to build something like what I saw.  Whatever it was, it just kissed the sky, a nice silent kiss.  I would call it the ultimate in graceful flying machine.  Thinking back now, on what I observed, during those few seconds...I&apos;d have to say that it was not only impressive, but beautiful.  Somehow...elegant.  Such a remarkable craft!  To fly without any wings!  Wow! If you ever saw it, I know it would be enough to make your jaw drop, when you witnessed it for yourself, zipping along, lickety-split, and passing quickly overhead, silently, like God throwing a silver football.  You don&apos;t hear a thing.  That&apos;s pretty neat.I suppose the whole subject of UFOs alarms some people.  But if I may speak to the issue of fear.  Personally I regard it as unwarranted.  Or at the very least, as unhelpful.  It can only cloud our thinking on the issue.  Of whether or not some extraterrestrial intelligence does indeed exist in the proximity of the Earth.  I don&apos;t know if it does.  It may.They don&apos;t scare me.  I never felt scared, or alarmed.  Instead, I felt...awe.  I remember feeling just very impressed.  And I still feel that way, all these years later.  As the amusing Pat Paulsen once said, there is nothing to fear, except fear itself.  And of course, the bogeyman!  :) I figure that if &quot;they&quot; are up there, cruising around, as though our atmosphere is their playground and race track, they are probably not bugs, or critters, like us.  They are probably not green, or grey.  They are probably not even alive, in the same sense that we use that term.My own personal speculation (if I may be allowed that here) is that the pilot onboard that quite incredible craft I saw (if not human, and if that craft was not of human design) was probably the equivalent of a very advanced robot.  Maybe I saw a probe.  Something...probably self-repairing, highly intelligent, and autonomous.Perhaps - I merely speculate here, because I *doubt* that we made the thing I saw - the pilot and the craft were one and the same.  Maybe I saw one of the same sorts of things that weve sent out, to explore other planets.  Unmanned.  Yet still capable of doing a lot.  But a *lot* more sophisticated, and a lot more capable.  Maybe - just maybe - *one* of their probes, centuries or even thousands or perhaps even millions of years ago, found a planet with bugs on it.  So it set about building more probes, using materials it found here, and now they are *all* busy studying us.  :) I don&apos;t know.  I&apos;m just throwing that out as the most &quot;reasonable&quot; explanation, as I see it, if there *is* (indeed) something of an extraterrestrial nature in or around our atmosphere, and present there fairly often.  There certainly do seem to be a lot of sightings, including a large percentage that some from very reasonable and responsible people, who have no interest in hoaxing anyone.If you don&apos;t believe me, fine.  But I *know* what I saw.As I see, &quot;machine&quot; intelligence (only) would get around the long flight time problem.  Let&apos;s suppose that matter indeed *cannot* travel faster than light, so even their fastest spacecraft travel at &quot;less than&quot;.  A robot probably wouldn&apos;t care how many centuries it took to reach another star.Even if it took 10,000 years for it to get from there to here, so what?  A well-designed, very advanced, sophisticated, intelligent, self-repairing probe could still be in perfect working order after many centuries, or even thousands of years.  In fact, in theory, even a million years could pass, and it could still be fully functional.  That would violate none of the laws of physics.I&apos;m not a UFO nut, at all.  I actually have not a great amount of interest in it, because I think hard evidence will be very difficult to come by.Basically if they&apos;re up there, I figure they&apos;re too smart and too fast for us.  So doubtful we&apos;ll ever be able to capture one, or even real close to one.But from all that I&apos;ve read, and seen, of video clips of sightings - and there are now quite a number (including at least one video of things flitting around in space near rocket launches, caught on film)....I&apos;d humbly suggest to everyone that the behavior of those apparently ET vehicles that many have seen (maybe myself included) is probably best described (and understood) as the behavior of quite logical and advanced *machines*, rather than the behavior of living creatures.They do not seem to much care what we think, do they?  To my mind, that says: machines.  Smart, analytical, but otherwise mostly devoid of sentiment.In any event, if they *are* here (and I am not suggesting they are, because I don&apos;t know what I saw), they may &quot;just&quot; be doing science.  Studying.Collecting data.  Curiosity is a trait we should easily understand.  We - as a species - are very curious ourselves.  We are already exploring other planets, too.  I&apos;m sure that if those craft are real, and alien in origin, and are piloted by &quot;machines&quot; (as I suggest), then those machine are still many times smarter than humans.That is a logical assumption too, I think, because suppose they started exploring space &quot;just&quot; 100,000 years ago.  In less than a hundred years, from now - and maybe in only a few decades - *we* will have machines that are much smarter than us.  So...truly advanced (artificial) minds on those craft is not that hard to imagine.  If you work it out, using carbon nanotubes and molecule-scale processors, one cubic centimeter of their processor cores could have approximately the processiong power of about a billion Pentium IVs processors.  So an alien processor even a meter cubed would dwarf all of our computers, and maybe all of our minds as well.Put in those terms, one of those ships wouldn&apos;t have much to worry about, in terms of being outsmarted, or outclassed.As I see it, there is no inherent reason why even very advanced, intelligent probes should want or seek any direct or intentional contact with us.That doesn&apos;t fit within the agenda of &quot;study&quot;.  Especially if we seem to them to be very primitive.  And I wouldn&apos;t argue with them on that point.We&apos;re still all pretty...duh.  :) But even *if* that object I saw flying high overhead about 12 years ago was built in a plant somewhere right here on earth, by humans who get a paycheck for building neat stuff - I would say to the guys who built it (if I could): boys, congratuations!  Your new airship is technology with a capital T.I mean...first of all, it looks *alien*.  It looks like...puh, Hollywood, move over.  And on top of looking weird and ET-ish, you&apos;ve managed to build something that&apos;s evidently about the size of a cottage, that has no wings, and it can zip through the earth&apos;s atmosphere at quite high altitudes, faster than a rifle bullet, and do it without making a sound.  That&apos;s a pretty neat trick.  Where did you get the design for it?  :)((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I Had picked up my load north of San Francisco and was heading to Nashville, TN for delivery.  Crossing into Arizona at some point I believe around 9:30 to 10:00 I noticed a huge ball of light fall straight out of the sky toward the ground.  I was on my cell phone to my father when it appeared and he shared my experience as did several other vehicals that passed by.  I thought it was the end me and everyone as this huge Ball with an orange and yellow trail streaked toward the earth.  It was huge!  If it was a meteor it would have surely been a global killer. It stoped before it smashed into the ground.  I was in shock and my father a 30 year Naval Officer listened as I described what I saw.  I stoped the truck parked and started walking toward the object describing what I was seeing to my father: it appeared as a blue perfectly round sphear.  Suddenly it seemed to cloak itself blending perfectly into the horizon and desert background.  Suddenly there was what appeared to be a bolt of lightning emiting straight up toward the sky from the cloaked object -- that streak stayed for what seemed like several minuets.  Finally, a perfect image of a large Blue Whale materialized and seemed to levetate in mid-air.  It was at this point that my father told me to go back to the truck and try to confirm what I had seen with other witnesses.((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.  However, we learned that he is not certain of the date, and", "Pink disc plays &quot;hide and seek&quot; with private and miltary planes for 2 hrs.!This sighting occurred in 1971-1972 from what I can figure out. I wish I would have written down the date, but when you&apos;re a child - you don&apos;t think to do something like that.My brother and I were walking to the local convenience store to get some candy about 8:00 PM at night when we saw this odd, shimmering light in the sky across the Santa Clara Valley. It was stationary, the color of magnesium and kind of looked like a mild Fourth of July sparkler sitting there motionless in the sky. It was over the valley low enough that we could see the outline of the top of the mountain range up above and beyond it.Well, we apparently weren&apos;t the only people witnessing this extraordinary aerial phenomena. A small private plane was coming across the sky toward the light to get a better look at it. As soon as the plane was a short distance away form it, the light turned itself off, dimmed itself into darkness. The private plane made a few tentative circles around where the object was and flew off. When it was a short distance away, the object came back on again, shining away in the exact same place.If this wasn&apos;t enough, apparently this shimmering star like object had attracted the attention of the local Navy P3 Orion subchasing patrol. One of these large military planes came over to take a look - and the same thing happened again! The light went out, the big plane made a couple of large, lazy circles in the area where it had apparently observed the object, and then when it left - on came the light again, in the same place! The next thing that happened about ten minutes or so later, we weren&apos;t quite prepared for. We heard it before we saw it - the military had scrambled a jet from one of the nearby military bases. We heard it before we saw it as it came screaming across the sky. So did the object, and apparently was startled by it. The thing all of a sudden glowed much brighter than it had been (&quot;Oh, no!&quot; ;) and then quickly put it&apos;s shimmering light out again.The jet stayed there for about 20 min. or so, going from wide to tighter and tighter circles, and even doing &quot;figure 8&apos;s&quot;. But, apparently, it gave up the pursuit of the object and we saw the jet fly off - and guess what happened?? The shimmering light came back on again - but this time, it had moved a short distance in the sky to another spot not far from the original one! And , it continued to shine.During this incredible experience, I had run the two blocks back home and had gotten binoculars. Through them , I had gotten a much better look at this mysterious object. It looked like a glowing pink disc or football shaped object, completely molten, with sparks coming off of it. It kind of reminded me of how an ember glows in the dark. I estimated it was about the size of a passenger car.The whole incident lasted about two hours, because we were kids and had to go home to bed, and probably got a little bored because the object was just sitting there shimmering and not moving. We didn&apos;t watch it leave, it was still there when we gave up and went home.I saw it in the exact same place again several nights later, shining away again, but didn&apos;t watch it again that night for very long. No planes seemed to be trying to molest it this time. And then, I never saw it again.My brother and a neighbor lady witnessed this with me. There also had to be witnesses in the private plane, the P3 Orion subchaser plane from Moffett Field NAS, and the pilot of the jet fighter. I haven&apos;t seen anyone else report this sighting, so I thought I would.P.S. Peter - please use this version - I corrected a few typos.

It was a clear night, with a bright moon, but there were a couple of puffy clouds that were illuminated by the moon.  As I first looked up, I saw an object that I thought was a meteor or falling star.  Then after looking closely, I saw it was a bright white cigar shaped object sort of falling at an angle like the hands of a clock from 1 to 2.  Suddenly it silently moved at an impossible rate of speed across a large arc of sky to end up behind a cloud.  It made no sound, and looked just very white with no other distinguishing features.  My girlfriend saw it too after I said &quot;look at that !&quot;.  The funny thing was, I got the feeling that it sensed it was seen and fled like an animal.

I am a pilot and my wife and I had just returned from a flight. I heard the sound of a helicopter near by and looked up the check the type and location of this aircraft when I spotted a brilliant white egg shaped craft traveling at a high rate of speed going from east to west. I would guess the altitude to be at or about 5,000 feet. There was no sound associated with the passage of this craft and I would guess the speed to be just barely below the speed of sound. Shortly after the passage of this craft the sky was filled with white plastic threads, some of which were clumped together. Most of this material disintegrated upon contact with the ground.

I felt vibrations and thought I imagined it, but a second wave through the chair and stronger ones frightened me so much so that I jumped out of it and to the other side of the room.As I sat and almost waited for the chair to do something else, not realising it had been a tremor at that point I got up and went out onto my balcony (I have french windows in this room), the sky was exceptionally clear, it was very cold and there was only the faint hint of a breeze. To give an idea of direction, the full moon was facing me slightly to the right and Heathrow is to the right.  I looked to the right and saw a clear light about the size of a headlight about pencil length above the rooftops of 4 story flats in that direction (I&apos;m on the 5th floor and about the same level as their roof) The glare was bright and I&apos;m very used to watching planes and helicopters being in central London.  I thought for a moment it was a plane but at the size it was, I would have expected it to move or change direction or something or at the very least, grow in shape if it was coming directly towards me for example, but it was stationary for a good 5 minutes.  I ran in and prayed my batteries were okay and hunted for my digicam (nikon coolpix 775) and ran back outside.  I took a couple of pictures but it was very cold out and I was shivering so they are a little blurred, but I also managed to get a couple of short videos though again they&apos;re a little shakey, as the camera has a 15 second silent video feature.  Had that been a plane it would have grown in size and neared except that wasn&apos;t the right direction for the usual flight path either.  A helicopter appeared from behind me and hung around between me and the full moon or there abouts and still the light didn&apos;t move straight away.  Eventually it moved slowly up and to the right in direction and I feared I would not be able to see it as it slowly passed behind my flats.  I ran to the other side of the flat and out to the front balcony.  First the helicopter came over the roof, (the whole time there was only ever the helicopter noise, nothing at all from the object itself.) It could have been a completely separate UFO as the look differed greatly from each view ! point or the same one with just the angle making it look very different.  Bu it climbed and began to come right over head where now, although it was dark as was the object (which did at that point look possibly like it could have been a plane) when I realised the pattern of red lights were alternating and going in a triangle shape, very clear bright flashing red lights in a continuous pattern, I could make out a basic triangle shape and confirm to myself that this was not a normal plane.  The object moved in front of me from left to right and I managed to get a photo of this. (Heathrow would now have been to my left, and the moon would have been behind me).  Having loaded the photo&apos;s to the computer it looks very odd.  One light shows only (they had alternated) and two of the outside edges  can be seen though they are blurry and look almost cloud like except there were no clouds whatsover and it stayed this shape the whole two-three minutes it took for it to pass over heading towards the direction of Hamstead (if you imagine the point being close to me and the flat side moving away)  I was asked if it looked like a vapour trail but this would have been completely reversed and was moving clearly (between the size of a penny and a twopence piece) in the totally wrong direction for it to have been so.  It didn&apos;t look like that to the eye, to the naked eye it was a triangle shape with red flashing/alternating lights that went round the inside edges of the triangle shape and possibly one in the centre when I try to think back. Just one edge red light showed up on the photo though and I&apos;m glad to have got as much as I did considering by now I was absolutely trembling with the cold and trying to get the object in the picture at all.I&apos;m very used to planes, (though not camera&apos;s!) I often watch and am used to seeing anything up to 18 in the air at one time from my view and am also used to seeing the Presidents aircraft landing in the American Ambassador&apos;s home in Regents Park directly opposite me.  It was not a plane, it was not a helicopter, it most certainly wasn&apos;t a meteor (as has also been suggested) as the shakey photo&apos;s can only show a split second still and nothing like what the naked eye sees by way of clear lights flashing in a continuous sequence and a definite shape etc.&gt;From the tremors with the chair to the object leaving, the whole thing lasted 16 minutes.", "Observed what at first appeared to be a star but it was moving against the star field in rotation.

But, as I focused the shapes interacted uniformly, as if they were fixed on the front of a Stealth Bomber (&quot;flying wing&quot;)... making a slight turn and straightening manuvre; but with no complete form... just the fixed, hazy dots.I thought maybe some geese were flying over silently, and as they passed I would see birds; but it flew way too fast and silent.

At first only could see 2 colored lights, and a spotlight beam that did not reach the ground, noticed colored lights slowly turning (first appeared as helicopter losing control). As I slowed down, the object also slowed down and began to wobble, and then suddenly flew sideways across the Freeway approx. 50ft in front of my truck, I slammed on the brakes to a stop.

The other car that stopped, remained parked. We watched the object continue its dance as I drove off, my wife keep telling me to pullover to watch this object, but I didn&apos;t trust it.

Shortly after Air Force One went out of site, I noticed a dark shape that appeared to be drifting across the sky. At first, I thought it was a black or dark-colored party balloon. Then we noticed it was larger than a balloon and was not drifting, but seemed to be moving under its own power. The shape was oblong, like two spheres joined together. There was no observeable texture to the surface or any reflections. I estimate the size at 8 to 10 feet long, and 2 to 3 feet tall.

The Space Shuttle, Atlantis, had undocked from the Space Station, and the Shuttle was several minutes ahead of the Station, preparing to return to Cape Kennedy on the following day (October 18, 2002).As we stood, scanning the evening sky to the west, searching for the Space Station, both of us witnessed a peculiar object STREAKING across the sky, covering an estimated 10-15 degrees of arc (from our vantage point), traveling from our right to left, in approximately 2-3 seconds.  The object appeared to have several point sources of light on it, perhaps 3 to 5 of them, each approximately the color of a green LED, and it subtended an arc of approximately one-half a degree, i.e. equal approximately to the width of a thumbnail held at arm&apos;s length.  At just about the time both observers commented on the object&apos;s appearance, it just faded from our vision in approximately 1 second, or less.  It appeared to travel at a constant angular velocity throughout the sighting, i.e. it did not appear to slow.Since it was just past dusk at the time, the object was not easily visible to us, except for its lights, although it appeared to have &quot;structure.&quot;  During the short time we witnessed it, the several lights on the side facing us (its port side) did not appear to change position relative to each other.  Both witnesses were left with the distinct impression that they were looking at some kind of unidentifiable, solid object.The object&apos;s high angular velocity across the sky rules out any type of conventional aircraft.

Here is my description again...As I was traveling west on a county road in SW Lehi, Utah, I had just crossed over some railroad tracks and turned right when I noticed this rather large, illuminated object that seemed to be hovering just over the rooftops and it was covered with lights with no true shape to it.  If I had to guestimate how many lights there were, I would say approximately 15-20.  And mixed in with the white lights were about 2-3 red ones, which were around the perimeter of the craft.  I was about 1/4 mile away from it and I would say it was traveling at a rate of about 25-30 mph because I pursued it, but it was staying the same distance from my car.  As it moved through the air, it left a rather thick, white trail which looked like either smoke, exhaust or steam.  It also seemed to rotate as it moved and the lights kept changing in brightness and position.  It made no noise either.  As a matter of fact, there were many other cars in pursuit of this thing as it made its way west.  Some cars had stopped where people had gotten out to watch it, while others stayed in their cars and pursued it (like me) for about 1-2 miles.  However, after about 10 minutes, it dipped behind a large home and suddenly just vanished without a trace.  It was truly one of the most amazing things I had ever witnessed.  I had no explanation for what I saw.  It was my second UFO experience actually because I had seen this same aircraft before a few weeks earlier, only it was a very brief sighting (maybe 10-20 seconds).  I should have called the local police to report an unidentified flying object, but didn&apos;t.  I was also amazed when no one else reported it, considering the number of people on the backroad who either got out of their cars to gaze at this thing or follow it.

After that, the object moved further west and then I lost view of it as it, from what I could perceive, moved to the south.

My father and 2 brothers were in the cab of the truck and I was riding in the back with a friend of my father&apos;s who was asleep. I was laying down on a matress that was in the bed of the truck, my head was near the cab. It was about 5 o&apos;clock in the afternoon and we were traveling east on highway 152 going toward San Luis Dam and Pacheco Pass. We were travelling about 50-60 mph. I looked to the north and saw two egg shaped objects (one slightly ahead and above the other) traveling in the same direction as we were. My first thought was that they looked beautiful and absolutly perfect and pristine. I then said to myself &quot;that&apos;s right, that is what they look like.&quot; I then realized that these objects were being piloted as I could sense a &quot;presence&quot; in the way they moved, this frightened me. I watched them for as long as I could for they were going a little faster than we were and were slowly moving up and away from us. I lost sight of them as they were lost in the haze of the setting sun. I was unable to determine their size but they were about the size of a pea held at arms length and I could see that they were round because of the shadow along the rear bottom portion. They were not shiny but white and they looked just like two chicken eggs, (I always felt silly telling people that they looked like chicken eggs.) Later on in life I connected the feeling that I had recognized them (&quot;that&apos;s right, that is what they look like&quot;)with an incident that happened when I was nine yrs old. A neighbor found me walking down the street at 3 oclock in the morning and brought me home. After I woke up in the morning the neighbor came over to our house to see if I was OK. At that moment I remembered that I had had a dream that night and in the dream I was standing on the front porch looking at someone on the other side of the fence but in the dream it was very, very bright outs! ide, bri ghter than daylight. I always felt like there was more to what happened that night than I could remember.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although witness does not imply that fact.

The most important factor is that he has this on video camera.  We have seen the event and it is real.  Our friend was sleeping and had a bright light in his living room wake him up.  His house was shaking.  He looked out and saw a round, mushroom shaped craft.  It was white, with green , red, blue and black in the center.  He felt the center had a hole in it.  The object was shaking his house and he held the camera and filmed it while it was in his neighborhood.  He filmed it as it flew up and away.  Amazing!

The objects had no light except for a slight haziness(almost like the lights from the city were reflecting off of them) and made no sound whatsoever.  They flew right behind a tree that was blocking our line of sight and I run away from the tree so that I can catch another glimpse of them.  By the time I got to where my sight was not obstructed, about 4-5 seconds, they were gone.  Of course, we dismissed them as a flock of geese traveling   in a V but the objects were traveling towards the north and they made no honking noises which got us to thinking that these were not geese.  The &quot;objects&quot;  were also traveling at high altitudes and incredible velocity so we ruled them out as geese.

There is a vacant house and a barn used for storage at the end opposite of where we observed. All land is owned by us. It was about half way thru the show, when I yelled to my brother to &quot;look at that&quot;! He was in the couch , so he had to lean way over to see it. I had seen 2 deep red balls of light fall from the sky,about halfway up the field, one right after another, however, my brother had enough time to get up and witness the second ball. There probably was only a 2 second delay between them.They seemed to &quot;burn out&quot; about 50 ft above the ground. They were maybe 3 ft across, just guessing. Not large at all.

But it was perfectly calm that night.After about 20 seconds, it died out.Not a sound was made. I drove up to the old house with a camcorder, but  nothing at all happened again that night.This was the closest experience Ive had with these things. However, lately, these bright red, and sometimes orange orbs have been making loud noises, much like fighter jets do when they fly close to the ground, and the noise starts and stops very abruptly. The noise is usually accompanied by glowing red balls flying above the tree line, which stop, ascend, descend sometimes making noise, most of the time not.Another thing Ive noticed over the years of seeing these lights, sometimes I see what looks like a star, but Im good at telling the difference, because if I keep watching, it stops acting like a star(flashing red, gree, blue, white) and turns into a glowing red ball which sometimes pulsates or fades. Ive seen them start moving, change speed, direction, even split into two or three different balls, then go back together. Some fly pretty close to the house at times.  So what in the world is it that does these things? We can see them almost any given night.", "I&apos;m not sure about this report because it was witnessed by my son, who was driving an 18 wheeler at the time.  I am hoping perhaps someone here can shed some more light on this for us.  My son was driving through Pennsylvania with his co-driver.  Suddenly he noticed a black square in the sky.  It was like a black square hole in the sky.  It was not like a craft, but a &quot;hole&quot;.  Clouds were moving past it, but it was not moving at all.  He had seen another of the &quot;holes&quot; in another state, but I can&apos;t remember which state it was.  It was all within days of each other.  About 2 years ago, another of my sons experienced a sighting of a rectangle box shape black &quot;fog&quot; crossing the highway he was diving on.  Several witnesses were present then because they all got out of their cars and watched this &quot;thing&quot; cross the highway.  It was approximately 3 to 3 and one half feet tall, and approximately 12 to 14 feet long.  It was lying on its side, floating across the highway.  People noticed that you could not see the lights from the cars through it.  This occured around 10:00PM (22:00) and was on Hwy. 69 South of Lufkin Texas.  At the same exact time, my sister was traveling on Hwy. 69 NORTH but was just about 15 miles south of Tyler Texas at the same time, and saw another one of these things crossing the highway there.  The exception in this case was that it was standing lengthwise and crossing a 4 lane highway, leaving the highway and traveling out of sight into a pasture.  This sighting happened at about the same exact time the other one did, but they were 85 to 100 miles apart.  Neither my son nor my sister told anyone else about the event, until they told me at different times.  I had to tell them about the other one seeing it too.  I think what my truck-driving son saw is the same things that my sister and another son saw except that the truckdriver son saw them in the sky and across the country from each other.

When I was about 3 miles from my parents house I noticed a bright red ight in the sky.  I could not take my eyes from it.  I drove faster to see what in the world it was.  As I was driving down this road, which is very rural, I noticed a car coming from the other direction.  As the car passed under the light their dome light came on.  As they neared me they were waving for me to stop.  Because I did not know the 3 males in the car and because of the time of night I did not stop.  It was a very clear, bright night with hardly any clouds in the sky.  As I drove closer down the road and closer to the light my radio went off and wouldn&apos;t work anymore.  The light was now lower in the sky, about housetop level.  It was red and glowed but did not give off light.  The light reminded me of the light given off by one of those glow-in-the-dark balls that kids play with.  It was elongated and seemed to undulate as it now moved down the road in front of me.  A best guess estimate as to size is that it semed to be about 9 feet long and 3 feet wide.  It dropped from housetop level to the level of a monster truck cab.  Once I was this close I all of a sudden did not want to catch up to it anymore.  I slowed down so that I would stay behind it and not catch up to it.  It was traveling down the road in front of me.  For some reason it now seemed very menacing.  The way I can best descibe it is the way you feel when a dog growls at you and you can tell whether it is a dog that will wag its tail and lick your hand if you talk to it or will back up its growl with an attack if you speak to it.  It was the bad one.  It seemed evil and menacing.  As I approached the intersection, it was now down to windshield level of my chevette car.  I stopped for the stop sign at the intersection and it kept going without stopping.  It is 4/10 of a mile to my parent&apos;s house form the intersection.  Half of this is! on the paved road and half is a private lane.  Where you turn onto the lane the pavement rises into a hill to continue up and around a curve.  The light was barely ahead of me when I reached the lane.  I was just barely idling along at this point, so as not to catch up with it!  While it continued up the hill I turned onto the lane and stomped on the accelerator.  I looked in my rearview mirror and saw it behind me.  I started honking my horn and as soon as I was in my parent&apos;s drivway.  The lights in my parent&apos;s house came on and they came out onto the porch.  I stopped the car and ran as fast as I could into the house.  It took my parents a long while to calm me down.  My mother and I stayed up for a couple of hours and I finally felt I would be able to go to sleep.  I fell asleep on the couch in  the living room.  There were no electrical appliances or lights anywhere near the couch.  At approximately 4am I was literally shocked awake.  The hair on my arms stayed upright for all of the next day.  When the shock jolted me awake and I woke up I saw the light at the corner window of the living room as if it were looking in at me.  At first I was so scared tht I couldn&apos;t even get my vocal cords to work then I was screaming for all I was worth.  My parents ran into the room, turnng on lights as they made their way to the living room.  The light seemed to dissapate and disappear.

Each individual object was of an illuminated white colour, and seemed to resemble the shape of a bird. The formation was completely silent, and flew smoothly past several clearly identifiable commercial and private aircraft at a speed &gt;250 mph.  After the formation had disappeared in the NW sky, I observed two objects flying independently.  Whether these had come from the formation I had observed is unclear.  The first object was of the shape previously described. It flew at roughly the same altitude and speed as the formation, yet seemed to circle and hover in the WSW sky. Barring it&apos;s speed and luminescence, it&apos;s trajectory did fit with that expected from a hawk or other predatory bird.  I can only describe the shape of the second object as a point of light.  This object flew at a higher altitude than that already described (&gt;10k feet), and reached incredible speeds.  What was most impressive was the flightpath that it followed; my best description of this object&apos;s trajectory would be &quot;extremely ERRATIC&quot;.  At such a high rate of speed, this object seemed to turn and bank with almost no leeway, in the same manner one might observe a firefly or other small insect to do as it is blown in the wind. I also described the pattern this object made in the night sky to a colleague as that which might be expected to result from someone moving a laser pointer around the ceiling of an auditorium.  The possibility that a ground-based device created this image, however, can be ruled out by the fact that the observed object would come into and out of view as it passed behind sparse cloud cover.", "I was able to capture an UFO using still photographyEnjoying a day off from work, I hiked high into the hills above San Marcos, CA to take some informal Nature Photography.

I wish I could remember the exact day and month, but I think is was in the middle or late part of June in 2001. My father brought it to my attention in our front yard. Facing north-north east and looking approximately 65 degrees up we were staring at a fairly large sphere that was orange/red in color. At first I thought it was a star in the early evening, but quickly brushed that aside when I saw other stars near it. They were basically dwarfed in size. I am familiar with the sky in that area as having lived there for many years and watched the stars and meteor showers with my father over the years. soon my mother joined us. I ran to get my fathers binoculars and when I came back, our neighbors had pulled up and jokingly asked if we were trying to find aliens. When we pointed to the sky, the neigbor ran inside to get HIS binoculars and him, his wife, and my family all wached it for almost an hour. It did not move, nor did it change color, yet at the end of the hour, it quickly faded away (while looking through the binoculars, it was an intense bright, hot orange/red and as it faded it shimmered a shade of sliver....maybe the sun relecting off a craft???). It was not a reflection of the sunset off a star, as I have often watched the sky over the years and previously noted that the stars in the rest of the sky were quite small in size in comparison (I have always been intrigued by astronomy and took several classes in college).I have no clue what this was, but there were 5 adults watching this &quot;phenomenon&quot;.... one ex military, one working in media, one school teacher and 2 nurses.

As we came around a bend in the road I noticed a bright red light in the sky in front of and to the right of us, at about a 1 o&apos;clock position.  It was very big and very bright.  I commented about how big it was and asked J. if he thought it could be a satellite.  He said it was too big, he didn&apos;t know what it was.  I watched it for about a minute and a half, the time it would normally take us to get from the end our our drive, to the gas station that is a mile away.  The light was hovering stationary in the sky, and had not moved in that minute and a half I was watching.  Then it moved across the sky from a 1 o&apos;clock to a 9 o&apos;clock position.  I am not sure, but I believe the car in front of us was looking at it as well, because as soon as the light began to move, the person driving the car in front of us slammed on his brakes. The object moved very steadily, there was no wobble or anything like that.  It moved across the sky and then stopped and went back into a hover.  We were passing it at about that point in time.  As I caught my last glimpse of it, it appeared that there were now two red lights.  They were only red lights, no other color.  They were not blinking, like the smack lights on an aircraft would do.  For lack of better words, I would say the light was pulsating, but not blinking.The light was about as big as half of my pinky nailbed if I were to hold it at arms distance away from my eye.  That would mean either a very large object, or a very close object.  There were no sounds.  A helicopter would have made a sound. I was a helo mechaninc in the Marine Corps and I would have been able to distinguish which helo by the sound of the engine. There was no sound. The only other craft I know of that can hover like that is a Harrier, and that, too would make a very loud and distinguishable sound.  We continued on along Pala Rd and I lost sight of it once we passed the Pechanga Hotel.  I had it in my site for about 4-5 minutes.Last night I went outside after dark and watched the air traffic around the area.  There is an airport to the north of us and a military base to the south of us.  I noticed that none of the lights of the planes that were coming and going were as large as the light I saw on the 5th.

There was no moon or obstructions to the viewing. The formation was to our left and in the direction of James house west of us. My effort to capture the formation on video was sucessfull this time and I have a video of it.  The formation was heading from north to south and it was to the west of where we were.

Reluctantly I followed and I will describe it as a circular light that at times changes colors to red or green and it jumps from a spec of light to a very big flash of light and when it does enlarge for those brief moments there is a lot of detail that is visible.  It almost seems translucent.  My friend and I both had video camera&apos;s on hand which is strange in itself as we don&apos;t go around with camera&apos;s typically.  My point is that we have never reported a sighting before and never went looking for this to happen but look forward to someone telling us what this is on our film.One more detail to add is that when we both were looking in our viewfinders recording it...at times you would think we were zooming in and out when we were not.  That is how much it would enlarge then shrink.", "Report from the Dutch newsPicked from the news: Source:De Telegraaf www.nu.nl(newswebsite) I translated the report into English for you because I think you should know about it.UFO achtervolgt stel uit Brabant UFO chases couple in Brabant Uitgegeven: 30-9-2002 8:04 published:9/30/2002 AMSTERDAM - Een UFO heeft zaterdagnacht een stel uit het Brabantse Bladel de stuipen op het lijf gejaagd, zo meldt de Telegraaf.A UFO scared a couple from the Netherlands saturdaynight (province of Brabant, the town called Bladel) So reports the Newspaper The Telegraph.De twee verklaarde tegenover de polite dat de vreemde bol hen drie kwartier lang achtervolgde op de provinciale weg.The two stated to the police that they were chased by a UFO, a ball shaped light, for 45 minutes on the province road.&quot;Ik ben zeer nuchter in die dingen. En ik weet dat de mensen ons voor gek zullen verklaren. Maar wat wij gezien hebben was echt. Dat licht bleef ons maar volgen. Het reageerde exact op onze bewegingen. En ik had echt niet te veel gedronken,&quot; aldus de man van het stel, Pieter Vosters, in de krant.Mr Pieter Vosters says:Im quite sober with these things and I know that people will make fun of us about this but what we have seen was real.The light just kept following us and it responded exactly to our movements(by car).And we didn&apos;t drink a drop.Vosters vertelt verder aan de krant: &quot;Eerst dacht ik nog aan een of andere lasershow van een discotheek. We maakten er nog grapjes over. Maar toen hij ons maar bleef volgen dacht ik &apos;Hier klopt iets niet&apos;. We hebben de auto direct aan de kant gezet. Het licht stopte ook en bleef boven ons rondjes draaien. Dat heeft zich een keer of zes herhaald. Als wij stopten, dan stopte dat ding ook.&quot; &quot;Toen we linksaf richting Bladel sloegen, sloeg de ufo ook af. Het was een heel helder licht. Geef maar een flinke peut gas, zei ik tegen mijn vrouw. Maar het bleef ons volgen met een enorme snelheid, een streep licht. Toen wisten we zeker dat het geen laser kon zijn. Mijn vrouw werd bang. Ik durfde niet meer naar huis.&quot;First we thought that it was the lasershow of a nearby disco and we joked about it but when it kept following our car we realised that something wasnt right and we put the car on the side of the road. The light circled above us. When we drove again it went with us. This repeated for six times. When we went left, the UFO went left. The light was very bright and my wife said pull some more gas but that didnt make any difference. As we drove faster the ball shape craft transformed into a stripe of light. As we became more and more afraid and too frightened to go to our house, the light disappeared.", "Disk East of Poplar Bluff Seen and Feds come to investigate.We were getting ready to move a bee yard.

Needless to say, we never got to use the telescope. My daughter was laying in the back of my station wagon,and started telling me that a car was coming and that I should pull off the road a little more to avoid being in the way. I glanced back at the headlights coming behind us, and even though something told me that there was somthing wierd about the lights, I started to get in the car to pull over more.  Suddenly, my daughter started to yell that it was not a car, and for my friend and I to look behind us.The lights that had been behind us, were now lifting up and over the car! My daughter wouldn&apos;t get out to see it right away, because she was afraid, but my friend and I were transfixed on the craft. It, was definetly triangular, it made NO sound,the lights were very muted on the bottom of the craft. It&apos;s size was VERY large. I would say, (I know ther are better terms) the size of an acre or a little more of land. It was crusing very slowly, about 25 to 30 miles an hr. heading in a southern direction toward Muncie, In.My friend and I were watching this craft going off into the distance, and questioning each other to what we had just seen, when my daughter started yelling again,that there was another one coming up behind us! My friend and I looked back, and there was another craft, exactly like the first, heading in the same direction as the previous one! We all watched this one follow the same course as the first, noting again that there was no sound, and although there were lights, they were very muted. The outsides of the crafts were very dark,and appeared to be one with the blackness of the sky.After that unforgettable sighting, we raced back to town and called the Muncie airport to see if they had heard any reports or seen anything on their screens, but they hadn&apos;t.My friend has since died, but my daughter and I will never forget what we witnessed.", "500 moving lightsWe saw the white lights in the night sky.

They were very far away. Their seemed to be flashes as they zipped off to another part of the triangle. Their was no noise. Eventually the lights dispersed. A light came over the sky towards us and split into two. As the two white lights went directly over our heads we noticed green and red lights where the wings of a jet would be, their was again no noise, no wind and then they were gone.The night sky was just on the turn from pitch black to dark blue.If you have seen the movie STAR WARS Return of the Jedi and the scene where Luke Skywalker is on the new death star and he is looking out at the combating fleets then that is the nearest description to what we saw.The first observer was aged 24 male and worked as a night porter.

My friend was made aware that sensors surrounding one missile silo recorded a rapid rise in ground temperature( from -25 to -30F to 50 or 60F} within the space of 5-15 minutes. Simultaneously all the sensors on perimeter &quot;fences&quot; showed that whatever was occurring had not been initiated by something crossing the fences nor had any of the ground sensors indicated anything had &quot;walked&quot; by ground passage up to the missile site. He said he was told that the missile silo cover had been set aside, that &quot;crew&quot; from the unknown craft broke into the missile silo, and some of its &quot;crew&quot;  were examining the circuitry of the ballistic missile. At least one Observer on the U.S. military reaction team arrived to see &quot;crew&quot; scampering aboard the &quot;craft&quot;. Apparently as is SOP, fighters  scrambled. My friend said when the radar target appeared on &quot;his&quot; radar scopes within a few moments of the reaction team&apos;s &quot;radioed&quot; report, it was travelling straight up at a speed in excess of 50,000 miles an hour. It disappeared by moving outside the range of the radar his NORAD shift was using.When he told me this he began perspiring profusely and was very nervous and discomfitted. As a decorated Vietnam combat veteran I know nervousness and a few things about fear. My friend was very nervous, a bit scared, and upset. If we had not been such good friends he probably would not have told me about this. He did know about one prior UFO experience I had - and before this happened used to give me grief about what I had told him had happened to me. Ever since that conversation I am now reporting, he has never made fun of UFO sightings or reports.When I read the report situated on your website I initially thought you were talking about what my friend had reported to me. I was very surprised that the date was 1975 because, if what my friend told me was true - and I believe what he said, it wasn&apos;t the first time missiles at Malmstrom AFB had been examined by unknown personnel from a craft whose origins were also unknown. From what my friend said, it had technology far ahead of ours. He said everyone was told the &quot;incident did&apos;t happen.&quot; I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t be more specific because I am relating the comments my friend made. That is why I can&apos;t give you a shape of the craft or other details. He was watching this on various instrumentations, but others involved &quot;talked&quot; to eachother, swapping info {I would imagine} to confirm they weren&apos;t crazy. He was an experienced Fighter controller expert, so this was no novice relating the story to me.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

According to my friend, the 1972 or 1972 event was similar to the one in 1975 in that the missile silo was opened, then the missile was opened up and the electronic circuitry examined.

There is a large parking area which is also very popular with local astronomers during &apos;new moon&apos; weekends. The land is flat with groups of trees being the only things sticking up here and there. (see park map at www.nps.gov/ever/map.htm) WHO.Approx. 25 people where in the Mahogany Hammock parking area during this sighting although I am not sure if only a half dozen people actually saw it. The rectangular shaped parking area&apos;s longest sides run on about east/west orientation, my wife and I were set up on the north side near center with our 12.5&quot; and 8&quot; inch telescopes. Observing conditions were clear and steady, visibility unlimited, very dark, no moon, an excellent and cool nite. Everyone was busy observing or photographing Messier or NGC objects.  The usual lone observer, mingling small groups, and muted conversations were all evident. By the way, dark adapted eyes are needed for deep-sky &apos;visual&apos; observations such as nebulae, distant galaxy clusters, etc. and no white lights were allowed. Only very dim red flashlights were seen around the area.  I should mention that deep-sky observers avoid viewing the planets since their brightness will ruin &apos;dark adaptation&apos; for a long time. If by accident anyone opens a car door and white light is seen...angry screams always follow! Dark adaptation is guarded by all. Anyway, it was one of those perfect nights you rarely get...especially on the weekend...so everyone was head down into sky charts or squinting into eyepieces on their quests to log as many objects as possible on their personal observing &quot;hit lists&quot;! I came to believe this is one reason why only a few of us saw the craft or were even interested enough to look at it! I still can&apos;t believe only a few of us said anything about it. Thankfully, my wife was there. We both saw it, and this fact has made my homelife easier as I probably would never mention it if I would have been alone. I mean people think you are crazy or something, you know, because of all the official &apos;denial&apos; going on about these things.Anyway, please excuse my ramble, but it does point out the irony that this happened to people who know the sky and know what is up there! WHAT.The details as I remember them. Sometime around midnite I heard a man&apos;s voice to the west of me say, &quot;There&apos;s something flying over there!&quot;  So I looked about due west and also saw this bright object hovering just over the trees about a 1/2 mile away. It may have actually came up out of the trees we don&apos;t know for sure. At first glance it was bright with orangish/goldish color. At second glance, a few seconds later, there were no navigation lights, no strobe lights, no sound! It was a glowing disk and it wasn&apos;t flying in the sense of &apos;aerodynamic&apos; flight. As a former private pilot I am aware of the factors of flight: when lift and thrust overcome weight and drag anything will fly. Also, the FAA regulations require red (left) and green (right) nav lights on the wingtips and white strobes and all aircraft. This disk was a &apos;craft&apos; but it was not flying. Floating along through our atmosphere in spite of gravity is a better description (than flying). As an amateur astronomer, I can tell you this was not Venus, not Jupiter, not the Moon and not swamp gas. It was a low level sighting of a craft that was moving about 10 mph. We observed it for about 12 minutes or so until the trees obscured it as it slowly disappeared to the south of us in the direction of Flamingo, FL.I should mention that it changed direction twice. I first saw it above the trees to our west. It was heading east, at us. Then it slowly headed ESE just missing us to the south of our position and only about 1/4 mile or less away. This was our best view as it remained just above the nearby treeline for the length of the parking lot. I quickly lowered my telescope enough to catch a glimpse, but the focuser didn&apos;t move enough to focus clearly at this short distance and the guide scope was a Telrad which has no magnification. However, we could easily see, with just our eyes, that the basic shape was a slightly domed disc looking about twice as wide as it was high. It had its own colorful luminosity yet it was metallic looking, sleek and strangely beautiful I thought. My guess at the time was 30 feet diameter craft and about 16 feet high with the domed part being on top.   We were on the north side of the parking area and so we had the best angle of view over the trees to the south. This may also explain why the people in the other parts of the parking area didn&apos;t or couldn&apos;t see it. As I am writing this, I am thinking this may be the biggest reason why not everyone saw it. Also, it is interesting that being among many astronomers that nobody, including myself, hollered out for everyone to &apos;check this thing out&apos;...fear of ridicule probably..or disbelief at what we were looking at... who knows why!  So, by the time it was passing close along the treeline in front of us, I knew this was no airplane, no blimp, no balloon. Oddly, at the same time, there was a small private plane flying (I flew Cessnas) a few miles away to our right and we could hear its engine and see the navigation lights and strobe but the disk shaped craft that was gliding by us was much closer and was not making a sound! Eventually, the disk turned south and went out of my sight. It somewhat paralleled the park road that leads past West Lake and then to Flamingo, FL. My last view of it was when I was standing on the bumper of my van and stre! tching t o see it go behind the distant treeline several miles away. It was at a very low level at that time also.TIME.Feb 1989 PS.It is funny but we never thought or talked about this sighting for many years. No special reason why. It&apos;s just that...you know...you have to get up the next day and go to work, and put the kids through college and all that. So it goes into the back of your mind for later recall if needed. Since then, but only recently, I have been reading up on the UFO topic. When I heard an interview with Travis Walton and Mike Rodgers, it hit me that the description of the craft they saw in 1975 sounds identical to what we saw in 1989 and I just wanted to put it in writing. I realize that this is an old sighting but I just wanted to add my two cents and say, &quot;I know they are out there!&quot;, period.Thanks, and keep up the good work.", "Moving from the North to the south , a very white &quot;light&quot; moved in a straight line across the night sky.

As I continued to watch, it continued to move diagonally upwards but at the same time it seemed to be gradually fading, until it just vanished.

I did not remember the incident until some years later and tried feverishly to get in touch with the others that were with me, to no avail.  On February 6, 2000 I was watching the History channel at approx. 2:00 p.m. pacific time and saw to my astonishment a show describing the exact thing that I saw, the exact words that I had spoken during the event and the feeling that I had at the time and after when I had recalled the event in the early 90&apos;s. The incident on the show had occured in Alagash Maine, which is across the lake from where I saw this thing.  It looked to me as if the Sun was rising over the mountain, but it was nearing midnight.  I thought it was the end of the world.  Then, I said that it was only the sun and never thought any more about it until some years later.  I have been frightened by the thought of UFOs ever since even though I had never really considered them prior to my memory of that big bright light rising in the midnight sky.  The report that I saw on the History channel so disturbed me and also affirmed what I had seen to be true that I began writing the names of the others that had seen it down on paper as well as the names of the hypnotists that they saw.

Apprx. 23:00 i was driving my son home from some school function and I we were about 1/2 mile from our home I noticed some werid lights in the sky.  It was just before 8:00 p.m. and was compleletly dark out. I noticed them because they were so low to the ground.  I kept driving toward my home and pointed them out to my 12 yr old son and said to him &quot;what the heck is that&quot;?  He said what I guess all 12 yr olds would say &quot;I dunno know&quot; &amp; went back to the radio.  As I proceeded up our street I kept saying what the heck is that.

Super Stallions and some other kind.  Anyways, I first thought that it was a helicopter cause these werid lights where just hovering.   But I would be dammed if I couldnt hear the helicopter.  Once thing I remember about those big helicopters is you can hear them and feel them when they fly that low to the ground.

I hold a BA in Human Relations and female 47yrs, the other 2 witnesses who with me walked to another part of the yard to keep the objects in view were male about 40 and 50 yrs of age, I&apos;m not sure of their backgrounds. The first object we believe was a plane with the usual red/green blinking lights, heading east to west, following that was a white light moving about the same speed, not fast but steady, but with no blinking lights . One of the other eye witness made the observation that it was much too close to the first object to be a plane because they&apos;re  not allowed to fly so near each other. The third object was the same short distance following the 2nd object and was also a white light with no blinking lights.We watched untill they were out of our view due to trees blocking the sky.

We currently live in a rural area where skies are often clear and the stars are very bright.  Upon awakening at roughly 4 a.m. 09/23/02, my attention was immediately drawn out the window to a brilliant star-like object to the SE, approximately 15 degrees up. It seemed exceptionally bright, especially since the landscape was flooded with competing moonlight. The object was flashing and pulsing red, green and white light --occasionally a flash would light up the immediate sky around it.  It first seemed motionless, yet very slowly passed from view behind the pines that surround this location. (I was keeping my head stationary on the same place on my pillow.) I had binoculars by the bed and trained them on this object as it reappeared through the trees, as I lay still. Well, through the binoculars the object seemed to change shape. At one point it was like a v-shaped pale pink blob, at another point it changed to a thin horizontal line, and at another stage a thin vertical line. This was peculiar and puzzling!  (In my mystification, I have been searching for explanations ...possibly the changes were created by the optics of the window glass?? Or atmospheric effects?) The intensity of the light faded, and when it passed behind another ponderosa, I waited for it to re-appear, but it did not. There was no sound associated with this object.  Other than the surrounding forest, which blocks some of the sky, thanks to our elevation and sparse population we have very good night sky viewing conditions --we&apos;ve spotted the ISS and enjoyed the Perseids.

I emailed staff at the Bruneau Dunes Observatory, who responded that I probably saw a planet or giant red star, though they couldn&apos;t really say without a better location.

The object, consisting of four or five rectangles connected with what might be described as a rigid filament (the filament extended out past the line of rectangles on both ends, as well) drifted across the field of view rather slowly, moving roughly toward the zenith.  It was approximatly one degree in apparent length and did not appear to be outside the atmosphere.  Detail of some kind was clearly visible on all the rectangles, but I have no opinion as to what it was.  The object moved at about the rate an aircraft cossing the field of view would have moved, rather than a satellite, so I ruled out space debris.  There was no weather ballon at either end of the series of rectangles visible, and, although my first impression on spotting it was that it was some sort of space station, the size of the object and its slow speed would, of course, rule that out as a possibility.  The sunset was recent enough to have provided illumination to the object, so I cannot conclude it had any illunation of its own.  I would be interested to find out if there is a well-known object that fits the description of what I observed.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))Thanks very much for your prompt response.  I, like you, am totally puzzled by the object, and despite my request for anonymity, please feel free to give my email address or phone number to anyone with professional credentials who might like to talk about it.  One technical point about the equipment that might not be immediately obvious (the Stellacam EX is relatively new) is that the setting of the camera at the time (sense up to 128, which means that 128 1/60 second exposures are cumulated on board the camera and output to the monitor every two seconds as one image) means that the object had to be quite dim.  At 128 a planet or aircraft would bleed badly into adjacent pixels, but this object did not bleed at all.  (128, for example, is so sensitive that stars within a globular cluster bleed into each other and the cluster appears to be one star.)  Since the object did not appear burned out in any way, it might actually have been too dim for, say, an 8&quot; SCT to observe at all and I don&apos;t see any way that binoculars could have picked it up.  But I still remain astonished at its apparent large size and slow speed.  I suppose the most obvious explanation is that it was some sort of attachment to a weather device or other man-made device of which the general public is not aware, and had I seen a balloon attached to it, I&apos;d have little doubt about that supposition.  But I didn&apos;t and, I cannot really account for its apparent direction of movement.((END COMMENT))", "5 bright lights, moving in formation an then fading each after another. seen in south-west Germany (crowded area)Sorry for my bad English.Standing on my roofwindow, smoken a cigaret, i saw 5 lights, slightly red in color, like the Mars.

It appeared to be about 100 metres across ( hard to tell ) and was very bright red/orange colour, about half a kilometre off the ground.At this stage I had blinked several times and looked from the sky to the ground and back again to check my eyesight. When I realised that it was actually there I yelled to my cousin to come and have a look outside. When he did, I directed his attention upward to which he yelled at the top of his voice &quot;What the hell is that?&quot; Within about one minute of us standing there watching this solidly defined shape, it emitted a very thin beam of light straight down from the middle of the object to the ground, (the focal point of the beam at this time was obscured to us by the sand dunes).  There was no sound at all.My cousin, gamer than I, scrambled up the sand dunes to see where the light beam was going/coming from? Originally we thought the beam was coming from ground. By the time my cousin had beckoned me up onto the dunes I noticed that the light was coming from the shape overhead as it ended on the beach sand with no accountable light source in sight.As we watched this oddly for about five minutes, the beam of light stopped abruptly and the once defined ball of gaseous orange/reddish thing slowly over a period of about thirty seconds, dissipated from sight.Again I state, big believer in we are not alone in the universe, ( considering its size), NOT a believer in little green men coming to visit us. I presume some form of  atmospheric gas occurrence is responsible, just what kind and how.Very very similar sounding to the gentleman&apos;s experience in Tyrone,PA.", "Strange shape shifting craft of pure light energy.It was my birthday and at about 10PM I was walking outside my house when I noticed a curious light formation in the sky.

The diameter of the head of the SS was about 10 times larger than your regular SS.  It traveled in a downward direction toward the ground although it was still very high up.  It also had a longer brighter tail than a SS.  The color can best be described as a very bright lime green light almost neon in color. It was about as long as 6 full moons lined up in a row.

The craft was not of a design that I could identify and I could not see any type of propulsion system also missing were any type of navigational lights or light beacon lights wich are required by law of all aircraft.The rapid change in trajectory indicated that the object was under positive control.The maneuvering ability the object demonstrated to avoid our conflicting flight paths was....well I was impressed; the maneuver would have been enough to structuraly compromise all conventional aircraft and probably kill any occupants.In other words it would rip a 767 into pieces.The object was gone from sight as it flew north and descended.((NUFORC Note:  Date in October 1994 is approximate.

PD))Many lights flashing slowlyDear Mr., I am writing these lines, intending to contribute in some forms in the research of the Exobiological fenomena, than by any another motive.  What do I pass to relate from now on, really happened.They were, more or less, 11 hours from the night in middle part of 1974.  I was 15 year olds then.  Arrive at home in that calm and starry night... When I look at the high sky, I saw a big ball of an yellowish light  like a big brilliant ring dislocating slowly of northeast for southeast, followed by many other lights smallerer in size than it. The colors and tinges, that varied of the red alive one, to the blue greenish one. I don&apos;t remember for certain from the quantity of lights, but I am able to say that were more of ten. The lights were foggy, as in a sign of neon, and they passed to impression of somewhat strange, unknown.I begin to squeak for my mother, that seems to be sleeping in that moment.  The lights enlivened itself to the decrease altitude (I realized this because near there was a stone quarry of some 800 meters of height and the airport is relativamente nearby and we could observe the planes upon raise flight).  I imagined that the lights dislocated themselves to, at least, some 1500 meters of altitude, without a noise.  Only my frightened shouts  broke to monotony of that hot night of Vit&oacute;ria, capital city of the  Esp&iacute;rito Santo state.  The neighborhood where my mother lives today stayed in the island of Vit&oacute;ria, the place is called Joana D&apos; arc.In the following day, watching the important, National TV News, that covers all the cowntry, I remember of the announcer  placarding the event in short and laconic form.  He said in the note that the objects were observed dislocating themselves of the north from the Bahia state in direction to the Esp&iacute;rito Santo and Rio de Janeiro stateS... I remember well that in the newspaper of the following day -  Headlines alluded to the fact, and a note said that an inhabitant from the Mountain Range - a place called SERRA - a neighboring city, that stayed in a plateau, to have observed everything of binoculars.Some years latter, already adult, I was in the Vit&oacute;ria Public Files, looking for newspapers from the epoch to find the correct day of the fact, but I did not obtain recollect correct date.  After very it find, I gave up and did not more I try..Today, past so many years, I continue with the remembrance of that night.  What did I observe not itself looked with that already had seen.  That experience went very outstanding and decisive in my life.  I read and I research everything that am able to do about these strange phenomena.These are the my remembrances..I would like that you did a research to verify to truthfulness of these facts.

Eu tinha 15 anos ent&atilde;o. Chegara em casa &agrave;quela noite calma e estrelada e...ao olhar para o c&eacute;u, v&iacute; uma grande bola, de uma luz amarelada e brilhante que se deslocava lentamente de nordeste para sudeste, seguida de muitas outras luzes menores de todas as cores e matizes, que variavam do vermelho vivo, ao azul esverdeado.N&atilde;o me lembro ao certo da quantidade de luzes, mas posso dizer que eram mais de dez pontos brilhantes.Comecei a gritar por minha m&atilde;e, que j&aacute; estava dormindo &agrave;quela hora, a nossa pequena casa estava toda &agrave;s escuras. As luzes movimentavam-se &agrave; baixa altitude ( calculei isto porque pr&oacute;ximo havia uma pedreira de uns 800 metros de altura e o aeroporto &eacute; relativamente perto e pod&iacute;amos observar os avi&otilde;es ao levantar v&ocirc;o). Imaginei que as luzes deslocavam-se a, pelo menos, uns 1500 metros de altitude, sem nenhum ru&iacute;do.

Dizia ele na nota que os objetos foram observados deslocando-se do norte da Bahia em dire&ccedil;&atilde;o ao Esp&iacute;rito Santo e Rio de Janeiro...Alguns anos mais tarde, j&aacute; adulto, estive no arquivo p&uacute;blico de Vit&oacute;ria, procurando jornais da &eacute;poca para certificar-me do dia correto em que o fato se dera, pois n&atilde;o conseguia recordar a data correta. Depois de muito  procurar, desist&iacute; e n&atilde;o mais tentei...Hoje, passados tantos anos, continuo com a lembran&ccedil;a viva daquela noite.

At&eacute; hoje leio e pesquiso tudo que posso sobre estes estranhos fen&ocirc;menos.Lembro-me bem que no jornal do dia seguinte-- Manchetes aludiam ao fato e uma nota dizia que um morador da Serra, uma cidade vizinha, que fica num planalto,  havia observado tudo de bin&oacute;culos.Estas s&atilde;o as minhas lembran&ccedil;as...Gostaria que fizessem uma pesquisa para comprovarem a veracidade destes fatos.

While painting I noticed a black object appear from over the peaks slightly Northwest of our location, it seemed to have risen from behind the hills, but given our location was far below mountain top, it may have been travelling west at a steady altitude before it was visible to us. After clearing the mountain top, the object lowered altitude slightly, to,I would say between 300-500ft. and continued to move east.  As it continued our way, but slightly northwest of us, it would travel slowly, periodicaly jolting forward, but never changing altitude. We watched as it traveled from the mountain range, at first from a distance it did look as though it could have been a very large balloon, and was a dark metallic color (like Black Chrome... but not as shiney) but was not round or teardrop , as it got closer it looked a bit like a pyramidic bubble, rotating randomly on no certain axis, and possibly the size of a school bus (this would be at a distance less than a quarter mile north of us, and at the same altitude stated, I know we had to look upward) as it passed it seamed to pick up speed and headed more northeast, it must have begun moving much faster, because it was out of sight quicker than the time it took to reach our vacinity from the mountains.", "unexplained but was nice to seewell me and my wife and two children were going out to eat dinner we were traveling down hwy 29 going south in the direction of pensacola florida my wife asked me to look at something she had been watching for a few minutes and i asked where to look she said right there so when i looked up i saw what looked like three rectangular pannels all were attached and were flashing like it was spinning around but was not spinning then i saw following this a triangle with a light in each of its corner these objects were moving west not very fast in the direction of mobile alabama she or i havent told anyone of this as there are not many who believe but to tell you the truth i dont realy believe either but she and i know what we seen and nothing or no one can take that image from us.. was it real yes it was very real . im not trying to get you the readers of this to believe me i just wanted to tell someone what we seen that night it was realy something to see .thanks and god bless..&hellip;((name deleted))", "circular object hovers over portlandone lighted circular object was sighted NxNE hovering at a 45 degree angle above portland.The object appeared to &apos;hop&apos; in a tight pattern for about 20 min.Several attempts were made to observe it&apos;s relationship to ground objects.No sound was coming from the object and as cloud cover began to move below the object it was observed that the clouds were backlit by light coming from the object.Clouds covered it completely after awhile.", "brilliant ball of lighti was just arriving home with my brother and friend about 12:30 am when i saw a brilliant ball of light. both my brother and friend saw it when i parked the car, i got out and ran in to my house to get the video camera. i began filming and zoomed in as far as i could then left it at that. the object was flashing blue, red, orange, and yellow. it would change size and bop around in the picture. it never got larger than about a dime at arms length. it was about 45 deg. above the horizon. i filmed for two and a half minutes befor getting freaked out. i turned off the camera and ran inside to wake up my sleeping parents. both got up and took a look out side. my mom was convinced it was a UFO, while my dad is convinced it is a star. however, the next night i was coming home from a massage about 12:30 and looked at the same spot in the sky, but it was gone, and it was a clear night out. it wasn&apos;t a star.

PD))", "Unidentified Bright Light Sitting On RoadWhile driving from Glennallen to Anchorage in a remote wilderness area, we observed a very bright light apparently on the road from a high ridge about 2.5 miles and several hundred vertical feet above the light.  As we drove down the hill we lost any view of the light.  The road at the bottom of the hill turned approximately 90 degrees to the right, and then went up perhaps 30 feet vertically and about a quarter-mile horizontally before we could see the light again.It was painfully brilliant to our dark-adapted eyes and we slowed the vehicle more and more as we drew closer because we could not see the road in front of us well enough to drive -- finally drawing to a complete stop approximately 200&apos; from the object.  Multiple flashings of the high beams to attempt to get the light reduced did not help, and we slowly creeped forward in small spurts until we were approximately 150&apos; from the light source.We waited perhaps 5 minutes for the light to change in some manner or another and began to get rather alarmed at the strangeness of it.  I made some comments about the fact that the light was super brilliant on the trees for as far as a line of sight carried it, but that it didn&apos;t reflect off of the metal of the car very intensely, so that I surmised it had some sort of polarization to it.  At that point our irritation turned quite sharply to fear when the unusual and unexplained nature of the event forcibly hit us.We backed up slowly for about 50&apos;, approached the again light slowly, freaked out, turned the car around, and raced back around the curving road through the 90 degree left turn and up the long, tall, straight hill.  It&apos;s embarrassing, but in our adrenaline-flushed brains, we had felt the car was &quot;bumped&quot; or &quot;jostled&quot; as we were approaching the light the second time, and we hit a top speed in excess of 90 mph in our subsequent flight.  The car was floored all of the way up the hill and well beyond.We travelled approximately 5 miles away from the light (and away from our intended destination) at high speed before we felt safe enough to pull over and discuss contacting the Alaska State Troopers.  We shortly decided that we had been rather cowardly, and did not want to be grist for the media grill, or the subject of jokes and ribbings.  Accordingly, we elected to return to the top of the large hill to observe the light from afar.Our second trip to the top of the hill confimed that the light was still there.  And we watched it for what seemed like a long time -- though it may have only been a few minutes.  There was no other traffic in either direction, and the light was unwavering.  We were too spooked to investigate with another close approach to the light, and we attempted to restore our self-respect by making a quasi-scientific observation:  The light was of the apparent brightness of a large stadium light pack.  It had a color temperature of 8000 or higher, i.e., an actinic blue-white that destroyed our night-vision if we stared at it too long.  It seemed to be a uniform rectangular source approximately 30&apos; by 20&apos; in size when we approached it closely, but appeared to be oval in shape when viewed from above and at a couple miles distance on top of the big hill.We finally decided to return to Glennallen and report our sighting to the Troopers...  or at least just go back and keep the whole thing to ourselves.  We had only driven back towards Glennallen for about 2 minutes when a light source appeared to be coming from the Glennallen direction.  This time however, it was a large tractor-trailer rig, a huge truck with a huge trailer that was literally barrelling down the road at 65 mph (we clocked it).We stopped and followed the rig.  We began to look forward to seeing what would happen to the scarey USO (Unidentified Sitting Object) as the comfortingly huge and purposeful symbol of human industry plowed toward it.  At the top of the large hill, and cruising in the wake of the big rig, we saw the light still sitting there, less than three minutes away as the truck briefly hit seventy on the downhill stretch.We came to the bottom of the hill, turned the 90 degree corner to our right, and coasted along in the wake of the giant truck, an irresistable force!  As we came to where the light had been seen before, there was nothing!  We hurriedly scanned everywhere, but stayed close to the truck.  No lights, nothing!  Within the next five minutes, we passed several cars going the other direction, but never saw anything that even remotely looked like the strange light.On a return trip later in the week we stopped at the place where we had had such a fright a few nights before.  I personally walked the pavement in the area, but could see nothing out of the ordinary.  We never knew what to make of the strange event, but have rarely driven a remote road at night without remembering it.  It has been more than twenty years as I write this report, so I apologize for any inaccuracies or forgotten details.  I have not observed any other unexplained phenominon in my life.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))Hello Mr. Davenport,You may post my account as you wish.

Suprised that someone else saw the same thing and it was not a hallucination I looked back up into the sky.  The clouds where being dimly lit by the street and city lights in the distance however this object seemed to absorb the light.  You could tell that it was at least a shadow of an object grazing slightly inside the clouds and when I thought it would come out so I could get a better view it seemed to change its course back into the clouds to where it was obscured.  I remember the movement was very odd.  It would zig zag slightly and it had a bell curve kind of acceleration that wasn&apos;t too abrubt but not like any plane or helicopter that I have seen and I have seen frequent helicopter landings living next to a Care-flight center.  What I can&apos;t figure out is that if it was a shadow why there was no plane in sight to create it on the clouds above or where the light source could have been from inside or above the clouds.  There were none with that kind of intensity.  It made no sound.  It was very dark and had a shape akin to an inverted delta.

I assumed I was looking at two stars and I saw some sort of optical illusion. Until I noticed a third object. The three formed a near perfect isosceles triangle and moved in perfect formation from west to east. As they travelled east and reached near the zenith point in the sky, almost directly above (not a menacing abduction type above, but a general straight up), the lead object appeared to stop and vanish.

He was looking to the west and saw a very bright light in the sky that was still in the sky.  It looked almost like a very bright star and appeared to be yellow.  He then told me that the light just faded out like a watch tower light.  I then turned west on Center Road.  After I went about a mile down the road my son saw the light again.  It was straight ahead, in the distance in the southwest sky.  Then there appeared another light in a line next to it.  The lights did not appear to be moving in the sky - just standing still.  After about 3 to 5 seconds they both faded away.  About 2 seconds later they both appeared in the northwest sky.  Then after another 5 seconds they faded away.  We were still driving west on Center Road, just past the Dixon Road intersection.  About 10 seconds later just one light appeared in the northwest sky.  It did the same thing, appeared still in the sky and then faded out.  We then continued home and ran into the house to get our camcorder.  Right when we walked out the door a bright light zoomed directly overhead at an extremely fast speed.  We stayed outside about another 15 minutes but were unable to find the lights again.  I did notice a flash of what appeared to be heat lightening, but there were no clouds in the sky.

We also lived outside the city limits at this time. Getting home, I turned on the TV for relaxing. Around 4 a.m., I felt I could finally go to sleep. My cat wasn&apos;t in the house and fearing the roaming dogs, I went ouside to look for it. I went out the back door, which faces east, walked around to the front, which faces west, looing down at the ground, under shrubs, etc. for the cat. The cat was out front under a bush and as I bent down to pick it up, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a bright white light light in the sky, which my mind said was the crack of dawn. Then as I fondled the cat in my arms, I realized that dawn would appear out in back, or the eastern sky, and this was west. I looked up at the southwest sky. There was a thick bright white trail, solid without separation waves, that a jet might leave. We have 3 big &apos;cedar type&apos; trees in the front yard so I shifted my looking past the 2nd. tree, saw more of the trail, then past the 3rd. tree, saw more of the trail but followed it with my eyes to the north west sky. I was dumbstruck, startled to see an arrow head shaped object, glowing a brilliant white as with an enormous amount of heat,  at the head of the trail. It was moving slowly, as if encountering a force. It went on beyond my sight. The trail was still in tact and visible when I finally went inside. The object might have been heading towards Chicago... or beyond. It was huge, even from the distance. I&apos;m sure it was as high as the commercial jet planes that fly over our house. A few years later, I read the front page of a &apos;scandal rag&apos; type newspaper while waiting in line at a supermarket. It had an interview from a physcic who told about this object and another incident I&apos;d seen, a storm where a huge black storm cloud hung over a power plant and lightening produced a constant stream of what looked like Hebrew letters. I too, saw that, from my workplace window. This physcic said a young man in the midwest had video taped that cloud w! ith hebr ew writing in it. So, guess I&apos;m not the only one who saw both things. I was working at this business place from 1976 to 1986. By 1985, the cat in this note had disappeared and I had acquired other cats. I have vet. papers for all my cats but have never looked up ones for the cat of note to pinpoint date closer. I know it was July 25th for sure because I noted it was my sister&apos;s birthday.

Early this morning(november 3) my two young daughters aged 5 and 8, along with their friend(9) and my girlfriend(26)woke meto explain to me what they had witnessed just hours ago in the early hours of saturday november 3rd. It unfolded like this: At 2am of november third my oldest daughter and her friend were awaked by a very loud sound, described to me to sound like a rocket leaving the earths atmosphere(lot of thrust), upon looking out the window, which faces west and is right alongside bed, she saw over the trees of our property a rocket shaped craft speeding toward the sky at a reasonably high rate of speed and holding a steady course up. She then awaked her friend who was sharing the bed with her, as well as my girlfriend laying a bed away, to look out the window at the rocket ship ripping through the sky. The window is on the second floor and faces west. The visibility of the area of sky, from top of trees on property to highest visible point of sky is ample as the trees are low and the windows high.Note:  this morning i had both my daughter and her friend both seperately draw what they had seen and they were exactly the same. Also, my girlfriend cooborated the intense rumbling at the time of the sighting, so i know the children weren&apos;t fantasizing/dreaming/playing.Description: A perfect rocket shaped craft, long(vertically) shape with a conical tip. 2 to 4 unblinking yellow lights sat at the top area of the craft and did not flash or otherwise blink in such a way the FAA would require of an aircraft. They also described the presence of intense flames shooting from the rear, in true rocket fashion, as well as the possibility of some sort of window(s) along the lateral side of the craft. Lights were also seen at the bottom portion of the craft above the exhaust area. As it moved skyward it created a contrail of either smoke or steam.The entire sighting may have lasted no more than a couple minutes, long enough for it to appear over the treeline until it was no longer visible from the window.Not being a scientist or otherwise, i immediately assumed it was a launch of some type of rocket or military type craft headed for the great void. This after some thinking didn&apos;t sit well with me or make any sense for the following reasons. First off there is no known base in this immediate area, the description of the size was that of a large house, this coupledwith the level of detail they described led me to believe it was much closer than any launch from neighboring states etc. Also, my girlfriend, whom never turned to look at it as she was tired, described a dopplereffect. The sound she said began as a low rumble and peaked so loud she believed whatever it was would crash into the house, so it was close. The sound was that of a space shuttle launch on takeoff and not the whine of a passenger jet turbine. The most dramatic feat in question is that of it changind direction i.e altering its course in a marked fashion by turning about 45 degrees and keeping a course more or less straight up.Anyway, first thing after hearing this i phoned the local police station and was promptly accused of making a crank call. I spoke in length with the desk sargeant about this and he soon realized it was no joke an listened. He claimed no one els&#x5C;e reported the event after checking through the nights log and so on. I also asked him whom i should call to report the event and claimed he didn&apos;t know and furthermore there was no reason to as any military activity would have beed reported to them beforehand, which it wasn&apos;t.Could you please contact me with any information regarding this event, military rocket activity, etc.?

Video cameras collect 30, or sometimes 60 frames, per second.  Hence, the object captured on video by FOX 23 covered 60 degrees in approximately one-third of a second.  The ISS does not do that while in orbit.Do you concur with my analysis, please? Cordially, Peter Davenport((RESPONSE))Mr. Davenport,I&apos;m afraid I would have to disagree, given the location it&apos;s quite possible that the flight path trajectory of the ISS would have been similar. http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/elements/index.html((NUFORC RESPONSE))Direction of view, perhaps.  Elapsed time, no.  Please see the entries at &lt;www.heavens-above.com&gt; for stats on sighting  the ISS, and all other bodies in orbit.   The ISS is usually visible for up to 4-5 minutes, when it passes overhead, or within 30 degrees of overhead. The object in the video was visible...I repeat...for 1/3 of a second, during which time it traversed 60 degrees (est.) of arc, or roughly speaking, 180 degrees of arc per second. The ISS, when viewed from the surface of the Earth, passes overhead at approximately  1/2 degree per second, or less.

The view was most sharp and clear, and the cylinder was probably more than 10,000 feet up, and perhaps several thousand feet below our plane (maybe much closer, depending on actual size).  The visibility was clear and sunny - I could see the farm squares below.  The object was a deep but bright orange-red.  It didn&apos;t seem to have a real cone of a nose, but more blunted.  There were no wings and nothing being exuded out the rear.  I pictured something like an old fashioned cylindrical 500 gallon water tank but twice or three times as long and painted red.  The paint didn&apos;t even give a feeling of sophisticated, just heavily enameled. I thought of a large military missile, but could not conceive of how it would be propelled in the air.  Because of the plane motion the object almost appeared to be still, but the ground scenery way below changed at a different rate as the ground relative to our wings.  I saw it for perhaps 30 to 45 seconds - when you are observing something that doesn&apos;t belong, time can be a difficult thing to judge ... I did not look at my watch, though I specifically examined its relationship with the plane and the ground.  I looked back and forth from the ground out from front of plane to back, I looked at the other people in the plane, and noone was paying any attention, then I went back to observing the object.  The scenery below was farm rectangles, with rare farmhouses and barns, which were tiny compared to the relatively near cylinder.  It struck me as odd that since I was in the air, not my normal world (I am a land lover), then perhaps it was wrong of me to make any assumptions about what was right or wrong about the appearance of this object in the air below the plane.

Initially I was attracted by a series of reddish flashing/shimmering lights, arranged in 3 groups - forming the corners of a large triangle.  The lights moved from the corners down the edges of the object, then reaccumulated back at the corners.  I watched this object for appx. 2 minutes, and as I watched, it passed in front of several stars, verifying it&apos;s solidity between the 3 corners of lights.  It moved quite slowly and consistently from East to West, about 30 degrees above the Northern Horizon.  Before passing behind a stand of trees, 2 large spotlights appeared on the rear end of the object.  The spots moved in large, circular motions before disappearing.  I lost sight of the object after it went behind the stand of trees.  It made no sound that I could hear.  With no reference besides the trees and stars, I&apos;m hesitant to hazard a guess at the size of the object, but my intial feeling is that it was quite large - perhaps 100 on each edge.", "catena metallica dove le maglie di ferro erano sostituite da lingue di fuoco incandescenteItaly Casalabate (LE) july 1992 in the evening..i was 12 years old at that time.. i was on the bitch .. i was walking when the people see this thing: I SPEAK IN ITALIAN LANGUAGE: si trattava DI LINGUE DI FUOCO poste sullo sfondo del mare, all&apos;orizzonte.erano come cerchi concentrici che si pormavano progressivamente in seguito all&apos;avanzare di queste fiamme in cielo.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command scrambled the jets soon after unverified reports were received around 4 p.m. Wednesday that the contrail, seen near the Turks and Caicos Islands, was headed northwest toward the United States, said Lt. Cmdr. Curtis Jenkins, a spokesman for the Colorado Springs-based group. A contrail is a white trail of condensed water vapor that sometimes forms in the wake of an aircraft. The jets were scrambled from more than one base and more than one location, he said, though he did not know how many jets or from how many locations. Commercial airline pilots later reported the contrail over Florida and then over Indiana, after which no more sightings were reported, he said. The jets attempted to intercept and identify the source of the contrail, but no visual or confirmed radar contact was made, he added. &quot;I don&apos;t know that anybody was predisposed to think it might be some thing or the other,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&apos;t even know that it was a thing. It was just simply reports of contrails. We don&apos;t even know that it was the same one. We had reports from different places and NORAD did its job and tried to find out.&quot; NORAD is coordinating with the Federal Aviation Administration and is continuing to investigate the reports, he added.

Several people from Farmville to the southern tip of Pitt County reported an odd light racing across the night sky. J.K. Butler, a former Grifton volunteer firefighter, was sitting in the old Red and White parking lot about 11 p.m. Friday. He was there with three fire department friends when the sky around them lighted up, coloring everything from the ground to the trees to themselves a strange shade of green and blue. The light passed over them, he said. And when they looked up, it was so blinding they couldn&apos;t identify the object. &quot;We all just looked at each other like, &apos;What in the world was that?&apos;&quot; Butler said. &quot;I&apos;ve seen meteors and space junk and satellites. I ain&apos;t never seen anything that color. &quot;It had some good size to it, too, and it was up in the air pretty good,&quot; he said. His first thought: the light had come from a UFO. His second: another country was firing missiles in the direction of Pitt County. &quot;Maybe it was government-related. If it was, we&apos;ll never know,&quot; he said. Over the fire-rescue scanners mounted in the volunteers&apos; trucks, calls came in from Ayden and the Pitt County Sheriff&apos;s Office. Butler heard patrol cars being dispatched to check for something that had fallen from the sky in the area of Jolly and Abbott Farm roads. Sgt. Marty Burroughs sent three of his deputies to survey for damage, or possibly, a spacecraft between the Ayden Police Department and the two rural roads. They didn&apos;t find a thing, not even a small piece of space tin. &quot;The main thing we checked were houses to make sure nobody had been hit by anything,&quot; he said. Deputies found the houses to be safe and left the area. Burroughs had a dispatcher contact Lenoir and Greene county sheriff&apos;s departments to see if a craft had crashed beyond the county line. But nothing was reported. A deputy in Ayden and several Greenville officers reported seeing the peculiar light near Pitt Community College at Fire Tower Road and N.C. 11 &quot;They just said it was moving and it appeared to be descending,&quot; he said. Asked if he thought the light was a UFO, Burroughs said, &quot;It could have been. I don&apos;t know. I can&apos;t explain it. Sheriff Mac Manning jokingly chalked the sighting up to the work of a shiny red sled and nine flying reindeer. &quot;I thought it was maybe Santa Claus making an early run, but we ruled that out pretty quick,&quot; Manning said. Apparently, he said, the light was bright enough and big enough to attract quite a bit of attention. Manning said the sighting of whatever-it-was isn&apos;t a big deal. Deputies patrolling remote areas of the county report seeing things in the sky all of the time, he said. Whatever it was, it scared J.K. Butler &mdash; and his buddies. For two hours they watched the night sky, looking for something, anything that could help complete the puzzle to what they had seen; whether that be little green men or a plane with similar lights. He was asked if he&apos;d recently been watching the Sci-Fi channels series on UFOs called &quot;Taken.&quot; He said he&apos;d never heard of it, and after being informed of the show&apos;s angle on alien abductions, he said there&apos;s no way he&apos;s watching it now.

As we were approaching the grade into the mountains I spotted a craft heading for our truck.  I yelled out &quot; Dude, dude, dude a ufo!!!!!  and pulled over immediatly.  It was a spherus shaped craft with red, blue, green, and white lights.  They were not many small lights but larger lights which covered the craft.  It appeared to be tracking down the side of hwy 8 going east and rotating forward as if it was rolling through the air.  It was the size of a 16 x 16 sphere.  There was absolutelu no sound, noise or any sounds related to the craft as it passed us at about a 200 to 300 foot distance.  We both watched it as it disapeared to the east.", "A number of cases described a reddish clay residue that had been found at abduction sites.When I was a child I lived in a corner apartment on the first floor in New York state. One night when I was about eight years old, my mother had just left my room after tucking me in. About five minutes had passed when I saw a shadow of what looked like a thin man with no hair walk up to my window. The curtains were drawn shut, so I could not see detail. I was startled, and then I heard a scratching noise against the screen. I was so afraid that I couldn&apos;t move. I tried to scream but nothing came out. Finally, I was able to get out a yell and my mother came rushing in. I told her what I saw and she reasured me that there was nothing there and that she would take a look. She kissed me goodknight and left the room, with the door open this time. Later I could hear her talking with her boyfriend outside my window. The next morning I went outside and took a look at the window. There was a reddish, pinkish clay that had been smeared about 5 or six inches on the screen where I had seen the shadow. When I asked my mother about it, she didn&apos;t say anything.Years went by. It was always in the back of my mind, but I didn&apos;t dwell on it. Then in the mid to late &apos;70&apos;s I saw an episode of &quot;IN SEARCH OF&quot; with Leonard Nimoy and the episode dealt with alien abductions. A number of cases described a reddish clay residue that had been found at abduction sites. After I saw this it was like a light bulb had gone on. It made my hairs stand on end. To this day I often wonder if I had a close call with being abducted.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source elects to remain semi-anonymous.

In a very remote area. We were in our garden on a bright clear day. It wasn&apos;t very windy but a steady breeze was blowing fron west to east (5-10 miles per hour) We were both facing north and looking at the ground when we heard a noise like wind swishing over something and turned around to see a large oval shaped sphere less than 100 yards away floating above the tree tops going against the wind. We stared at it . It looked like a giant ball of mercury going from east to west against the wind causing a sound as the wind blew around it. it slowly moved across the tree top behind some trees at the lower portion of our property.I tried to get a better look at it and walked down the field to see were it went. Then ran to the workshop and called a neighbor down the road where the craft was heading. He ran out side but could not see it.This thing had no lights , windows, motor or anything it almost looked like a blimp but was so shiny it looked like a polished mirror surface IT WAS NOT A BLIMP OR MAN MADE BALLON it just dissappeared behind the trees.The strange thing was we (my wife and I I) never talked about it until a few days or weeks later. I said to her &quot;what do you think that was&quot; and she said &quot;who knows&quot; Till this day we can&apos;t remember where our kids where or why we didn&apos;t react more freaked out by this experience.

On or about the date posted a buddy and I climbed a ear by hill to read letters from home ( as we always did). 5 to 10 minutes after reaching the top of the hill my buddy pointed to a solid dull looking cigar shaped object which seem to be carved out of a very clear blue sky.

The object was just huge since we actually had to move our heads from left to right to see it end to end. Within 15 20 seconds the object seem to be shrinking horizontally in size till it just vanished. To our estimation the whole incident lasted not more than 30 seconds. We ran down to the school to report what we saw and a group of the other children were very exited when they say us we figured that they had also seen the object.

I also called a neighbor and asked that she come and witness this because we all thought we were seeing things. My son and I were petrified. He and I both even today remember the feeling of being scared.I went into the house after an hour and called the yarmouth Police Dept and asked if they had any calls on a UFO sighting, and the dispatcher laughed at me. He offered to give me a phone number of a UFO reporting organization, but I refused because this is a small town and I knew what was going to happen (and it did...a few people made jokes about this..like we were crazy).  I even went as far as to run around my house and double lock all the doors and windows (my heart was racing).

It got boring after a while. a couple minutes later i turn back and the object was turning, going the other way. This continued about 7 times. the UFO was going around in a circle about 7 or 8 times and it could have been the air force but I think it is very unusual for something go to in the air 7 times in the same area.

The &quot;UFO&quot; on the other side did the same after that.  The one &quot;UFO&quot; was left hovering in the sky, the bright light kind of twinkling.  The single UFO came and went off and on for the next hour, making random zig-zag floating actions in the sky.  My father came home later the night and saw it too, he said &quot;Oh my God!!! I thought you guys were joking..&quot; - The weird thing is that it was sooooo windy that night, and the whole entire sky had a sort of pale amber tint to it.  Our gate in the back yard kept slamming shut and my mom told me that earlier in the day she had heard a very loud noise around where the lights were coming from.  The pets were acting weird.  The objects were not moving at all times, so they were definetely not airplanes...but they were close enough that if they were helicopters we would have definetely heard them.

Something caught my eye. I looked up to the space between two giant trees outside Caffe Luna and I saw something moving steadily and quickly up at a little under a 45 degree angle. I would have thought it was a shooting star, a BIG shooting star, if it weren&apos;t for the upward motion. It wasn&apos;t a firework because it didn&apos;t leave any smoky or sparkly residue behind. Really, it was a streak of very bright, irridescent light that was . . . accelerating I think. Also, the head of it was very definded, like you would think a comet would be.

My bedroom window faced S.E. and had a great view of the horizon over the treeline.This event occured 5 days straight with slight variations in activity.What made this notable was this.On the first morning at about 05:00 to 05:30 I awoke to a very bright light in the SE sky about 3inches (by extending arm to measure) off the horizon.

I knew then that the celetial sphere should have moved it.NOW, it was daylight and the thing was &apos;still&apos; visible. Still twinkiling wildly.Later that day I mentioned it to my mother. She asked me to get her if I saw it again. And the next morning I woke up without prompting and there it was. I got up, brought over to see it. We watched it until the sun rose. This time I pulled out my &apos;kids&apos; telescope and we took turns looking at it. I can&apos;t recall the final magnification we used but this is what we both saw.(the resolution was not the best) But it appeared to be oval or disk like in shape, appeared to have lights on the leading edge, red and blue/or greenish.

Since we live in a big city here, I&apos;m absolutely facinated by the dark country skies to which every star in the sky can be seen, so as usual I was looking up at the stars through the front windshield and passenger window while my husband was driving. I immediately became aware when I saw the red flashing lights out of the corner of my eye.  You know those Christmas lights they call &quot;chasers&quot; that you can set the speed of the flashing by a remote near the plug-in?  That&apos;s what these lights looked like, very fast and rotating around the the circular perimeter, it was hard to miss.  With my mouth wide open in complete awe, I grabbed my husbands arm and said &quot;LOOK at that!&quot; What direction in the sky were they sighted? We were traveling North, and the lights were moving from east to west.Did you use any binoculars or use eyeglasses to view them? No sir, I don&apos;t wear glasses and we didn&apos;t have any binoculars unfortunately.How were the lights strobing like quick short flashes, random around the circular perimeter? They were flashing rapidly (red)in a rotating fashion (like the lights were chasing each other) around the circular perimeter. I&apos;m not sure if my eyes weren&apos;t just getting blurry from staring so long at these things, but I thought I might have seen them change colors once or twice, to the color of white, very quickly as well.Did you stop and get out of your vehicle to watch at all? Unfortunately no.  I wanted to but there were 16 inches of snow on the ground (there were no place to pull over because of the snow drifts from the plows)and it was 9 degrees out that night, and we were late getting to our next destination.  We just drove very slowly observing them from the windshield of our mini-van.Have you seen any ufos before this sighting? Yes, but these two were very different from the other time.  The first time was about 1993 in Kokomo, IN.My mother and I were getting some groceries out of the trunk of her car (sometime around 9PM I suppose, it was over 10 years ago) when a triangular object with 3 big red lights on each point of the triangle (the lights weren&apos;t flashing) passed low in the sky right over our heads.  It was about the size of a football field and moved silently. It was made out of some kind of black metal and had some kind of groovy patterns on the underside. It flew just above the trees and was so low that we could see these patterns. I don&apos;t remember much about being 15, but I&apos;ll never forget that.  It was my curiousity in researching if anyone else had any similar experiences with both of these types of craft that led me to your website.Did you tell anybody you visited about the sighting? No. We were travelling with our roomate and her 5yr old son at the time to visit my husbands grandmother.My roomate and her son were asleep in the backseat of the van, and I didn&apos;t want to scare them.Did they tell you if they have seen or heard about any ufos in their area in the past several years? My husband&apos;s grandfather used to watch them from the front porch of the same house we were staying at when my husband was about 10yrs old (he&apos;s 24 now).  Oddly, every Tuesday or Wednesday (it was one day a week at relatively the same time at night, around 9PM) it would appear in the same place in the sky.  The front door of the house faces to the east and the craft could be seen from just above the trees.  He passed away in 1995, and has been known to watch this thing once a week for years while he was alive. I heard this directly from my husband.Are you or your husband from Missouri? I&apos;m originally from Indiana, and my husband and I live in Virginia Beach due to him being stationed here in the Navy.  He&apos;s from Nebraska. My husbands family is from Missouri though, and his grandmother still lives there, whom we were staying with for the holidays.One more thing to add....  They were stationary when I first noticed them, then they began circling around each other very rapidly while moving from east to west and west to east again across the sky...sort of like they were playing or dancing. There were no other aircraft in the sky, and it was around midnight at the time.  There were no other cars on the road at the time either. We watched them for approx. 10 minutes, then they began to dim, or maybe get farther up into the sky so that they appeared to be dimmer I&apos;m not sure, but then they just vanished.I would like to thank you for sharing your similar story with me.  I&apos;m glad there is someone out there who saw the same thing and I know Im not crazy now.I&apos;ve never shared either of these experiences with anyone else, besides my mother and my husband out of fear that they would think I&apos;d lost it.  But I know in my heart these were not aircraft I was seeing, planes and jets just don&apos;t move like that.  It helps to know that people like you are out there investigating, and bringing some comfort to those like me, in knowing we are not alone.There IS something going on out there.Take care, name withheld((END))", "A flash of light streaked across the daytime sky at about the altitude of a jet, but at least 10 times faster.In my peripheral vision I saw a a light streak across a short distance of the sky--if it had been just a few feet away, I would have perceived its speed as over 100 mph.  Considering it seemed more like a few thousand feet away, it must have been going at least 1000 mph.If I had witnessed this at night, I would have assumed it was a &quot;shooting star,&quot; but the sun had been up for an hour.  It was foggy, but I could still see the blue sky clearly.  It left a short contrail that faded at both ends.  The incident and contrail seemed to close to earth to have been a meteor, even if it were possible to see it during the daylight.", "aircraft flying in the vicinity onlyMy husband and I noticed this object a few nights before my husband and I filmed it on 12-23-02.

She was frightened and called out to my father, &quot;Look!! Do you see that?&quot;. My dad was driving and couldnt look long enough.  When we got home a few minutes later, my mom was so scrared, she turned out all the lights and paced around the house looking out the windows.  She called the police and reported it and asked if anyone else had reported it.  Her behavior frightened me because I had never seen her act that way. She was one who didnt believe in those things at all, but she believed she had seen a flying saucer. I wonder if anyone else same time and place saw anything.

I estimate about 1/2 an hour later when I tilted my head back to take a drink of my beverage I noticed this object parked (floating) about 200-300 yards out and about 3 stories high. I placed my drink down and looked at it and wondered, what is that?  As soon as I looked at it I would estimate about 20 seconds it then began to move forward very slowly.  The aircraft did not fly over me, it went on a 45 degree angle and passed over about 50 yards from my left.  While it was approaching my position where I was sitting at I noticed there was no sound, no panels with nuts or bolts, no windows at all and most of all the leaves on the trees did not move and the dirt did not kick up.  I also noticed it had a white light underneath it located on the left side of the aircraft and it was moving back and forth in a slow motion like a scanner or copy machine would do. Im very familiar with aircrafts since I worked around them and I assumed it was an AF stealth stationed at Holloman AFB.

This aircrat (object) is triangular and the size of a stealth bomber and it had a very sleek and shiny black color close to charcoal.  When it flew over I heard a whoooo sound such as the wind hitting a telephone line.  I estimate its speed must have been about 25-35 mph. I know it was not a military plane, this one floated with no sound and no pulsion.  I dont know why I did not get up and look to see where it went, I know I sat there in dismay and maybe a little shocked at what I saw.  Once in awhile at night time I see streaks through the sky, I can tell what is a commercial airline, and I have seen falling stars but this is unique, it disappears into the night. To this day I carry my camera.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

We had just moved into the county recently from the county just north of where we were driving. We turned down a old road and were heading west when I pointed out a spiral cloud in the sky to my wife. I reminded her of a television show we saw a week or so earlier that talked about spiral shaped clouds that migratory birds use to gain altitude for long journeys. The show also mentioned that these so called twist tubes were said to attract UFOs. Our younger backseat passengers took note and my wife and I ventured into different conversation. About a minute or so later my brother and law&apos;s friend said slowly in a calm voice, &quot;hey guys, I think there&apos;s something in the sky by that plane.&quot; We all immediately looked into the sky and I saw an egg shaped disk approximately 1/6 the size of a commercial airliner which the object was following. Frustrated with trying to drive and look I pulled over hoping that this decision would not make me miss the event. When I stepped out I witnessed 9 to 10 seconds of object flight that convinced me that the truth really was out there. I saw the silver slightly elongated craft appear to taunt the jetliner as it moved back and forth quickly under the fuselage and stopping at window level. I would think that someone on the plane would have seen the object. I saw it go left of the plane a to the right of the plane&apos;s fuselage once, hesitating directly under the fuselage as it passed under. It then moved behind the tail of the plane, rolled out to the left, and faded up in altitude and out of sight quickly. When we all settled back into the car and took a breathe of air I barely had time before I excitedly pointed out two airplanes coming from the south or Dayton, Ohio area and how much quicker they were traveling than the robust air traffic in the almost crystal clear skies.

I kept looking out my window, on the drivers side, of my car.  As I was traveling SE, it appeared to be traveling in a north westerly direction.  As I traveled past it, I was able to quite clearly see the chevron shape of the lights.  I could not determine any shape of the body.  It was too dark and I was traveling approximately 55-60 mph.  My sighting consisted of glancing at the object and back to the road about 7-10 times.  I almost ran off the road twice because I didn&apos;t want to take my eyes off of it.  The formation of the lights was one light at its peak, with, I think, 5 additional lights on each side.  The lights were under the craft and exceedingly bright.  They were very clearly round, evenly spaced and on continuously.  They did not blink intermittently or change color and they were of a very brilliant and intense.  The size was immense.  I saw an plane flying in the distance and even taking into account the distance I was from the plane, the size of the plane was about the size of a fly in comparison.  The craft I saw also had one red light at the end of the right side of the other lights and I believe it was blinking.

They went over the top of the hotel, 90 degrees, and blinked out at about 60 degrees northerly. I feel certain that the cluster was a break up of some space vehicle (satellite, rocket etc), it was reminiscent of the debris that came over Seattle some years ago that created quite a stir.

Typical movements included circular loops and some very rapid vertical motions followed by rapid change of direction to horizontal and then followed by a loop terminating in about the original position. one characteristic was the instantateous change of direction of flight. another feature was the very brightness of the object: it was brighter than any nearby star and it did not flicker at all.I determined the motion of this object by referencing two stationary objects and sighting along to see what the motion was. the most rapid motion was vertcally downwards which happened perhaps four or five times during the two hours of observation. it was a very crisp clear night though a bit of fog developed later.other than the rotation of the earth displaying ever unfolding vista through the night, the only other bright object with motion was an aircraft flying basically north to south.certified true and correct ((name deleted)) B.

The flashing light would only occurred in dark spots on the ground as if it was intentionally bypassing areas of man-made illumination.  I turned asked a fellow passenger behing me if he saw the light and he replied in the affirmative.  When the flashing light reached the south side of Wichita it then turned to the west and I lost sight of it.  It appeared that the light deliberately avoided flying into Wichita.  I did not see an object, only the flashing light.", "Blue object seen in the Port Charlotte Florida area.Port Charlotte, Florida. On the night of October 9th, 2002, at about 11:45 EST, while walking the dog, I noticed a blue colored object moving across the sky very fast. There were no blinking lights or any other colors on the object, just a solid dull blue color. When I first noticed the object it was almost directly in my line of sight (I was basically looking straight ahead, then noticed it) and was at about 50&ordm; in the eastern sky. I really don&apos;t know how far away it was, but if I had to guess I would say it was maybe 2 miles away at an altitude of between 5,000 and 8,000 ft. This object was about the size of an asprin at arm&apos;s length. There were two commercial jets in the area at the time. One jet had passed directly over head about 30 to 45 seconds before I saw the object, at about 15,000 feet, if I had to guess. The other jet passed over about 45 seconds to a minute after I saw the object, at about 70&ordm;, and and altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. All three were headed in a southerly direction. More than likely both jets were headed to Southwest Florida International. This object did not leave any type of trail nor did it descend at any time; instead it kept a steady path across the sky, parallel to the ground. I could not hear any noise from the direction of the object, however the faint sound of the first jet that passed over could still be heard during the sighting. I could really appreciate the speed of the object when the second jet passed over. The jet seemed like it was just crawling across the sky compared to it. I was able to view the object for a total of about 6 to 8 seconds. The conditions were completely clear at the time. I really couldn&apos;t make out any definite form or shape but if I had to label the object as resembling any distinct shape, I would lean toward it being more ball shaped than anything else. It definitely did not appear cigar or tube shaped.", "This object exucuted manuvers that no man made object could at speeds exceeding any winged craft.In the spring of &apos;98 around 9:00 at night,I observed an object traveling from west to east at a high rate of speed (about 10 times the speed of a jetliner).The object then slowed to about 3/4 its original speed and made a knife-edged 90 degree turn to the right,then sped up to its original speed,made another 90 degree turn to the left,traveled about 1/4 mile,made another turn to the right.It continued this until it disappeared behind a group of trees.The object was a single white point of light, high in the sky,roughly guessing about 10 to 20 thousand feet.It didn&apos;t make a sound and it never flashed or blinked out once and there was no other aircraft around.This was observed by myself and another person.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At first I thought it was a planet because it was a different intensity than the stars. But when it moved it caught my attention and I called my wife and son over.  My wife said it was a plane, but I worked around airplanes and airports for almost 20 years and I knew it was not an aircraft. There was no regular beacon and as we watched an aircraft did fly over and you could see the difference.  It was quite windy at the time with gusts of at least 40 kph and I thought it might be a helicopter because it seemed to be affected by the wind but there was no noise and it had to be at least 5 miles away, and for the size of the light, it had to be bigger than any helicopter I have ever seen.  On closer inspection, we could see it was sometimes triangular, then looked like a straight line and other times a dot.  About 15 min after I first noticed it there was a streak across the sky.  Wheter it was related to this or just a meteor i can&apos;t say.  As for colour, (I am colourblind) I deffinatly seen it as red, but overall the light in the sky was a blueish. (Kind of hard to explain.)I think it must have been rotating at times because I could see the tip of the triangle pointing to the left(east) then at other times right or down, and i thing someitmes when it turned is when it appeared to be a straight line.  I did phone the city police to ask if anyone else had reported it but noone had.  My son and I drove in our car to a place about 3 km outside of the city to get away from the light pollution and try and get a better view, but it didn&apos;t make too much of a difference, it was still hazy.  On the way out of town itI had the light on my forward left, and it was in line with the street lights and the next time I glanced up it was to my right and my son said it had shot over.  Then it shot back to where it was origionaly.  We watched it outside the city for about 20 min but the only thing that really was different wa! s that i t &quot;flashed&quot; about three times over a 15 min period.  I didn&apos;t see this but my son was saying at times that balls of light were leaving and returning from it.I called a couple of people because I wanted them to see it and not think I was making it up, but one neveranswered the phone and the second was in a location where her house was behind a highway offramp that blocked her view to the south.  I also tried to call the Saskatoon airport but only got a recording.  Since nothing extraordinary was happening and my wife thought I was nuts, I stopped watching at about 0345 and went to be.

The structural detail, is what made it stand out from the garden variety landing lights of jets approaching the airport. If I recall,Tampas&apos;airport does not begin flight operations until 6 or 6:30, realizing this, I realized I&apos;m looking at something unusual. The object was the size quarter dollar held at arms length. I had ample opportunity to observe details as I was frequently stopping at intersections with my window rolled down staring at it (with my jaw hanging down). Object appeared to be about 5-7 miles to the left of my vehicle which would place it in a location to my east, between US Highway 41 and the campus of the University of South Florida. It seemed to be slowly drifting lateral to me. If it was as far east as Interstate 75, and the size it was to my naked eye,then this thing would have been really huge. If i had to estimate altitude, it appeared to be about 400-500 feet, but this is only a best guess. Object remained stationary, perhaps slowly drifting at times, and the intensity of its illumination changed every few seconds, i.e., dimmed and increased, in almost a blinking pattern.  2 (two) smaller orange-yellow orbs of light were ejected from the side of diamond shaped object and disappeared in a rapide downward motion. There may be possibility that this was a commerical blimp that may have been used in a recent Tampa Bay Buccaneers Football Game this month, but after it ejected the orbs of light, I quickly discounted that notion. I even considered a shuttle launch from Cape Canaveral, but I&apos;ve observed many shuttle launches at night from our Gulf coast location and there was an absence of a large smoke plume illuminated by the engine nozzles and any distinct arc of movement.

I was amazed to see a listing of a sighting from 1969 that was just like what I experienced as a boy. It has been a long time but I remember it like this.  I was playing in the yard at night with three other children who lived in the house next door. This was in Kent in the 1970&apos;s and it was very rural and quiet there.  It was a very still and clear night. We were playing hide and seek and happened to be in a group in the center of the yard. I was about 12.

The multicolors seemed to spin as if the disc was spinning. But I remember that just the colors were spinning. The craft itself was not spinning and this was evident because flames were shooting out the back.  Just like the short report I just read, it was very silent except for a deep muffled sound which sounding like flames burning. It flew right over the house and disappeared.

Dripping, a tail, and variable at times.I was driving East on US 30 as dark fell.  US 30 runs directly east &amp; west for 40 miles between Tama and Cedar Rapids, Iowa at this location.  I saw a brighter than usual light in the distance a few degrees south of due east through my windshield as I was eastbound.The light grew brighter until it appeared like a brilliant Venus would in the morning sky.  It even had a liquid appearance at times just like Venus at its most intense.  After about 5 minutes I noticed that it had not moved relative to the horizon.  This eliminated a plane coming in from a great distance to the Cedar Rapids airport which was almost directly to my S.E. from my positon.  Suddenly the light doubled in intensity and appeared for a time to have a forked tail pointing downward and it seemed to throw off a particle or two.  At one point I thought I saw a faint line coming down from it.  It stayed in the same place for over ten minutes.  It briefly faded down to a bright ball of light but then flared again to a brilliant white shimmering light more than three times the size of Venus.  About twenty miles away the red blinking lights of 1000 foot towers around Cedar Rapids, Iowa were now visible.  This object was twice as high up as their tops.  I estimate that it was 15 miles Southeast of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Highway 30 turns SE as it approaches the outskirts of Cedar Rapids and at this point the light disappeared or went out.  It reminded me somewhat of the Rendlesham, England sightings as it appeared to be fluid in its shimmering.  It was above the point in the atmosphere at which rising stars shimmer and are magnified by passing through the atmosphere.  As I drove straight east for over twenty minutes this light did not change its location at all.  A moving plane on a flight path would have shown some change relative to my own movement.  The variation in intensitiy of the light also argues against a hovering helicopter.  It may have been farther away also and much higher up but it had to be at least  2000 feet up compared to the 1000 foot plus communication towers in the distance.  It had an appearance similar to the &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot; pictures we have seen at some point in our lives.  I have just checked star charts and verified that Venus is now a morning star.

In the process of watching the sky my daughter thought she saw a star move across the sky.  She asked me to look and to my surprise I also saw what appeared to be a star moving across the sky.  It was not a shooting star because it did not seem to be falling but moving in a horizontal direction over the sky.  As we were watching this happen we saw another object, that also looked like a star moving towards the first object.  We continued watching and proceeded to notice several of these star looking objects moving all around.  They appeared to stay in pairs except for one that stayed seperate from the others.  As we watched them move we saw them come to abrupt stops in mid-flight and seem to be suspended in air.  They would make right angle turns and also appeared to be doing 360 circles within there air space.  They were not spinning in one spot but literally doing a full circle in the area and would go from that motion into either a 90 degree turn or shoot straight across the sky.  They almost appeared to be &quot;dancing&quot; across the sky but always within what seemed to be their &quot;area of space&quot; and in pairs except for the lone &quot;star.&quot;  It was simply amazing.  My daughter and I woke my husband up and he too came out and saw the phenomena.  My husband was in the Marines for several years and I know that there is nothing yet that can make such amazing movements and seem to suspend in air after a immediate stop in mid-movement.  These object did not fly down or come even remotely close for us to see them as anything more than waht appeared as &quot;stars&quot; that moved.My family has never in our life seen anything that we would even say has come close to a UFO so we are not used to this, admittedly we were a little &quot;freaked&quot; out yet completely amazaed and unafriad.I have always beleived that it is very arrogant to have the frame of mind that in all the vast spanse of space the earth is the only place where life of any form can be found so I do think that what I saw is for real and not something from this planet.  I just feel priviliged that I now have a personal experience with this type of phenomena.  I can only hope that we were able to catch it on video--I am only worried that they were so far up in the atmosphere that it will not show up.  I will be checking tonight when I get home from work.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this date.

It moved very quickly, almost like it wuz moving with the clouds.  When it got a little closer, I could make out a large triangular shaped craft of some kind with a red glow in the center and a strong soft white glow going around it.  It moved quickly over my head and the vanished into the clouds.  This was about 5 minutes before the sun began to come up.  My friend saw it to, so i know i wasn&apos;t seeing something normal.", "Large, white/gray v-shaped object, flying silent..This evening my wife and I were in our backyard comenting on what a clear night it was when I noticed a very large, white/gray v shaped flying object. When I told my wife to look in the same direction, she noticed it immediately! The object was flying south east and made no sound at all and there where no lights visible. We observed it for about 15 seconds then we lost sight of it when it passed behind some trees. There is an Air Force base just north of Little Rock.", "Stange light seen near Heathrow airport.My wife and i were returning from shopping it was a clear evening and no cloud and the stars were out, i was looking at the aircraft over head as we have a habbit of doing as they are so close to each other we worry about near misses.I then noticed a light which was brighter than the stars and was like a hallogen light in colour and it was moving right to left of our possition and seemed to float along with no paticular pattern when i mentioned this to my wife she said &quot;it was probebly a plane?&quot;. but i pointed out that all the other planes in the sky had red navigation lights flashing and as i said this an airoplane flew under this light and turned in a normal flight path where as this light just seemed to float on?.So which ever way it would go if this was an aeroplane i would have been able to see its navigation lights but there were none  then after a few more minutes it&apos;s light seemed to fade real fast i could still see it and then i saw it no more.In conclusion with so many planes in the sky and being so close to heathrow airport someone up there must have seen something? especialy the plane which flew under the light and as we live under the flight path for Heathrow we know which direction the planes fly in and this object floated across them.", "Crome object seen on Siesta Key Beach, FL and Pic.As my girlfriend and i were walking on the beach of Siesta Key, my girlfriend said what is that so i looked and saw a staionary crome oval shape object and blew it off as nothing when she said thats a UFO, i looked closer and it was not moving one way or the other so i said oh it&apos;s probably a reflection of a plane or something, we looked away for one or two seconds and looked back and it was gone, now there wasnt a cloud in the sky so i was looking all around for the object but never saw it again until i looked at the pictures i had took of the sunset after that. I have a interesting picture i would like someone to look at, thank you.", "Something odd scared the hell out of me and I swear to god it was realIt was late early a.m. I had just gotten off work and had been home for 1 hour or so. I made a snack watched a little t.v. and then proceded to bed.Upon lying in bed for awhile with my head opposite to the window, I began seeing lights reflecting/shining on the wall. They looked similar to an ambulance a fire truck or police. Some kind of emergency vehicle. I remember thinking what the heck is going on here. I did live in a very rural area at the time and I know I didn&apos;t hear any noise of sirens relating to an emergency vehicle.I remember lying there wondering what was going on. As far as I can remember I looked out the small window and saw nothing out of the ordinary...No emergency vehicle. So I climbed back in bed. Tried to blow it off as nothing.I tried going back to sleep wondering what the deal was. As I was lying in my bed I began to hear odd little noises. Quiet and suble. Kind of like voices, but they didn&apos;t make any sense. I heard some odd noise at the back door, but living in the country didn&apos;t think much about it.Then I felt a un-easy fealing like someone else was in the room. I looked up and I swear to god I saw a figure, not much higher than my water bed. At very most the figure was 3ft tall. It was staring directly at me. I looked at it, and remember thinking I am not seeing what I am seeing.I also remember a sense of panic. I suddenly could not move. I remember trying with all my might to move, but I couldn&apos;t. I couldn&apos;t move, couldn&apos;t speak or anything else. And I also remember be affraid for my life. I was never more affraid at that moment than I had ever been.Now I grew up out in the woods and in the country. I have seen wild animals, bear...deer...etc. Many people out of the area would be affraid of ther own shadow...in the great north woods so it takes alot to scare me. But I froze and can honestly say that I have never been more scared in my life.I have mentioned this story to a few others and they just think I am full of it. I did mention it to a roomate the next day that was sleeping in another room that night and he told me almost exactally the same thing that I had witnessed. A little more vague, but with substantial similarities without me going into detail with him.Additionally no alcohol, drugs or any other chemicals or stimulants were abused that night nor any time prior to that event.((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was completely stationary and remained so for at least five minutes. This was not a cloud. Although it was small it was a clearly defined object. I don&apos;t think many people had even seen it- you had to look very carefully.The strange thing is that my husband has seen the exact same thing about 3 years ago in Seattle. He was looking out of his bedroom window when he noticed a white object high in the clear blue sky.  It hung motionless. He grabbed his  video camera and zoomed in. It appeared to be a white circular shaped object After a couple of minutes  it seemed to change into a series of 5 smaller discs, which rotated in a circular formation and moved ever so slowly , (still stopping and hanging in space once in awhile,) out of the range of the camera. (He still has this film but has never sent it in anywhere.) When I first watched it I was in total disbelief. I have never seen anything like it.My husband had kind of passed it off as just a weird unexplained singular event, but  yesterday when both of us witnessed the same thing his previous experience seemed to have more credibility.We&apos;re very curious about what we witnessed. Does this sound like some kind of satellite? Wouldn&apos;t it be moving across the sky steadily, and are satellites so visible during the day?((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))Dear Peter,All the information I can provide is that from the Richmond District of San Francisco (about a half milenorth of Golden Gate Park) it was north/ northeast.  We were standing at about sea level and its elevation we cannot estimate, although it was extremely high in the sky, more than a mile at the very least. My husband actually says he saw it about 20 minutes earlier when he stepped outside the restaurant we were eating in. Then when we stepped out, he pointed it out to me. So it was there for at least half an hour, not merely five minutes.My father is an airline captain in Seattle as well (he flies for World Airways) and says he has neverseen anything like what we described.Thanks for sending along your report! And my husband is now vowing to take our video camera along with us more often when we go out.   :-)Best Regards,((witness name deleted))((END))", "They disappeared behind the only cloud in the sky.My wife and I in our balcony terrace. She was 22 and I was 31. Around five in the morning. The sky was clear. No clouds except only one small dark cloud in the center of the sky. Then appear 3 lights in our vision focus (I mean behind buildings)... from west to east, with erratic movement. They were not airplanes. No sound. Very fast pace and erratic up and down movements. Two of the lights were rounded and the third light was like a cigarette. The three light were yellow. The rare thing was the three went behind the only cloud in the sky and then disappeared. I mean, the lights did not go out from that cloud. We stand there for about 3o more minutes to see if the lights go out but the lights never go out from that cloud in the center of the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date may be approximate.  PD))", "Gossamer V-shaped object seen from OhioAround 11:30pm last night (the 27th, EST) I stepped outside to have a look at the night sky. I first caught sight of the planet Jupiter, rather bright and imposing, shining away in the eastern sky. Several winter constellations were also visible overhead and in the south, shining through a thin layer of haze and broken clouds. It was a rather chilly evening so I decided to leave my telescope indoors and just do some &apos;eyeball astronomy&apos;.After a couple minutes I suddenly noticed an object midway up in the east (about 50 degrees altitude) moving south. Its appearance was that of broadly V-shaped gossamer contrail, three full moon diameters wide, without any lights or form of illumination. I expected the object to begin to disperse and dissipate as I watched, due to its thin and wispy appearance. It did not! The object continued to move south steadily. I lost sight of it after twenty seconds or so when the object moved behind a bank of clouds in the south. It made no sound the entire time that I had it in view.Being an amateur astronomer for the past twenty years has given me the opportunity to experience a good amount of sky phenomena. I have never seen anything in the night sky that I didn&apos;t have an explanation for - until now! I would be very interested in any and all plausible explanations of the object I spotted. My only explanation - birds flying south for the winter - was quickly discarded when I witnessed the object move behind the clouds.", "Ufo over downtown Los Angeles witnessed by  a husband and wifeIt was in the shape of a slightly flattened soap bubble being oval in the horizontal and I assume circular in the vertical perspective. The hull changed color like a soap bubble but the color was the light source instead of a reflection of light.  It appeared to become more transparent when there was more light behind it and more light producing when there was less light behind it.  It made no noise and the inhabitants which I could see as profiles appeared to be human and it wouldn&apos;t really surprise me to find out that it was from earth as in a special air force plane. I could see the platform that the riders were standing on and the instruments appeared to be mostly centrally located except for one or two short panels nearer the outer edge of the ship. It also would not surprise me if there were no other reports of this because even though it occured in downtown L. A. anyone who has seen anything like a flying saucer is rediculed from the outset and not having proof ignored. That was my husband&apos;s report  . He was taking me to work on Figueroa and I spotted it behind a hotel on Olympic &amp; Figueroa. It was on our left and I was able to look into the craft and they were staring back at us. I was on the back of his Honda 450 motorcycle and got a great view.I am willing to be hypnotized to give better details. I gave a report to this site last year but I wanted to share my spouse&apos;s perspective. It was strange to see a UFO downtown but that was years before they developed the land. It was probably 75 or 76. But it was Oct.31st because I was working at 1200 12th st and there was a Halloween party that nite at work Morrie&apos;s Ballroom. It was only about 15-30 feet off the ground. There was 3-4 men that were leaning over what looked like a console at us. I don&apos;t know where they were from but I&apos;ll never know if I don&apos;t submit this form. It&apos;s been a mystery for a little over 25 years and I need to know if anyone has seen a Ufo that reminded them of a soap bubble that they could see through when the sun hit it just! right.It occured around sunset going westward.", "An X shaped object coming from south-west, hovering in sky and quickly left to the east.I was driving west on a main street through town, i noticed a large white light about 1 inch above the tree line to the left of me (south-west).  As i continued driving i noticed the light did not appearto move in any direction, but was very large in comparision to the stars/planets (a size of a penny to the stars, which i would put as the size of a pin point).  I drove several blocks and noticed it was moving in a slow, north/north-east direction, as i drove several more blocks it was now about one block to my south-west direction, about 100-150 feet above the houses in the area.  I was at an intersection of a stop light turning south (towards object) with another car, who was also stariung at th eobject.  At this close range i could see a definate shape,it was a &quot;X or cross&quot; shape with one set of &quot;wings&quot; larger then the other.  One set glowed red under while the smallers set was white.  At the tip of each &quot;wing&quot; was a white light.  The other car was watching with me for about 45 seconds and then drove quickly away.  I continued to watch the object which was almost stopped about 1/2 block directly in front of my car, still about 150 feet above the houses.  I stopped to watch it, it hovered for roughly 1 minute and proceeded directly east at a medium speed.  It seemed to be watching or looking at particular items.", "Previous Stealth sighting in Williamsburg areaI&apos;m just submitting this because it bears on the 11/1/02 sighting near Williamsburg posted on the website. We were visiting Berkeley Plantation near Williamsburg in June 1994, and I looked up and saw what I&apos;m sure was a Stealth bomber. It looked just like the pictures - black and triangular. I never regarded it as a UFO sighting since we were near military bases and I was very sure that it was a military aircraft that I saw. I don&apos;t remember it making a sound that I could hear, but it was flying pretty high so that&apos;s not surprising.((NUFORC Note:  The B-2 &quot;Stealth&quot; bomber is very loud, when it is flying at a high power/thrust level.  However, at a distance, it might be audibly undetectable.  We have no way of knowing whether the event is in any way related to the 11/01/02 event.

At about 20 degrees up we saw 2 very bright whitelights alernating from one side to the other at set intervals every 2-3 seconds.  Sat and watched a few minutes.  Lights did not move. I told my wife I would drive east out the main gatw then north on Interuban.  When I turned north the lights were gone but I saw a faint flat straight sterak going east  My wife went outside after daylight there was nothing in that area which would hold lights like these", "((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to The Daily Reflector, Grifton, NC, for permission to reprint their article here.

Several people from Farmville to the southern tip of Pitt County reported an odd light racing across the night sky. J.K. Butler, a former Grifton volunteer firefighter, was sitting in the old Red and White parking lot about 11 p.m. Friday. He was there with three fire department friends when the sky around them lighted up, coloring everything from the ground to the trees to themselves a strange shade of green and blue. The light passed over them, he said. And when they looked up, it was so blinding they couldn&apos;t identify the object. &quot;We all just looked at each other like, &apos;What in the world was that?&apos;&quot; Butler said. &quot;I&apos;ve seen meteors and space junk and satellites. I ain&apos;t never seen anything that color. &quot;It had some good size to it, too, and it was up in the air pretty good,&quot; he said. His first thought: the light had come from a UFO. His second: another country was firing missiles in the direction of Pitt County. &quot;Maybe it was government-related. If it was, we&apos;ll never know,&quot; he said. Over the fire-rescue scanners mounted in the volunteers&apos; trucks, calls came in from Ayden and the Pitt County Sheriff&apos;s Office. Butler heard patrol cars being dispatched to check for something that had fallen from the sky in the area of Jolly and Abbott Farm roads. Sgt. Marty Burroughs sent three of his deputies to survey for damage, or possibly, a spacecraft between the Ayden Police Department and the two rural roads. They didn&apos;t find a thing, not even a small piece of space tin. &quot;The main thing we checked were houses to make sure nobody had been hit by anything,&quot; he said. Deputies found the houses to be safe and left the area. Burroughs had a dispatcher contact Lenoir and Greene county sheriff&apos;s departments to see if a craft had crashed beyond the county line. But nothing was reported. A deputy in Ayden and several Greenville officers reported seeing the peculiar light near Pitt Community College at Fire Tower Road and N.C. 11 &quot;They just said it was moving and it appeared to be descending,&quot; he said. Asked if he thought the light was a UFO, Burroughs said, &quot;It could have been. I don&apos;t know. I can&apos;t explain it. Sheriff Mac Manning jokingly chalked the sighting up to the work of a shiny red sled and nine flying reindeer. &quot;I thought it was maybe Santa Claus making an early run, but we ruled that out pretty quick,&quot; Manning said. Apparently, he said, the light was bright enough and big enough to attract quite a bit of attention. Manning said the sighting of whatever-it-was isn&apos;t a big deal. Deputies patrolling remote areas of the county report seeing things in the sky all of the time, he said. Whatever it was, it scared J.K. Butler &mdash; and his buddies. For two hours they watched the night sky, looking for something, anything that could help complete the puzzle to what they had seen; whether that be little green men or a plane with similar lights. He was asked if he&apos;d recently been watching the Sci-Fi channels series on UFOs called &quot;Taken.&quot; He said he&apos;d never heard of it, and after being informed of the show&apos;s angle on alien abductions, he said there&apos;s no way he&apos;s watching it now.

We were driving south on Rt. 295 in New Jersey, and were maybe a mile north of Exit 31 (Lawnside, NJ). We were returning to Maryland and Virginia.  I was in the front passenger seat, and it was approximately 1:30pm..  Driver saw something to the left and ahead of us, and called my attention to it; it would have been in the southeast quadrant of the Rt. 295 and White Horse Pike/Rt. 30 interchange (Haddon Heights, NJ).  I got to see it for perhaps at most about three seconds; I feel if I had gotten to see it for even a few more seconds, I would have been able to decide more definitively how anomalous it really was.What I saw was a large, dark rectangular object, oriented horizontally, just above the trees, about 1.5 miles away.  It was the length (left to right) of two of my thumbs held at arm&apos;s length, and it was about 1/4 as wide (up/down) as it was long (this estimate of &quot;thumb width&quot; was done later, not at the time).  It was either black or very dark gray, and it was somewhat &quot;fuzzy&quot; in its outline, in a way I can&apos;t quite describe; it looked strange, unlike anything I&apos;ve seen before.  We were currently driving down a hill, thus the object, which I happened to see as the bottom of it just started to go below the treeline, continued to descend below the treeline (being on Rt. 295, we couldn&apos;t stop or slow down, of course).  The driver, who saw it for a few seconds longer, said she thought it was moving horizontally and downward, very slowly; I had the impression it was moving downward as well (since WE were moving horizontally and downward ourselves, it made it hard to discern how much of the object&apos;s motion was from it, versus us, but we both had the impression that it was moving itself, but very slowly).  We had our windows closed, so we would not have been able to hear any sound from it even if there had been any.  It was definitely not an airplane, nor a conventional blimp, and certainly not a helicopter; there were no wings of any kind, nor anything hanging down from it, such as the cabin of a blimp.  Had it been a human-built craft, it had to be landing, and quite slowly (far more than any plane could), and it appeared to be going down in an area that was fairly dense with trees.We were startled enough by this sight that we pulled off at the next exit, Exit 30 (Lawnside, NJ), which was only about a mile ahead of us.  Of course, it was impossible for us to tell exactly where it had been, but we drove though an old residential area to about where we thought we had seen the object.  Naturally, we saw nothing.  We pulled into a large shopping center (the one having the tall tower with the White Horse on top; no, the object we saw was NOT this well-known landmark that I knew even as a child growing up in NJ).  We looked around the skies in all directions, saw nothing.  After looking for about seven minutes or so, we got back onto Rt. 295 at Exit 29a, and continued southward.  For the next ten minutes, I kept looking out the back window of Sue&apos;s car, scanning the skies for any object, but saw nothing (not even any planes).  The weather was a bit chilly, but the air and sky were very clear, with visibility of (I would guess) tens of miles, with some very high clouds.As to the estimation of the size of the object: it was the length (left to right) of between one and two of my thumb widths, held at arm&apos;s length.  My thumbs are approximately 2cm wide; the distance from my eyes to my thumbs, approx. 60cm.  Using simple geometric proportion, the following table estimates the range of possible lengths of the object (ObjectLengthInMiles=ThumbWidths*2cm/60cm*MilesAway): Thumb Widths (2.0cm): 1.0 1.5 2.0 1.0 Miles Away 0.0333 0.05 0.0667 1.5 Miles Away 0.05 0.075 0.1 2.0 Miles Away 0.0667 0.1 0.133 Taking the middle estimates of 1.5 thumb widths, with the object being 1.5 miles away, gives us a UFO length of 0.075 miles, times 1600 meters/mile equals 120 meters, with the range being between 53 and 213 meters.  The 747 jets that NASA uses for the space shuttle program are 71 meters long, so the middle estimate puts the object at being 1.7 times the length of a 747.", "Red light above PortlandI noticed a red light at night (naked eye) coming from the east of downtown Portland about 20 degrees above the horizon heading west. The speed and size of this light was the same as when ISS &amp; Shuttle are docked together, but this light was red and did not fade away. This red light flickered abnormally in intensity as a whole. The event ended when it went behind the hills and I lost sight.", "Bright fast moving &quot;satellite&quot; changes from straight line movement to erratic movement and then disappears abruptlyCountryside, approximately 40 km east of Brussels, Belgium. Hot summer night, clear sky, some 15 minutes after sundown. Walking back from the deer stand (where me and my son of 15 had been observing game) to the car, we saw a fast-moving light in the sky traveling along a straight line from SE to NW. It looked like a bright satellite, it appeared to be very high. Our observation started when it was at around 40 degrees above the horizon, and we took it for a satellite.

It sometimes broke up into little tails or simply stretched out uniformly, like someone pulling at taffy.

The object originally appeared to be vertically oblong, and the object below it appeared to be a smaller metal sphere. We got the digital camera out to zoom in closer, and observed that there were bright blue and green lights surrounding the object, with a red flashing light on it&apos;s right side.As we watched, the larger object would reduce slightly in size, then change to a purple and green color around it&apos;s edge, then seemed to &apos;explode&apos; into a much larger array of light, probably three times it&apos;s original size, and highly resembled a wagon wheel with smaller lights on the tip of each spoke and single bright light in the center. The object at that time would be spinning. This can be observed and appears to be obvious on our video tape.The color of it at that time would change into different intensities of pinks, yellows, greens and sometimes blue and red. Then, the object would again reduce in size back to it&apos;s original appearance.The smaller object did not come out on any of our video, yet was obvious without the aid of any magnification. But because it was only shown by the reflecton of the light from the larger object, this evidentally caused it not to show up because of light and dark filters on our camera.Our video is approximately 15 minutes long and we also have several good still shots taken off the tape as well.", "I was was approximately 5:30 pm when I noticed a ball of light slowly decending. I then called my daughter to come out and see it. After watching for a few minutes she ran in to find the camera. By the time she came back out it had winked out. A few minutes after that two helicopters coming from Supmter (possibly the Air Force Base?) came out and started circling the area. About tem more minutes two more came out. Approximately 7:00 pm I saw a streak of light across the shy, it happened very quickly. One of the helicopters cut across the sky towards where the streak had been. More helicopters came out after that. I then saw the second streak around 9:00 pm and another helicopter proceeded to fly towards that streak, but both streaks were too fast.

From about a mile away I saw a bright light at the airport.  I passed it off as just being the beacon.  When I got closer I was shocked to see that there were two separate sources of light, one being the beacon and the other being unidentified. When I got to the precise area where the light was, which was about 1/4 mile from the airport beacon, I saw the object producing the light.  It was about 100 yards away from me at a position just above the tree tops.  I had a very good view of the craft.  I exited my truck and stood at the side of the road observing it for approximately 1 minute.  It was saucer shaped but had flat sides which did not come to a point. It was approximately 200 feet in diameter and had bright lights around its peerimeter and on to and bottom.  The lights varied in color from green to blue to white. It made absolutely no noise.  As I watched it I made a decision to leave the road to attempt to get underneath the craft as it was only 100 yards away.  I heard a vehicle coming down the road and looked in that direction to see if they were going to obvserve the object and slow down or stop.  I was only looking in that direction for a second or two and when I turned my head to watch the object again, it was gone.  It had made no noise at any time.

It was dark and we saw a slow moving, low altitude blimplike craft. There was no sound. We initially thought it was a blimp, but as low as it was flying, we should have heard the motor. It moved to the rear of my apartment building and we ran into my apartment which had a balcony. My Parents and Brother were in the apartment and joined us on the balcony. We saw it again moving slowly from left to right at about the speed of a blimp. It had lights which appeared to circle the craft. They were about the size of lights on a blimp but were not letters. Letters would have been easily read as low as it was positioned. What really convinced us that it wasn&apos;t a blimp was that after about 30 seconds of moving after we got to the balcony, it suddenly took off directly away from us and was out of sight within 5 seconds.

I was seated well aft of the wing on the starboard side of the plane with a clear view of the ground.  I noted a light shining on the ground at about our 4 oclock position.  I at first thought it was a police helicopter shining it&apos;s searchlight on the ground.  It was traveling in essentially the same direction and speed as our plane (B737-800).  I suspected it may be a light from our aircraft, but eliminated that possibility when the light went under some scud...and the scud was back-lit.  It would reappear on the next opening in the scud. That happened several times.  We were in clear areas for long periods of time when it would look like it would do zig zags at right angles to our path and then return to the same direction as our path.  None of these manuevers were in tune with aircraft attitude changes, except for it&apos;s general direction.  I called it to the attention of a man seated next to me and he too followed it&apos;s progress and witnessed it going under a thunderstorm cell and reappearing on the other side of the cell as we passed by.  He too had no possible explanations for the light.  Once in a while it would flare out to a wider area like a flashlight being raised slightly, but most of the time it gave the appearance of a cars headlight shining down a wooded road..with the flashing as trees obstructed it.  The squared nature of its movements would also give the impression of a car going on checkered board roads.  But, we were now moving at a ground speed of 525+mph and at 30,000+ft.  The light would not be as bright going through towns, but one could follow it&apos;s progress through them in the same general direction and occasional zig zag.  It would appear more brightly out in the open country.  We came upon a real strong band of thunder storms and the light went under them and except for one break was not sighted again on the flight.  Clouds obscured the ground on the descent into MSY, ! but when the ground did appear, the light was not there again.  All in all, probably the most interesting flight of a flight filled life.  The thunderstorm band was spectacular, it was the night of the devastating tornados just NE of our flight path.((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the passengers witnessed.  If the report is accurate that more than one passenger witnessed the alleged light, and that it did, in fact, disappear behind clouds, then it could not have been a reflection from the inside of the aircraft.  Had it been a daylight flight, a possible explanation of the sighting might have been the phenomenon known as &quot;Broca&apos;s Spot,&quot; in which a spot is seen on the ground where the plane&apos;s shadow is cast, but this phenomenon does not occur at night, obviously.

At the same time, my daughter and I were looking up and we both said, &quot;Oh my God,what is that&quot;? We both were looking at an object that was boomerang in shape, no lights, gray or dark-sky color, and made absolutely no sound at all. This craft was headed north and was immense in size. It was so big that the only way to see its shape was by the fact that it was blocking out the stars behind it. The event passed and my daughter and grandson left. I returned to the house to try to continue watching a movie with my neighbor. Later, at 1:00 a.m., I asked my neighbor to walk outside with me; I wanted to look again. As we walked off the front steps and looked up, my neighbor yelled and pointed up. There was the craft again! This time, the object was moving to the southeast and was directly above the house. It seemed to be in the same &quot;orbit&quot;, as earlier I had noticed the Little Dipper was nearby the object the first time and then as the night wore on, the position of the stars had changed too.Again, the object was near the Little Dipper. Another note; the neighborhood dogs were barking frantically when both events occurred. I do not know if this is significant or not. I was always a little skeptical but have tried to keep an open mind about these things. Today however, I am changed. I really want to know if anyone else saw this craft or not. I am going out again tonight to see if I can see it. I know it was not a stealth fighter or bomber - I have seen both, living close to McConnell Air Force Base. This thing was really, really big.

I was driving north on a busy stretch of Highway 99, 5-10 miles south of Yuba City, CA. Roughly 1-2 miles ahead of me, I saw a very large white/yellow light hovering at about 1,000-2,000 feet in the air, approximately 100 yards off the highway. As I approached (about 1/2 mile away), I could see three large, distinct lights in a row, and one small red/orange blinking light on the left (west). I assumed the blinking light was a landing light on a wing, so I briefly dismissed it as a plane or jet. But the object continued to hover (as far as I could tell, it never moved), and as I began to pass underneath it, I realized that the three large lights were arranged in an equilateral triangle formation. I couldn&apos;t make out an outline of the object, because the three white/yellow lights were too bright. Unfortunately, there was too much traffic to find a place to safely pull over and observe the object. But there were 3-4 cars in front of me and 5-6 behind me, so I have to assume that someone else saw what I saw. I know that Beale AFB is roughly nearby, so who knows what it was. I suppose it could have been a Harrier jet, but as near as I could tell, it wasn&apos;t making any noise.

I am fuzzy on the date of this event, as somehow, all three of our memories were temporarily wiped clean.  As awesome as this spectacle was, we forgot about it, which to me lends more questions than it does answers; Our memories of this event had just gone away -- that was until last night Dec 29, 2002, when my wife made a comment about a strange looking star, and then she said, &quot;was that like the UFO you all saw that night?&quot;  Then the forgotten memory hit me like a ton of bricks.  We must have told her about it before our memories lapsed.It was sometime in the summer around July or August when this occurred, we are not for sure the date.  But, ((female name deleted)), my sister-in-law, ((male name deleted)), my best friend and I were in my back yard.  They were smokers and my wife Stacie and I did not allow smoking in doors.  It was very late; I run an e-commerce site and at the time was keeping some peculiar hours due to some temporary bouts of insomnia.  I would guess it to be between 3-5am EST.I lay in a hammock looking up into the clear night appreciating nature.  The only noises to be heard were the whispers of us when we spoke infrequently and the whir of a happenstance car going by on the usually crowded Man O&rsquo; War boulevard, a major road running through Lexington, KY, which my backyard borders.A jet in a normal traffic pattern began to fly from east to west.  I heard it above us, the unmistakable whining of the jet engines.  However, this time, the plane sounded distressed, in retrospect, I believe that the tremendous noise, the strain on the engines were the pilots trying to pull-away from the object in front of it.  Although, with some of my memories still being clouded, I believe that the plane may have been distressed and the object in front of it was saving it from disaster, either way, I doubt that I will ever know the whole truth.  Whatever it was, we all now saw it.  We were in awe looking into the sky, we saw an object, which was masterfully crafted, and expertly engineered open it&rsquo;s hull to accept the whining passenger jet.The massive hovering object sat in the sky above Man O&rsquo; War Boulevard, just to our west and allowed the plane to fly seemingly safely into it.  It then closed it&rsquo;s cargo door and with a strange whining/buzzing/electrical noise took of in a streak leaving behind a tremendous explosion which I assumed was a sonic boom.  It ripped into the night sky creating a huge, beautifully galactic light in it&rsquo;s wake, reminiscent of the Aurora Borealis mixed with the most fantastic lighting storm that you have ever seen.We sat there now in the wake of a booming explosion, and then quiet, nothing happened.  No neighbors came to their windows or doors to inspect the calamity.  No sirens, which was surprising as Lexington&rsquo;s Fire Engine Station 16 sat nearly directly below where this occurrence happened.We all looked at each other with many mixed emotions &quot; fear, dumbfounded ness, shock, amazement.  I said, &quot;What in the hell just happened here?&quot;  No one answered.  They stared into the sky trying to figure out the grand, celestial event that had just displayed itself in front of our very eyes.  If there hadn&rsquo;t have been other witnesses to this fact, I would never have mentioned it to a soul for fear of being called crazy.

This small object had three lights on it, two red one blue and made some strange noise. I ran into my house and got binoculars and went back outside.

I was watching two Navy Jets (trainers orange/white) practice formation flying and then begin to dog fight.  They were having a good time of it and all over the sky.  I am not sure of the altitudes, but it was probably never lower than 8,000&apos; to 10,000&apos;  I was watching them with my binoculars for about 45 minutes to an hour.  The sky was clear of clouds, but a bit hazy.  I was looking to the north with the morning sun behind me.  The two jets joined up in formation and started flying to the east by northeast.  I guess flying  back to the Naval Air Station in Kingsville.  As I watched them depart, an object slowly entered my area of vision in the binoculars.  The object was moving in the same direction of the departing jets, west to east, but moving much slower than the jets.  Maybe 150 mph based on the jets speed in departing.  Hard to tell.  I heard no sound, but had heard the Navy Jets very well all morning.  The object was in the shape of a long cylinder.  It looked to be narrower in the center and the ends were the same thickness.  The narrow center section of the object was a hazy red color while the rest of the object was silver.  The front, middle and back section were all about the same length.  I know the object was about 3 to 4 times the size of the Navy Jets, because while I was watching the object, the two Navy jets returned and buzzed the object two times (under and over) before departing again to the east by northeast.  I could hear the jets after the first pass, but nothing ever from the object.  The object did not have wings or a tail that I could recognize.  The object continued to the east at a steady rate of speed until I lost sight of it.  I don&apos;t know why, but I got the feeling that the object had been watching the Navy Jets practice too.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the individual who submitted this report, and we found him to be quite credible, and we suspect he is an exceptionally good witness.  He is a former military jet pilot.  The witness, based on his experience, believes that the two aircraft were aware of the presence of the unidentified object, and that they many have left the area because of its presence.

It was necessary to focus intermittently on traffic until the vehicle could be stopped in a supermarket parking lot.  At that point, while still visible, the object simply disappeared, leaving nothing but a small and dim point of white light that continued to fade until it too disappeared.  Elapsed time from the initial glimpse until the light faded completely out was less than two minutes.The observer is a 59 year old former police detective who has extensive experience in microwave and RF engineering, and in uplink satellite telecommunications.  He is also very familiar with most types of aircraft including military.  The observer has had no prior sighting experience.The object appeared as a black dot, initially about 1/8 inch in size at arms length.  It was at altitude; although it&apos;s impossible to say how high without a frame of reference for size.  From the observation point it appeared at a heading of about 080 degrees and at an elevation angle of around 40 degrees.In the busy airways of the Dallas/Ft. Worth area it would have gone completely unnoticed except that it was showing a brilliant white light similar to that of the landing lights of jetliners but much brighter.  The light was many times the magnitude of the brightest star at night, and was very clearly visible in the daylight.  The object was not moving.  There was absolutely no cloud cover in the entire area.A departing jetliner was in the outbound pattern about 25 degrees to the south of the object appearing to be at around 5-7 thousand feet; but it was not close enough to gain a comparative perspective.  A good guess would be that the object was at at least the same altitude or higher.  There were no other objects aloft that were visible to the observer at that time.The observer initially thought that the light was a reflection from the sun on the side of an aircraft until he realized that the object was not moving, was much higher than local helicopter traffic, and that the color and brightness of the light seemed inconsistent with the sun&apos;s reflection.  Within 90 seconds after it was seen, and as the observer gained a stationary vantage point, the object disappeared.

It was generally clear; the only clouds I noticed were at the horizon where the sun was setting. Just as I was about to approach Vietnam Vet&apos;s, I slowed down for a traffic light.  I happened to glance up, and noticed a metallic object quickly going by.  It was at my 11 o&apos;clock position, traveling from NE to SW.  Just as I saw it, the sun glinted off of it, and then it simply vanished. Since I was at a stop at the light, I had time to really look for it, but it was nowhere to be seen.  There were absolutely no clouds up there that it could have gone behind.  I remember thinking as I first saw it that it was strange that it was not leaving a contrail, as the other planes were. I could not judge the altitude, but it looked like it was considerably lower than the planes were.  It looked bigger than the planes I had seen, so I&apos;m assuming it was lower.  It did look spherical, but of course, right as I noticed it the light reflected off of it, so I could not say for sure that it was.  I know I didn&apos;t notice any wings. After it disappeared, I tried to make sense of what I saw, and thought that just maybe I had seen a plane.  Then I happened to see a real plane as it was making approach to the Nashville airport.  I could see the wings and everything, even though it was many miles away, and the object I had seen was almost directly overhead.  I realized that 1) if that had been a plane that I had seen that was just too low to leave a contrail, I would have seen the wings, and 2) the reflection flash happened on the opposite side of the craft from the setting sun.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I noticed the object in the sky and said, &quot;what is that?&quot; We pulled into a parking lot and observed the object for awhile.  It was very large and was goldish in color.  The edges were not smooth, but kind of jagged-almost like a sand dollar.  There were marks on the outside of the top of the object.  It was completely soundless and was bobbing up and down at the sides very much like a gigantic balloon.  As we watched the vehicle slowly moved westwardly and higher in the sky.  We got back in our car and breifly followed it, but it dissappeared into the distance.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The tractor stalled on the way, so we left it there in the driveway, and walked dwon to the mailbox, and upon as we were walking back to the house, noticed how bright the evening star seemed that evening.  The four of us were in our mid 20s, tow males, two females.  Upon reaching the house, one of us noticed that the evening star seemed to be getting bigger and brighter, and we all went over and leaned on the fence, and watched as it became clear that it was an object approaching from the west, in the clear twilight sky.  after about an hour it was getting quite large, and was approaching our location directly, and shortly after that it was right overhead.  All the animals were quiet, and we all felt that it was going to land.  One of our group (female) ran out towards the object, which was as large as 1/2 acre accross, and had red lights on the edges.  We tried to discourage her, but she returned without incident to our position at the fence.  It seemed to hang there for a while, and we felt as if our thoughts were being monitored, very odd.  Just as it approached right over the farmhouse, it took a turn to the south and within a couple minutes it gained speed and vanished over the southern horizon.  We were all elated and a bit frightened to go back in the house (aliens in there?), but worked up the nerve, and had no problems, and the following day, the tractor started right up.  One of our group contacted Wright Patterson AFB about it and was not called back about it, and we seldom talked about it after that.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was very dark out, an overcast of thin clouds with about a 1500 foot ceiling based on the commerical airliners landing at Salt Lake International airport at the south end of the Great Salt Lake.  As I took out my car keys from my jacket, I happened to look up to the north end of the valley and saw several aircraft on final descent to the airport. As I was watching them for a moment, I also noticed what appeared to be three lights (white, red, and another white) horizontal to each other skipping between the landing aircaft.  The unidentified lights traveled from the north end of the valley to what appeared to the the airport in about 10 seconds or less and I estimate the distance to be about 30 miles or so in that 10 seconds.  It did not fly in an straight line, but seemed to hop skip a little above and below as it traveled horizontally.

I was staring in the sky when I went out to smoke a cig in the yard, and then, probably in the southern part of the skies I have suddenly saw a strange thing - it looked as if a new star in the sky has lighted up. Maybe this star was there in the sky already for millions of years, so I thought then that this might be only some kind of mispercepcion of the eye. But then, this &quot;new star&quot; gradually started to become more and more bright. I could even hear the sound of it - it was something like a humming sound of mid-frequencies, but it gave me an impression like this sound is very far away - or should I say - this sound was like a plane sounding, but very far and contextual. On the other hand, this sound was very interesting, even relaxing and somehow hypnotising - maybe it was only because I like minimalistic music style. OK, it doesn&apos;t matter for now. The next thing that happened, was even more strange - it was really something. This &quot;new star&quot; - after it reached some kind of certain level of brightness - started moving - or floating - in the sky. I don&apos;t know how to explain in the words, but this view was really fascinating. But the most amazing thing - it was the figure, that this star has drawn in the sky (it left no trails, no nothing). this figure was that of a question mark - like this - ?, but with no point at the bottom. after making such a figure, it started to become less and less bright (i.e. the reverse process of the beginning has started) untill it has reached the same level of brightness as in the beginning, and went back to its place - the place in the sky, where it has appeared (or maybe it did not appeared - I don&apos;t know). But then, the thing happened, that really shaked me - this little star, after going to its place - actually was in one of the three corners of bigger triangle in the sky - i.e. in each corne! r of thi s triangle there was a star, although, there were no lines, no nothingwhich was connecting those corners. So, after all the thing that I saw, could be named as the &quot;spy, sent out for investigation from the corner of the triangle in the sky, the origin of which - I am 1000% sure - was xtraterrestrial.", "Aurora borealis looking lights on the horizon shoot overhead to form a pulsating circle consisting of eight curved rectangles.My husband and I, two elementary school teachers, were driving around 9:15 P.M. south on the Pa. turnpike (Rt. 746) just south of exit 35, the Pocono exit near Lake Harmony.  There was great visibility for several miles since we were high in the mountains in spite of the rain and mist.  Straight ahead in the southern sky above the tree lined horizon we both noticed from 5 to 8 undulating, free-formed, fuzzy-edged, vertical shapes consisting of medium to light blue lights waivering back and forth.  Their length was approximately 1/16 of the total curve of the sky.  Our first thought was northern lights or swamp gas.  However, in a flash, these hazy, soft, undefinable shapes shot to the ceiling of the thick cloud cover overhead.  While still maintaining their fuzzy edges, they took on fairly distinct slightly curved rectangular shapes that together formed a huge broken circle that must have covered perhaps a hundred square miles. There were approximately 8 of these soft-edged blue rectangles with convex and concave ends equally spaced apart.  The whole circular configuration looked like a sliced, sectional donut of bluish-white lights.  As we watched, suddenly the lights began pulsating in and out, converging in the middle and then expanding back to the original size at approximately 1/2 second intervals.  In an instant it shot down to the right side of our field of vision into a smaller, pulsating formation, maintaining the same shapes while hovering about 1/3 of the distance above the horizon. It held the same configuration for about 15 seconds when again it traveled back to its original position into the same immense circular arrangement of rectangles.  After pulsating for about 5 seconds, the formation converged and flew over the sky to the northwest horizon, behind us.  At this point, since I was driving, I couldn&apos;t see it, but my husband said it shot up through the night in a semi-radial pattern with equidistant spaces between each pale blue wide beam of diffused light dissipating to black.There were several cars on the highway at the time.  We wondered if anyone else had seen this phenomena.  Lights from the ground cannot be an explanation since no source on the land could have sent its beams that far.  Besides the light seemed to come from above.  No aircraft could be spotted.", "flying disk over northern Peoria, IllinoisI was about five and remember it was around the time of the Apollo 11 moom landing.

Although I did not personnaly see the event happen, the whole town knew about it, and it was reported in the Local Newspaper, and admitted by the local police department and the local U.S.A.F Base near Del Rio.  Here is Del Rio&apos;s real U.F.O. story as I remebered it from my youth in 1957:  One night, a local Del Rio traveling salesman who frequently traveled east on US Highway 10, from Del Rio to San Antonio (165 miles away}, was engaged by a cigar shaped UFO.  The UFO hovered over his car with oscillating multicolored lights.  The UFO caused the car&apos;s engine and electrical system to shut down.  When the salesman looked out his car window at the UFO, he was severely burned on his face.  When the UFO left, the salesman being terrified, restarted his car and returned to Del Rio, (he was about 30 miles east of Del Rio when he encountered the UFO). When he reached Del Rio, he went to the hospital for burn treatment and the hospital reported the unusual circumstances to the Del Rio Police Dept.  This type of encounter may not seem to odd until you hear the unusual thing that happened to the salesmans new &quot;two-day old&quot; car within the next few days.  The next morning, it was obvious all the paint on the salesmans new car had been completely burned off. Within a few days the outside of the car had &quot;totally rusted&quot; from exposer to the UFO. The local Ford dealer could not account for the &quot;sudden&quot; paint loss and rusting on the car.  As I recall, the local Ford dealer gave him a new car and the U.S. Air Force took the car away.  The local Del Rio salesman suddenly left Del Rio and was never seen in Del Rio again. This story is true.  It really happened in my home town in 1957.  Many of the old-time residents in Del Rio remember going down to the police station and seeing the &quot;new rusting car&quot;.

PD))((COPIED TEXT FROM http://anomalies.bravepages.com))Written Report of UFO Sightingby Rod BrockI was sitting out on my patio, smoking my pipe. The weather was clear and cold. The atmosphere was very stable and the starlight was very steady ( the &quot;seeing&quot; was &quot;good&quot;). I had gotten into that sort of meditative state that some pipe smokers may be able to relate to, puffing away on a Christmas present of &quot;Sweet Killarney&quot; tobacco from Ireland. I wasn&apos;t thinking anything in particular - just relaxing, periodically looking up at the stars.I heard the faint rumble of a jet airliner above, which is common around here, as I live beneath the flight path of airliners on their way into the Vancouver, B.C. International Airport, about 50 miles distant. Absently mindedly, I looked up...I saw the airliner, with its landing lights on, traveling the same course that airlines always travel over my house - towards the northwest. But -- and from this point on it is difficult to describe my feelings -- there was something else there, moving in an almost due-west direction. The immediate feeling was a sense of unreality, and a kind of boggled amazement, at what I saw.My brain took a few seconds to process what I was seeing. It was a brilliant, vivid orange light on a westerly heading, moving at a tangent to the airliner&apos;s northwesterly heading. The object was several orders of brightness greater than Venus at her brightest (Venus =~-4.0), but it is difficult for me to assign a visual magnitude to this, as I have no basis for estimating point sources of brightness greater than Venus, since Venus is the singly most brilliant (apparent) point source in the night sky. &quot;Brighter than -4.0&quot; is the best I can do. On first sighting, the apparent separation of the anomaly and the airliner was perhaps 5 degrees, with steadily increasing separation thereafter...however, I did not focus on the airliner... I jumped up, and stood stock still staring at the object. It was like my brain was trying to make sense of it...because, in addition to the brilliant orange light, there was something above it, moving with it - attached, unattached...? I can&apos;t say. This &quot;something&quot; moving with the light had a startling appearance - cigar shaped, fully 1/2 degree in length, and it was rotating slowly in a clockwise direction, so that I was looking at its axis of rotation, around its center, like looking head on at a slowly rotating airplane propeller. This rotating object was sort of...ghostly in appearance...it had a faint orange luminosity, yet parts of it seemed dark, and the orange luminosity seemed to shift around as it rotated. It was situated a couple of degrees above the bright orange light, but the two anomalies were moving perfectly in tandem, as if connected.My mind, almost unbidden, started flashing through possibilities. The first thing that flashed through my mind was reentering space debris. But that was not it - I have seen the reentry of a spent Russian booster, which, while spectacular, was nothing like this...with the solitary bright light, and the rotating object above that, this was just too &quot;mechanical&quot; seeming. Not chaotic and fragmenting like a reentering piece of space junk. Furthermore, it was traveling on a due- west course (as opposed to the characteristic due-east path of man-made spacecraft ).The second thought that raced through my mind was that it might be an aircraft, at altitude, which had experienced a catastrophic failure of some sort. For a moment, I thought this was what I was seeing: a fuselage in pieces, burning, tumbling down out of the night sky. The immediate gut level reaction was curious - a brief feeling of relief that it was finally identified, followed by the sick feeling that would accompany the viewing of an aircraft falling out of the sky on fire. Momentarily, however, both my impromptu hypotheses were banished because, about 3 degrees directly above Alpha Pegasi, the bright light abruptly stopped [30 seconds from first sighting], and when it stopped I could no longer see the rotating object, but the brilliant light remained, orange in color, and sharp (not diffuse, but rather, starlike). It remained stationary for [approximately 15 seconds], and then it began to backtrack along its original course, moving very slowly. The rotating object was no longer visible - only the light. However, as I continued to observe it in this ascending course, I saw that it was manifesting a left-to-right, right-to-left swaying motion, perhaps a degree or two in either direction, that called to mind the image of a LEAF FALLING UPWARDS. I began to feel very strange -- almost fearful -- as I realized that the left-to-right, right-to-left stops and starts were very precise and mechanical...zip-zip-zip. It reminded me of the way a hummingbird flies. At this point I realized I was trembling (not from the cold) and I heard my voice say &quot;Jesus Christ...&quot; [ falling leaf motion manifested for 15-20 seconds][~1 minute into sighting]Suddenly the object began to move in a more conventional manner, slowly following an arcing course towards Cassiopeia. Briefly the object passed behind the top of a tall fir tree, where I could see it off and on through the branches. At this point, I suddenly decided to run (literally RAN) for my binoculars. It took about [20 seconds] to get them and get back outside.[~1 minute 20 seconds into sighting]When I returned, the object was still there, moving along towards Cassiopeia. I raised the binoculars (10 x 50mm) to my eyes and got the object into focus. Now, it appeared to be a solitary, cigar shaped object, I would estimate between .25 deg&lt;[length]&lt;.50 deg, and inclined so that the bright light, which was on the left end, was lower than the diffusely glowing right end. The object was still in motion, and as I watched it through binoculars, the right end swung further upwards, so that the &quot;cigar&quot; was now perpendicular with respect to the horizon. As in the case of the rotating object that had previously been visible, the diffuse light seemed to shift around on the object as it changed its orientation. At this point, the object was located about 10-12 degrees beneath Beta Casseiopeia, and still moving, slowly.[25 seconds of binocular observation].[~1 minute 45 seconds into sighting]Abruptly, I decided to call my girlfriend and tell her what I was seeing - I popped through the patio door into the kitchen, grabbed the handset, and hopped back out onto the patio. This only took a few seconds, and I did not dial immediately, but continued watching the object move (without binoculars, now, although they were hanging around my neck). The object had reached, roughly, the center of the constellation of Cepheus when suddenly, in a downwards direction, perpendicular to the horizon, it emitted, very rapidly, a solitary white starlike object of about 2nd magnitude that descended about 10 degrees and winked out. As it emitted this starlike object the bright &quot;mother&quot; appeared to fade slightly, and then it brightened once again to its former luminosity. A few seconds passed, and it suddenly emitted another starlike object, identical to the first, which also descended about 10 degrees and winked out. As it emitted this object, the light seemed to flicker (it reminded me of the way a fluorescent lamp flutters when you first turn it on)and then it simply disappeared from view. It was simply gone. [final phase of observation 30-45 seconds][~2 minutes 30 seconds, total observing time, &plusmn; 15 seconds]I called my girlfriend, immediately got a time check from her, and yammered excitedly to her about it. She was very interested, but calm, and, knowing my involvement with ufology, told me I should write a report immediately (which I was going to do, anyway). So, I carefully reconstructed what had happened, judging various elements of the account by recreating where I had been standing at various points throughout the observation, which stars the object had passed in front of, and testing that against where the object had been situated above/behind the sillhouettes of nearby trees. I timed how long it took me to run in the house and grab the binoculars from a drawer in my bedroom, and run back outside, discarding the lens-caps willy-nilly as I went. And so on. In this manner, I worked out the approximate lengths of different phases of the account, and then established a range for the duration of the account, to allow for errors in my estimation of how long the total time of the observation was (3 min.&gt;[duration]&gt;2 min.)After doing this, I stepped outside for a moment, found my abandoned pipe, and relit it, looking up at the sky. A minute or two had passed, when at zenith I saw a &quot;star&quot; of second magnitude blink into existence for about 2 seconds, and blink back out. No movement was apparent. It occured to me this might have been an iridium flare, but I have no such certainty - I will need to look into that possibility. I found it strange enough after the earlier event to once again call my girlfriend and tell her about it.I have created &quot;snapshot&quot; starmaps, showing the direction I was looking, my long./lat., and the appropriate date and time. For this purpose I utilized &quot;Your Sky&quot; online software. I also created computer graphical &quot;sketches&quot; utilizing Adobe Photostudio and MS Paint.BACK", "Grey Banana W/O lights or soundIt&apos;s been a while since this occurance but the craft is still very clear to me.

There&apos;s probably a good explanation.", "a bright star looking object that glowed brighter then dissapearedme and my wife were driving along a back road, just talking. it was clear and pretty day. we were heading west and you couldn&apos;t notice these two lights in the sky. i already new what they were, because i had seen it before one night. i ask my wife did she see them? she said &quot;yes&quot;. i told her that  is what i seen one night. i couldn&apos;t beleive it, i am actually seeing it again. i went into town and asked people that were standing out did they see them? no one seemed to notice. the first time i seen it was a few years earlier. i was laying out early one morning(3am-4am)in my girlfriends driveway. at first, i thought it was a shooting star, but it didn&apos;t burn out. then i thought it was a plane, maybe a jet. it was moving quickly. but i know that planes have red &amp; blue lights on the wings and i think a red light on the tail. this object had no other colored lights. i didn&apos;t think anything strange untill it started glowing really bright. it went from what looked like a star to a street light in the sky. at that point i sat up, i was laying on my back. i asked my girlfriend did she see that plane go into a cloud and started glowing. i probably sat another hour starring into the sky waiting for it to come out the clouds. it never did.it kinda scared me. i thought it may have been a space shuttle blowing up. the light in the sky was so intense, it put you in mind of the beams you hear people joking about coming from spaceships. the one that comes down and picks you up but only it was in the sky. that made me wonder if i had been abducted. but i know that i didn&apos;t feel any different or feel like i had been anywhere. my girlfriend didn&apos;t see anything. the 2nd time i seen it me and my now wife was traveling a back road. we were taking the long way into town. about 3 mile out of town i seen them in the sky. i touched my wife and told her ther they are, that&apos;s what i seen that night. i had been telling her about it for years. there were 2 softball size(from where we was) bright light in the sky. we both seen them. t! hey zig zag a little bit in front of us, just out of sight to tell what they really were. then one went into a cloud then glowed and dissapeared. the other just glowed in the open and dissapeared. we both made sure we really saw what we did, or stories matched. i didn&apos;t tell, her but again i wondered had we been abducted. but i think they were just letting me know that i really seen what i had seen that night. i had tears in my eyes but i wasn&apos;t scared. nobody in town had seen a thing. i told my wife that there was no way we were the only people to see light that bright in the sky during the middle of the day(3pm). if any know what the lights  are i would love to hear it. thanks for listening FRED   they didn&apos;t make any noise both times i seen them", "It started out as five lights, then went to one bright light, then the light turned into a ring, and then back into a ball.Well, at about 2:30 in the morning, I walked out on my porch. I heard a siren type noise, and it seemed to be coming from every direction. I walked off my porch and saw what I thought were five search planes because they had a bright light in the center of them which slowly blinked. They were, I&apos;m guessing, about two hundred feet up. They all came really close together, and then the siren noise stopped. They flew over the ohio river, and just stopped there. Then, there was a weird swishing noise, like you would expect to hear at the beach. One of the lights faded out, and the rest of the lights grew brighter, and it happened again and again until there was only one, extremely bright light. The light started to dim, and then it changed from a weird ball shape to a more of a ring shape. The ring was about 15 feet in diameter, not very big at all. The ring started to spin, and then stopped. The light fell into the water, and then came back up again, kind of like when you are flying a kite and it goes down and up. From what I saw, It looked like it was making the water come out of the river and flow straight up like a rod. The water stopped when it was around ten feet off the river. Then, the water dropped back into the river and the ring formed a ball again. The ball just kinda fell into the river and the light went out. I&apos;m not sure what it was, but I am pretty darn sure it wasn&apos;t a plane.", "Noseless sauser, lucky witness.It was a long time ago in Russia. I was about 6 (i am now 17). But by looking at my age don&apos;t turn away, i remember it quite clearly. Mum and i lived in a 10 storey flat and we were on the 8th floor. One night we went to our friends party in the same building and later came back with my friends for a sleep over. We were lying down in the loundge room and i was on the floor facing the window. We talked for a quite a bit that night and i didn&apos;t take notice of the time but the sun was gone and the sky turned dark blue. In the background i saw only the horison of the city and the dark blue skyes. About a minute or two after we all went quite but i kept looking at the window. Then i saw a large black object fly past our window and i said &quot;guys, look!&quot;. I wasn&apos;t dreaming that&apos;s for sure. Every body hopped out of their beds like an alarm had just went off. Sure enough they&apos;ve seen it but i layed there on the floor asking them what it was but they told me not to worry, yet they were talking about it the next day. I believe that by the time they got up and ran to see it, the object would have took off.Becasue it was getting darker i only saw the outline of the object so i couldn&apos;t have been able to determine the shape of the object from top but by what it looked like from the side and comparing it to all the other ufo&apos;s i would have to say that it was a sauser.The object was made up of the main body which was oval but had sharper ends (more like two dinner plates joined together) and a semi sphere on top (may have been the cocpit). The diameter of the sauser was around 4-6 metres and in height about 2-3 metres. At the base of the semi shpere (cocpit) were different flashing coloured lights, spaced out about 40-60cm from each other. The sauser was traveling at about our window level as if it was scanning our floor level. It&apos;s speed would have been approximately 10-15km/h. There was no noise at all even though the windows were open, so if it wasn&apos;t for me we would have missed it completely.I strongly believe in the ufo after that particualr encounter but i don&apos;t think i&apos;d like to get any closer unless they start communicating.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

Then the lights became three lights, moving in all sorts of directions in almost a pattern like.  Then they moved very quickly and rapidly across the sky.  After that we struggled to find a video camera.  We ruturn to see the lights moving still accross the sky in different directions and stopping on a dime again.

It was exam time and a few days before Christmas break. The dorm was full, but the halls quiet, because most of us were either studying or trying to catch up on sleep. It was about 8:30 pm in the evening and I had just lay down and turned out the light to catch a nap. Suddenly a brilliant light flashed into my room with a thunderous sound. The whole room shook. Frightened, I ran out of my room. Girls every where in the hall where screaming &quot;did you hear that, what happened?&quot; No alarm went off, but about 10 girls at the large window at the end of the hall, yelled for us to come and see what was in the sky. It was a typical winter night sky, I don&apos;t remember a moon, but I do remember thousands of beautiful stars. We looked in astonishment as a large star like object hovered distantly in the sky. It danced like a &quot;Mitch Mitchell&quot; music ball all over the horizon. Suddenly it lifted itself high above the distant mountain peaks and 5 smaller orbs seperated from the large one and just went crazy in the sky..ziggaging everywhere. Then all six orbs flashed into the sky and disappeared. I don&apos;t know if anyone called security or not or reported it. I told my family, but I think the authorities would have just accused us of playing a school prank or hoax. It was no hoax. I really heard that large boom in my room and looked out that window with the other girls and it was no jet plane. It was beautiful dancing orbs, and I am as sane as rain.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

However, that is only a guess.  PD))I have on film an unexplained large,odd shaped ,colorful object in the night sky.First let me tell you , We are not nuts, We are very sane normal everyday people. With better things to do with our time than to watch things in the sky. Especialy 4:00 in the morning. I actualy feel stupid tell you about this. At First We thought it was a plane coming at us . That what we were seing was the headlights. I was up getting a drink of water. And my kitchin sink window faces the back yard Where my garage is. Up over the garage in the sky was this really huge light. Larger than any star I&apos;ve ever saw. I called my husband to see. Even he couldn&apos;t figure out what it was. We both tried very hard to analize rationaly what we were looking at. &quot;North Star? &quot; ruled that out ,it was getting closer and seamed to be moving. &quot; Headlights of a plane ? &quot; ruled that out, usualy after a few moments the plane would turn and you could identify it plus it would have a blinking light on it , which it did not, and it never revealed itself to be one. It was a VERY clear night. Other stars were out. This was 10 x&apos;s or so larger than other stars. I told my husband we better film this. I acutarly had to sit in my kitchen sink in order to steady my hand and take the film. I tried real hard to zoom in on it , to get a better look at what it was. We still tried to believe it was just a really bright star. We even had to rule out a commit, because there should have been a tail. Every time I tried to zoom in on it , it would dissapear from my lense. And I couldn&apos;t figure out why that was. So instead of just zooming right in { I Have a very powerful zoom in movie camera} I would tap on the zoom . I got in pretty close. This is when my husband and I were really confused. It was changing colors. It would be a bright neon green on the outside and red on the inside. It kept pulsing { getting bigger than smaller] in and out. We just figured that was the automatic focus. This would occur if the object in the lense was moving. So it would automaticly re-focus. I did not have a tripod to steady it. So we just thought this would! be that my hand was shaky. It was completly round. When it pulsed bigger. This is when you would see the red center. Than when it pulsed back it would turn to its bright white. Eventualy it started going behind a tree. I then moved into my bedroom window where I could see if I could get a better view. This was better, Also because I could set the  camera down on the window sill and it would stay in focus and we could see if it was my shaky hands moving or the object. WELL. this was incredible. I got a better view and was able to zoom in VERY GOOD. This object kept going out of my view frame. Telling me that IT was moving and not me. And it had change shape. Stars don&apos;t do this. It changed to the shape of a , &quot;Get this&quot; a CHristmas Bulb. Sounds strange but I do Have it on film. It had two  white rings around the center, that were very close to it and each other. It Appeared to have a smaller ring in the center and off the small ring went four bars like an x. The top had gotten flat. It was purple in a perfectly shaped window at the top part that was square. The rest was round underneith.Also I forgot to mention. When we were in the kitchen window it got flat on top, then it changed to flat on the left side of it. In my video after viewing it on my tv. You could see the gararge too. Which gives you an idea of how large it looked to us.I kept filming hoping IF it was a UFO. That I wanted to get it on film taking off. But My battery ran dead on my camera, And I had to get up early to put my turkey in the oven. So I just gave up and went to sleep. If anyone thinks this is just a bright star. Please let me know. We are really puzzled. We want to know what it was. Usualy if a planet is going to be really close and really bright they let you know on the news so you can watch it.

East hill of Kent, WA.I had just been on the phone with my girlfriend ( approx 7:15 ) who was driving north on 405 near Renton and she had told me of three lights she saw in sky which she thought was peculiar. Moments later I&apos;d left my apartment and was walking to the laundry room with my laundry. The skies were very clear. I heard a sound which was like a high pitch whirr mixed with a low resonating hum...I thought the sound was coming from the laundry room. Just then I watched a large black triangle gliding above the trees just to the east of me and maybe a 1000 ft up or so. It was as big or bigger than a 747 but moving half as fast as one that close might be moving. It was only a couple blocks to the east but still pretty much overhead and I clearly saw the dome shaped white lights on each corner and a red light in the middle. The red light may have been rotating or maybe a smokey half dome shape was over it rotating. I could tell the sound was coming from it but was weird, kind of resonating. Not a very loud sound either, and not one I&apos;ve heard before. I watched it gliding north behind the trees and staying smooth and steady. As it moved away I could discern the thickness of the craft. Gliding overhead took about 5 or 6 seconds I&apos;d guess, but I continued to watch it through the trees for maybe 20 seconds. After putting my laundry in, I went back to my car and drove around up on the hill a little but it was gone from sight by then. I don&apos;t see how hundreds of people didn&apos;t see that. I believe the triangle was equilateral in shape. I observed many airplanes after that, not even the same. The white lights on the corners were steady and bright, but not necessarily &quot;unearthly&quot;. The object didn&apos;t seem to be affected by gravity, I had no impression it had weight. I attached a photoshop rendering of what I saw against the type of night sky that evening. I also attached a map showing it&apos;s approximate location and direction. My girlfriend&apos;s sighting put the lights north of my location about ten minutes earlier, yet I saw the objec! t headin g north towards her location. Either it had gone south and turned around or there may have been more than one out that night.Earlier in the evening, the freeway had been blocked by police activity (south of this location in Federal Way) involving a car chase and then the search for two suspects which had escaped on foot. By this time of the evening, the search had just been called off, the suspects had escaped. This might be relevant to the assumption that the black triangle is a surveillance craft.", "Incident on Pacific Coast Highway leads to time lossMy first husband and I were on Pacific Coast Highway taking a late night drive.

I have never seen a UFO although I have been looking for one for a long time. Early this morning from about 0520 to 0610 I was out in an open field watching the Leonid meteor showers. At approximately 0545 I noticed a bright, very high object traveling across the sky. I was standing at the edge of a treeline to my back, which blocked my view from the SSE to the NNW. When I noticed the first object it appeared in the sky about 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon, the moon would have been about 30 degrees to my right. It traveled in a straight line across the sky. Since the sun was about to come up I could see the arc of light that the sun made in the eastern sky. The arc extended from the ENE to ESE. The first object traveled across the sky ENE. I first took it to be a satellite but I have seen satellites before and this one seemed to travel faster than the ones I have seen before. As it reached the upper edge of the arc the sun made it disappeared from view. About 5 minutes later another bright object appeared in the same area of the sky and traveled in the same direction, same speed and the same altitude as the first. It disappeared from my view in the same area of the sky, which would have been about 40 degrees above the eastern horizon. I think the thickness of the atmosphere caused it to be hidden to my view. All this time I was seeing the meteors as they entered the atmosphere and burned up. The third object appeared in about the same area as the first two about 5 minutes later but traveled more in an easterly direction. I know there is a lot of space junk in orbit so I can&rsquo;t discount that. But I don&rsquo;t think that many satellites would have traveled across the sky that close together in time. It took the objects about 20 seconds to travel the distance that I was able to observe them. There were other aircraft in the sky at the same time but they were airliners and much, much lower in altitude. Do satellites orbit ! in this direction and do they orbit in these numbers and this close in time? The objects were definitely not meteors or aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing satellites, which were being illuminated by the rising Sun in the east.  However, please see other reports for this date, which seem equally serious-minded, and which apparently do not describe orbitting satellites.

He then summoned the rest of us out to take a look. Directly overhead, at an extremely high altitude, were what appeared to be just 5 objects moving in a SSW direction. After focussing a little more on the area of the objects, more faint objects appeared and as it turns out, there were no less than 15, and perhaps as many as 25 objects in a cluster moving in a SSW direction. There was no activity on the flightline at the airport, sicne it is mainly used as an overhaul facility for military and commercial aircraft, so if those objects were planes, we should have been able to ehar them, but there was no sound. Nor was tehre any contrail. Looking at other portions of the sky were planes had recently flown by, there were contrails. These objects left no trace of contrails. Less than a minute into this event, 3 objets on teh west flank of the cluster shifted and moved to the east side of the clutster while the other objects went in a straight line to the SSW. It is difficult to describe the shape of the objects, because they were at an extremely high altitude, well beyond jetliner altitude. My best guess was that they either an oval or circular in shape, and definately did not have tails like a jet would have, but they were at too high an altitude to be aircraft anyway.I am also a weather enthusiast, and 2 hours after the event I decided to check upper level winds (38,000 ft and above)and they were moving at a general easterly direction at the time. So, this rules out balloons and the like.The 3 or 4 objects that swapped from the west flank to the east flank appeared to have some kind of intelligence behind it.

Routine event of every evening was underway, when this writer made usual glance into above sky to determine weather conditions; (area is rurual).  After walking a few feet, while looking into the sky, suddenly a white and yellow lit oval object came into view.  It was approaching the NW sky from the NE area, at approximately 10,000 feet.  The front of the oval was bright blue, shining like a mica type color would, in a reflective way.  The object disappeared from sight as it made a gentle arc in the sky, but it did not disappear on the horizon level, but some distance above.  The moon was almost full this evening, but paled in comparison to the brilliance of the unknown object.  This writer quickly returned to the main home area in order to write down what had been seen, and then to obtain number for the reporting, and then to make the report, approximately 20 minutes after the event ended.

This part of the country is dessert terrain and on that night the sky was incredibly clear with generous moonlight.However the lights held our attention as they remained stationary in the sky and as we drove it became apparent that we were moving towards them. Our second conclusion was that it must have been the lights on top of a piece mining equipment. It also became apparent that the lights were a lot closer than we had first presumed and as the road made a slight curve within minutes we were driving alongside them. The light formation consisted of 4 vertical rectangular shapes. The rectangle on the far right glowed a constant red while the other 3 alternated in a pulse. Firstly the outer two would pulse white while the inner would remain black/invisible, next it would pulse red while the other two turned black/invisible.As we drove they remained up on our left not moving in a rock solid position. Our estimate at distance from us would have been 50 feet back from the road and about 50 feet in the air. The length of each rectangle looked about 10 feet long and about 3 feet across.

Strange energy field emitted, making it difficult to see clearly.Date: 10/27/2002 Time: 17:00 Weather Conditions: Clear late afternoon, no breeze Temperature: 60-65&ordm; F Location: Lower East Side of Santa Barbara, CA Number of Witnesses: 3 Description of Event: Three of us were taking a break from work on a Sunday evening outside of our software development company.  I noticed something reflecting in the sky that hadn&apos;t moved in the last 30 seconds.  I have spotted many satellites in our skies but this was different, due to the intensity of the reflection and the time of day.  It was 30 + minutes from sunset, the time that satellites are spotted in our skies.  Also, unlike satellites, it was oscillating between reflections, as if it were spinning.  This struck me as strange and highly unusual for skies.  Something else of note is that we had all just commented on how much &quot;activity&quot; was in the sky.  Not vehicular, but almost as if the sky were alight with an energy that was beyond the usual intensity.  It had almost a vibration to it.I called to my co-workers to have a look.  It took a moment for them to spot it and once they did, they too commented on the strangeness of its pattern.  I had a pair of 20x binoculars in the car so I grabbed them.  I fixed on a stable surface and peered into the bright blue sky.  What I say was the unexpected.  It was a disc angled in such a way as I could see the bottom as well as a good deal of the top.  To best describe it, it looks very much like the typical &quot;UFO&quot; that has been depicted many times, by many people.  The Disk had a slight warble to it and it stayed in a fixed position.  There were dark spots around the upper half; they looked like what would be windows or some form of exterior ventilation.  I described what I saw and the others decided to have a look.  As a little background, I have extraordinary vision.  It has been rated at 40/20.  In other words, I see at 40 feet what most see at 20.They stared with amazement.  Though they couldn&apos;t see the full clarity as I could, they could make out exactly what I was seeing.  We continued to take turns looking at it with the naked eye and through the binoculars.  As the minutes passed, the previously mentioned phenomenon of the increased energy in the sky began to grow stronger.  It was almost as if the color of the sky intensified significantly.  It became increasingly difficult to focus on the portion of the sky that the UFO was located.  We had to avert our eyes many times due to the power emitted.  Then, all of a sudden, it was gone.  There wasn&apos;t a trace.  The sky also resumed its normal brilliance though to our eyes everything took on a glummer hue.This may not be the most fantastic form of a tale but it really did happen.  After that, the three of us shared a couple of stories of previous encounters, or at the very least, we thought them to be encounters.  To this day, we talk about the strangeness of the event.  Was it some form of US military operation with a new high tech tool, or was it in fact what we really think it to be.

They were going across the sky from a northern direction heading Southeast AND they were pretty much going straight across with a slight downward direction...like a very slow descent perhaps.They were going more in the direction of north to southeast but more south than anything else.I held my arm out fully extended and then used my thumb and index finger to measure the size of what the larger one was...it was the size of the space between my thumb and index finger fully extended...about 5 inches! The front part, of the leading object, which seemed to be about a two inches or so of more &quot;solid&quot; looking while the last 2 or 3 inches seemed to be more &quot;tail&quot;.The last three seemed to be about half the size of the leading one.They appeared to be reflecting somewhat from the soon coming sunrise.I watched as long as I was able to see them...I lost track of them behind the foothills. There was not any blast of light -- like I would have expected to see if there was a hit on land.I did wonder for a bit if maybe they were missles as I have no idea what they may look like going across the sky.  I had even thought for a moment -- well this is it folks! I think I have dismissed the missle theory though...they were just moving too slow for that I think.I had looked around to see if anyone was up and about but I seemed to be the only one around to see this.I would love to know if anyone else had seen this though...I am truly perplexed!

As we passed a pond locally known as &quot;Stinky Pond&quot; due to stagnant water in mid-summer we pulled over ((deleted)) when one of us (I don&apos;t remember who) notiticed an enormous craft immediatly above us in the sky.  It was approximately 50 to 100 feet above the tree line and moving west at a very slow speed (2-3mph?).  In any case, I stood outside of the care, and Adam was still in it behind the drivers wheel as the craft moved directly over us.  The UFO was apprximately 200 to 300 feet across (absolutely enormous), and made virtualy no sound as it basically just sat above us (it was big enough that I could barely notice it moving when it was diriectly overhead).  As I remember, it had a number of white lights toward the out parimeter, and one or more colored lights (I was too in awe to remeber exact details but I think it was one redish light in the center).  In either case I suddenly realized I was looking at something extrordinary, and had a definite feeling that whoever or whatever was above me was looking at me as I was looking at the ship (perhaps a conditioned feeling from various UFO stuff I had seen in the past). I had  a definite impulse to get out of there.  ((name deleted)) was of the same mind , and regretably we left as a result of some instinctual fear.  The rest of the way home we spoke little except to try to figure out whether what we just saw was a bonified UFO or possible a high level military project with technology way-way beyond anything we previously would have considered possible.  We both agreed the white lights gave it a man made quality, but then we also agreed that regardless of how advanced something may be, if there was a need or desire to put any kind of lighting on a craft then why not white.  The bottom line is that me and my friend witnessed a craft approximatelly 200 to 300 feet wide from node to node (I can&apos;t give a more accurate estimate as it just completely engulfed ! the sky above me), and the thing was moving at a barely perceptable speed, and made little or no sound.  I say little or no sound because I kind of remeber a really low hum like that of an air conditioner, but it&apos;s been so long that I can&apos;t be sure.In any case, I personally would not be sharing this (as I do not care whether it was military or extraterestial as I believe the first is probably far more advanced than I would imagine, and the second is a given when considering the likelihood), but I am sharing as I plan on being hyptnotized so as I can remember it better as time has made the memory less clear, and it was just absolutely too cool to let the details become blurred.  In addition, I also want to get hyptnotized so that I can compare my description under hypnosis to those of a recent show I saw on the Discovery Channel which descibed a very similiar craft.  Before I get hyptnotized I am willing to take a lie detector test and recount the sighting in as much detail as I can remember for those who feel that it is important to prove to the world what most of us just know makes sense anyhow.If you would like to contact me about this please do so in the next couple of months before I get Hypnotized as hypnotism will diminish the the validity of any lie detector test.Sincerely, Bryan Addicott", "Large object, no lights, no radar indication in HoustonObject had NO lights, was cigar shaped and moved through the sky heading East to West.

The lower group consisted of six lights more tightly grouped at about 15 degrees above the horizon.  The general location of all the lights was 70 degrees east of magnetic north.  All the lights were were moving slowly in random directions.  All the lights were identical in color and the color was orange-yellow.  The lights looked like bright stars in appearance.  Not as bright as some of the brighter planets on a clear night, but nearly so.  Also, all nine lights were identical in brightness.The lights twinkled in appearance as stars do, and they had no discernable shape other than a point of light.  I looked at the lights with a set of binoculars to try to determine a shape and found no change other than being slightly brighter in appearance with less twinkling.

This particular night my girlfriend pointed to a small group of what looked to be satellites moving across the lower eastern sky. The night was extremely clear so what we were viewing was without question objects at satellite height moving south at a clear constant, no flashing lights, no noise. The formation was as three objects, one leading two more following. The two following were in a stack formation. Picture if you will four dots forming a box with the top right dot not visable (right angle formation). We observed this for just a couple of seconds when my girlfriend pointed to a fourth object trailing from the north moving on the same plane but at a very high rate of speed easily catching up to the formation. It closed the gap so fast that it made my girlfriend exclaim that it was going to collide with the lower rear object. But without any hesitation the object dipped below and overtook the bottom rear object turning upward toward the top rear object circling over the top as to make a half figure eight then heading downward and toward the leading object. These movements were flowing,no jerky movement,as if doodling on paper. Never slowing or moving out of formation the three objects remained on a steady course. The fourth object overtook the leading object and narrowly missing it passed below it excelerating twice to three times the speed of the formation. Now the fourth object was now heading in a southwestern direction. That fourth object was out of view in just a blink of an eye. The three in formation stayed on course as if programed to do so eventually disapearing to the southern night sky. I know that what I saw was extroidinary. Nothing made on planet earth moves at that speed with that kind of movement at that height with someone or something at the controls. But if we do have aircraft capable of such flight we are being kept in the dark ages by a organization much more powerful and secretative than anyone could possibly imagine.

Four journalists observed and photoed this UFO from different angels and areas.On Nov 1 at 2:30 AM, one caller called the hotline of a newspaper and said &quot;come out, there is a flying saucer in the estern sky!&quot; One journalist said, over the eastern sky, he saw a bright rice sized object emitted  with yellow, blue, and pink lights. Around 4:20 AM, all fo the sudden, the object became big, the color changed to deep red, the shape is ball-like. The size of the object became 1/4 size of the moon that night. The surface of the object has different cycles. Later, the object moved to the south, a few seconds later, it became a rice size again. Around 6:05 AM, the object became big again, seconds later, it disappeared.A professor at Nanjing Scientific Observation of Chinese Science Academy studied 27 pictures took by the journalists, he believed the object came from somewhere rather than the earth, this is not a natural formation like weather etc.He said the object is NOT a ballon, airplane, cloud, rocket, or lights from skycrapers, neither a satellite because satellite won&apos;t be able to seen over the eastern sky of Xinjiang (Russia). He also estimated this object was turning and emitting some small objects, the height of this object was about 10000 meters above the earth.The link: http://news.creaders.net/headline/newsPool/8A150802.html The image: &lt;a img=http://news.creaders.net/headline/newsImage/A150802.jpg&gt;", "Light observed in night sky followed by what appeared as military aircraft.It&rsquo;s been some time since this occurred, so I am guessing as to the exact date.  However, I remember the event quite clearly.I was in high school and attending a band practice. It was a very clear night, and quite dark.  We were outside practicing our marching under the parking lot lights.   --- For what ever reason, a few friends and I noticed a small light in the sky.  The light was silent and did not blink or flash.  At first, the light seemed to be a slow moving, high altitude plane, flying in an easterly(?) direction, and quite unremarkable.  However, after approximately 30 seconds of observing the light, it appeared to change direction and start flying strait up.  This upward direction was not apparent at first, however as we watched this object, it appeared to become smaller and the light dimmer.  Finally after about 1 to 2 minutes we could no longer view the object.  This seemed quite odd, and many of us were speculating what we had just seen.    What happened next made it even more interesting.A short time later, after the light disappeared, 5 planes flying in formation, appeared from the east(?). (Unsure of the exact direction.)  They did not appear to be flying as high as the light we had witnessed and we could hear their engines.  They appeared to be some type of military jet and were moving quite quickly.  These planes flew to the location where we had last seen the light. The planes then broke formation and seemed to be searching the area.  One plane appeared to fly strait up, the others spread out, a started flying in a wide circular pattern.   After a few moments, the planes regrouped and headed back the direction they came from.That was the end of the event.

We didn&apos;t think to much of the sighting until the objects started hovering then moving in a zig zag formation and appeared to be travelling faster than any aircraft we ever saw before.

I have not seen anything like it again and I am still watching.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "i am an airforce pilot.we were conducting night flying around 1900 pakistan standard time .we were operating in circuit (a flying pattern used during flying on the airfield).we were three cobra gunships helicopters in the circuit at that time .it was pitch dark night when something resembling an illumination round of artillery shell appeared .it was fater then a helicopter but slower then an aeroplane.its movements were very well coordinated .it was flying like aan aircraft.the strange thing was that it didnt have any engines and its aerodynamic shape was not like an aircraft but it was flying like an aircraft.it was far superior then us and was capable of making abrubt changes in altitude and direction.we took it initially as an indian RPV spying on us but on a close watch we found that it was very different in shape from an RPV.it was elongated in shape..15 feet in length and it had a dim amber light towards the bottom .i tried to follow it on obtaing permission from the air traffic controller but it dodged me in speed and manouevers and then it turned towards we and passd from a distance of 50 feet.that was the time i was able to have a close watch.the matter was repoeted to all autorities concerned.every body who wasnt flying said that it must be an indian or american RPV.but we six pilots who were airborne at that time knows in our heart that it was nothing close to an aircraft in shape .i dont know what it is.i have haerd a lot abt ufos but seen it for the first time in my life.", "It was just light bright yellow lightI saw three lights all bright yellow.  I didnt know if they were planets or planes or something.  But they moved around.  They were in sideways triangle shape and the point was faceing to my right.  The middle light moved into the middle and the the top light dissapered and then the bottom moved behind the trees.  I have no clue but i dont see them anymore.  You must get this a lot i just dont know if it was a planet or satalight so i dont know if it was something but it looked weird.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))", "This is how the UFO Appeared/The craft was grey shaped. It traveled from Southwest to Northeast.  Was very slow moving, didnt make any noice and was shaking a lot as if it had lots of turbulence.  It is not human !!!  It went into the clouds or even higher (possibly into space).  When that happened it became hazzy and you can see a very faint light.", "Rolling white diamond above hillsone morning on the train to work( I work as a systems engineer in the city ) I noticed a white diamond above a nearby hill, it looked like it was rotating along the horizontal axis (ie rolling towards or away from me). because it was &quot;rolling&quot;  I could see that it was very thin, like a diamond shaped wafer, it &quot;rolled&quot; about 3 or 4 times then just dissapeared.The object was plain white, it wasnt glowing, I couldnt hear any noise, judging by the distance to the hill etc I&apos;d say that it was pretty big.I have no idea whether anyone else on the train or anywhere else for that matter saw it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Supplememnt to original report dated 12/06/02 of sighting on 12/02/02 at 05:15 in New Baltimore, Pa USA.", "In formation/Abrupt formation change/Smaller objects shooting from larger ones/Up and out of sight.My wife and I are musicians we were returing home and were unloading our equipment. I had asked my son (age 15) and his friend to help me unload the truck.  I casually glanced to look for Orion which I tend to do.  I immediately noticed 6 stars that I didn&apos;t recognize. They were orangish yellow in color and they were moving.  I also observed that they were in a pattern of a very thin #4.  I called to my son and his friend and told them to look. I then called my wife who was 2 doors down wishing a neighbor Happy New year.  The cratf appeared to be traveling in a NW direction from the SW.  They were very high(could&apos;ve been 100-200 miles).  We all noticed that they began to turn to the SW.  The turn was abrupt and they fomed another pattern similar to the Big Dipper.  They continued to extend  starting to form a single line and then one by one seemed to shoot straight up out of sight.  I did also notice that one or two seemed to have smaller lights shooting out from them and then disappearing.", "We tracked a large cigar shaped object accross town until it went out of view over the treeline.As we exited off the highway to go into the city, I spotted the big, bright light in the sky. It was straight ahead of us about 150 feet off the ground and about 2 miles away. The sky was thinly veiled in clouds, the crescent moon and some stars still visible behind them. The light we saw was almost as large as the crescent moon and almost as bright.It was on the underside of the clouds, and was clearly visible. It was a cigar shape and moved with as we drove into the city. We were traveling at 60 mph. and as the object flew with us, covered a much greater distance in the same time. I would guess it traveled about 150 mph. We got caught at what seemed like every stop light trying to follow the light as it passed over the town and away toward the next town. We kept up the best we could and finally lost sight of it as it disapeared over the tree line about 5 miles away. At this point, we were way out in the country and no roads lead in the direction the object flew. Just farm and swampland. The object must have been of huge dimensions as we could tell it was always at least a couple miles away for most of the chase, but was still as big as moon. I tried to call the local airport to see if they had any anomolous aircraft on radar, but no one answered the phone.", "Bright round ball. several thousand MPH leveled off to one thousand MPH zig zaged through dense timber, no sound no projected lightA brightly lit white perfectly round ball estimated fifty feet in width dropped in a straight line almost as fast as a shooting star and began to make slight serpentine motions as it slowed down. As it slowed futher the zig zaging of the craft became much more radical until it was making large sweeping switchback turns going from a speed of several thousand miles per hour to about one thousand miles per hour. We were witnessing this from a distance of about one mile away. The craft looked intensely bright at it&apos;s core. As it leveled off at the tree line in the dense forest that it was flying into one would have thought that it would light up the whole forest around it. However it did not emit this light out because as it disappeared in and out of the dense forest that it was zig zagging in and out of, it dissapeared totally and then reappeared with no light projecting on to the trees. So it didn&apos;t project light as we know it. It looked extremely bright at it&apos;s core but the light did not emit out beyond that core. It had the ability to zig zag in and out of heavy black timber at a speed of nearly one thousand miles per hour. It didn&apos;t bump any trees or make a single sound of any kind. I was with two other men that can verify this if they are willing. They got pretty scared over the whole thing and wouldn&apos;t talk to anyone afterwards but I&apos;ve been very gabby telling everyone I know about it. I&apos;m sorry that the reporting was back in 1981 before I contacted anyone but frankly I didn&apos;t know who to tell until I came across this site on the dinternet. I also have another sighting to tell about that happened only three years ago and I have a credible witness to that one who I&apos;m sure will talk about it. I&apos;ll fill out another report on a different form to report the second sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, althought the witness does not indicate that.  PD))", "VERY BIG BRIGHT PINK LIGHT (VERY UNUSUAL COLOUR)AT ABOUT 5:25 I WAS GOING TO A FRIENDS HOUSE WHEN I SAW A BIG PINK LIGHT IN THE SKY.IT WAS SLOWLY MOVING BUT GETTING VERY BRIGHT. IT WAS A VERY UNUSUAL COLOUR BRIGHT PINK AND WAS ABOUT 2000 FEET HIGH.IT THEN SHOOT OFF INTO THE DISTANCE VERY FAST UNTIL IT HAD GONE. MY FRIEND WITNESSED ABOUT HTE LAST 25 SECONDS OF THE INCODENT.", "I believe this object was either a test vehicle of some sort or it was not of this world.A friend and i were playing outside about 8:00 pm when we noticed this disk shaped object moving slowly from south to north. The object was white in color. No lights were visible, just the white light of the surface of the object. We were only ten years old and were very frightened by the experience. I remember it in vivid detail until this very day. The object never made a sound or changed course. I have never told this story to anyone because I thought i would be laughed at.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "N.E. WA. 3 witnessed rocket shaped UFO emmitting orange sparks.My girlfriends brother in law age 30, my daughter, and myself 31 were driving down hwy. 395 headed west through Kettle Falls, WA.  The time was around 5:30 11-11-02 when when my attention was drawn to the sky I saw a reddish orange object emiting what looked like orange sparks, and it had a tail.  It seemed to just appear, and then seemed to almost stretch as it flew off to west (like you see the enterprise do when it hits warp speed).  It looked like it stopped as it entered atmosphere, then shot to the West. It was shaped like a 50&apos;s rocket toward the front (round nose, not pointy), but it had a tail emmitting what looked like orange sparks.  It had what looked to be an area in the front that was free from sparks in the center of what I would call the nose (clear bubblelike but outlined in orange sparks)  It was in the middle of town, with alot of activity, there were surely more witnesses.  During the sighting we were all quiet, and it took a moment , or two for me to ask, if anyone saw what I saw.  My girlfriends brother confirmed what I saw as did my daughter who asked what it was, I had no answer.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
