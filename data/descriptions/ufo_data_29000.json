["white/silver orb  seen in Glen Burnie Md. following 2 high altitude jets leaving con trails.At approximately 8:00 am Monday morning I noticed two high flying jets traveling south to north, leaving a contrail. Behind the two jets a ways back I saw a white/silver orb following behind the jets. It was about the size of a dime at arms length. It followed along behind the jets for about 3-4 minutes, long enough for my school friends to see it too. Shortly after the sphere was lost to view a green helicopter, the same shape as the Maryland Police helicopter but NOT a police helicopter, followed along the same path but much lower and much slower. It may have been a coincidence.    This was reported to me by my 12 year old son. I have transcribed it as told.", "My exited triangular craft sightingI was outside at night on 11/12/04. And i had a camera taking pictures of my sister just for fun when. It was really cloudy outside and i saw something go right over our carport. At first i suggested an airplane, then i saw three sides and claimed it as a triangle. It was a ufo and i have seen 2 ufo&apos;s before this sighting date. But this i actually got a picture of it! My luck i had a camera in my hands because it was too fast to go in to get the camera. It was cloudy and the top of the craft was in the cloud but i saw the bottom and the lights, 2 white lights and in the front was a red one. If you want a picture contact me in e-mail ;). Feel free. As i am writing this my pictures have not devoloped yet, but i will get them tomorrow. I can&apos;t wait! I hope this picture does not come out bad ;). Ok sorry about that now back to the ufo stuff. I do not believe in aliens or nothing. I believe it was government type and i don&apos;t believe in aliens and i do not think they exist. Ufo&apos;s do!!!", "My husband and I were driving south on Interstate 29 going to Sioux Falls. When we were about 6-7 miles north, of the city, I was looking up in the sky watching for the usual airline traffic from the airport. I used to live in Sioux Falls not too far from the airport and loved watching the planes and am well aware of all types of conventional air craft. The day was clear and sunny with just a few lines of whispy clouds. I was watching one jet fly over, east to west and then another came along also, east to west. A little higher in the sky, I noticed a bright round, white,light like a nickle at arms length and, I am estimating about 60 degrees off the horizon to the south and a little west of the city. It was very bright and appeared to be flashing though, it could have just been the reflection of the sun. At first I thought it was another plane but it didn&apos;t appear to be moving and didn&apos;t have a contrail as the other planes did. I asked my husband if he saw it and he said he did. It appeared to be moving in and out and above and below the clouds and would fade out from time to time. When the second plane came over, I noticed another light of the same type lower than the second plane and on the same course. It disappeared after about 5-10 seconds, the other one was still visible. I pulled to the side of the road to get a better look and try to get some pictures. It disappeared as we drove on, then, it reappeared and I pulled off onto the off ramp and drove down another highway looking for a gravel road so I could park and watch it. It was still in the same place in the sky and still doing the same things. By the time I had found a gravel road, it appeared to be higher up but still in the same place and barely visible, then it was just gone. I did notice another plane come from the airport, circle around at a lower altitude in the direction of the light but, don&apos;t think this pertained to it.", "They flew silently, straight, and very quick.Ok, never seen anything like this. The second I saw this I got chills and was freaked out. I was out stargazing when this happened. There was three craft. Perfect triangles. They were grey. No detail could be seen, even through binoculars. They had no lights. No sound. When I stargaze, planes go over at 10,20,30 thousand feet and I can always hear them. But these were silent. I read some other reports from seattle and these seem the same except for the lights. They were in my field of view for 10 seconds and went from west to east. They flew a perfect straight line. I saw no turns. I was a air traffic controller in the navy til about two months ago. I know my planes very well and this scared me. I have no idea what they could have been. I know speeds and know about the sound barrier. But they sure were close to it if not over it.", "Over the hudson riverBasically ther are 4 of them. They keep going around and around and then going into the center and going past each other and after like 3 rotations they all go off in different locatons come back nad repeat it.

I was driving north on PCH, coming home from work.  I sawe a white bright light, bright like reflcted snow, come down at almost a complete perpendicular drop. It appeared 100-200 meters above the beach level. It was the whitest light I have ever seen.  It appeared small, diamond shaped, with a small tail.  What could have been around 1-2 football fields in length from the ground, was a sudden disapearance of the object.  It was moving at a speed that no man made object could move (I believe), being so close to the water.  I had my windows up and music lightly playing, but I heard no crash of a landing or saw no impact into the ocean or beach.  I advise someone ASAP to search the water off-shore for anything unusual.  As soon as the object disapeared, the &quot;check engine&quot; light on my car came on, but my engine did not fail to stop.  After careful thought, I ruled out the posibilities of what it could be : not an astroid/meteor, no fireworks, not a plane or a helicoptor.  I was about 30-40 miles away from camp Pendleton, but I have never heard of anything from that army base ever - EVER - leave north and become visible to any civilians.  What I saw was no hallucination, I was not under the influence of any illegal substance, was not tired, and was sober and sane.  I just hope that this report does not go unnoticed for any more than a day or so after I give it, because most likely any government official/organization will do what they can to erase the evidense within hours or days.

Noticed  aircraft above it from a distanceLooking north out of my kitchen window over the nevada mtns. noticed what looked like a fireball going from east to west over the mtn.

It was a blue green light, which I thought must be ball lightning, then from my car window, saw a streaking pinpoint of burning debris, which left a contrail, or smoke, then seemed to go out.  heading east to west, towards Ohio.  At first thought it was a missle, moving too fast to be a wrecked plane.  Stopped car and got out, to hear if there was any noise.  I was in a very quiet area, but did not hear anything, but by the time I was out of my car, it was out of site.

It appeared to be a sting of triangelish lights conected together at a perfect diagonal. connected to the lights were long tubes at different lenghts almost reminisent of a revolver chamber on a pistol. I would surmise the object to be about the width of 30 jet size airplanes and an undetermined length. It was hard to comprehend anything that size flying. It did not huver, it did not speed off it simply floated effortlessly towards the east and dissapeared. I have never seen anything remotley like this and can not imagine anyone creating something that looked like this. I will never forget it as long as I live, and feel very fortunate to have seen it. I only hope others did as well.", "Bright light outside of Edmonton/SherwoodparkAmazing that this happened to me!  As I went outside I heard a cat crying out in pain. Long story short, i found a stay cat that was reall just skin an bones.... it ate 5 cans of cat food... :&#x5C;  But as I was feeding this poor kitty, I saw a bright white light off in the distance. I would say it was SOUTH WEST of true north. This is not the first UFO I have seen in these parts. Last time I saw a UFO WEST of my location. I live OUTSIDE of Edmonton, Alberta. I am near 2 SMALL air ports. So I see alot of planes. I even remeber once I saw a black unmarked helecopter as a child that flew no more than 10-20 feet over out house... I never thought about the importance of that incedent till recently. See as how thoes unmarked helecopters have been reported many times when it came to UFOs and even more CATTLE mutalations. Altought as far as I know I personly have not heard of cattle mutalations in my area. Anyways, as I was feeding this poor cat, I saw a bright light off in the distance. Off in the direction of SHERWOOD PARK. It is a town outside of Edmonton. I wanted to eyeball this light as long as I could, but trying to keep attention to the poor sick cat and the fact that small trees where in my way. I did not stay entirely focused to it. I would say about a minute or 2 after I saw the bright light, it just vanished. I would say it was VERY far away, but it could not of been a star consider how low it was to the horizen. This time of year up here it gets dark quite quickly, and I can honestly say I have never seen a star that was that bright at this time, or even moved around for that matter. This bright object moved around a tiny bit within the 1 to 2 minutes I watched it. It did not move in random patterns... But I would say it moved UP... not UP UP like into space or the atomsphere, but UP.... It was a LARGE distance away, but no plane or anything of that nature could produce such a bright light from that far away. I really wanted to get my binoculars, so I could view the object, but being only human, I could only help the poor starving cat. I lost site of the object, (from my view from beyond the trees) quite quit. All the trees around here have lost thier leaves, but I still was not wearing my glasses. But for a bright object to dissapear like that within the time period and direction it was moving and the fact there was no red or blue lights, which rules out any airplane, just leaves me boggled. I lived on farm land, and from whats I have noticed on this web site is that sometimes &quot;Advertizing lights&quot; can be a factor in a UFO report. But let me tell you this, never have I heard or seen or even considered the fact that advertising lightings will be within or around the area of Edmonton, Alberta. OH, and if your wondering, the stray cat is at a SAFE shelter now. :) By now he will of been adopted. If I had to estimate the distance of the object I would say...... Quite far..... From my current location, I would say I was still a large distance away... Even if I got over to the closest highway, I would still say I was still 1/6 distance away from it. It was far... but very bright.  FYI: I also saw this object, while an Meteor shower was occouring, and I can tell you that this was no Meteor.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It then started to move north once again but very very slowly.  It stopped again and a few seconds later, it looked like the bottom exploded and a round red object came out, then it did it again and another red object came out and then it did it again and another red object came out. They circled the first object and then they all disappeared.  We did watch to see if there would be a report on this, and also have asked several other people if they saw it.

At first we thought it was a train. Then we heard a large roar and suddennly a huge unmarked beige colored military helicopter that looked a lot like the old Soviet HIND helicopters used in Afghanistan, roared just 20 feet over her residential rooftop heading West, Southwest towards the direction of Tinley Park, IL. I was very shocked to see an unmarked miltitary aircraft flying so low over the buildings. My child was delighted.

Then I said &quot;What are those planes doing?&quot; At that time my daughter and I both saw the upper light dim and disappear, the final light instantly disappeared.We can see the beautiful night sky each night and we see lots of planes, meteors etc. But the location of these lights were out of the ordinary.

I figured that they must and went in and forgot about it. About 30min. later I heard some people outside and decided to check it out. I watched the children that were making the noise and before going inside I looked up and noticed another similar light moving in the same direction but it was a little further west than before. As I watched it I saw it go from a south-to-north direction, into a more norteastern direction, but it was soon evident that the object wasnt moving northeastern, it was gaining altitude. It only lasted a few seconds before it dissapeered into the sky going almost straight up. The light was the same color as the rest of the stars and about the same intensity as the most intense stars.", "3 Lights in Triangular Formation Moving Accross The SkyI was sitting outside with 4 friends when one of them shouted to look up at the sky. Three dots of light in the shape of a triangle were moving accross the sky from south to north (identical to the Melbourne sighting in Aug03). They appeared to be at a very high altitude and moving too quick to be satelites. They crossed the sky within minutes and then faded away as if moving out of the atmosphere.

Possibly a satellite.

I was looking between some large Queen Palm trees, so those managed to give me a feeling of scale. There were no clouds that I could tell, the stars were out. The sky was a bit hazy. We are near John Wayne International Airport so I am always seeing and hearing planes flying overhead, usually on takeoff, and usually flying from east to west (opposite to this things flight path) I also have a strong understanding of visual recognition of aircraft from many years working at/near air bases - I am in the aerospace industry. Note that we are about 1 mile south of Interstate 405. At about 6:45 PM, I saw a motion in the sky that attracted my attention. It was moving from the west towards the east, straight in front of me. Since I was looking west, it appeared to move up in the sky. It was moving at a high velocity compared to the aircraft I usually see flying, perhaps twice as fast or more. It flew up to almost directly overhead, then turned abruptly to the southeast. It appeared to be increasing alitude, although that is a bit speculative. It flew between the fronds of the palm tree, and finally up over the roof. By the time I got to a better viewing angle, it was gone. The vehicle itself looked triangular in shape and was black/gray, looking more like a mottled gray shadow against the black sky. It seemed as if the bottom of the vehicle either had a slight glow or was reflecting lights from the city below, as there seemed to be a bluish mottling over the bottom surface. The leading edge had a number of fairly dim lights, perhaps five to seven. I think there were a couple of lights on the trailing edge, but I&apos;m not certain of that. There was no sound whatsoever, although aircraft engines were heard a few minutes later as a airliner flew over. The size of the vehicle seemed impressive .. I see aircraft through our typical haze all the time, including planes flying around tonight, and this seemed much more diffuse, so I think it was fairly high up, higher than typical commercial aircraft. The overall impression was a large triangular shape flying high above the normal traffic pattern at a high velocity, but that could be way off. I did notice a decrease in traffic around that same time. Bear in mind I do not think this was &quot;alien&quot;, more likely some sort of secret military surveillance vehicle.((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes himself as an engineer.

Just the sparking that did not form a tail or any sort behind the object.  Of course it was a dark night and if there was smoke I would have not seen it.  It happened so fast that if you were not ready there was no way to warn anyone to look that way or the other to catch a glimps of it.

The best way I can describe the movement would be to compare it to someone shining a laser on a wall and moving it in a very tight counterclockwise circle, at a medium-slow rate of speed.   The movement was barely discernable and lasted maybe 10 or 15 seconds, then stopped.  I wasn&apos;t altogether certain that my eyes weren&apos;t playing tricks on me, so I watched for a while longer, and it happened again. I don&apos;t have a video cam, or I would have filmed it, and it wouldn&apos;t have served any purpose to take a still photo, since the image would have just shown a starry sky.  At any rate, I went inside and watched TV for an hour or so.  Just before going to bed, I went out on the deck and had another look at the sky.  That &quot;star&quot; was no longer there.  There were plenty more stars cleary visible in the immediate area of the sky where I had seen it, so I doubt seriously that it was now hidden behind clouds.

The red dots seemed to be floating farther away or maybe just disappearing, but they lasted about 30 minutes. Besides the red lights or whatever they were we saw a lot of planes going around and not just regular boeing jets, there were helicopters all over. I can see that many other people have reported this too. We first thought that maybe it had something to do with terrorists considering whats been going on, but theres no doubt in my mind that this is nothing like that.

Often airplanes will fly fairly low over the surfers just to check us out on the weekends.  I was at a surf spot called &quot;sharks&quot; which is near the &quot;Hook&quot; a surf spot that is directly at the end of 41st avenue which runs from Highway 1 to the cliffs at the Pacific.  We were sitting there and we looked up because there was a twin engine conventional aircraft approaching at about 1,000 feet and below it and moving much slower was a triangular craft small at about 500 feet and approximately the size of a hang-glider except that it had firm trailing edges and there was no bow in the wing as there is in hang-gliders.  Additionally this craft was completely silent and about 2-3 feet thick. It looked too thin to have held a human and there was no landing gear. This craft had 2 props located approximately 3 feet from the left and right tips of the triangle. It was white with no other markings.  It flew directly overhead and the continued to go at the same altitude directly over the land. At this point the twin engine conventional craft banked off to its left to avoid going over the land at a low altitude. Before and after the conventional craft came and went the triangle traveled at about 30 miles per hour and was completely quiet.  One surfer said to me &quot;what the hell was that?&quot; I replied that it looked like and unmanned aerial vehicle.  The other two surfers said nothing.  Most of the time us surfers prefer not to talk to each other at all.  It is not like a friendly atmosphere with other surfers as we are basically competing for the best waves and there is more hostility out there than friendliness if any conversation at all. A few days later I called the nearest airport which I believe was in Monterey and I spoke with an air traffic controller.  I questioned him about the legal altitudes for aircraft over water and I believe he said that it is 100 ft. over the water and 300 ft. over the land but I am not sure of those numbers.  The reason I asked this question is because of the fact that the twin engine banked off when the craft went inland.  It looked to me that the twin engine had seen the craft and was buzzing it from above to see what it was.  The air traffic controller said that he had not recieved any other reports but asked me to report to him if I saw it again.  As an important side note; my brother-in-laws father worked at Lockheed Missiles and space in Silicon Valley and also in L.a.  In L.A. he worked at the skunkworks as a purchasing agent and he was buying wooden hand made props for  unmanned aerial vehicles that he said were powered by chainsaw engines that had exhaust systems installed to make them perfectly quiet.  He said they used wood props because they were only 2 feet long and made by some obscure small time person who could shape them the way they needed to be effective and also quiet.  The craft I saw looked too thin to hold a human although if the human was lying down in the prone position perhaps he could fit inside.  What amazes me is that the military would fly such a craft over heavily populated areas on a weekend in Monterey Bay and over land too.

Thought it mught be a weather balloon, but official wind data from NOAA that day indicates winds out of the NW (the direction needed to push a balloon to the east) only at altitudes above 12,000&apos;.  So if the object was at or below 12,000&apos;, it was moving agaisnt the wind.  However, even at 12,000&apos;, the object&apos;s velocity would have been over 310 nautical MPH, approx. 7x the highest recorded wind speed for that day.  My calculations would have to be off by a magnitude of 10 (I&apos;m a mathematician) for this object to have been a balloon.  I can mathematically prove it was not.

((name deleted)), NJ 07071", "Early afternoon siting of cigar shapped object, August 1986, Pineview Reservour, Ogden UtahOn this afternoon I and my sister-in-law, who was about 17 years old at that time, were swimming at a local reservour, below the Wasatch Mountains. This place, later would also be used as one of the Olympic event sites. My siting occured almost directly across from what is now the Trapper&apos;s Loop by-way across the back of Mount Ogden. The road ends in a tee onto the main highway and there is a campground almost directly across the road from where Trapper&apos;s Loop comes down off the mountain. We were camping at this camp- site as we had for about 5 years as my ex-wife&apos;s Grandma lived just down Ogden Canyon from our yearly campsite. My ex-wife&apos;s mother, her husband, my sister-in-law and my ex and I would go up to this campground so they could go and visit Grandma more easily. At the time my ex-wife and I lived in Farmington, Utah and it just made things more simple to go camping so the women would have acess to Grandma. At approximately 1:30 pm on the afternoon of August 15, 1986 while sunbathing, I offered to go to our campsite to fetch something cold to drink. Where we were swimming was a converted boat ramp. Converted to swimming while Fish and Game had moved the boat launch down the shore a little way because of increased use by swimmers. The launch had origianlly been carved out of the bluff / canyon that Pineview Lake was claimed from. So, the ramp did about a 130&apos; semicircle down to the lake, with the campground up above about 20 to 30 feet. As i was going up this old launch ramp, back to get sodas, my head had just cleared the depression of the ramp and I could look out into the campground and across the highway to the foothills. These foothills are farms mostly, and grazing land that then just continue up as part of the backside of the Wasatch Range east of Ogden, Utah. Anyone familiar with northern Utah would know immediately where I am talking about, as Pineview Reservour is a major play place for fishing and boating. At any rate, as I was looking into the coumpground and across to the hills, which are no more than 250 yards away, I heard an explosion. Like to when a farmer is blowing stumps. And so thinking I had heard a farmer blowing stumps looked closely at the hills to see if I could spot  any flying dust and wood in the air. I was convinced it was a farmer blowing stumps. As I scanned the hill directly across the street a cigar shaped craft approxiately 100 feet long and possibly 30 feet thick,  that looked as burnished silver, but intensely bright even in the full August afternoon sunlight that Utah has at that time of summer, was just leaving the creast of the hill I was looking at. This object just seemed to appear in the sound. I was absouletly stunned. I said to myself, Oh my God there it is. I watched the craft glide perfectly silent, out over the valley floor no more than 500 feet away from me as it headed in an east direction toward the Trappist Abbey and towards Evanston Wyoming over the mountains east of the campground. About 5 minutes agfter spotting the object which was moving slower than any flying craft should be able too, I heard another very large boom and the craft seemed to shimmer, like when one sees a heat mirage. All around it the air moved like that and it picked up speed. Then it started to fly about as fast as a conventional helicopter, still headed due east. About 2 or 3 minutes later this object seemed to stretch out to basically over the horizon, like Star Trek&apos;s going to warp. It actually looked like a rubber band strtched out forever and in a huge explosive boom, this thing was gone. Booooom! Gone! Just like that. The perfection of the object is what struck me at the time. It was very litteraly, beautiful. The metal glowed without flaring sunlight off it&apos;s shell. I was in nuclear weapons during the cold war from 1971 through 1974 in Europe so this daylight event I have described was not and I mean not, the first time I had had daylight sightings. It was not the last sighting either. I have two sons who became avid skywatchers, also. it is truly interesting, Peter, that when people take the time to look at the sky, they will witness something inexplicable. Peter, I now live in Aberdeen and would like to help in your quest for disclosure and knowlege. I hope you sense that I am no crack pot and it has taken me many years to report this one event.  I have listened to you on the radio for years and have wondered if you could or if you actually would accept an offer of genuine concern and interest. I don&apos;t even know if you will see this report or if you want assistance. I have better things to do than have my motives questioned. So, if you need some certain help, I offer this to your endevour. Thanks for the forum.", "WHITE LIGHT CHANGING TO REDESS GLOW, THE LIGHT APPEARED AS LOOKING THROUGH A GLASS WINDOW. THIS THING PASSED OVER HOUSE ASIF ITWAS ON A MISSION/DESTINATION.", "An object observed hovering with candle white lights hued purple in front of house.My husband and I were in bed trying to convince the little one to go back to sleep and as I was rocking her in my arms I happened to look out the window acrooss from our bed and there was this bright light in the shape of a plus sign or diamond , I became focused on it and remember thinking that the north star wasn&apos;t usually that bright. Iremember thinking it must have been a star because iit wasn&apos;t moving.I didn&apos;t think anything unusual about it other than the intensity of the light(lack of sleep, sick with cold, restless baby were factors )Then, I looked away and almost immeditely my husband was in a panic and started freaking out , baby starts crying, and my husband said, Did u see that? did you see that? and i saiid what the light? and he said yeaah, i looked to where i seen the &quot;bright star&quot; and it was gone. It was a clear night and and i could see other stars in the sky where it had been but dim in light by comparison. I had just missed it when i looked away to tend to our baby.my husband who seen this bright diamond light come directly toward us in the sky and lit up our bedroom the silence fell among us and we could feel and hear these rythmetic vibrations (whommm... whommm... whomm) I will now turn the commentary to my husband, Here is what my husband has to say from the time i looked away (I hadn&apos;t told him of the &quot;bright star): we had both seen the bright lite but my wife was unable to stay focused on it due to rockin the baby back to sleep. I had become fixiated on the bright, twinkling object that had now begun moving in a fast &apos;swirling&apos; motion-like a merry go round with bright lights that were the color of candles with a purple twinge to it. At this point maybe 5 min. had passed. As my wife looked away the object then dashed toward out house at an exceptionally fast speed, with the bottom of the object looking like a lit up honeycomb with lights. Then it was gone.", "Particially hidden, behind cloud, hovering craft with large observation window clearly visableMy wife (at the time age 21 a receptionist at the Stanford business park) and I (age 29 a marketing administration manager for a national medical instrumentation company)were about to do some Christmas shopping in what was then called the &quot;White Front Store&quot;. After parking the car, I happened to glance up to observe very low hanging clouds and peeking out from one such cloud was a triangular shaped portion of a craft just exposing enough area to include a large observation window. Of particular note was the rootbeer metalic color of the craft. I have since seen such metalic colored material on 5 inch wide ribbon cabling used on experimental micro wave missiles. This area is very near a military airbase. Moffett field. The craft remained motionless and no noise was heard. It was as if it was hovering very still as observations were being made. After approx 10 minutes of viewing the craft, I went into the store. When I returned 45 minutes later, it was gone.", "Three red lights in overhead sky.Three red lights in triangle formation, low altitute, moving very slowly, no sound.

Its size and magnitude were 5 to 10 times greater than Venus, which is often visible in the eastern morning sky.  It was about 7:20 A.M. and I was between exits 59 and 55 (Shelbyville and Martin) when I viewed this light. It appeared to be lower than planes should fly. It remained stationary, apparently hovering. Within perhaps a minute I came parallel to it and passed it. Looking through my back window, I perceived its outline enough to know that it was the largest airborne object I&apos;ve ever seen and quite close.  (I&apos;m afraid that I&apos;d subconsciously invent details if I tried to describe what I THOUGHT its shape could have been.  All I can say with certainty is that it was long and immense.)  I called my fianc&eacute; on my cell phone and described the object to him. He said to call him back if I found out any information about it. I would have to imagine this object was seen by the other motorists on the highway with me. Realizing that my curiosity about this would probably be met with scorn or, at least, disinterest, I was hesitant to contact anyone. My curiosity bested me and I called Aeronautics in Lansing, but hung up in dismay over how to credibly word my inquiry. The next day I contacted the Allegan County Sheriff&apos;s Department. Their dispatcher said she had received no calls regarding this and suggested I call Dodgen Aircraft/Padgham Airfield. The gentleman I spoke to there also had no information. My best guess is that it was some sort of military aircraft, although I have no idea why such a thing would be hovering over Allegan County. I have seen nothing about it on local news websites. Any information would be appreciated.", "Showed up on downloadNot sure if this is anything , but was out taken some pictures and took one of the clouds passing the sun , didn&apos;t think much of it till I downloaded to my computer and what caught my attention was I could see the clouds in front of this object , but didn&apos;t see it with the naked eye , the camera is a HP photosmart 850 that I have taken well over a 1000 pictures with and never had anything show up that wasn&apos;t there .", "UFO sighting Springfield Queensland Australia.As I was having a breath of fresh evening air on the veranda I suddenly turned my head to the right to watch a bright orange object fall slowly from the sky.

That friend was driving while I rode in the passenger seat, looking out the window and just checking out the passing landscape while we talked. We were northbound on Interstate 15 at about 11:30pm. Just before we headed up the hill towards the city of Escondido, California, I spotted an orange light in the sky above the mountains. The reason it caught my eye is becaiuse the night sky was cloudy and the clouds were actually fairly low. So, I knew this light had to be very close to the ground. I looked at the horizon and quickly tried to determine whether or not what I was seeing was actually on a mountain or hillside on the horizon. As cloudy as it was, the light pollution was bright enough to darken the horizon and I could tell that this light was indeed in the sky. Next, I tried to see if it was moving. At first, I couldn&apos;t tell because it was so far away. It could have been stationary, but after a few moments, not only could I tell that it was moving, I could tell that it was flying to the East. It appeared to be over State Highway 78. The light seemed to slow and get brighter. It seemed to pick up speed, but I knew it may have been flying at the same speed, just now it seemed faster because it was actually coming our way. So, for this report, I wouldn&apos;t say it changed speed. I think it stayed pretty constant. As it got closer, I peered out the passenger window, as it was now off to the right side of the highway we were on. I noted something strange. The light wasn&apos;t flying back West. I would have expected that if it were a plane coming in to land at a local airport. I live in this area and I know that there&apos;s a flight path leading back towards Palomar Airport. Planes sometimes circle over this area a take a Southwest bound approach towards the airport in Carlsbad, California. If a plane was making it&apos;s approach, the light should have cut back to the left and soon I should have spotted other lights. I should have seen a red or a green light, maybe a flashing light. I didn&apos;t. All I saw was a single orange light. The light flew directly South along the I-15 now, just off to the Eastern side of the highway. I watched it first out the right side of the windshield, and then out the passenger window. It wasn&apos;t over the highway, but close enough to it that it was about to pass us directly overhead in a few moments. My next thought was that this must be a police helicopter. I&apos;m used to seeing a single red or a blue light, but not just a single orange one, so I tried to peer up at it as it passed overhead to see if I could make out a dark shadow of the craft&apos;s shape. It was also as it approached that I was able to tell that it was flying really low and at a good rate of speed. I compared it to the traffic coming at us in the opposing lanes, all the traffic traveling southbound along the I-15 on the other side of the center divide. The light seemed to be moving just as fast, if not just a tick faster. So, I&apos;d say somewhere bewteen 60-90mph. It passed right by us and almost directly overhead. It passed a few blocks East of our position on the highway. With the low clouds and enough light pollution from the city of Escondido to make the clouds almost glow, I should have been able to make out a vague shadow of a craft attached to that light. We were definitely close enough now. I could not. The light wasn&apos;t that bright, but even as low as the light was... that&apos;s all that appeared to be there. It was just a single orange ball of light up in the air. I looked back over my shoulder as we passed the local ice arena. I couldn&apos;t believe what I just saw. I should have been able to see the shape of something, but all that I could see was a single orange light. I can&apos;t explain how I was able to tell that it was low, other than this. There&apos;s just something about the way you look at an object in the sky and if the background behind moves fast, then you know it&apos;s close. If it moves as slow or seems to hang with the background, it might be that far away. This light was moving by us, but there was enough of a contrast between it and the low clouds above it that I could tell it was fairly low. My guess... I would say this was just 3 to 4 times above tree top level. I don&apos;t know where it was going, but we were getting onto the 78 at this point and I no longer saw it behind us as the landscape soon obscured my line of sight with the light. I wonder how many other people may have seen it. I wonder if it had sound. I was traveling in a vehicle on the highway, so I have no way of knowing. The trouble is it really didn&apos;t stand out too much. The light wasn&apos;t very bright. It was about as bright as you&apos;d expect for a normal navigation light on a plane. Probably the only reason I saw it was because I try to be more observant of these things now. I&apos;ve already had a couple of UFO sightings before. This wasn&apos;t the most specatular, but the fact that this was just a single light, with no apparent craft attached to it, was strange enough for me to post this here tonight.", "Glowing white oval object on the horizon. Stationary,never moved.Disappearing and reappearing in the same locationaround 5 pm on Sunday Nov 7th I, my fiancee,my mom and my dad, saw glowin white oval object on the horizon as the sun was setting on a very clear day. Not a cloud in the sky. It was stationary. When I went to get my binoculars for a better look it had dissappeared just as a plane in the sky was nearing it. about 2 minutes later it had reappeared in the same spot and was then emitting and orange light then again disappeared just as quick. a few more minutes later it reappeared again emitting the same orange light and again, after another minute disappeared. After that we didn&apos;t see appear again.", "Strange round lights changing colors in the dark sky on the same day of the Lunar Eclipse.It was the night the lunar eclipse happened. I was recording the moon for obvious reasons. When my dad noticed a rather strange light that seemed to be flashing/changing colors to the left. It was above my neighbors house, but not close at all. From our eyes, we could only see it as a dot that was flashing. It didn&apos;t appear to be flying or moving in general. So we didnt think it was a airplane or a star because all of the other stars weren&apos;t flashing rapidly like that.(I dont think I have ever seen a star do that anyway). So I started to record it, I zoomed in as close as I could get and didnt mess with the zoom anymore. It was better on the video camera because we were able to see it bigger and a bit clearer. It appeared that the light was changing colors from blue,green,white. It looked as if it would double too and take the shape of a heart, but it mainly stayed in a circular shape. The thing that really got to us was the fact that it looked like there was some kind of electricity inside of the circle or at least going in front of it. Sometimes though it looked as if the electrical static went outside of the circle and above it, as if it were going nuts. As I said before, I did not mess with the zoom when I had it as close as I could get to it. I restate this because before we knew it, the circle seemed to enlarge as if it came closer, and suddenly shrink to a dot. It was amazing, I didn&apos;t think it was moving at all but it seemed to be moving forwards and backwards at random moments and fast. After a while there were more colors, including red,purple, and some goldish color. There aren&apos;t any big buildings in that direction or anything at all. So a flashing light from a room up high is ruled out also. Anyway, maybe an hour later I went back outside to film the rest of the moons transition, when I decided to check out the light to see if it was still there, and it was. The strange thing was, it was no longer in the same position it was before. As if it had moved off a bit farther n higher to the right. I stood at the same distance and place as I was before, and zoomed in again with the camera as close as I could, yet it never got as big as it did before, as if it had moved farther than before also. When I looked at it with my eye, I noticed there were 2 more on both sides of the one I was looking at. They were also much smaller, yet they were flashing/changing colors as rapidly as the first. I am not sure how long they stayed there, or how long they were there from the beginning, but from the time I was out there for a couple of hours or so they were there. My dad and I are very interested in the paranormal/supernatural. I have never seen anything like that before in the sky. I have no idea what that light was, but all I know is if it was nothing out of the ordinary then I still find it to be a pretty sight, at the same time I would like to hear how that was normal if at all. My dad has said that no one would believe me anyway that it had gotten smaller on its own, that they would assume I just zoomed it in and out fast. I do have statements behind that. First, the volume was on very high and the zoom buttons make a sound when u press them, even if you press them slowly, and when I was filming the moon and adjusting the zoom you could clearly hear me pressing the buttons. Second, I couldnt have zoomed it in and out that fast, because when I did try with filming the moon, it went blurry fast. I had to do it slowly to keep it focused. Last, I am not fond of liars, or hoaxes at all. I would never try and fake a thing like that, I have nothing to gain from it. I believe people who do that, give off a sense of them not being trustworthy, because if they would want to fool others and deny it, then who knows when they are being serious? Like that book, &quot;The boy who cried Wolf&quot;. Anyway, I would certainly like to know what that was. Oh also, I am not sure how long it lasted, because I didn&apos;t stay there until it left.", "Triangular UFO w&#x5C;red,blue lights,spinning clockwise,completely silentThe object was triangular with red and blue lights.The lights were turning in a clockwise manner while the object was moving from northwest to southeast.

It had no blinking lights at all. It had no tail ,no wings,after a few seconds it continued on to the southeast and did not make a sound. It seemed to be quietly gliding on the air.

PD))", "Many unusual lights on one object.At approximatly 2030 hours MST 11/07/04, there was an object in the North Eastern sky that was about the size of a nickel. Though there is no way to estimate distance. Call it the size of a thumb nail with the thumb held at arms length. The unusual part of the object was that it had many red lights that flash around the perimeter in a half arc (Northern half). There appeared to be about six or eight of them although they were difficult to count as they flashed in a random manner. If this object was at a great distance from where I was standing, that would cover a very large arc. The object appeared to be green, although there could be flashing green lights also. It had green highlights that came and went. They too appeared to be random as to placement. It also showed a great deal of yellow although the red and greens kind of overpower the yellow. Further, the yellow seemed more concentrated at the middle of the object. The colors were not opaque, they were distinct and bright. My first thought at seeing it was an airplane with navigation lights and the cabin lights on brightly. However, it didn&apos;t move. Not in any direction. I was visiting a friend at his house and called him out to view it also. He saw the same as I and got his binoculars. What we then saw was the same thing, just a little more clearly. The most powerful he had were 7 X 50&apos;s. We watched it for about a half hour when some cloud cover moved between us and the object and we could no longer see it clearly at all. (Although it was still vaguely visible.) One of the main points being, it did not move in all of that time. I have since come home and can still see it but not clearly at all. I have to look though tree limbs as well as the cloud cover. The second part of the evening that is interesting is that we saw what appeared to be the Northern Lights, but.... they went from the western horizon in a complete arc around to the east. I&apos;ve seen the Northern Lights many times from here, but NEVER in a 180 degree arc. An odd part of that is they appeared to start from the horizon and arc up to a single point just slightly south of overhead. I have seen the N/L&apos;s jump and shimmer all over the northern sky, but never arc to a single point overhead here in Montana. Both the eastern lights and western lights as well as those from the north all arc&apos;d to that single point. Just to mention, that point was no where near where we saw the object. It was in the lights, but in a much more easterly direction. I still wonder about airplane, but have never seen one of those with an entire series of lights that flashed in a large arc. Nor one that appeared to be an disk. Such fun. I have never seen anything like it in either case. To add, my location is about 8 miles east of the town of Lavina, Montana out in the hills. There is no possible local lighting that could have caused that.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the witness for the original report, and for the follow-up, which allows us to close this case.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))But, was wrong.Thank you for your response, Mr. Davenport.Tonight the sky is clear and I went just went out and looked again. Sure enough, it is there. So you are correct. (As you knew, I&apos;m sure. lol.)I do kind of believe the Northern Lights affected what I saw last night (wondering about which being partly why I included that in my report to you) for I had never seen coloring quite like that.Yet the star is there in the same place and while not as bright tonight (northern lights have not been turned on at this time) it does have the chromatic effect and the coloring is there, merely not as pronounced.  Which must be why I have not noticed it before.

The light then very quickly shot north from where it had been and stopped directly over me and at the same time my motorcycle engine died causing my motorcycle to stop. It happened so quick that I remember looking up and noticed a ring of red lights glowing and absolutely no noise at all. I also noticed that whatever I was looking at blotted out the stars and was very large. I estimate that it was about maybe eight stories above me. I also remember kicking the engine over on my motorcycle but it would not start. The object stayed above me for awhile and then still making absolutely no noise shot straight up into the sky getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared.

I looked towards that direction and saw a huge black rectangle with large windows on the side.  The interior of the object was light up well enough that I could tell the mass of the object was very large.  I would estimate the object to be as wide as a five lane highway or at least 100 yards wide.  I seem to remember seeing other hyper bright ( xeon or blueish in color like the new BMW cars headlights ) lights on the exterior of the object. The object passed about 200 feet off the ground nearly directly over the Schnucks store flew over hwy 67 and out of my sight.  The object made no sound as it flew overhead.  As it passed I noticed movement inside of the back windows of the object and thought I saw someone move from the interior portion of the craft to look out the window ( perhaps to see the lights of the police car ).  My immediate impression was that this was some sort of military stealth blimp.  I do recall other colored lights on the exterior of the object, but can&rsquo;t be certain of the configuration or more specifics because my attention was diverted to the large window and the movement I discussed. The next day I told my friends I had visited that evening and my then girlfriend about my experience.  I hadn&rsquo;t reported it to anyone else initially until I saw a documentary on the police officers who followed a similar object on the exact same night.  This year I contacted Darryl Barker (a local producer who has a website on the incident) here in St. Louis and spoke with him about my sighting.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Darryl Barker for directing this witness to our site.

It was in the northern sky, and seemed to be very high in the air, and looked exstreamly big.  I whatched it flash 3 times fairly quickly, and everytime it flashed, for as far as i could see was lit up with white light. It didn&apos;t move at all.

What was strange is that you could see planes all over the place in the other parts of the sky as we get a lot of flight pattern from 2 of Chicago&apos;s airports, and this light was not moving at all.  Just stationary for the most part. Then it blinked, and faded a tad, and then it was gone.  But it did not fade away, it just blinked and then faded to black in 2-3 seconds. A very similar aircraft with lots of flashing lights also flew very, very close to the red light a few minutes after we first saw it, and unlike the other planes in the area, this one had lots of flashing lights (almost like the lights on top of a police car) and it seemed to fly towards this red light intentionally as if it was trying to observe it.", "it flashed very bright and then took off at the speed of light with a blue trail following it.we were sitting on the car looking at the stars and then something flashed bright and then shot strait up with a blue stream trail following it like a tracer and then it vanished. that was it but we looked at each other and freaked out we both think it was very strange.", "cigar shape object that hoverd above a house then at speed whent in to the skyyou are about the 10 place i have contacked about this thing we saw but no one get back i giveing it last tri so iam not going to write two much as i have in the past we saw this thing in the sky long hoving then shoting up in the sky it is on camcorder for 1 min i live in england", "Triangular light formation, tree top height above my head in Aitkin MnThat night my sister was spending the night, with my wife and I.

They were pointed straight ahead like car lights.  If there would have been a craft attached to the lights I would have been able to see it.  After all, it was so low to the ground if I would have had a rock I would have been able to hit it easily.  They flew straight accross the field and over the tree line.  The speed was to slow for an airplane, but fast enough where their should have been some wind sound, there wasn&apos;t even sound from an engine. I watched it most of the way accross the field.

I and my wife saw the lights and I believe that they were three distinctly seperate objects.  After being alerted to the lights by a family member in Oak Forest we looked up from the area of 179th street and 67th Avenue.  In the Eastern sky we saw the three lights in what appeared to be an almost straight line from top to bottom with the bottom light a little further to the right (South) of the others.  As we watched the middle light moved to the right (South) of both of the others forming a triangle of sorts.  A couple of minutes later the bottom light moved up into the place that second light (the one that had moved out when the triangle was formed) was and a semi-straight line was again formed before the lights disappeared.

I had seen &quot;Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind&quot; a few years ago.  (therefore the date I gave above is only an estimate)  When the lights went out suddenly, I pulled to the right side of interstate 70.  I was headed south.  My 2 companions were go-go dancers.  I was taking them home. I stopped the car and thought that the senario reminded me of the aformentioned movie.  The fog was thick but when I looked to my right I saw a farm house  thousands of yards away that had a large red light above it.  It illuminated the whole area.  I thought at first it was a helicopter searching for some lost kids or something.  But the red light stayed fixed on the farmhouse.  I noticed there was no sound. The huge red light and no sound made me suspicious.  I tried to figure a a reasonable explanation for it, but could find none.  I kept thinking that the red light would move, but it didn&apos;t.  The light was so large, I reasoned, that it could not be a helicopter, either. ( I had not read any ufo books on abductions at this time.  Only later did I realize that what I saw appeared to be a classic abduction case.) After watching it for a half hour or more, I realized that this could be a UFO.  I raised my right hand,( in a form of greeting, with palm foreward) and said in my mind.  &quot;I have a son at home, please don&apos;t take me.&quot;  I felt immediately a tingling sensation on my palm, like they had heard my message.  I tried to awaken the two women in the back seat.  However, they did not wake up, no matter how I tried to make them.  I blieve I finally saw the light move some to my right, slowly. Still no sound.  After some time of watching the red light, I fell asleep.  I drove back home  hours later when it was light, as my lights still did not work.  I took the car to a repair shop and asked them pointedly about what caused my headlights to go out.  They said they did not know.  I had to have both headlights replaced.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I stopped the car and both my friend and I were surprised by the scale and luminence of the craft though there was no real detail we could see as it was very high above us. I said it could be a hoax by Richard Branson or someone else but then it moved from the spot it was in to a different spot in the sky to our east and at least 5 miles away as if nothing had happened - really quite effortlessly and in a split second, as if it was floating or moving gracefully, but suddenly miles away.

It moved &quot;smoothly&quot; across the sky, and no type of movement that would be consistent with flapping of wings was visible.  Moreover, even though the object was not well lighted, its shape seemed to be peculiar.  It appeared to be either triangular, or &quot;boxy,&quot; in shape, although that is a subjective analysis.

I observed what at first I thought was a very bright star. After it caught the attention of my girlfriend also, we had a closer look. It was definitely not a star. This thing was changing colours, every colour of the rainbow actually. At first it looked like just red and white but when I got it on video, it is definitely much more. Looking with the naked eye, it seems to be one object, looks somewhat like a bright star blinking rapidly. When I looked in my binoculars, it looked like 2 objects very close to each other. Moving very rapidly and wildly. It looked more like some kind of weird electrical force than a UFO, but definitely nothing I nor the people with me had ever seen before. I got out my video camera and zoomed in on it. On video, it shows as one ball of light, changing colour and moving rapidly in every direction, like the movements of a bee or some kind of insect. The binoculars may have been splitting it into 2 or maybe they got a closer look at it and it is actually 2 objects. Whatever it was, it was not from this world. I got about and hour of it on video. It lasted for well over 2 hours, I ended up waking 2 other people that were here and they say it too. When we went to bed at 5:00, it was still there.

On the top of this yellow sphere there was another sphere, red one, about 1/3 size of the yellow one which was blinking- mostly it shined but in turned off for short times in periodic intervals.

The following is a description of what I observed:  In the WSW sky elevated at approximately 15 degrees from horizontal a radiant slightly pulsating symmetrical source of extremely brilliant light was visible. White, blue, green and yellow were the most noticeable colors of light emitted. The light was being emitted in all directions (object or light source appeared to have 3-dimensons). The axis of symmetry for the object was elongated along the vertical axis and compressed along the horizontal.  The light source seemed to stay in one position for about 1.5 minutes then moved off at a moderate velocity until no longer visible 30 seconds later.

Nevertheless, my former asiistant and myself, were 500 feet in the air on the rooftop of a 50 story high rise where I have been employed in building maintenance for 22 years. This was in the heart of downtown Chicago. We were checking out the chemtrails left by some tankers that were spraying the area on that morning, ( another story entirely) when we simultaneously noticed a mettalic looking round ball sitting to the left of a very small cloud about 300 feet above us, but out over lake Michigan. We were inland about two city blocks from the lakefront, and I estimate the object to have been at the lakes edge, or directly above Lakeshore drive. As we pointed towards it, the object slowly moved behind a very small cloud, the only cloud around, and then appeared to go straight up. This was only about a 5 to 10 second viewing, and once it was behind the cloud, it&apos;s upward motion which we detected for only a second, yeilded to a complete absense of the object. Nothing speedy about it, it just appeared to briefly go upward behind this very small cloud, and then disappeared. We were both sober, and both kind of feeling funny about the viewing. We joked that we had better not tell anyone, but of course we did. It was forgotten about over time as it was really not that much of a sighting. Very bland and very brief.I would have never reported it if I hadn&apos;t come across the opportunity to do so here. In summary, we were 500 feet in the air and observed this metallic colored round ball. When we pointed to it and gazed at it, it moved behind a small cloud as if to hide itself from our view. We stayed on the roof another 10 minutes or so and it never re-appeared.Boring perhaps, but quite true. I&apos;m not saying what it was, or was not. I dont know one way or the other. Also, the object was totally silent.", "Bright, randomly flashing, zig-zagging craft or object (possibly orb) off in the distance.I heard a deep, low-pitch flight noise which motivated me to wonder what the heck it was.  Upon looking out my window to the west, I saw a bright randomly flashing object that was moving jaggedly about in a southward direction.  I have never seen flight like this.  In reality, looking at least 10 miles to the west, I don&apos;t think what I heard (the low-pitch) was what I saw.  However, this thing flew like an insect on speed.  It bobbed and weaved about, extremely rapidly, within a small radius, while travelling wherever it was headed.  I am a logical person, and the fact that the flashes were extremely bright for how far it seemed away and totally random (not timed like a commercial plane light), plus the fact that it was rapidly darting about (again constantly darting within a small area of space- the movement was part of this thing&apos;s flight pattern) leads me to believe it was not from this world, at least to my knowledge.  I&apos;ve heard of hovering, and rapid speeds, but this things was rapid within a short space of area, not darting expansive distances.  It was beyond weird, and I would&apos;ve woken my family had it not been 4:30 in the morning.  Also, in a big city like Philadelphia (I live in the suburbs 10 miles away), you&apos;d have to expect these things would not want to be seen, hence, they would probably only show themselves at very stategically planned times- such as 4:30 when most people are asleep, or not yet awoken.  I know what I saw, I may&apos;ve been tired, but I know what I saw.  And what I saw cannot be defined as a space craft from this world, at least to the layperson&apos;s knowledge.  This was energy, raw energy I presume from the random flashes and hectic darting pattern.

C.  It was late afternoon and the sky was hazy blue.  I was in the same general area as the 9/17/04 sighting.  The smooth silvery craft appeared to be at cloud base moving very slowly southeast.  It had no wings, no lights, but appeared to be a smooth circle--may have been bottom of a craft.  As it hit the edge of a cloud a big reflectiion from the sun shot out momentarily.  The craft then started to move slowly upwards (about 10-20&apos;) when strange dark straight lines appeared next to it.  I then realized it was approaching the bottom of another much larger craft--the lines were part of the larger ship.  The larger craft was completely invisible to the eye from where I was except for the lines.

I live in the flight path of nearby McChord AFB and have seen hundreds of aircraft follow this route.  This object appeared to be slightly higher than those aircraft approaching McChord AFB, and much lower than commercial aircraft for nearby Seatac International.  As the object moved by and was now to my South, I saw as it dropped several, 3-4, small objects that glowed and seemed to &quot;go out&quot; as they neared the ground.  I can only describe them as burning ember like, only they fell instead of rose.  The object continued West and made small, slow direction changes, at one point turning back east before going West again.  The object dropped a few more &quot;embers&quot; before it lost whatever illumination it had and disappeared.  I could hear a faint noise that I compare to mabye a blimp enjine, too quiet for a helicoptor.  I could hear the noise after the object was no longer visible.

It was flying north at around 200 to 300 mph in a northerly direction which stayed in view for less than a minute. A 747 was flying near by, leaving a long contrail and heading south parallel to the UFO. The UFO didn&rsquo;t make any sound as it passed over. The UFO was round and bright and gleamed like the suns rays were bouncing off of it. As it flew over I could see that some type of white mass was protruding from all around the UFO in a clockwise position at a very slow spin compared to its speed. The UFO was too high to determine if it was shedding the white material or not. It was hard to believe what I saw until I got my October issue of UFO magazine a few days after the sighting.

I looked up and saw a small disk glowing very bright green, just the color of a traffic light. It moved quickly across the sky in a westerly or slight southwesterly direction. As it moved away from me it appeared only as a white light. It streaked across the sky very quickly, being visible for only about a second, and then disappeared from sight. I was left rather stunned and wondering what it was. I would rule out any commercial or private aircraft. I would estimate its altitude at somewhere less than 10,000 feet. An aircrat at this altitude would move much more slowly. In fact  several minutes later I saw a plane cross the same area, and it was tiny and moving very slowly. The object I saw was also completely silent. The lights it displayed did not resemble those of a typical aircraft. I have observed military aircraft over Boston. They were extremely loud. If this was a stealth bomber why would it display the bright green light?  I would also rule out a low or high orbit satellite as I have seen them before and they look completely different.

Lack of visual reference cues makes this thing impossible to size, but it moved like a big object and the reflection of the street and city lights glowed dimly off the curved bottom surface at a seemingly moderate height, well below the airliner traffic. It made no sound and really seemed to be more a boomerang shaped disturbance in the air rather than a visible object. Speed was impossible to judge, except to say that it took 20 to 25 seconds to traverse my field of vision. I jumped up and stood in the spa to view as much of this thing as possible while it disappeared behind the houses across the street.

As we do often while fishing and waiting for fish to strike, we try to spot these satellites moving across the sky at night. I spotted one in no time and motioned my son over to look at it...he was impressed at the speed. Usually, these objects are very small and look like light dots moving quite fast across from one side of the sky to as far as our eyes could see. This &quot;dot&quot; of light was moving consistently with what I have witness a few times before when spotting these satellites. As it moved across, my son and I were tracking it and pointing at it when all of the sudden it stopped and it took off faster than it was moving in the beginning.....90 degrees to our right. This object seemed to stop dead on and took off 90 degrees from the direction it was traveling and it disappeared. Needless to say, we were speechless.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It moved to fast for us to see it move but we followed the red glow as it trailed like a small tail of ionized air behind and below the craft.it moved 3 times and the second time it hovered over a cow and it was lifted in air to the crafts middle at which point we started jumping up and down in excitment to what we were seeing, we unwittinglly attacted the attention of the craft and 1 second later it was over us! the beam used on the cow was now on us!  we could not look up at it as we were both paralysized physically in this beam but we could scream and we did.the light beam looked like white laser light. you could see particles of sort in light like thick light.

While heading eastbound on State Road 26 at around 8:30 pm, give or take about 15 minutes, an orange burst of light caught my attention in my peripheral vision. The night was clear, there were no clouds. I saw an orange light, at first like a dim star, which grew in size or intensity to about four times the size and brightness of Venus. Then another light seemed to grow near this one in the same manner, at about 10 o&apos;clock the original objects position. Then the first object faded out followed by the second. This took place over a 10-20 second period. After this happened, I noticed two objects remaining equidistant circle the area. From my position facing east, they started at the eleven o&apos;clock position and moved to the two o&apos;clock position, and then back again, from left to right. Vertically, if the ground is at  90 degrees and straight up is zero degrees, they were at about 50 degrees up. I have no experience judging distance so this is the only way I can relate it, I hop it helps! Once these two objects returned to the position I originally noticed them, I noticed several other objects, three, I believe. They converged in one central area of the sky. At this point I pulled off the road to watch them more closely at the state road 26 and state road 29 intersection. I observed the same appearance of the orange lights that I described earlier. Each time I witnessed that, I observed another object. They totalled seven at this point. They were flying in all directions in the sky, but circling to the north of 26. They were about one half the brightness of venus. At some times they were flying quickly while others seemed to maintain position. The objects themselves flashed white, but intermittently. This is why I was so interested in them, never seeing an airplane like that. The two objects that were keeping the same distance between them as I described earlier seemed to be flashing at eachother. One would flash several times, for different durations, a quick flash followed by a long, at a seemingly random interval. Then the other would start flashing just as the original ended. It reminded me of the lights on a broadband modem, when the computer is connecting to the internet. Once there were seven objects all flying in random directions one flew directly over my position. I can&apos;t judge the altitude of it, but it wasn&apos;t as high as those jet liners that are seen at night... probably not helping. it was about the size of venus in the sky, but not as bright. The object that flew over me appeared to by triangular, although that was hard to judge. It had three red areas, that looked like the tips of a triangle. the outer points were the brightest, fading into black at the center. It resembled a peice of metal when a torch is held on one side until it gets red hot, fading into the opposite, cooler edge. The objects maintained their seemingly random flight paths and then fell in line heading southwest at an incredible rate of speed from my position at the intersection . They would have bursts of light that became more uniform in interval instead of the random flashes from earlier, and then accelerated across the sky. I phoned my brother to look outside at home (romney, indiana) to look outside to see if he could see them. He looked east from our house half a mile from US 231 and he saw them. He reported that they were moving at an unbelievable speed and reported that he saw one start flashing really quick and take off. They headed south out of sight.", "NON BELIEVER TO FIRM BELIEVER FROM ONE ENCOUNTERme and a mfriend of mine were standing out front of my house smoking a cigarette and talking. We noticed a really bright light in the sky, about half the size as a dime in the sky about right in front of us. then 10-15 minutes later we noticed it was alot further to the left. We started looking at it periodically and noticed it was slowly moving horizontally across the sky but very slow. I don&apos;t know how close we were so I cant tell you exactly how fast it was going. All the time it was gradually changing colors from a bluish, to a greenish, to a yellowish color, i emphasize on the &quot;ish&quot; because the colors were changing so fast we could not make out one specific color at a time. Then we were both watching this light yapping about god knows what, probobally trying to figure out what it could be, when all of the sudden the light got really dim, then it flashed really bright while changing colors still and vanished from the sky for good. Then a week later the exact same scenario happend to a T. Same lights, same slow moving &quot;craft&quot;, same dim to bright and disapear action. Until then I did not believe in E.T&apos;s or UFO&apos;s, but since that night i&apos;ve been reading alot and digging deep and now i&apos;m sure what I saw is what I think it is.

I called out my room mates boyfriend to see waht I was looking at. We both watched two smaller fireballs flash brightly then both fell, one on each side of the craft. To me it looked like when the space shuttle takes off and then drops its solid fuel boosters. The third trail of fire just kept going and faded off into the night sky.

They were very bright white lights, I don&rsquo;t recall seeing any colored lights, and they were moving slowly westward.  I went to look for my binoculars in another room, when I got back into the living room the lights were traveling in my direction.  I went out to the front porch to get a better look and try to hear the aircraft, they were moving very slowly, not like an airplane or helicopter, I thought maybe a blimp but couldn&rsquo;t hear any sounds coming from the lights.  The lights passed in front of my neighbor&rsquo;s house which is north of my position, their house being approximately 300 feet away.  How far the lights were in front of their house I have no idea, but they appeared to be right in front of if from my point of view.  The distance between the lights was the size of two of my fists held at arms length, and black in the center, in other words I couldn&rsquo;t see anything in between the two lights, which led me to think maybe a blimp but still no sound what so ever.  Maybe it was two aircrafts flying side by side, each with one light on them, whatever it was all I could see was the light, not a shape of a craft or anything to describe how it looked.  I lost them behind the trees on our property, they were traveling west/southwest at the time and I didn&rsquo;t spot them again on the other side of the trees.

They were first noticed over the near-north side of the city, passing over downtown, until out of sight.  All 3 objects were the same color.  They did not appear to be emitting any light of their own, but possibly reflecting the light of the city.  The color of the objects was a muted pinkish hue, about the same color as the haze on the horrizon glowing from the city lights.  For this reason, I first thought the objects were clouds or smoke from New Year&apos;s Eve fireworks, but then I realized that the sky was perfectly clear, and 2 of the objects were changing shape in what appeared to be a controlled movement.

Suddenly, I heard weird pinging sounds. I looked up and saw three saucers zipping through. There were green trails where the aircrafts had flown by. They were in a tight triangular formation. Suddenly, four or five more saucers in loose formation shot out from the clouds after the previous UFOs (which I think they were). Suddenly, a light shot out from one of the pursuiting crafts after the ones that had previously zipped by. It hit one, and it instantly blew up. When the green phosphorous light caused by what I think was a missile cleared, there was no more light there. From the rear, more missiles shot out. One of the lead UFOs took a sharp banking turn (the light started dimming, which I think means he turned away) and the missile just continued on its path. The other one took a critical hit, and the same thing happened. There was nothing else. The four or five planes in the back seemed to have disappeared because it didn&apos;t glow anymore, but later, I saw flashing lights, which I think were indicator lights.

We determined this by the objects proximity to a mountain in the same area. We noticed the light because it was moving all around but not going anywhere. It also caught our attention because there is normally very little aircraft activity in the area, due to its remote location. The light would also change colors every few minutes, from white to green and back. After observing for a few minutes, we noticed another object to our west at about the same distance, behaving in the same manner. We looked in all directions and noticed two more. One to the east and one to the south. These appeared a bit more distant. As for altitude, my guess is from 2,000 ft. for the closest two to ??? for the distant lights.

Finally, the lights just went out.I returned to my dorm and found my roomate was listening to his police scanner, as he was a part time ambulance driver.

It was a clear night and there were stars out, nice to see over the city.  Then I saw the flashing lights in the sky, blueish white, no noticeable pattern.

These two lights seemed to escort every single jet that passed out of the area in some what of a formation trailing each other.  Once a jet liner flew over, probably a gov. plane, that was escorted by a fighter jet and was still followed by these two flashing lights.  Every time the flashing objecs would zip back to there positions over Manhattan.  I thought this was crazy so I had to go wake up my girlfriend to show her.  I had already been sitting watching these objects for over 30 minutes and she saw them as well.  She went back to bed I continued to watch them do the same thing over and over again.  They moved so smoothly and quickly through the sky it was amazing and flashed the whole time.  I know dying stars tend to flicker and sometimes seemed to be shooting stars but after every movement, north or south, they would return to their original position over the city.  From the time of this sighting and the location being the over Manhattan on the last day of the RNC, it is my guess that this was not alien but US military related in origin.  Whatever their origin, this was an amazing display of aviation.  I eventually became bored and went to bed with the objects still doing their thing in the night sky.

It was during the last week of August, right before Labor Day weekend.  One night, after putting our son to bed, about 10:00pm, I walked out onto the balcony and looked out over the gulf waters.  In the sky, there were two round lights.  They were white &amp; amber colored, kind of like far away headlights.  As a matter of fact, that&apos;s exactly what I thought they were...plane headlights, really close ones.  But they weren&apos;t getting any closer.  They weren&apos;t moving at all.  I called my dad and husband out to the balcony to take a look, but then they were gone.  They just disappeared in the exact same spot they had appeared in.  All the while, there were no sounds except the tiny waves that make it into the gulf. All of this transpired in 45-60 seconds. About 60 seconds went by, and  right after my dad &amp; husband made it onto the balcony, the lights re-appeared in the exact same spot.  At first just the two of them came back.  Then, as my dad, husband and I stood looking at these two lights, another one appeared to the right and just slightly above the others.  Then another one to the right and slightly above that one.  And then another.  So, now, there were five lights with the first two being side-by-side and the other three extending up &amp; out to the right in a diagonal line.  Still, I could hear no sound except the calm ocean.  After watching these lights appear and stay lit for about 40 seconds, I turned to run inside and get my camera.  As I went through the sliding glass door, I looked behind me, afraid that the lights would be gone.  Just as I turned and looked at them, they faded to black and I could no longer see them.  I did not get a picture. We sat on the balcony for a few more hours, until about 12:00 midnight.  We sat out there talking about what we had seen and looking out over the gulf, waiting for the lights to come back, but they never did. Now, I&apos;m not sure what we really saw out there.  I know that Eglin AFB is really close to this area.  Maybe the lights had to do with that.  Also, maybe there was a ship way out there in the gulf that we couldn&apos;t see, with air craft taking off from it.  I guess maybe, we&apos;ll never know.  However, if anyone out there knows what it could have been, or has seen something similar, any information would be greatly appreciated.", "Huge Black Triangle sighted in the night sky over Borrego Springs, Ca.

The two smaller ufo&apos;s where mainly red in color and were only visible for a 10 min period. The objects often moved and changed shapes and sizes.

The lights on the bottom are so bright, it seems as though it is spotlighting the ground beneath.  The second time I saw this aircraft, I was driving in my car home.

The object began to travel away from me in a westerly direction at a very shallow angle, again with no visible means of propulsion. It climbed and travelled at relatively the same speed. Never increasing speed. There were times as I watched that the object would bounce up and down and side to side as if being affected by turbulence.

As I watched it more closely I realized that it was wobbling up and down, side to side in small but definate movements. Also noticed it wasnt moving in a direction. It was stationary aside from the wobbling movements. This event lasted for at least two cigarettes, and I smoke 100&apos;s, and a few mins longer than that. I estimate 20 mins. or so.

In the old days, I listened to Sputnik and watched the ECHO satellites.  I have built telescopes and have spent many hours watching and photographing the sky.  Over the years, I have seen all of the usual UFO candidates like satellites, flocks of birds, highflying aircraft, balloons, blimps, and rocket launches (we can see them from Vandenberg).  So, I am reporting this in the hope that someone can give me an explanation for what I saw. The sky was clear and dark.  I was looking for a comet when I saw three orange lights (approx magnitude 4) traveling at an apparent high rate of speed from north to south, passing about 3 degrees west of the Pleiades.  I believe that their altitude was greater than that of an aircraft on approach to LAX or Burbank.  Even though the sky was dark and clear, the lights did not appear to be true points of light, as the stars did.  I had the impression that they had ?dimension?.  It was as though I was viewing them through a light cloud, but there were no clouds.  One light was distinctly ahead of the other two by at least 2 degrees.  The trailing two appeared to be side-by-side with approximately a &frac14; to &frac12; degree separation.  One of the trailing two then appeared to overtake the other and their separation decreased to near zero.  The one that appeared to overtake the other then went slightly ahead.  They all vanished about 45 degrees above the southern horizon.  There was no sound or trail.  The behavior is consistent with a typical satellite, except that there were three at once and the apparent passing of one by another.  I checked satellite-viewing websites and could not find any naked eye satellites that would have matched what I saw.", "3 strong lights that faded out when approached by fighter jetsInformation from a good friend who passed this info to me in confidence.My friends are in a band and were driving back from a gig and stopped the van to go to toilet just before 6am just north of the town of Cashel near Thurles, Ireland.

The lights were independent and lined up on top of each other with the top light  slightly off to one side.

It was as if the light was headed the same direction we were.  The light grew 3 or 4 times it size and then would just blink out.... gone and just as quickly would reappear.  It would split and 3 or 4 smaller lights would would sort of fly away from the original light.  They would fly sort of a zig zag pattern ....zip zip... up down.... gone there ... crazy.... no planes fly and disappear and reappear and change colors.... go big and then like a tiny pinprick in the sky...I have seen other ufo&apos;s in the sky when I have been alone but this time the family saw it.  When we got home to Girard Michigan I ran in the house and called the radio station in Coldwater Michigan.... boy that was a mistake.... they thought I was looney and laughed.... whil I was on the phone my husband and kids stayed outside to observe the light... it was descending on the horizon, grew 6 or 7 times it size.... bright bright... and then just gone...One time when I was driving very late I saw lights in the sky similar to the above... I was driving cross country on the back roads and there was a car came up behind me and both of us pulled off the road to watch this.... there was a man and woman in the other car.... we didn&apos;t speak to one another just watched till the light or craft whatever, was gone... got into our cars and drove away....

My feet were pointed to the east, and I noticed in looking back towards the west what I first thought was a meteorite approaching from the west traveling east. I sat up to watch, and mentioned to my friend that this meteor is just going and going and not burning out. I watched it fall far below the horizon, and thought it might actually make a landing in the Atlantic ocean. I laid back down and began scanning for meteors, satellites, jets, etc. when it approached from the east moving to directly overhead of me at a tremendous rate of speed. Quite abruptly, and with perfect precision and no change in speed, it performed a maneuver and changed course at about a 45 degree angle. I remember feeling ecstatic, and had quite a surge of adrenaline. I told my friend what I&apos;d just seen, he seemed disinterested. Within a minute, the object moving at the same speed began to approach from the west. This time it performed more high speed perfect maneuvers, zig zagging directly overhead and continuing east. It was at this time that I began to percieve that it looked like a very tiny triangle with a red light at each point. It seemed to be at a very high altitude and made no noise like a turbine engine. The maneuvers were impossible for a fixed &quot;lift&quot; type wing, and too perfect and quiet for turbine thrusters. If It came back from the east I don&apos;t remember because eventually it began doing the same thing but in a North south, south/north flight path. Every time it passed, the maneuvers became more complicated, and I witnessed it at least ten times or more flying back and forth. Again, I stress that the maneuvers were geometrically perfect. My friend is not as familiar with the sky as I am, and it took a few passes for him to actually detect the craft, but what turned out to be it&apos;s last pass, he described to me the maneuvers as I had seen them. He doesn&apos;t talk about it to this day. As a matter of interest, the last maneuver that it performed actually included a full and abrupt stop, followed by a faint burst of light as it took off again towards the south. It did not accelerate...It went from zero to full speed instantaneously. The whole event left me feeling satisfied but puzzled, a bit frustrated but elated, and I can&apos;t just tell anyone, because humans live in darkness. But let those who are wise understand this...A light has shown in the darkness but the darkness has not understood it; I&apos;m not worried about what I saw, just blessed. And someday I&apos;ll know the answer when I look not through the darkened mirror, but meet the Perfect face to face.", "white light similar to satellite traveling high over SeattleAt about 5:17 this evening I was on my deck and as always looking up at the sky to see what was there.  It was just getting dark and the stars were starting to show up, (the brightest ones first of course), were all I could see at this time.  So, right by the star Capella, I believe, in the constellation of Auriga, there was a rather bright light appearing to be the same size and brightness of that star (Capella) traveling in a East, Southest direction, at a fairly slow speed.  At first my thoughts were that it was a Satellite~ and it could have been I guess, however it didn&apos;t seem to act like any satellite I&apos;ve seen before.  First of all, it was for sure not a plane! There were no blinking lights on this object,just a white light, like a star.  Usually satellites disappear quite quickly and sometimes even flash as if in rotation and reflecting light as they rotate, but this light stayed the same intensity the whole time I observed it.  I actually ran into the house and grabbed my binoculars and ran back out and still found it moving in the same general direction without the binocs!  So I followed it with the binoculars for a couple more minutes until it faded and finally disappeared, which was fairly close to the horizon /Cascade Mountains.  It also did seem to speed up and change direction of its course although this was not real apparent, not like rapid changing or sharp angled turns. Just a sort of veering into a more southerly direction and speeding up slightly.  It also didn&apos;t seem to be as high as a satellite usually travels.  That is about it, nothing overly exciting but I thought it was worth writing in about.  I&apos;m wondering if anyone else saw it and might of reported it also.  I&apos;d be interested to know if you think it was a satellite.Thanks, DC", "Bright greenish blue light dropping down(southern horizon) and gone. I expected to hear a big bang, but alas, it was silent.", "V shaped light formation travleing S/SW in BiloxiI was standing outside this morning watching the meteor shower. A boomerang of lights seemed to appear out of nowhere, close to the ground but made no sound. It turned in different directions rapidly then just disappeared. I live close to Keesler Air Force Base and figured it was probably just a plane. But I could see no outline of a plane even though it was that close to the ground and i could hear no engines. The best way I can describe what it looked like, because I can&apos;t remember how many lights, is a flock of geese heading south for the winter...all wearing orangish~yellow lights. Maybe someone out there has a logical explanation for what I saw.

It was traveling toward the northeast.  From the south position to almost directly east took about 7 seconds.  The object was less than a mile from me, about 1,500 feet above ground level and 100-150 feet in diameter.  It did not change speed or altitude.  There was NO sound, lights, trail, aura or vibrations.  If this object did not change course prior to me seeing it, it must have past over the Berwick Nuclear power plant outside Berwick, PA.", "While driving a friend ogf mine and I both saw random glowing lights appear in the sky then formed a strait line and dissapearHere my description and it&apos;s still so fresh seeing how it happened just last night. My friend Stuart and I were on our way to Books A Million to pick up my wife from work who would be geeting off at 8:00pm.  It was probably 5 minutes before 8 when it happened. As i was turning in to the parking lot I saw a group of what looked light glowing balls of light come out of knowhere, they didn&apos;t seem to be in any formation at the time and I was like stuart Do You See That and he was like yeah and then these &quot;glowing balls&quot; formed into a  line that  sort of looked like the were turning either towards us or away and as they turned we could see that the turned into like a streamline of light and then they just Dissappeared just like that.  So it was like, no formation of glowing balls, formation and moving in the same direction and then to a perfect line then dissapeared.  We were shocked!  It was amazing! And later we both discussed the fact that the lights looked sort of like the yellow caution lights you see on roads, but from a distance. Also if that was some sort of military aircraft turning in flight then it was a HUGE one maybe the size of a b-52.  But, the fact that it went from no frormation to formation boggled our minds.  I&apos;m happy that there was a sight to post this on, it makes me feel a little better about the whole&quot;situation&quot;. Thanks!!  Robert Randow", "Twilight sighting of bright, glowing, red, oval and moving object in northern Canada.While driving in our small city at very near 4:15 PM (MST)we noticed a bright red object in the sky. It appeared to be moving at high speed although we later debated the speed of the craft at some length. One of us thought that it was moving slowly and for a period was stopped, another thought that it moved at extemely high speed. One thought that it changed directions a number of times. We are confused about the sighting. It was very bright, and the only object in the sky. It was roundish in shape but probably oval would be more accurate. It seemed big. It was clearly red in colour.  There were no other colours present. Just a steady red glowing light. This was what made it stand out so clearly. It was nearly time for the sun to go down, and the sky was white. Here the night hours start very early due to the location on the globe. The sun was down but there was still light in the sky. This object was not the northern lights, a star, the sun, a planet, a meteor or anything else we have seen before. Other people saw this object while stopped at one of the main intersections near the hospital and Wal-mart. We could see them looking at the object from their vehicles as well. The object appeared, from our location, to be right over the main part of the city, and then moved off over Great Slave Lake. We were driving at the time, on our way to the vets to pick up a dog, and when we came out of the vet clinic the object was gone, but the night sky was still bright enough to see that it was gone. It was no star. It moved deliberatly. It was interesting, but we were not terribly upset or frightened. Just left with a sense of &quot;What in the world was that?&quot;", "sphere flying over traffic congestion in Bakersfield Ca January 05I was traveling to the gym for a morning workout at 8:00 am on Rosedale highway heading east and traffic was heavy. I spotted a flying object which I thought was a helicopter flying at about 1,000 feet elevation. It seemed to be gaining speed and as it neared my vicinity, I was trying to see the blades or the tail of the craft. It was about 1/2 mile away and at 1,000 feet. Thinking it was a helicopter, I thought that it must be on a heading for some crime that occured in our area. But, it didn&apos;t slow down. It was picking up speed and then turned northwest and as it did, I could see that it had no wings, tail, or blades. It was shaped like the front of a helicopter and on the back were 3 large round purple sphere. It made no noise and seemed to just glide along. Then, I thought it might be a weather balloon. But, the direction of the winds were easterly at 30 miles per hour due to a rain storm earlier in the am. It was heading against the direction of the wind. It gained altitude about 500 feet and maintained its speed north west. There was no jet trail, or sound of it moving. It was if it was scouting for something or sightseeing our city and the traffic. I took several pictures with my throwaway camera. They have been developed and you can see a small object in the distance in each photo. But, because I used a cheap camera, anything more than a 1,000 feet away is just a spot. I called the airport radar tower. They didn&apos;t want to say anthing about it. I called the paper, they just sd send an email and copy of the pic. Oh well, I did see other people in thier cars staring at it. As we were stopped at red light for at least 1 minute. I pulled over and took the pics.If there is anybody else that saw the object this morning. Maybe you also took a  photo. email me at ((e-address deleted))", "Large &quot;Gulf Breeze&quot; type object seen over Boston at about 10,000 feet in WinterI was a passenger with a window seat(F) on the Boston MA to Newark NJ shuttle.  We were climbing out of Boston through large thick clouds that had open spaces between them.  We were at about 10,000 to 15,000 feet when we flew by a gap between clouds and I saw clearly a large object that struck me at first as being the shape of a hot air balloon (with no gondola), but it appeared to be solid and the diameter of the bottom narrower part was bigger and had a kind of flange shape at the bottom.  The object was mostly light colored with regularly spaced raised geometric shapes in several bands around the object.  (Seven years later when I first saw the Gulf Breeze photos, I blurted out &quot;That&apos;s what I saw!&quot;) The gap in the clouds closed in about five seconds.  I looked up and down the interior of my plane to see if any other passengers had been looking out the window and showed signs of having seen the object, but no one appeared to have been looking.  I clearly remembered that it had been just below freezing on the ground as I entered the airport, so at 10,000 feet it would have been extremely cold.  The object appeared to be motionless, relative to the clouds, and it was BIG.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two serious-minded sounding reports from same witness.

It must&apos;ve lasted for about 10 minutes or so, but it felt like it was a lot longer, but anyway, I thought that somebody must&apos;ve been camping out in the woods in the middle of the night and made a campfire for light, because it was too warm to have a fire in the first place. Suddenly, the glow started to move slowly left and right then it gradually disappeared.

My sister said &quot;look at that light in the sky, it&apos;s white, blue, and red.&quot; I was driving so I could not pay very much attention, but I glanced up and noticed it. My sister then said &quot;look, it&apos;s moving.&quot; At that point my sister-in-law in the back seat said &quot;that is not a helicopter, it&apos;s moving too fast.&quot; I wanted to check it out because they seemed to be alarmed about it. As I was turning the corner I looked up in the sky and I saw it move very fast back in the directon that it was coming from, so I immediately pulled over into a driveway and parked. We continued to watch for about 3 minutes when we noticed that there were more lights blinking and moving in the sky. They began to move back and forth and up and down way too fast to be anything other than ufo&apos;s. We noticed that they seemed to be responding to each other by blinking their lights in patterns and after they would do this we noticed the others moving towards each other. At this point we were outside the car screaming to each other in disbelief of what we were seeing. Then we noticed that one of them began to come closer in our atmosphere and moving in our direction. At that point I called my husband, hysterically trying to explain what we were seeing. In this time that I was on the phone the object came closer and moved over our heads at about as high as a helicopter would fly, and that is when we knew these objects were not stars or planes, etc. We could actually see the lights rotating in a clockwise motion around   the middle of the circular craft. That object continued past us, and headed towards town.I then hung up with my husband who thought I must have gone insane. We then focused on the 6-7 other lights in the sky that were moving quickly and flashing lights that were a reddish color. The lights were then scattered throughout the sky and we saw some that they were moving in the direction of our apartments so we hurried home. As I was coming in the apartment complex we noticed that one of the lights looked like it was coming down toward the ground so we drove to the back of apartments to continue watching it. It then started moving behind the trees so we could not see it. Then all of a sudden it came back up into the sky above the trees and then we noticed the other lights coming over from up the street. By this time we are terrifird because there are so many at one time we were afraid that we were being invaded at that moment, so we called the local sheriff&apos;s office and began reporting what we saw, and asked if there were other report&apos;s yet. As my siser was talking to the person on the phone I noticed a bigger light coming from the ground up over the trees. The best way to describe it would be the way a light turns on a lighthouse, except we don&apos;t actually see the light, just the flashing rotation. Just as that light was turning I saw a beam of black light shoot up into the sky where the objects were. I would have expected a laser light to be white but this was not, it looked like a shadow of a laser being shot in the sky. At that point I was really thinking I was insane , and I said to the girls &quot;did you see that black laser beam shoot into the sky&quot;, just as I said that another black beam extended to the sky and we all saw it that time. It was unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen, as it happened we were all screaming into the phone to the sheriff&apos;s office what had just happened with the beam and that was enough to get him off the phone and out to where this was happening. He informed us that he was leaving the station to see what we were reporting. We did not tell him our exact location or names in fear of us being labeled as insane. We then noticed that after that beam of dark light the colored flashing lights seemed to just flicker out into space as if they were never there. We then rushed home to tell my brother and he confided in us that he&apos;s seen them ever so often in the same vicinity where we saw them. I did call the sheriff&apos;s office back to see what the officer had witnessed and we were told that the sargeant was the one who left and he had&apos;nt returned yet. I know this sounds crazy but I am a 25 yr. old mother who works in the medical field and the last time I checked I was completely sane. After seeing that black laser beam of light shoot into the sky I know that what we witnessed was not ordinary. I have always been interested in ufo&apos;s even as a child but I had never seen one. I forgot to mention that after seeing the first light I said to my sister &quot;I always look and wish to see one&quot; and that is when they just seemed to come from everywhere. It was like they were saying &quot;you wanted to see us here we are, take a good look.&quot;  This experience has changed my life, I came home and described it to my husband and began to cry because everything changes when you actually see one up close and personal. When I&apos;m reading or watching tv shows about them I can put it off as someone&apos;s imagination.

Two were parallel to each other, and the third was just a little below the two.  They were shaped similarly to vacation cruise ships, albeit much longer and more slender,  and   because of the perspective, must have in actuality been a lot larger, certainly much larger than the plane I was in.  Many other passengers were looking out the window, presumably at the objects, because on most flights I take, I don&apos;t see many people watching out the window during the landing.  No one commented on the objects. At the time I thought I must have been seeing some weird reflection,  or some lit up building that was resting on a low mountain or hill but they really were too solid and distinct to have been some oddity of the light, and the Baltimore/D.C. area doesn&apos;t have mountains to say the least.  They were subtlely lit. My mind totally tried to rationalize what I saw, because they weren&apos;t like any common aircraft at all.  When I first glanced at them I thought they were other planes coming in to land, but I soon realized that they were too long and far too large, only their distance made them seem momentarily comparable in size to our aircraft.

One of them on my left side leaned over to get a closer look at me, and his face went into the light a little, so I could see him pretty good.  I could tell it was a male because of his presentation, and he had some male human characteristics.  Immediately after his face went into the light, he was scolded by the person standing next to him, then I seemed to be able to understand their language by telepathy, and I could hear them telling him that they would have to send me back because now I know what they look like.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

This time, while waiting on a street corner (Old Courthouse at Lord Fairfax) for a bus, I observed a jet flying towards the southwest, at an altitude of perhaps 30 degrees above the horizon, being trailed by two apparently spherical objects, one larger than the other, giving what appeared to be a metallic or specular reflection.  The objects maintained a roughly constant distance from the aircraft of a mile or less, following consistently on the port side of the jet (clearly away from the contrail left by the jet).  The jet (and others like it) were leaving contrails, but the spherical objects did not.  As the airplane and the objects passed into the distance, the smaller of the two spheres became less visible, being obscured in the general haze at times, and eventually all three were lost to view.  Other than the haze, the sky was cloudless.  The jet appeared dark in silhouette against the sky, unlike the objects--i.e., the reflection patterns of sunlight were entirely different for the objects from those of the aircraft.  The observation location was -77.22943 long, 38.91296 lat. While riding the bus home from that point a few weeks later, at nearly the same time of day (about 1615 EST--note that the first observation was in daylight time, though), I again observed the same phenomenon, this time with only one spherical metallic object in view, with the plane and object nearly overhead, rather than lower in the sky and well to the southwest of the location.  The sky had a lot of high broken clouds, and the plane and object disappeared and re-appeared among the clouds more than once.  Because of the angle of observation through the bus window, the phenomenon could be observed for only a couple of minutes this time. Weather permitting, I have continued to observe west- and southwest-bound jets at this time of day since, but have not seen the phenomenon again.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The loops had increased to 9. We again calculated the drift speed &amp; found it to be 0.2&deg;/min.

There was a light cloud layer to the north approx. 800 - 1000 feet high. I focused on the craft and could see it was about 400 feet above me.  Completely dark with a very light grayish V along the botton.  It was going very, very slowly and there was no sound what so ever. There was also no masking noises in the area to block any sound it might have been making.  It was moving south to north very slowly.  It was extremely difficult to see and although it was very close, it was very, very dark.  It had no lights of any kind.  No wingtip markers, no strobes, no anti-collision lights.  There was significant commercial air traffic in the air and it was flying right under the landing path for BWI aircraft as it traveled north. As it passed over I got off of the trampoline and walked to the hillside to get a rear view.  When it was between myself and the cloud layer it was almost completely triangular.  I would have thought it was an Stealth Fighter F-117 but the tail was not serated, and it was flying way, way too slowly and with out any marker lights.  I had a good low angle view to its rear and still saw no marker lights. I thought I should report it.  A thousand of these could have flown over my house and I would never have seen them.  It was extremely difficult to see.  I have seen stealth aircraft at airshows, both in the air and on the ground, but this was totally silent and only going perhaps 30 or 40 mph.

Nov.1974 at night.  Round, bright white object hovers over the lake.My father and I were up deer hunting in the fall of what we think was the year 1974.We were at my grandmothers cottage which resided on the south end of Higgins Lake. Her cottage is about 80 feet from the shoreline.We were just about ready to go to bed when I noticed a very bright round object just sitting above the lake, about 40 feet off shore.At first glance I thought it might just be a full moon, or possibly someone out in a boat shinning a light at the cottage.The longer I watched it the more I realized it was nothing of the sort and I was a witness of something vey special.It was at about this moment that I looked at my father to see what his reaction was.The object was a very bright white light and round, it lit up the inside of the cottage. At this point I was so intrigued that I wanted to go outside to investigate it. I even had the thought that I would take my rifle with me. It was at this point that my dad told me to put my head down and try to go to sleep. Being only 17 years old I did what my father told me to do, I put my head down and I ended up falling asleep.It hasnt been untill recent years that my father and I have talked about the incident.I know this sounds a little strange that we have not spoke alot about it with each other untill now, but my parents are divorced, we did not see alot of each other then or now. When I finally brought the subject up with him at a family gathering I was amazed at what he said.He told me he felt extremely threatened by the object. That is why he told me to put my head down and go to sleep. He said he felt that it was his way of protecting me from what ever was out there. He also was pretending to go to sleep to relax me. He tells me after about 20 minutes he pulled his head out from under the blankets looked out the window and the object was finally gone.This object made no noise what so ever, but it has left a huge imprint on our lives.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounds both sincere and credible to us.

I saw some red lights and a white light in the trees ahead of me. As I drove up to these lights they were completely stationary making no noise, and i would say about 100 feet off the ground. I 100% thought these were radio towers or cell towers that someone one put up today. I completely stopped the vehicle and put my window down. As soon as I did this the object made a slight roaring noise and accelerated extremly quick to the north. As it flew north it gained altitude and speed untill I could no longer see it.  It had a steady red light on what I would call the front of the craft, a blinking red light on the tail of the craft and a steady white light on the bottom. I could not see the actual craft or its shape, but the orientation of the lights allowed me to make out front back and bottom.

A cold front had recently passed through so the sky was with about a 10/15 mph north wind.  I took my dog outside as I do every night and the object caught my attention right away. I was looking east/southeast.  It was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon and not moving.  The object was an extremely bright cluster of flashing red, white and blue lights in the shape of a cone or diamond (at times it was each).  The first thing to come to my mind was a helicopter in a search pattern. As I watched it there was no movement or sound, it was way too bright and I have yet to see an aircraft with lights in this formation, brightness or colors.  I was not able estimate the size or distance of the object because of not reference points.  There was a white light on top with red, white and blue lights flashing (not blinking) randomly around and on the bottom of the object.  All of the lights had the intensity of strobes.  The lights would diminish in intensity and then get extremely bright. I watched it for approximately fifteen minutes and went back into my house to get my binoculars and my wife.  She watched it for about 10 minutes. It still showed no movement or sound.  Through the binoculars I was able to better see the individual lights but not a structure.  I watched it until approximately 9:40 pm. During that time it again diminished in brightness and moved a few degrees to the south and a few in altitude.  I finally got too cold and went back inside. The next night I went back out during the same time period to see if this may have been a star that had fooled me due light refraction with the combination of a recent cold front and closness to the horizon.  I check three times during the same time period and the sky was empty of any lights or stars.  Just blackness.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

At precisely 19.05, my brother sat opposite said &apos;whats that light in the sky&apos;.We all began to observe a very bright light at about a 45 deg angle in the sky over the sea.We had been observing the stars every night, as they are so clear in the Cuban sky from what we see in the UK, and we knew instantly this was no planet or star.The light was a pulsating orange light, that was motionless.My brother said he had been watching it for a few minutes previous, and only mentioned it when he saw another orange light slowly join it.To me it was one light, but some at our table thought there could be up to four lights close together.I estimated the light to be no more than 3 or 4 miles away.We all agreed the light was orange, and slightly pulsating, or possibly expanding and contracting.Other diners noticed our looking, and they began to observe the object.Then the waiters became interested, followed by the kitchen staff who all came out and went to the edge of the restaurant for the clearest view.This was the best indication that we were observing something unusual, as the Cuban staff seemed so fascinated themselves.In all there were about 20 people watching the object. We observed this object all together for about 5 minutes.It was about 19.10 when the light just faded and was gone.Unfortunately I did not have my camera with me this evening. There was some background music playing in the restaurant, so we could not hear any other sound. We ruled out any type of conventional aircraft, and as I work for an aviation company, I could only imagine helicopter(s) could create this illumination.But why anyone would want to create a bright unexplained orange light, near a tourist resort, that the Cuban staff could not explain, within Cuban airspace, is beyond me. Our unanimous decision that evening is that we literally witnessed a UFO. Coincidentally, the next morning my neice heard on TV that a UFO, picked up on radar, had been reported in the Jacarta region of Indonesia.Even more coincidentally, this seemed exactlty one week to the day when the major earthquake hit SE Asia just off Indonesia&apos;s coast.

It was able to stop dead in its tracks and reverse course in a split second. This I decided was not the actions of a satelite and I must be tracking either future technologies or a UFO.It appeared as a satelite would to the eye. On the second sighting I called to my friend who saw the light too. It again sped off with speed. The UFO returned once more but then I didn&apos;t see it after that.

It was extremely bright, like a star or a planet.

This object that I saw on the 18th was due east and roughly 30 degrees above the horizon It appeared to be slightly moving, although now I can&apos;t recall the exact direction. It&apos;s motion was unspectacular. It travelled neither far, nor fast and it&apos;s movement wasn&apos;t particularly perceptible. The strange thing is that it looked like a very bright star/planet, and I&apos;ve never seen a star that bright in that location before, and to the best of my knowledge there shouldn&apos;t be one at that location. After staring at it for about 30 seconds it just went dim and disappeared. Now it is true that the sun was beginning to rise, but it had not come up over the horizon. Also there were plenty of other stars in various locations relative to the object in question that were still visible, and their brightness only seemed to dim gradually as I continued to look outside. They&apos;ve never just went dead as if someone pulled the plug. There were stars both above and below the object/celestial body when it stopped shining.

Within a minute or two, it disappeared behind (below) the island&apos;s northern horizon of trees and houses (estimating) approximately 0.5 to 1 mile distant.

Just prior to begining our descent, I noticed 3 lights at our 11 to 12 o&apos;clock postion. There was an overcast layer of clouds way down below topping at 8000 feet and crisp clear moonless sky above. The lights caught my attention because they were moving unlike those of commercial aircraft. I immediately assumed they were military and thought they might be flying in the area of Buckeye MOA. I was on with Indy center and asked them if Buckeye was hot and they said that no aircraft were in there tonight. I continued to watch the lights and their movements as we descended. I checked on with the next Indy &quot;low&quot; sector and asked this new controller if Buckeye was hot and &quot;No&quot; was again the answer. I then began to describe to the controller the lights that we were seeing and their movements and direction from our postion. Another airline pilot on the frequency backed up my description. The lights would periodically move vertically very rapidly down then back up to a hover. The lights would line up at an equal distance apart in this hover parallel to the horizon. The strangest thing that I saw was that all three lights then moved horizontally a small distance in unison. I thought that maybe I was staring too long and it was my eyes causing the movement that most people will experience when they stare at a star for instance. The star might appear to move or drift if stared at too long. So, I looked away at the fixed cloud deck below but kept the lights in my poriferal vision. They still moved. I tested my vision again looking repeatedly away in different directions and confirmed that they were all moving together in unison. Then occasionally one light would be brighter than the others and then fade. At one point they all disappeared for a couple of minutes and then all reappeared together. There were also times when only one or two lights were visible at one time as well. They were not commercial aircraft and not military aircraft in formation as I know what they look like. Also, at 150nm from cvg, it looked as though the lights were in the vicintiy of cvg but as we got closer to our destination, we could see that they were much further away in the distance and so I could not even guess on their range. Again, the most striking characteristics were the movements in unison and the high velocity they appeared to have whether it was vertical or horizontal.

We were actually riding on the public golf course (knowing we were not suppose to! We were about 10-11 yrs old) and ther was a back way out of the golf course. So after driving over a couple greens and tee boxes we deside to go the back way out that leads to a gravel road about 3/4 of a mile from the GC. We head out and down through this trail that at first is thick trees and then becomes an open plowed feild. We ran through this trail many times before. Well, just at the end of the trail, the tree line stops and the open feild begins and there is a jump or a dirt mound that we always liked to jump. We get up some speed and ramp this dirt mound and become airbourne! As soon as we land and look ahead my bud slamms the breaks and we both say at the same time &quot;What the hell is that!&quot;  The craft was about 50yrds in front of us and hoovering about 30 to 40 feet or treetop high. It seemed to be moving very slowly to the east away from us. (It has been 20 yrs but I still remember it well) I knew immediatly what it was and I told my bud to turn around and get the hell out of here, but he wanted to observe it for a minute and I said &quot;that is a UFO and the dam thing will take us up if we don&apos;t go&quot; and that scared him, so we tured around and boogied off back through the golf course. Nobody was playing golf that day cause it was wet and cold. Although, that day was very clear and the sun was just starting to set. The UFO looked like it had  a welding ark multiplied by 100 on the top and all colored lights like a rainbow dimmer than the top &quot;ark&quot; brightness. How I could tell it was round was because in the middle of it, this row of approx. 2&apos; tall by 1&apos; wide squares of orange lights would start at a point at us and go around to the otherside of the craft and then end up back at us, but moving constantly. I could hear a faint hum over the 3-wheeler at idle. It sounded like what a guardlight sounds like in your back yard.

I was only 11 yrs old, but my mom had seen somthing a few years before and started researching the UFO thing and talking to people in the area that had seen things like UFO&apos;s. I was, and still am, up to date on all the latest Technology as far as Public &quot;need to know&quot; goes. I have 2 brothers, 1 in the USAF serving in Both gulf wars and knows a lot of stuff about a lot of things along these lines, and another that was in for 4 yrs and got out. I have worked at a top secret Gov. facility but I won&apos;t go into detail on that. I know this UFO was definitly a UFO. In a rual town near a rual road in a wheat feild looking like that!! I&apos;ve been waitng for somthing to look like it for 20 yrs but I have not.  There had been a lot of strange sightings around that area in the early 80&apos;s. If someone can explain what it was please do so. I&apos;m not sure if it took us up, but I&apos;m sure curious! I have a diviated septum if it means anything. My bud became one of my enemies later in life over a girl, so I don&apos;t know if I could talk to him about it, but I think we could.

The local news is not very helpfull and are just as confused as myself. I have herd and seen these befor in california with the excepion of the strange lights, and sounds. To me the fighter jets sounded more like they were chasing something, not just practice. I have herd a report of an Air Raid siren going off in NC just befor the sonic blast. This come from someone in Surfside beach who was on the phone with a friend in NC at the time and herd it all. I have also watched a report on the news and one persons experiance was close to ours and she discribed the lights as flairs. Well I live around the military long enough this was not normal.

It was New Years day and I had heard a few fireworks earlier that evening, but considering the date everything was quiet.  The sky was mostly cloudy, but with areas where stars could be seen clearly.  I was walking down the street in an Easterly direction looking up at the stars when I saw a white light traverse the sky, approximately  from south to north.  There was no object visible just light, illuminating the cloud cover from behind.  The light moved very fast, in a straight line across the sky in about one second.  If I had not been looking up I would never have seen it.  At first I thought it might have been from a search-light, like auto dealers sometimes use, but the movement was too fast crossing, the sky in one direction only and with no visible beam projected from the ground. I continued watching the area, and within less than a minute the light appeared again, from the same approximate point in the South following a streight course to the North.  Again I continued to watch, ane within less than a minute I saw the light again a third time, on the same course and speed.  I watched a little longer, but didn&apos;t see anything more so I continued my dog walking.  As I apprached the end of the street, at a slightly different heading, I looked back again at the sky and saw a forth light, traveling the same path as the other three. I then returned home. As I stated, there was no visible object with any of these four light sources.  Rather the light appeared to be projected from behind the clouds onto the surface.  The lights appeared rectangular, with rounded corners, dimensionally the length appeared to be about three times the width, although this could have been an illusion caused by the speed the lights moved.  Ther was no sound associated with this incident what so ever.", "On Aug. 10, 1982, this house size saucer flew close to our car, the occupant  waved, and it flew off.My wife, children and I were driving home from a friend&apos;s house, westbound on Feather River Boulevard in the &quot;linda&quot; section of Marysville, cruising about 25-30 MPH when a rapid, strobelike flashing began to reflect off of the tall trees on either side of the road.  The flashing appeared similar to the effect one would see if lighting a white flasher firework on the 4th of July, except that this light just kept flashing brighter and brighter.  We were amazed at how much of the boulevard this was lighting up, and we looked back to see the light that seemed to be coming from behind and above us.  I slowed down to stick my head out of the window opening and look.  What my family and I saw was startling, unbelievable, but undeniable....there it was.  I thought I was going to have to slap myself.  This round, disc-like object, I thought, was something that came maybe from a movie prop?  People weren&apos;t supposed to see this for real,  just in the movies, right?  The very closest description I could give you for this craft is that it was able to hover, it was approx. house-size equivalent, it had a large bay-type, bluish-tinted window with what appeared to be 2 beings standing behind it, looking out towards our direction.  These beings may or may not have been people, but if they weren&apos;t, they were at least darn close.  They wore some sort of dark, wrinkly iniforms I think.  The one on the left I took for a male, and he waved briefly.  The device that was emitting the strobe-light like activity appeared to be a rotating ring of lights on the underside of this craft that were in a mini-structure that was only slightly lower than the ships bottom, or belly, and was round.  I swear I have never written anyone about this before, but you could get a great idea of what this craft looked like if you view one of the old lost in space rerun episodes featuring the jupiter 2, except that some of the edges were only slightly more rounded.  The craft continued its descent, approaching a distance of close to 75-80 feet from us.  At this piont I panicked and floored the gas pedal.  The 383 magnum v-8  in that old plymouth we were riding in reacted by pushing us into our seats and accelerating the car to speeds which didn&apos;t occur to me at the time weren&apos;t road-safe. Now I&apos;m sure the ship could have caught us, but instead abruptly veered off to the right and sped off into the distance.  It seemed to be completely out of sight in an instant. It made no sound as it traveled. Later, we were informed by our local sheriffs dept. that there were more than 300 calls placed about the object at that same time.  A representative told me that our local air force base had been called and had been informed that the air force base had no craft flying in the area at the time.  I was highly skeptical of reported ufo sightings before this took place.", "hi, we let off fireworks to see in the new year, as the last one was finishing we noticed three circles of light in a tri-angular formation,travelling east to west, i have no idea of their altitude, but they were travelling slowly, we managed to capture them on a mobile phones video-cam. i have posted this on a couple of uk sites, as i cannot believe we were the only ones to see this, because of how long they were visible to us, their may have been another sighting in margate,kent.this is the first ufo encounter i have had, please let me know if anyone else has seen similar lights, or is it a hoax if so it was an amazing one.when i get movie off of phone i will forward it to you.((name deleted))", "Silver oval sitting still in skyOne Silver oval object seen sitting still with white smoke on one side,very high in the sky.

I noticed one in particular. It moved sporadically, slightly left/right and up/down. I got a pair of binoculars. The light was too far away, probably over Cahutta or Dalton, GA which is SW of my property. I woke up my husband who probably said it was a plane, since we have a busy flight path overhead. Since I had been watching it for over 10 minutes, with no evident travel distance, I insisted he look through the binoculars. No daylight yet, so sky was black. No noise and no discernable shape of unit itself. There appeared to be blue, green and white lights most visible on the lower left side. Through the binoculars, the stars were still just white dots, this object was glared and looked like a cross shape. At one point it appeared to be lighting an area underneath it. Twice, from a considerable distance to the North and to the South of it, there appeared to be shooting stars. But they were shooting upward instaed of down. Tonight my husband informs me the news said we are having meteor showers after 11:00 pm. So did I see a prelude?", "the object looked like a star and appeared to get brighter at times as it moved up and down across the nights skyAt first I thought it was a star, that&apos;s what it looked like.  Then, I noticed it move.  There was an irregular pattern to its movement, sort of up and down in a zig-zag motion at times and at the same time, for the hour to hour and twenty minutes I watched it, continually moving from left to right across the sky.  My best guess is that this was somewhere over Constant Friendship or Bel Air.  I was thoroughly intrigued by this light,  I knew it was not an airplane or helicopter.  I live in Havre de Grace and everyone in Harford County is familiar with Aberdeen Proving Ground, and we are even more familiar with their aircraft and flight plans.  Also in the time I observed this I counted about 4-5 planes go by in that direction.   I could assume these were planes passing because they all had the flashing red or red and green lights, as well as, they seemed to maintain a constant rate of speed.  Whereas, this object I saw moved at a snails pace or just seemed to stop right where it was at times.  Unfortunately, I have a small forest out back and this object fell out of my sight through these trees.  I would have liked to have seen it dart off at some amazing rate of speed, that would have confirmed it for me, and likened my story to those I have seen on television.  However, all I have is a &quot;dancing star&quot; moving very slowly across the night&apos;s horizon.", "3-4 crazy star-like objects moving at very high speeds and direction change. defies convention.

This memorial is a man-made island, located in the heart of the city, to the west of the washington monument-- which you can see in the reflection of the pond surrounding the memorial.  All of us were smoking cigarettes and looking up at the stars, which were fairly prevelant this night, though there was some cloud coverage.  One friend spotted what seemed to be a star, moving about at an insane speed, in no one particular direction or course. Two to three more objects that also looked like stars appeared in the sky with the first object.  The objects now, which were a light white, close to the color of any random star, looked like they were playing almost, looping around one another, and changing direction and speed in ways  we believed to be completely impossible for any craft of our knowledge.  The objects would hover and accelerate and take up so much distace in the sky in an instant.  These objects also moved backwards, and there was certainly no turing radius either, they stopped on a dime, and flew backwards and loopty looped and the crafts chased one another in these formations and in a figure eight sort of design. They then dissapeared behind very high clouds. All the objects were fairly dim, and very far away, and it would have been extremely hard to catch this event if you weren&apos;t directly watching the sky, as we were.

I called it while I was actually viewing the craft. I sent them a follow-up letter two years later only to get no response. Therefore, I had very specific details that have probably been lost be the organization. The unique thing about my sighting is it happened two days in a row. The first evening, at approximately 1600 in the afternoon, I was standing in a yard with six other witnesses, one an extreme skeptic. The cloud cover was extremely low that day; a nearby landmark on a hill (Mount Helix, La Mesa) nearly touched the cloud cover. A red, ovular intense red object dropped from beneath the thick cloud cover. It remained perfectly straight for several minutes. It moved erratically at a few points (briefly), and twice traversed several thousand feet in a millisecond. The well educated skeptic on hand admitted, &quot;I have to say it is very strange. It&apos;s not a star or an aircraft. I don&apos;t know what in the world it could be.&quot; It was clearly some sort of craft. It made no sound and left no trail when it jolted about several times. It did give a tiny bit of reflection of red off of the nearby cloud cover. Finally, it shot straight upward and vanished. The next evening approximately five miles from the first sighting, I noticed the object again. This time I was with a total of four people. Everyone was sober; no one had been drinking or anything like that. The night sky was crystal clear. There was minimal lighting interference from the town and it was easy to see great expanses of the sky. The red object moved very slowly and steadily in a straight line. This time, it appeared to be many miles up in the sky. We observed the craft for so long that we went onto the roof to observe, and even had time to call the local UFO hotline. After the phone call, I came back outside. The object suddenly shot off to the left, covering many miles in just the blink of an eye. The dogs in the neighborhood were uncharacteristically loud and barked incessantly. I knew the neighborhood well and this was not typical behavior. Moments after changing location, there was a small white, oval shaped flash and it completely vanished from the night time sky. I had a clear view of hundreds of miles of crystal clear night time sky and it literally disappeared in the flash of an eye.  The first time the object was located south of Mount Helix San Diego (summit)at approximately &quot;324601N 1165857W 1373 El Cajon&quot; I was facing southeast toward the said object location from a distance of about two - three miles. Second sighting: I was standing on Live Oak Drive in La Mesa california looking toward Mount Helix.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Red glowing object seen in Southern California sky by multiple witnesses...Sorry about the multiple submissions.

They appeared to be illuminated by the rising sun, as they were the same color as the clouds around them. My glance drifted away for a while, but then I looked back out of curiosity. The lines had seemed to had joined into one bright line in the eastern sky. I watched the line for as long as I could. It stayed level, then leaned slightly. At this point, I arrived at school and had to stop watching.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Student report. PD))", "Growing-up with aliensThe sighting that I am about to report took place many years ago when I was 16, the date was Christmas Eve 1970. My grandparents owned a very large and remote cattle ranch and our family had enjoyed a wonderful evening togather and all had long since retired for the evening. I was awakened out of a dead sleep for some reason. I had fallen asleep in the living room on the couch with a huge picture window directly behind me. It was a winter wonderland outside with nearly three feet of snow and a thin cloud bank that was draped over Pikes Peak off in the distance and magically lighted by a full moon. Feeling totally awake, I turned around to really take in this enchanting scene. Then, I saw something that I couldn&apos;t believe, a tiny cloud moved away from the moon and fully lighted the valley where our ranch house was nestled. Not more than four football fields out from the house I noticed a big black shadow being cast down onto our meadow. What made me take notice was that the shadow had perfectly straight lines on the snow. I then realized that this cloud which I couldn&apos;t see due to our overhanging porch had straight edges. Impossible, I thought! so, at 2:30 in the morning and 20 below zero, I step outside on the porch in my longjohns and gazed up. what I saw, I&apos;ll never forget, a massive black rectangle shaped object just floating over our meadow! I ran back into the house, jumped into my coat and snow boots and took off running across the meadow toward the craft. Within a matter of four minutes, I was standing directly under it and realized it was less than 300 hundred feet above me. This craft was silent and it had no lights or windows that I could see. It must have been 1500 feet long and 400-500 feet tall and 300 feet thick. I stood under that thing for as long as i could stand the cold. It did nothing. So, I finally just went back.What was very strange about this was that the entire time I was looking at it I &quot;felt&quot; safe and somehow knew that &quot;They&quot; were mining for minerals. As I was growing up on the ranch there was an area on the ranch that you could not go to. Horses would refuse to go into this area and if I forced the issue they would go crazy and start bucking. I never could walk into that range of small mountains. If I did a very strange overpowering fear would sweep over me until I turned around and crossed that invisable boundry and instantly it would go away.I learned from the  horses where the boundry line was and it never changed. For all I know it&apos;s still in place. I had numerous encounters with beings and craft on the ranch growing up. The most beautiful craft of all that I saw twice, was a golden teardrop shape. Always, coming or leaving this area that was around 3000 acres. It was common knowledge on the ranch about that location. It was a family joke that we always knew where the cattle and the horses weren&apos;t. When I was a kid I would take friends to the borderline and we would run into the area in an attempt to try and tease the aliens. I found out in short order that they weren&apos;t amused. Because, I began having terrible nightmares. I knew it was them so I went back to the boundry line and shouted to them that I was sorry and I wouldn&apos;t bother them again. That night the nightmares ended and so did my trips to the area.You might say I&apos;ve grown-up with aliens. I&apos;ve seen them. Some look like us, others, the old wise ones are on average 7 feet tall with elongated skulls with blue translucent bodies. They are trillions of years older than we are and are very gental and loving. I have had two of them appear before me from time to time to check-in on me. They watched me grow-up as an only child on our huge very isolated ranch and I always could feel them protecting me when I was alone in the forest. They love us and consider us their children. They have come back now to help us through what is coming. They will soon introduce themselves to the world. That is why you are seeing so many ships. The blue beings don&apos;t need spacecraft, they are far more advanced. They travel by thought.They have showed me what is coming. A global nuclear war that will distroy nearly all of America, Europe, Russia and China. There is an alien faction that is running the New World Order. But, they&apos;re no match for the &quot;Blue Beings&quot;. They aren&apos;t here to stop it. They are here to pick-up the broken pieces and help us start to rebuild once again. The new center of growth and knowledge will be Venezuela. During the war that entire country will be covered by a protective dome of energy. If you want a good time-line watch very carefully what happens between Venezuela and the NWO. More and more there&apos;s going to be agression aimed at Venezuela by Bush and the NWO. Everyone will think it&apos;s for the oil. Not so, it&apos;s about &quot;The City&quot; There&apos;s a massive underground city built by a confederation of aliens hidden in the southern jungle of Venezuela preparing to re-build mankind. Tesla,Marconi and Fulcanille were involved. I have met personally, two high ranking Venezuelan officers who interface with &quot;the City&quot;. The NWO knows full well about this city but, are powerless to do anything about it. My entire life has been about what I&apos;ve just related starting with my first trip deep into the Venezuelan jungles in 1989 exploring for gold and diamonds. That is when I first learned of the city and was once again visited by the two &quot;Blue Beings&quot; who showed me what is coming. There is much more to this story, I&apos;ve just hit the highlights.I can only state that what I was shown in 1989, appears to be falling in line with what is now taking place. The NWO is looking for something, something that would give them power and control over the &quot;Blue Beings&quot;, what they&apos;re looking for is hidden in the jungle.

I saw at about 1030 pm est a yellow cloud with a very bright white light in the center of it travelling at about the speed of ISS or just a little faster heading ESE and making about a 15 degree tilt to the South.

It was a summer night and hot down here in Brownsville, Texas around 9:30pm. Well we all had finished eating and were sitting around having a nice conversation when my friends girlfriend yells out, &quot;Hey, look, a shooting star&quot;. Everyone looked up to see what looked like a regular really bright star. This supposed star was traveling at a constant slow speed, in what looked to be an East to West direction. We all started talking about it and debating whether it was a falling star because it had no burn trail whatsoever. Still staring at this object, we all pretty much concluded that it must be a satellite because of the constant slow speed, perfectly straight flight path and never burnt out like a falling star usually does. A couple of friends got bored of seeing this object and looked down at each other to continue talking, while the rest and myself stayed staring at this thing. In one split fraction of a second this object Zoomed the opposite (180 deg.) direction from what now was a West to East direction at enormous length of space in just, like I said, A split second. We all were in awe. The ones that stayed staring including myself let out this &quot;Whoa&quot; sound grabbing the attention of the other friends that had turned away. Suddenly this &quot;star looking&quot; obect started making these incredibly, incredibly fast zig-ziag maneuvers. At this point, all ten witnesses were now watching. We all looked at each in amazement. I can not emphasize on how fast this object was. I&apos;m talk about 90 degree turns, among other angles, zig-zags and zooming the opposite directions in a fraction of a second then haulting at such abrupt stop. I still get excited right now just typing this out. It was such an amazing experience. Then all of a sudden this, now through our eyes we had labeled it a UFO, shot straight up towards space and disappeared. There is NO WAY! on earth a human can withstand such sonic speeds then coming to such abrupt stops...NO WAY! Just as soon as this UFO disappeared, it reaappeared at a different location of the sky. It started flying the different zig-zag patterns again, then shot back up then reappear. It continued this pattern for the length of which was fifteen minutes. You know, it was weird, but it was as if it knew that we were watching and was taunting us. It then shot again straight up toward space and never reappeared again. The best part of this entire experience is that we are very good friends and we all saw the UFO and there is no denying it. Oh.....one more thing. Two of my friends out of the group of ten that witnessed this UFO had the same experience a year before at another friend&apos;s outdoor wedding reception. The only thing that I regret was that were weren&apos;t prepared with a camera or video camera.

That&apos;s not the sort of thing that I usually accept as a possibility, but about a month before this, I spotted something odd in the sky as well and so did a few others, but it was too high up to be sure exactly what it was. My wife went outside to smoke a cigarette and the neighbor was heading back over to her apartment when I heard them both call for me to come see something. They sounded like it was urgent, so I grabbed up my son out of his playpen and headed outside to see what was up. They pointed up to the sky and there were bluish, rather dim lights that almost looked like stars, but they were moving in a mostly straight pattern across the sky. They were going reasonably fast, but not any faster than an airplane might fly. But then, we looked around longer and realized that there were more of them, and not all of them were flying the same direction. Some where going straight and some were curving around. Others flew by that had reddish or amber lights instead. Now I&apos;ve seen lots of planes, but these did not fly like planes or helicopters, or any type of aircraft that I&apos;ve ever laid eyes on. Not to mention, some of the lower flying ones appeared to have more than one light, and they tended to be in a diamond/triangular type shape. My neighbor, wife and I all stood there awestruck for minutes pointing out to each other when another one would fly into view. This was all truely amazing, but there was more to come. All of the sudden, we saw one  fly across MUCH lower than all of the others and it flew quite slowly (slow enough that an airplane would have stalled out), where we had a plain view of the shape and lighting of it. It&apos;s very hard to explain and I wish I had remembered to grab my camera, but I was in shock and could not think straight until it had already passed out of sight. The lights were mostly blue and in a diamond shape with 5 lights, although some of the lights alternated between red, blue and green. The rear of the object was a little longer than the rest of it. There were no corners or points anywhere on the object...it was completely smooth and rounded, yet it still had a diamond type shape. It was no more than 500 ft in the air above us, and when it went right over, I could vaguely see a disc type shape on the bottom, and some sort of strange markings that were illuminated slightly by the lights, but it was hard to make out and really unlike anything I&apos;ve seen. It was also nearly completely silent. I couldn&apos;t really hear it at all, but my wife said she heard a slight humming noise. It was obvious that it was not a helicopted or plane, because I&apos;ve heard them both fly over at that altitude, and they made LOTS of noise. This made almost none. I had to take the baby in, since it was getting really windy not long after this, but apparently my wife spotted two more diamond shaped UFO&apos;s a few minutes later. I had my wife come in a watch the baby so I could look at the sky some more and I noticed several other lights...flashing this time in the sky. Those were obviously airplanes (about 5 of them).

They were driving south on Rt.126 in Bellingham, MA, ten minutes from the dancehall. They stopped at at T-intersection stop sign. No other cars were on the rural road nor people on the street at the time. My girlfriend was the passenger, so was able to get a better observation. She is a quite sane, college-educated professional person. As they stopped at the T-intersection (to take a right turn on the two lane road) she saw a perfectly circular white light (which she said looked just like a full moon) come from the right, traveling along the road at a height of just three or four feet (eye level with the hood of the small car). There was a church directly in front of the stop sign on the other side of the road. The object came directly in front of the car, traveling horizontally, no more than 100ft in front, then went straight up and over the church, where they lost sight of it. She estimated the object was only about six feet in diameter. She said it was the size of dinner plate held at arms length. It made no sound. There were no flashing lights or changes in color from the original yellow-white. She also described it as one of the glow-in-the-dark frisbees turned on its side. It travelled fast, but not at blinding speed. She said it move purposely. It did not stop in front of their car but kept moving. She did not know if it went up into the sky or just hopped over the church to the other side.  The driver made her right turn on to the cross road, the direction the object had come from. She said it travelled along the road from the right to the left, in front of the car, before going straight up over the church.  They thought about going back to see if they could see it again but decided not to. The car was traveling south from Milford into Bellingham, then took the right, going west on to the cross road.

Both dispachers told me that no one else had called about a UFO (I doubt they would have told me otherwise, anyway). So, next, I called News Channel 10, WJAR, Providence. I spoke to news person, a young man, about what my girlfriend saw. He said, oh yeah, we had a few other reports from last night in that same area at about the same time. He went on to say that the previous night the same small circle of light had been seen in another town in Massachusetts, named Billerica.  When nothing appeared on the news on Channel 10 that night I called back the next day to WJAR and asked why nothing was reported. A young woman said she didn&apos;t know, but maybe the editor, &quot;Tim&quot; could tell me. She went to look for Tim but said he was not available and I&apos;d have to call back. I had the feeling he didn&apos;t want to discuss it or the reasons it was not &quot;newsworthy.&quot;  Also, my girlfriend, upon further reflection of that night, said the object could well have been smaller than the six feet in diameter she originally thought it might be, but in no way any larger.  So, other witnesses called in to the news station of that same sighting and one for the previous night, but of course, nothing on the news.((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of the report, and congratulate him for his willingness to follow up on a report.  PD))", "At 12:15AM a large extremely bright object in the northern sky was slowly moving south.  As it moved closer, its size appeared even greater than at first sight.  It appeared to shift direction and began to slowly move east.  I could not believe the size of this light.  It was like nothing I had ever seen in the sky before.  After watching for maybe 20 seconds, the light vanished completely and I noticed an airplane flying in from the east.  Coincidence?  I don&apos;t know. Strange? Definitely.", "My girlfriend and i were laying outside under the stars, when a formation of lights appeared out of nowhere high above us. the lights traveled in a straight direction very quickly for around 13 seconds when the head of the formation suddenly changed its direction heading further away from the others in the formation and all other lights quickly followed, they then travelled independent of formation very quickly until they all faded into nothing.", "Bright light, moving faster than the planes close by!!!I first saw two airplanes, one to the north traveling to the west, prop engine noise was why I looked up, the other was a jet, also noise, traveling from the north to the south, while I was looking up, I observed a bright,white, light, just appear overhead, no details, just bright.  It was traveling faster than either of the planes from east to west, it disappeared as fast as it had appeared.  While looking up, trying to determine if this was another plane, it reappeared sightly to the north of the last location I had seen it in and was now traveling south to north, again, it was only visible for about 10 seconds.  While looking, I observed several high attitude jets (vapor trails), with the sun shining on them, but they were not as bright as this light.  And none were in the area I had observed the light.I am a retired Police Detective and now a Director of Training.  Would really love to know what that was?", "I have never seen anything that could move that quick and make a 90 degree turn, then  go backwards!!It was monday night football, 4th quarter, like a min to go, so I went outside to smoke a ciggarette.  I have to smoke outside since my wife is 7 months pregnant.  She was in the bedroom waiting for me to come to bed.  So as usual, I went out to my back yard to have a smoke.  I always look up at the stars, just an old habit I quess, from when I was younger looking for shooting stars.  Anyway, I noticed a bird like shape gliding north, swaying a little left, swaying a little right, just like a bird.  I was surprised I was able to see it, but with clear skys and a bright moon, I figured the bird was white and it was just a reflection from the moon.  Well, thats when i relized that it passed above a high altitude cload.  It took my brain a second to realize that there was no way i would be able to see a bird that high in the sky at night.  So i wacthed with more attention.  Thats when the object changed speed and moved in the same direction at a much highher speed.  I basically was thinking a plane since I live about 15 miles from MIA, and thats when the object made a left turn (west) 90 degree turn, at a speed that is not possible, at least in my head.  I was very confused.  I was looking right at it, it must of been way up there, and it seemed to have light, not blinking, but going from dim to brighter and back in a slow duration.  And then it went backwards just as quick, made another turn, and continued north up the coast till i could not see it anymore.  I could not believe the way it was moving slow, then would move so fast, then slow again, then the high speed 90 degree turn.  Anyway, I have never claimed to see a UFO before. I have always looked up, seen high altitutde planes, satilittes, and other things, but nothing that could move and change direction like that.  I just could not come up with any other answer.  I came in side, told my wife, and went to sleep with one eye open, scared for the first time as an adult.  I am 32, professional.", "Oval shaped object performs remarkable aerial feats over Hastings, MNI am a FI trainee with MUFON reporting here a sighting my sister had on the evening of January 28th of this year. My sister was driving south on Highway 61 in Hastings, MN en route to Winona when she spotted a bright, oval shaped white light southeast of her position.  There were scattered clouds and the moon was fully visible.  This object appeared at approximately the 3-4 o&apos;clock position relative to the moon and my sister assumed that it was the light of an oncoming plane that she was seeing until it began to perfom some very remarkable movements.  From its stationary position it rapidly decended vertically to near the horizon level and hovered.  It seemed either to be wobbling or to be flashing lights, the clouds made it difficult to tell.  The object then reversed direction to head directly upwards approximately 1/3 the distance it had initially decended then stopped again.  After a second or two the object shot off with incredible speed to the northeast before disappearing. She had managed to reach me by cell phone during the sighting and was obviously excited and seemed certain that she had seen no ordinary aircraft.  Unfortunately the object left the area before she was able to take pictures.  Also of note is the fact that she saw a vehicle pulled over to the side of the road with a man and his child watching the object through binoculars. I plan to contact the local FAA to see if I can get any more information.", "Bright pinkish orange oval radiating light at 19:35 close to the horizon and about 15-29 degrees east of due north.A oval star-like very bright &quot;thing&quot; quite close to the horizon.  It was similar to the pinkish orange of Mars and much larger even at Mars closest point.  It radiated a kind of glow.  I watched it for about 4 or so minutes and it never moved (I had it between 2 wires for placement).  All of a sudden it went up like the opposite of a shooting star! Now this was a very clear night. I could see tons of stars and planes (there was a lot of air traffic).  I am very familiar with the flight path as I am out back every night I am in town.  This object was low to the ground and about 15 -20 degrees east of due north.", "Saucer With White Bright LightI was standing outside in the morning drinking coffee when suddenly at disc shaped object zoomed at incredible supersonic speeds past my house.

It had a white light on the back flashing very bright also.((NUFORC Note:  No other reports submitted from other witnesses, to the best of our knowledge.  May not be not a serious-minded report.

At first, I did not notice it until my dog started barking towards Black Mesa. I tried to tell get him to stop barking, but he would not. So I looked towards where he was barking and he was barking at a light that was top of Black Mesa. It seemed like it was nothing and then all the dogs in the area starting barking too. So I kept watching the light along with the dogs. Then my dad came out of the house to see why the dogs were barking. So I told him they where barking at the light over Black Mesa. It was shaped like a oval, light. The color of the light was white in the center, and around it was two other colors yellow and lite blue. The colors seemed to virbate bright and then dimed back and forth. It was floating on top of Black Mesa very slowly for about 15 to 20 minutes. It started from the east side of the mesa, going west. I did not see were it went, but it was gone. Then I just went back inside with my dad.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It sure looks like a UFO.", "Vee shaped red/orange lights moving east to west over Sacramento.Approx 6 very faded red/orange rectangular lights in a vee formation.  Based on the disappearing background of stars, the object gave the appearance of a vee.  Based on my point of view, the object was very large.  I could not judge the altitude but had the impression it was not as high as a jet in the normal departure altitude (from Sac Intl. The lights were solid but very dim.  There was no sound.  I waited 30 seconds for a jet sound. I just finished viewing the comet and turned to the south and caught a fast movement of an object moving from west to east.  As I looked in a direction of approx SE the object was visible for approx 3 seconds before it vanished in the east. I am use to seeing jets and hearing them a few seconds later.  To the north, approx 40 degrees was an airplane displaying appropriate lights traveleing to the north.   Earlier I saw a satelite moveing north to south.

I couldnot see anything else even against the dark background except for this red blinking light. It made absolutely no sound. I called my wife and 6yr old daughter who both saw this for about 1 minute when it went out of sight. We have been living in this place for nearly 25yrs and know each aeroplane that fly over our house by heart. Moreover this made no sound eventhough it was flying at a good speed (definitely more than any average plane). It covered the entire area from East to West in just around a minute and made no sound even at that speed.

We were lying in front of my house in the road. Our neighbor is very quiet at night and gets hardly any traffic and is very dark. Great for stargazing. It was anywhere between 11:00 PM and 1:00 AM. Not sure on exactly the date and year. I believe I was around 16 or 17 when this occurred. My brother is three years younger than me. Our friend about the same or two years younger than me. I am 42 now. We were all three lying down on our backs and just talking about things in general and looking up a the stars in the sky. The sky was completely clear with no clouds at all. And the sky crisp and dark enough the faint hint of the Milky Way &apos;clouds&apos; as I call them. No planes were in the vicintiy. Suddenly straight up above us in the sky one of the &apos;stars&apos; started to move in a slow spiral pattern that gradually got wider. It then suddenly began to zig zag very quickly back and forth in long paths. After doing the zig zag pattern 3 or 4 times it zoomed off and disappeared. We all immediately looked at one another and said. &apos;Did you see that?&apos; We all confirmed that we did. The object was about the size and brightness of a medium white star. It was large enough to see fine.  The object blended in totally with the other stars in the night sky. It looked just like another star in the sky until it started to do the movements I describe above. There was no sound.The three of us still talk about that night and what we saw whenever we get together.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

PD))", "It was late and I decided to go upstairs to bed while my husband stayed downstairs to watch tv. My children were all in bed upstairs in their bedrooms. In our bedroom our bed faced a north window. I got in bed and saw that I must have left a light on as there was a reflection in the window. I couldn&apos;t figure out where the light was coming from so I got up to go to the window to see where to locate the light. That was when I discovered the light was in the sky not a reflection of some light in the house. So I watched it. For just a second it was a cluster of lights and then they all spread out into a circle like a ferris wheel. That is what I thought it was, a ferris wheel. If I had stopped to think I would have known there couldn&apos;t have been a ferris wheel up that high or that big but I wasn&apos;t thinking like that. I was just fascinated with the lights. There was an open field outside the north window I was looking out of and beyond that were tall pines and houses. As I stood there and watched the lights went out and then came on again and it had moved. The lights now rather than seeming to be rounded were inverted and had a bluish tint to them. Now it didn&apos;t seem so much like a ferrish wheel but just big lights in a circle like a ferris wheel. Then the lights went out again and it moved to the left again. It didn&apos;t roll or anything like that, the lights just dissappeared and then it appeared again. It moved like this until it was out of my sight because of the trees further away from me. I didn&apos;t even think of it as a ufo untill the next morning when I was telling my daughter about it. She was 20 at that time. I never heard any other reports of anyone seeing what I saw. Although if you were standing on the ground you might not have noticed since the lights were facing out instead of down.  I was upstairs which gave me some advantage and there was a big farming field next to the window I was looking out of. I do not believe this object came from outer space I think it was something the government was working on. Before the lights ever went out the object was normal and after it went out and then came back on it seemed to me it was like an imprint a computer would leave behind or something like that. It wasn&apos;t the same as it was in the beginning. I sure wish someone could tell me what it was that I saw or if anyone else has ever seen anything like this before. I wished I had called my husband to watch, but I just didn&apos;t realize what I was seeing at the time!", "6 lights flying VERY fast((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The path it took was not straight, but wavered, and then disappeared belowed the treeline. It looked to be traveling straight down, but if it was traveling straight out, would have been traveling at a very fast rate. There was no trail of light behind it, as a shooting star would have.I expected to see a flash of impact, but there was none. I pulled off the road at a clear cut to see if there was anymore activity, but there was none.  I have seen numerous shooting stars, fireballs, comets, satelites ,the re-entry of space juck and other aerial displays, but this fit none of them.

Both times it has been a single light moving across the sky. What made this one different is that a friend of mine saw this one with me. This one seemed to make a direct dive to the earth after we first saw it move into our view. Before reaching the tree line it &quot;turned off&quot; (for lack of better words) We discussed this for at least 45 minutes, concluding that it was maybe 100 yards away, give or take, and that it didn&apos;t look like any meteor we&apos;d ever seen. It had a white center, and a blueish glow around it. As it passed clouds, it did light them. As a side note, the one I saw on my own was in the same area, and had a similar appearance, but looked much closer, seemed to move horizontally, and went behind the trees instead of dissappearing. I really would hope that someone can either explain this light, or has also seen it.", "Hi again Mr. Davenport:  I wanted to let you know that I spoke to my brother in law, who is a ((deleted)) captain on ((deleted)).  He works at night, and after I saw the fiery object in the sky last night, I called him to ask him if he might have seen anything himself, on his boat that goes between ((deleted)) Seattle (south of where I was walking), Vashon Island and Southworth on the Olympic Peninsula near Bremerton.((deleted/brother)) said a couple of members of his crew saw two events, just after their shift started about 21:00, and one the night before as well on his shift. He said that a crewman probably saw the event I saw, which he said was somewhere up near my house located somewhat north of the ferry dock.((deleted/brother)) said that there were in fact some clouds out of which these shooting stars seemingly came, and he said that they went quite low through the cloud cover and then burned out before they hit the ground.  He said that they were both quite low and did in fact, enter the sky below the cloud cover.  They were within Puget Sound, and the one was just where I described it.  So I also find it strange that my brother in law saw the same event, two seconds or so long, that I did.  Pretty strange.  Incidentally, my brother in law, ((deleted)), before becoming a((deleted)) captain in Puget Sound, was an officer in the Coast Guard and also had a degree in Astronomy, though I don&apos;t think that it makes him any more of an expert than the average person who might witness such an event.  Just makes it a little more credible.  ((deleted)) often says he witnesses at night lots of astronomical events, being out on the water, not close to land or lights.  Quite a meteor shower and I guess we did see some that passed low.  If you want more information, call me or write back, and I&apos;ll try to ask ((deleted)) more about what he saw from his angle, south of here and out on the water.

I noticed a brownish formation of three objects starting from the north going in a southly direction at a very fast pace.  The movement of these objects seemed like a flock or birds but it accured to me that it could not be as they were traveling way to fast across the sky.  They seemed to move in front and back of each other till they disappered in less than 5 the most 6 seconds.  They object were wider apart at the begining and moved closer to each other as they travelled south.  Almost a brownish orange in colour not to bright but noticeably with the eye with little strain.

Hope someone could shed some light to what I saw! Ther where no sounds or aircrafts in the area((NUFORC Note:  If the sky was dark at the time of the sighting, as I suspect it must have been, it is possible that the witness may have observed three birds, probably migratory birds, flying rapidly across the sky.  I, too, have been startled, momentarily, when first witnessing birds flying rapidly through the night sky.  The lighter colored feathers reflect illumination from the ground, giving an observer on the ground the impression that a peculiar object is streaking across the sky, when in fact, the birds may be much closer than the witness perceives to be the case.

After the thought I was afraid, what if it could read my thoughts. I could see the object and here is my description. I haven&apos;t yet seen any description like it. it looked like a giant childs playing jack with the top and bottem flattened to one third their size. there were three other tips instead of four sides the ones with the little ball tips on a childs jack.

We tried talking to several people about it, however people looked at us as if we were crazy to this day I wonder what ever happened to us, and if any one else saw it.

I also noticed several air craft inbound for PDX international airport.They where on approach with there landing lights on.As one of the commercial aircraft flew  over I looked to the south to see how close the next incoming jet was. MY vantage point is on a hill with a view to the south down the willamette river valley. The sky was clear to the south and light overcast to the north. A 1/2 moon was in the west lighting up the 3:30 am sky.It was when I glanced to see the other incoming aircraft that I noticed a large object several miles south and appeared to be at a very high elevation. This object was approaching very fast. faster and higher than the incoming jets. The first thing I noticed was the speed and size of the object then I realized there where no lights or strobes. No identifying marker lights at all. it was grey in color as it reflected or was lightly illuminated from the moon just off to the west of the object. I calkled to my friend who was just inside the front door to come quick. he looked up and immeadetly saw what I was staring at.He said what the heck is that there is no lights.Did it just fly over the inbound traffic pattern.( we are within 12 miles of PDX international and well within the TCA) Neither one of us could figure out what we saw other than a huge un marked grey flat bottom solid shape,high, very high altitude,extremely fast flying and totally silent straight line flying object. It flew from south to north straight line and if it remained on this path it would have had to have flown directly over the end of the runnway in which the commercial aircraft where approaching.Surely PDX tower must have seen this,even if it was at extreme altitude. I assume they would have anyway?The object flew directly over head but dissapeared behind the thin cloud layer just to our north. This object was too big, too high. too unmarked by strobes or any attention getting visuale marking and too quiet,silent infact, to be anything identifiable although we both had a very clear and deffinate view of the craft.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded both sincere and credible to us.  We do not know what it was he witnessed.  PD))", "Couple Spots Huge Lighted Object In Sky With Smaller Lights Dancing In Sky Around ItMy wife and I were crossing Florida from West to East on the way home from a Seminar in Tampa.  At a little after 8 p.m. we were on Route 60 between Lake Wales and Vero Beach, Florida.  We were getting close to a Camp Retreat known as River Ranch.My wife called my attention to a huge lighted object in the sky to her right.  I looked and saw what appeared to be a large formation of equal size light. The lights were steady and not blinking.  It looked like the top of a very wide oil refinary tank with lights mounted around the top edge of the tank. In fact, I thought it might be a very large tower of some sorts, but I ruled that out when I could not see any indication of anything stretching from the formation of lights to the ground, that it was actually a huge object in the night sky.  About that time a brilliant flare-like light burst in the sky closer to us and between us and the lighted object. A second burst or explosion of bright light came out from that first burst. The light bursts resembled huge Roman Candle balls, but were as bright as flares and had no trail of lights or sparks, indicating they had come up from the ground. I drove on watching the formation of lights and finally pulled over to get my binoculars out of the trunk. The huge object was still in the sky and I saw the lights on it through my binoculars and the naked eye, but could not get the binoculars focused into one image.  I never did see any kind of craft, but only the formation of lights which seemed to curve around the edge of something.  It was so huge that it looked to me like about a 10 to 15-story building, with one light cut on on each floor, lying on its side up in the sky.  While I fiddled with the binoculars, the lighted object moved rapidly away from me towards the west or southwest and disappeared over the horizon.  When I stopped to get my binoculars out of the trunk, my wife saw more of the bursts of light -flare-type lights we had seen when we first spotted it.When my wife first called my attention to the big lighted object, there also seemed to be scores of smaller independant lights jumping around the sky in the vicinity of the big object.  A few of these smaller lights had blinking lights and were probably aircraft, but the &quot;jumping&quot; smaller lights were puzzling.  There was a full moon out.  I wanted to think this was a lineup of small planes, or helicopters, but there were no blinking lights and the perfect formation of the lights on the big object, that all moved as one, prevented it from being any of these. My wife will separately enter her version of what she saw.((COMMENT FROM READER))Likely explaination for sighting in Lake Wales  1/24/2005Referencing the sighting reported on this date, I am very familiar with this area. The direction the folks were traveling (east) and the fact the wife sighted the lights to her right (south), this was most likely military activity over Avon Park Bombing Range. Flares are frequently dropped from high flying aircraft that float slowly on parachutes. The high altitudes and distance make the flares seem motionless without a reference.((END COMMENT))", "The fireball UFO came from behind the mountain,and was traveling south at a upward angle towards the moon.

They don&apos;t make contrails, and they don&apos;t have wings or make a sound. Planes are not multi directional and can hover in suspended motion. they are of a shape like a ball, and they are a bright reddish orange at night, and by day they are white, because extreme hot surfaces tend to have a white tint to it.

I can&apos;t even listen to skeptics talk, espcially the ones that say as a matter of factly &quot;there is no such thing as ufos&quot; If they only could have seen...I&apos;m not saying that there are aliens, but there are ufos for sure. After riding dirt bikes in port all day, my 2 friends (from port elizabeth) and I decided to go to Ocean city that evening. I was taken home by one of them to put my bike away and get cleaned up.We were to meet back up with my other friend at the Dorchester WaWa store. All went fine and we were headed back when we noticed 2 huge bright lights in the sky. we actually joked that it looked like a giant set of (certain)car headlights. At that point we were heading south on rt 670 about 3 miles north of mauricetown. Our conversation went back to the events of the day, until we got to the mauricetown bridge. At that point we realized that the lights were still there at the same spot, we got a good, strait on view of the front(?) of this object. We judged that it was about 500 ft above the treetops, it wasn&apos;t moving, it was HUGE, and it looked like it was hovering over the WaWa, exactly where we were going. It gets better, as we decended the bridge it was a clear, strait shot to the WaWa and we kept our eyes glued to the object the whole way.  The closer we got, the more surreal the event became, almost like real life startrek or something. When we pulled in the lot we were practically histerical. The thing was so big and close, it looked like a floating city. We pulled around to the front of the building to a normal flow of WaWa patrons and realized that no one had even noticed yet. Our friend was on the payphone out front with his GF. As soon as we stopped the truck I jumped out, ran up to my friend, shook him and pointed up. He almost dropped the phone and just said OMG. Without stopping I ran into the semi crowded store and yelled &quot;hey everyone there&apos;s a ufo out here&quot; some just looked at me like I was nuts, but most people came out to look. I remember one woman screaming and jumping into her little white car and speeding off. And for about 5-10 more minutes 10-15 of us just stood there stairing strait up at this massive rectangle shaped craft. It was dark in color, grey or black with an irregular bottom and rounded or slanted corners. It sat silent and motionless, yet afterwards we all agreed that there was a vibration or hum of energy of some sort. The size was the most impressive part. I can&apos;t really say how big, but I&apos;m talking mother ship or floating city or whatever. Finally, very, very slowly it started moving west. Toward the original direction of the 2 lights (remember those) As soon the craft made it past the horizon of the stores&apos; roof we jumped back in the truck and took off in it&apos;s direction to follow it. (Ocean City was the other direction) When we pulled out it was still moving slow, visible directly out of the drivers side window. But was speeding up fast. After only 10-15 seconds it was pulling away fast and starting to incline about 20 degrees. At that point, in a clear sky, it moved away from us and strait out of sight in less than 5 seconds. You can&apos;t buy tickets to an event like this, and it opened my mind forever.My folks claimed to view a disk in Millville in the 50s with a similar type of close encounter. The sightings of that time are well documented the archives here by many others. They told that story to us as kids and I always wondered. I had to believe my parents but I guess seeing is believing. After the dorchester WaWa event, I stopped wondering.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Moving gracefully and hovering but do not seem to have any substance - just lights attached to a frame.", "Unknown craft with string of colored blinking lights in night skyI was out in front of my porch while star-gazing (one of my favourite pastimes).  At the same time my dogs were barking loudly apparently for no reason.As I looked towards the Orion belt, I got almost startled seeing a slow-moving reddish-golden blinking light or two.  Immediately the blinking light(s) increased in number to around six or seven and pulsed away on and off at a rapid rate from left to right in a straight string-like pattern apparently under the belly of the possible flying craft (which could not be seen due to dark evening though the sky was fully clear of any clouds). The possible craft started heading at quite a fast rate (faster than any normal aircraft) towards north-west direction (opposite to the airport) while the lights continued to blink in changing colors of red, golden, green and blue.  Within a minute or so the possible craft silently moved away out of my sight.Living close to the international airport of our capital since last twenty years I have had a good guess and estimation on structural designs of commercial airlines, two-engine light planes and choppers, etc. in flight. But the above described craft with those string-like blinking lights that I witnessed was completely different from any earthly aircraft.", "Tuesday, December 14, 2004  While driving to Chatham from Ridgetown on the 401 at apx. 4:50 pm I noticed a jet above the clouds on the horizon, I was not driving. Two of my co-workers who I was carpooling with at the time were also in the car. Behind the jet I noticed a flashing light which I took to be another jet close behind the other or in the same area. Noticing the difference that the first jet I saw had a condensation trail and the second did not. I let it go for a couple minutes unwatched and when we puled off the 401 at Communication road I scanned the skies again. The reason being that for the past few days I have been watching the skies for anything out fo the ordinary. Now I know why. At apx. 5:00 pm while heading north on Creek Road I noticed what I assumed to be the jet I had seen earlier. This time it was much closer and appeared to have an unusually short condensation trail. My eyes were drawn to what I saw in the sky behind the &quot;jet&quot;. The same type of flickering I saw near the jet onthe horizon and in almost the same relative position to the jet with the con trail. I figured that this was just another jet that was catching the suns rays. Until the flickering ceased and the lagging object appeared more brilliant, even solid. At this point I knew somethign was not normal about this so I asked the driver to pull over. Both of the other passengers had seen what I was looking at before I asked to pull over. We stopped at the corner of Creek road and Indian Creek road, got out of the car and watched as the two objects traveled in a South Southeastern direction. The distance between the two objects was apx. the distance from the tip of your index finger to the tip of your thumb while held at arms length. My friend suggested that it was an airplane that had another object or craft in tow but that turned out not to be the case. As we were facing south and both objects passed in front of us, the condensation trail behind the red dot dissapeared. Both objects proceeded along their paths and then apx. three seconds later the red dot had started traveling backwards. It did not stop, or turn. it REVERSED. Up until this point I was awaiting the moment when I could say &quot;Ahh, that&apos;s just a couple airplanes&quot; I do not know of any modern aircraft that could mimick the movement I saw. When the red dot reversed its path, there was apx. 3 seconds where it appeared as though the trailing object and the red dot were going to collide. The two objects passed very close to each other and both travelled out of sight at a constant speed. The white luminous object heading South Southeast and the red dot, on its reversed path, and without condensation trail, progressed North Northwest. All three of us that witnessed this event can not come up with any rational explanation for what happened.

I was lying on the sofa in my ocean front condo that faces east when I noticed what looked like a sattalite. This one got my attention because it shined like gold and blinked on and off. I went out on the balcony to get a better look. The lights were out in the condo. Looking east over the ocean, about midway between the clear night sky and the ocean was this satalite shapped thing that glowed a bright gold color. It blinked on and off a few times. Then it went real dim, like it was powering down. Then three (3) round shaped bright gold colored objects came out of the bottom. One went to the left (north?) and one went to the right (south?) and the third one went what I think was downwards towards the ocean. The object powered up to it&apos;s bright gold.

At first we thought we were being attacked by teenagers running towards us with lit cigarettes (or lighting bugs coming through the woods and grass) until more and more of these lights appeared (over thirty moving were now all over the place) and were now moving in a floating manner right torwards us (forty feet away).  This was not human, this what we seen, is humanly unabe to really describe. These lit probes moved together yet each constant lit tiny light moved as if separate, and knowing we were there, it was coming after us because we were there. We hardly ever talk about it, except now that we are older, I have begun to wonder more strongly what encountered us, we tried to rule out anything alien, because I do not believe life exist in space.

It was approximately 2:30 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon with overcast skies. While driving, I happened to glance out my driver&apos;s side window at the sky over the ocean. At the instant I looked at the sky, I observed approximately 12 orbs of the brightest silver light I have ever seen. I could only describe the luminosity as being like that of liquid mercury--only many times brighter--and pulsating. These bright lights appeared to surge out of the cloud cover and pulsate in a formation of 3 stacked rows. The size of each orb was larger than a marble but smaller than a golf ball--if held at arm&apos;s length. Almost as quickly as the orbs appeared, they disappeared.", "I woke up at night and looked out the window near my bed. There was a huge sphere of shining light in front of our nine floor apartment block building, on the level of seventh or eighth floor.

It was as if the light was headed the same direction we were.  The light grew 3 or 4 times it size and then would just blink out.... gone and just as quickly would reappear.  It would split and 3 or 4 smaller lights would would sort of fly away from the original light.

At around 11:12 pm, I was facing westward, when I noticed 5 relatively dim white lights, arranged in a chevron pattern, over my left shoulder.  It was travelling from a southeast to northwest direction.  This time, I was not able to discern the outline of an associated fuselage.  There were no starboard, port, or flashing &quot;running&quot; lights, as would be expected of a normal airplane.  I estimate the altitude at around 1000 feet or less, and the speed was about what you would expect from a private jet.  I would say the size was that of a B-2 bomber.  However, it was completely silent.  It had a straight flight path, and a constant speed.Having lived in the area for some time, I know the normal flight patterns and altitude of commercial aircraft on approach to the Bay area, and small private aircraft from nearby smaller airports. This definitely did not fit the appearance of either.Now that I&apos;ve witnessed this a second time, I believe it must be some type of advanced military aircraft.

He lives a few short miles outside of Scottsville, Kentucky.  This man is still alive today, and he is in his middle 70&apos;s now.  He has always told us this same astonishing story over and over again many times over the years, and his story is always the same with great detail involved.  Recently, he told me this same amazing story again just like he has so many times before in the past.  So I decided to share his fantastic story with you.  While this story is really bizarre to say the least, I do strongly believe that it actually happened.  I have seen UFO&apos;s myself, so I can relate to his unique experience.  This is no lie on my part either-just the truth.  According to this man, one night back in 1972 (estimated year), he was sleeping in his home when all of a sudden his children came into the house from outside yelling for him to get up.  Thay were terrified about something outside and wanted him to come and see it for himself.  They yelled at him telling him that he would not believe it.  After he had finally awakened, he at first noticed that the inside of their house was really bright and lit up for some reason.  He realized that something was causing this to happen from outside.  His dogs were in an uproar too.  He hurriedly got dressed and went outside with his family to see what was happening.  To their astonishment they could clearly see off in the near distance a large glowing disk proceeding to land out in a field directly in front of their house.  The disk had different colored lights rotating all around it-sort of in a swirling motion.  It did land, and it just sat there for half and hour or so glowing brightly.  He and his family just stood there in shock at what they were witnessing.  After they had observed this huge disk for the lenght of time mentioned above, the disk then began to lift up slowly from the ground and just flew away at a tremendous rate of speed.  The disk never at any time during this sighting made any sound at all either.  As a believer in UFO&apos;s, I did want to share his story with you.  What this all means is a mystery to me.

However we were in bed watching it with the lights out and it caught my eye. Then we proceeded to watch it for 45 mins until it ent out of view as it was moving with the star contstellation as mentioned. The ufo was moving eratically, a rythmn was hard to determine but smaller pins of light were evidently working with the main star shooting towards and away from it like a worker bee. The main star also formed a halo of light around it that built up of about 2 seconds then the halo would shoot out like a ripple in a pond. The experience was profound and has left us both very excited, they were without doubt using the star constellation as a disguise so not to attract too much atention.

I was 14 at the time and related the story to my dad at the time and we went down to the area where I said I had seen the craft and we found the usually wet swampy ground to have become hardened like pottery in a roundish shape similar to the size of the craft. After that time I watched for the craft again and never saw anything like it but I began to feel differently and more attached to my own life (could have just been the age at the time?) Anyway I have listened to you on CtoC many times and thought of reporting but just got around to it. Several years later in Calif when I was returning to my apartment about midnight I saw a similar craft crusing along about 500/600 feet above but it had a short tube up to a small ball on top of it from the dish like craft, same lights beneath. At the time I was a student pilot and called the Lond Beach tower and the Lakewood sherrifs office and they had nothing. After crusing along at altitude it took off upward and outward in seconds out of sight!!((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

This is the 4th time I&apos;ve seen a light like this.  (I previously reported them last year.)  I drove in to tell my husband who was ahead of me and after I got gas, I left the station and saw that the light was still in the sky.  I raced home and went upstairs to view from a bedroom window.

My husband, mother and myself watched the light and saw it elongate and appear to be a craft with 3 lights.  I called a friend who lives approximately 1/2 a mile from me and she and her husband went outside to view the lights as well.  We watched them for about 20 more minutes.  During this time another craft seemed to come from behind the first one that looked identical to the first one and it slowly separated from the other one and moved further across the horizon.

I had to re-focus and take another look to register what i was seeing. The UFO was definitely a sphere and as to my best guess it would seem to be at an altitude that commuter jet aircraft would fly. All I really remember is that the sphere was dancing around this cloud and making incredible turns as if playing around it. I watched in amazement as it would appear in front of the cloud and travel the lenth of what i can compare to three or four football lengths then stop and make almost a 90 turn then go around the back until i would see it appear in front of the cloud again.

At first sight, I thought it was a planet because it was so bright, but I then noticed it was moving slowly so I started eliminating the facts of what it couln&apos;t be. Fact 1- Even though it was as bright as Venus or possibly more, it couln&apos;t be a planet, because it was moving. Fact 2- Air planes flew by higher up in the sky, so its altitude suggested it definatly couln&apos;t be the space station or a satilite. Fact 3- Comparing it to a plane or hellicopter, their were no flashing lights on its sides, or under it, or over it. Just a bright white ball of light. Fact 4- No sound was coming from it. At that altitude, about that of a small plane, or hellicopter, I would have been able to hear sound coming from it, yet there was none. Fact 5- As it passed over me and headed away from me, the bright light/sphere simply faded away after about 30 seconds. Fact 6- It couldn&apos;t have disapeared into the thin clouds in the distance, cause it wasn&apos;t high enough. Plus I could see faint stars through those clouds, so I would have been able to see the object very clearly. I was able to see the light sphere for about 20-30 seconds at most. What was interresting too is that during 14 minutes after the sighting of the light sphere, I saw two satellights and a shooting star near the constellation Cassiopeia. I also saw a dot (like the appearence of a satellite) at the altitude of a satellite traveling about twice as fast as the previous satellite I saw a second ago.

MILAB? Strange visit from the health department?Hello  An incident occured on the night before Easter in 2003, and its been nagging at me and my family since. That night, my mother, who had a nasty respitory illness, woke up in what she described was like a drug induced haze (she was once a nurse in Emergency rooms, and has herself had a few surgeries, and thus knows very well what medical anesthesia feels like, and she said this was very similar). She saw fuzzy images of what appeared to her as best she could tell, were people in full surgical garb. One of the &quot;doctors&quot; called her by name, told her everything would be ok. She remebers a needle being inserted in her arm, and blood taken. She couldnt speak, other than grunt, and was very confused before she blacked out again. The next morning she woke up. She saw a needle pincture in her arm and was very concerned. My stepfather, who was also in the bed with her, woke. He also had one, which scared him. To understand better, my stepfather has a serious phobia of needles. When he sees the doctor, he must be sedated before they can poke any sort of needle into him, because he literally vomits and passes out on seeing needles. he often must leave the room when they doctors take blood from my mother. He remebered nothing, but was feeling very drowsy and run down, and felt confused. They both came in and asked me if I had let paramedics in the night before, and I told them no. That night, I myself was playing on my computer. Since I was working a grave yard shift at the time, I had only woken up at about 8 P.M. Yet after 2 hours of being awake, I suddenly was overcome with such drowsiness and exhaustion, I simply crawled onto the cot I slept on, and fell asleep within minutes, which was VERY strange. I woke up feeling sore all over, which was weird, but no puncture or needle marks on my arms at all, and no recollection of anything the night before. When they both showed me these strange needle marks, i was indeed very interested. They told me they themselves fell asleep suddenly, probably around the same time i did, judging by what was on TV when they fell asleep. What was even weirder is that my cats, all of them were very spooked the next day. This was very interesting, as my largest cat never gets spooked. Vacuum cleaners, dogs, loud sounds, nothing phases him, yet I found him hiding under a bunch of boxes, and he hissed at me everytime i tried to reach in and get him. The other cats were terrified and hiding in other places. My stepfather also told me the door was unlocked. I remeber him locking the door every night, and remembered him doing that. We lived in a bad area (White Center) and always made sure it was locked, but the door seemed locked, and the cats would go no where near it. Anyway, this whole thing was very strange. We have been puzzling over it for these past two years, and Ive done a bit of research, and cannot seem to find any possible explainations. Although I have always been interested in the UFO phenomenon, and have done alot of personal research and study, and even had a sighting years ago, at that time, it seemed that the alien abduction theory was not a serious question. However, as I do more looking into it, I have become a bit more confused. I feel that perhaps submitting a report to NUFORC would be the best option. If you folks dont do abduction reports, feel free to send it on to whoever you feel would be best for this subject, if it is indeed typical of abductions. If there is a mundane explaination, like a bizarre midnight visit from the health department (the SARS epidemic was big news at the time, and my mother did have a bad lung infection), Id like to know as well. Im really interested in getting to the bottom of this &quot;high strangeness&quot; and am looking for an answer, mundane or otherwise. Feel Free to contaqct me for any further information by phone or email or other, and Ill be happy to answer any questions. Thank you.

I have told close friends of this, and they know I&apos;ve never taken one drug in my life or even smoked a normal cigarette! I was taking my friend home way out Westport Road. At that time, it was different, undeveloped except for a huge Ford Truck Plant and some apartments.  All along the way it was just land, with huge power lines on tall poles draping over a fairly twisty road in places. After taking her home, in my Mustang, I noticed what I believed to be a normal helicopter coming down...down...then it got so darned near to those big power lines that it scared me! I didn&apos;t want its propellers (though I saw none) get twisted into those lines, so I stopped immediately. I wasn&apos;t going that fast since the road twisted into a sort of curve there anyway, with a guardrail there, and power lines above. No lights were there, only my car lights so it was pitch black otherwise, out in the country. It came so low near my car I wondered if it was a police helicopter looking for someone...I had stopped so I rolled down my windows and turned off my air conditioner. I could not hear it and it was BELOW the second draping power line. That is too low for any craft to be near a street, so I thought it was dangerous. Then it darted back up--way up in seconds. It was unreal how fast. The thing was cigar shaped in that it was similar to a plane or a helicopter body but it was lit up and also shone a light down on the ground. It wasn&apos;t directly on me but near me. I thought a Police &apos;copter made a mistake and was looking for someone but when I heard no engines or whirring propellers it was mysterious to me. I wasn&apos;t even thinking of UFO&apos;s! I went home and followedit in the sky with my eyes and it began to come nearer and then go out higher, irratic for a plane and a &apos;copter can&apos;t go that high I don&apos;t think! I went home (35 minutes trip) and it followed me all the way home, till I got into the driveway. At one point in the road where they are a crossroads, I actually turned out my lights and then went up the hill and thought they lost me but they just went up high. When I got to my yard and parked my car, I stayed in the dark car a minute looking up in the sky as it &quot;looked&quot; for me. While it was up in the air a minute I ran into the house and told my mother who said it was probably a helicopter looking for someone. I said it was so strange it would follow me that long. All night I had this dream I couldn&apos;t stand where I was &quot;downloading&quot; all this &apos;simple&apos; information like: what was my weight? Height? Size? Who were (names!) all of my relatives, what was my education, religion, heritage, you name it. This was before computers and stuff, and the only way to this day I can describe it is like in my dream my whole &apos;data&apos; was downloaded. Maybe the whole thing just gave me this dream, yet in the dream it was very annoying to answer all these simple questions so painstakingly for what seemed hours. I&apos;ve never seen anything weird before or since. I have never smoked, drank anything but an occasional drink because I don&apos;t even like it, and wasn&apos;t on any medicine, didn&apos;t need to be, was perfectly healthy and happy and normal.I have never taken ANY illegal drugs either. I know what I saw wasn&apos;t normal. One other funny thing is that to this day, twenty years later, when I think back on it, I picture myself going TO my friends apartment, yet it was that stretch of road coming BACK that I saw it....weird.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous; indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The object was dark except for a lighted area in the lower lefthand quadrant.  The lighted area was changing from silver to orange and back at a rate of about 5 to 7 seconds per cycle.  I observed this object for about three minutes and it appeared to be stationary with respect to the contrail and was at about 60 degrees off of the horizon slightly west of due south.  I pulled the binoculars away from my eyes expecting to see it with the naked eye but could not and was not able to locate it thereafter. I called the Renton Airport to see if they had observed anything on radar at that time.  They explained that their radar does not have the range to locate anything in that area (South Kent to North Auburn) and directed me to the Seattle Air Traffic Center.  I called them and left a message but have not heard back at this time.

By way of background I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering.", "We did not make out an object, the light was too bright.The non-factory air conditioning in our car would fail against the heat of the desert so we decided to drive home from Southern California to Central Texas at night. My fianc&eacute; (now my wife) and I were somewhere past the Arizona/New Mexico border going east on I-10 in the wee hours of the morning, Thursday, June 18, 1981. We were barely across the NM border somewhere near Mondel, NM, as I noted hwys 80 and 338 coming in from the south as the next signs of any roads. I&rsquo;m not sure of the exact time, but we had been driving since 4 p.m., stopped to eat for a half-hour in Tucson, and it&rsquo;s about ten hours to Deming where I have relatives. I remember this because I knew we&rsquo;d miss them as we&rsquo;d drive by too early in the morning. So I place this observation at between 2:30 and 3:30 a.m. As we were driving, totally alone on the open stretch of pretty straight highway, we both noticed a very bright light to the north. At first, because of the intensity, we thought it was rather close. But as we kept driving, and it remained in about the same position, we kept talking about it and placing it farther and farther away. We were traveling along for at least ten minutes and we could still see it directly north of us, perhaps the equivalent of one car length more westerly than when we had first observed it. It did not seem to be moving. This was 1981 and I don&rsquo;t think I had ever seen any vapor, tungsten, halogen or other lights - just fluorescents and incandescents. I had seen a search-light close up, and this was the intensity of about twenty of those. The light was not directed at anything, had more of an emission than a beam, and it did not appear to be moving. The only reason we noticed it as strange was that it had such brightness from so far away. We could see that it was above the landscape, no more than a hundred feet, but it just looked like a very intense factory lighting system that appeared (at our distance) to be one solid light. Then it moved, or I should say &quot;shot&quot; from our left to directly in front of us. In less time than our eyes could adjust and follow, the light was above I-10 about three hundred yards ahead. It didn&rsquo;t have any searching quality. The movement made no noise (we had our back windows open.) We could make out no shape. It was just one intense source of white light which flooded everything on the ground around it and us. This one light could fill six football fields. I instinctively moved my foot to the brakes but, before I could apply them, it again shot up and to our right (south) and disappeared into the sky above us in less than two seconds. This time our eyes followed it, she out her window and I through the sunroof, until it just blipped out. We both said, &quot;That was no building!&quot;  Fortunately, we both witnessed the same thing and talked about it for many miles afterward. Neither of us could attribute this phenomenon to sleepiness, reflections on windshields, somebody playing tricks with mirrors, air balloons, or any known aircraft or light source.", "stable tapered vertical light in skyLast night I got out of bed ~1:30 to fetch my girlfriend a snack (poached egg on toast; chocolate pudding).  Upon returning to our bedroom I looked out the window and saw a vertical streak of light starting just above the tree line and extending perhaps 10 - 15 degrees into the sky.  The streak of light started narrow, got slightly wider and brighter in the middle and then narrowed again. It was symetric both vertically and horizontally. The light was a whitish/greening/blueish color, akin to some northern lights displays I have seen.  However, it did not shimmer / wave as northern lights do.  It did however slowly fade and brighten repeatedly.  We both watched it for about 15 minutes before going back to sleep. The sky had a fairly uniform cloud cover.  Dark spots moved accross the sky slowly, but it was not clear if these were darker clouds, or openings in the clouds exposing dark night (I suspect the latter).  Regardless, the spots passed behind the light causing no change in relative brightness. We could not judge the distance of the light. We live in Minneapolis on Seabury Ave., which is directly on the Mississippi River.  The light was about 5 degrees SE of the Prospect Park &quot;witches hat&quot; watertower:  (http://www.pperr.org/history/thetower.html).

I was throwing a football straight up in the air and catching it as it came back down when I noticed the object in the sky.  It was small at first, about the size of a star but I remember thinking it couldn&apos;t be since it was nearly noon and directly overhead.  It got bigger and bigger and I realised it was coming down.  It made no sound at all.  At one point it just seamed to hover above me, and apeared to be a small silver ball about the size of a dime held at arms length.  It was hard to tell how high it was, my best guess is that it was somewhere between 2,000 - 5,000 feet high.  I continued to stare at it, wondering what it could be.  Then I remember feeling a strange sensation as if my whole body shifted an inch to the right in a matter of an instant as I continued to stare at the object.  A few seconds after that point I noticed a jet heading towards the object.  Thinking back now on the situation, I realise that it may have been a military jet coming from the direction of the Whiteman Air Force base, just west of Jefferson City.  As the jet got closer to it, the object appeared to rapidly ascend straight up until it was no longer visible.  The jet that had been coming towards the object turned around and flew back in the direction it came from.

Neither are sure of the exact date but it appears to be sometime during the first week of January 2005. Both were travelling on I-405 North (in separate cars) at approximately 6am in the morning. Around the 30th Street Exit (Kennydale) they saw a craft of some sort that seemed to be hovering over Lake Washington. My wife said that it seemed circular, and the lights were like nothing she had ever seen on an airplane. She had the very real feeling that she could possibly be seeing a UFO. It was still dark so no details of the craft could be determined other than the &quot;odd lights&quot;. Just tonight (1/27) my friend called and he wanted to tell me about something he saw in the sky. It turned out it was the same approximate time and place as my wife&apos;s sighting. Neither of them had known the other had seen something, let alone at the same time. My friend said that it was definitely circular and hovering. The lights were around the whole craft and &quot;Revolving&quot;. He knows what airplanes and helicopters look like, and this he said, was nothing like those. The revolving lights in a circular pattern was what really got - and kept - his attention. He said he kept his eye on it to the point that he almost hit the car in front of him. Approximate time of sighting lasted 2-3 minutes until he could no longer see it in his rear-view mirror.

Because it was so small and seemed shiny, it looked just like the stars around it. Because I didn&apos;t know exactly how high up it was, I couldn&apos;t guage the distance very well.

It seemed to be indirectly heading from east to west.After several minutes, another object of the same sort but a little larger joined it. It must have stood still the whole time because we had thought it was a star in the night sky and it startled us to see it move. It moved a bit faster in the same direction, only following one path. It passed from one star to the next in only one or two seconds.As soon as the second ship moved, the first and smaller ship began acting as if it were running away from it.

Something seemed to be glowing outside directly above the treetops in her front yard.  When she looked outside the side living room window into the treetops she saw what appeared to be a cluster of glowing lights of some sort.  She said that they were moving around in every direction, were several different colors, and that there were many of them too.  They all glowed tremendously bright.  We both later agreed that they all could have been part of a very large object that was hovering directly over her house.  She did tell us that that she never heard any type of noise at all during this sighting, and that she did watch these mysterious objects (lights) for over an hour moving around in the same location.  My Grandmother back earlier in her life had a somewhat similar experience she always told us about too.  Back in 1962 or so she had seen a large jet plane being followed or shadowed by a small flying disk.  She could clearly make out the disk and the airplane in the Scottsville sky that day.  They appeared to be far away.  Anyway, I must tell you that my late Grandmother was always a devout Christian her entire life.  Grandma would never lie or make up a story such as this just for fun either.  I believe her strange story, and I thought that you might like to read it.  By the way, your Web site is spectacular and very informative.  The story that I have just told you IS true-not fiction.  Evidently, it seems that there are many people throughout the world that are believers in UFO&apos;s now because of their own encounters.

He could hear nothing, but it was definitely close enough where he SHOULD have heard something.2. It had wing-type structures and a tail.

Very disappointing, because I saw it so very clearly. But anyway, that&apos;s it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Do you have a handbill about your performance, fuel receipts, or credit card reports, for example, which might allow you to calculate the date precisely?  Please let us know, if you would, and we will enter that data with your original report. Thanks, again, for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport((END))((RESPONSE))Peter,I&apos;ve talked to the other guys from ((name deleted)) (the band I was in at the time of the incident) and no one can remember the exact date of that show. We&apos;d played the Rockpile numerous times for WAAF, and there were never any fliers for the show. I even tried searching through WAAF&apos;s website but came up empty. It was definitely sometime in Sept. of 2003.   As crazy as it sounds, I&apos;ve seen far more than my share of UFO&apos;s in my lifetime... several were in broad daylight, all of them different, and totally inexplicable, including one that was followed by - I kid you not - a black helicopter sighting in broad daylight about 3 years ago in New Haven Connecticut. My ex-wife was with me for both the UFO sighting and the subsequent black helicopter incident... verystrange, to say the least.I&apos;m no nut job, and although I am extremely interested in the subject, I am plenty skeptical,and even assess my own experiences with a touch of cynicism.Thanks for the acknowledgement, and I&apos;d be happy to furnish you with any other reports, past or future&hellip;  It would be great if someone would just admit that someone is here. IN my own experience alone, there is far too much evidence to substantiate that assertion.Sincerely,((name deleted))((END RESPONSE))", "very bright object in sky, no movement, 2 bright headlight shape with faint light in center.Was driving home from my mothers house,(2 miles from my house) and looked to the west and saw a unusual bright light in sky,I told my daughter, age 5, to look at the bright star in the sky.  Then she was aking questions about why wasn&apos;t there any other &quot;stars&quot; out,  so I proceded to explain to her it might be a planet.  As I drove on, I could clearly see it in sight, and when i came closer to the object it was two round headlight looking objects with a dim light in the center.

When bright lights in the sky caught my eye. At first I thought this might be a plane but, as I drove closer I realized it was stationary. My next thought was could it be a helicopter? No, as there was no sound from blades. As I got closer I could see that the object was Chevron in shape hovering about 150 feet above ground level. It had 2 very bright white lights positioned in it&apos;s center front section with no additional red or green lights. As I passed beneath the object I could see an orange/gold glow illuminating it&apos;s bottom surface.

The light swooped down, leaving behind it a bright contrail, that quickly disappeared. As the light approached us, we saw that it&apos;s movement was erratic. It moved in a zig zag pattern, left to right. The light then accelerated and went straight up, leaving another misty-fog like contrail behind it. It never made a sound. My son had jumped out of the car when we first noticed it, as I had stopped the car to watch this event. The object must have been about a mile away. I have seen other strange objects over the years, and have even reported some sightings on this sight, but this is probably the most significant event I have witnessed to date. the movement, the contrail, the acceleration. All of these were mind blowing.", "4th of July, 2004, 2 giant red lite oval/circle shaped objects over El Cajon, CA, for apx. 1 hour.On July 4th, 2004, my girlfriend and I took our dog out for a wake at apx. 8:15 pm, to witness the fireworks that would be going off at apx. 9pm. We did not know where any of the fireworks would actually be, but we just set out for a stroll and catch a glimpse of any festivities around our neighborhood. At apx. 8:30 pm, my girlfriend noticed in the Northeastern sky, 2 giant red oval/circle lights in the sky. It was apx. 2 miles from our location, and maybe a mile or more up altitude wise. Considering the distance and altitude, I guessed that they were apx size wise to be maybe a few hundred yards long and maybe 250 yards wide, they probally were a lot bigger. To describe them I will say they seemed to be fuzzy or had an aura, no solid edges, and it  seemed they might have been somewhat flat, definetely red. They appeared to be somewhat oval/circle like. There were no blinking lights noticable on either objects. They moved very slowly, and traveled side by side, but were independent of each other. One would move a little away from the other, but not far, then seem to come closer back to what would be a formation or safe distance from the other object. The speed as said, was very slow. As they moved towards the south, we would notice on ocassion they would wobble or vibrate, then go back to there normal slow direction heading south. Of course there were many other people out in front of their homes to witness the fireworks set for 9pm. I noticed apx. 10 or more people outside close by to us. I yelled over to the people close by us, and asked &quot;do you see those lights&quot;?, and they replied that the lights had been up there before we both had arrived, maybe 15 minutes or a half hour (I&apos;m not 100% sure). Of course I did not have my digital camera to record the incident, and asked if any of the neighbors had something to get images of the objects. I asked if someone could call the TV stations or police, etc, but only got the silent treatment. We stayed in our position for apx 30 minutes until they were now overhead us. So that means these objects took almost a half hour to go apx 2 to 3 miles from the original position till they were directly overhead. They exhibited the same manuevers, moving away from each other, but never very far, then to come closier to each other. It looked like when they were overhead us, that at one time they looked like they were going to merge together, but did not. They did vibrate or wobble at intervals, maybe every 5 or 10 minutes, then to return to there slow smooth approach to the south. I could not stand still any longer and we returned home, so I could call the police. Both lights were still up in the sky when we did enter our home. I spoke to an police officier, and he said I was not the only one to call about the lights. That done, I went back outside to see if they were still there. I was planning on bringing my camera to photo, but was not sure if they were still there (I was in a hurry, and also figured they were moving so slow, I would have plenty of time to photo them). One was gone, and directly over our home was the last remaining light/object. And of course, it was going straight up at a much faster speed that they had ever exhibited prior. It continued to go straight up and then out of eyesight range, and was gone for good. I was surprised to not hear of any news or information concerning this sighting on any local news or television stations, etc. This sighting has bothered me since that time, and I just  now (1/15/05) deceided to see if any one else has seen this same event. So I typed in UFO Red Lights over El Cajon CA, on July 4th 2004, in the search engine &quot;Ask Jeeves&quot;, and came to this website. And so I find now (6 months later) that  there were indeed other wittnesses to this event. I to, like others that have voiced their opinions, think that on New Years Eve, and 4th of July celebrations, is the perfect time to have a cover story for objects or UFO&apos;s to occur. Most people would say that it was only fireworks, etc. But it is quite obvious that no know aircraft exhibits such manuevers, shapes or discription.", "Huge glowing green object in Northern VA.I had just picked up my Son from work in Manassas, and we were driving in a Westerly direction, toward home, at approx. 07:55 PM (EST).The night was dark, clear and starry weather...no moon in sight...with some, not many,  scattered clouds.Several, easily visible, and identifiable commercial jet aircraft were inbound to the Dulles Int&apos;l Airport, and were flying their regular approach traffic patterns...of which we are very familiar.Suddenly, we witnessed a growing green glow approaching from the west, and increasingly lighting up major portions of the sky, very bright, almost neon green. Clouds rapidly became brightly backlit, and sillouetted.Then we were stunned to witness a huge, brightly glowing, green object traverse the sky, almost horizontally, from approx. southerly to north / northwest direction.It appeared, at first to only be a few thousand feet in the air...but this was hard to judge....it flew on very rapidly , trailing a sort of vapor in its wake, and then, just as suddenly as it appeared, it suddenly descended to earth, with extreme speed,and this was followed immediately by blackness (darkness).It appeared to us, from our vantage point, to have come down to earth, either crashed, or landed, perhaps within several miles to the west....We were puzzeled because there was no sound, no sonic boom, no sound of a crash, and no smoke on the horizon...We discussed the incident together, and thought perhaps it was a meteor???, but dismissed that because we had seen several meteor showers before, and they never resembled anything like this object.It was extremely large...glowed very brightly, neon green incolor...had a vapor trail, traveled at extreme speed (at least ten times faster than jets in the air that night), and then suddenly dived, or descended rapidly....and almost certainly landed, or came to earth via a crash...all without a sound.It lit up an enormous portion of the sky..from our vantage point.I am puzzled as to what that was???...and if anyone else in the region,or on board a flight that evening had a glimpse of the same object?

We had a camp fire going and we had been getting ready to put it out when we decided to just let it burn itself out instead. One of the three of us commented on how clear it was for once, since it had been overcast for the last few days. We then started picking out the names of constalations that we were able to point out. Thats when we saw what we think was a UFO. There was a slight haze or light glow around the object. At first it seemed more like a distand planet but after a while we noticed it was more than that. It was actually moving, slowly moving but moving. The first thing that came to mind was that it was a plane, except planes dont just stay around one spot. Then we thought about a helicopter or something of that sort, but there is no reason a chopper should be floating arount there, nor did it really look like one. It was hard to tell the shape of the object be cause the glow caused the object to look blurred. We discussed our new topic of intrest for a while, wondering what it could be. We had gotten away from gazing dumbfoundedly at it for a while only to look back and notice a second glow. At first it seemed unreal, but after the two moved in diffrent patterns and stayed relatively close, we knew it wasnt anything normal. We decided that we would go on with our night as we planned but the happening stayed in the back of our minds all night.

I was pretty bored that night and i believe i was watching X-men for the first time. Well, the couch i was sitting on was by our Windows that face the front of the house, facing south. For some reason i had the odd feeling something was over the house, maybe because i heard something, but i had the urge to look out that window... so I quickly opened the blinds to look outside, and there was a craft flying from over my house towards the small mountains. You could see it fly that way because the lights from the city behind the mountains helped to sort of give an outline to the shape of whatever was flying overhead.  At first i thought it was just a helicopter flying over the house, heading back towards the city, but afterwards i asked myself why in the world would it be so low. It seemed like it was only 100-200 feet above the house as it flew past, and when it went over the mountains, it just barely flew over the edge of them. No lights were visible, and so i said, &quot;that was either a UFO or a military plane flying really low over the town.&quot;  My last thought about it before i went back to my movie was, &quot;Hey, that&apos;s illegal to fly that low anyways!&quot;((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes himself as a member of the U.

I was outside smoking a cigarette, and through the trees above my neighbors house a light/fireball looking object appeared.  It was about the size of a street light but was quite a distance away.  It was a much bigger light than any plane, and stayed in the same spot the whole time while other planes flew in various different areas of the sky.  It was also higher in the sky than any streetlight, and above a large forest area, so it was definately no ordinary aircraft.  While watching it, the object would dim and brighten randomlly.  At one point, another object that appeared to be the same type showed up next to it.  That object disappeared but the first object stayed.

It was just after sunset and the after glow of the sunset was almost entirely gone. There were some kind of radio towers out in the hills and I was doing a little game with myself trying to spot the radio tower&apos;s support wires. It took a little concentration, but I could make them out still against the slight glow of the horizon. I kept moveing from one set of lights to the next to see how far out there I could see. The radio towers had 2 red lights on the tops of them. Off to the right of the radio towers there was another set of red lights, but this set had three lights and another set of lights right next to it that held the same shape, but different colors (One set was red,red,red and the other set was red,white,green). I thought that it was kind of weird and continued my little game on it. I noticed there was no tower under it and no wires. It wasn&apos;t close enough to anything to have been supported by something else. As I kept driving I noticed it was near the road and I would be driving near it, so i kept my eyes on it as much as I could.

First thing I noticed was there was no sound of anykind of engine or exhaust. This really had my attention at this point, I knew this was something seriously new to me. The lights didn&apos;t give off any real radiance to speak of, more of a dim luminesense. The trees below the lights didn&apos;t show and color of the lights. The glow was almost like the glow emitted by the painted Christmas lights, a real subdued glow. The position and shape of the lights were like a wide V shape with the individual lights them selves being the shapes of large ovals or maybe circles looked at from the side. The angle of the V shape was about 30 degrees angle on each side angled up. Kind of like this with the angles being 30 degrees and the lines being ovals &#x5C;_/ much like lights on the bottom side of a concave object.

After rising again for a short distance the light on the left turned sharp left and down 45 degrees. the light on the right turned sharp right and up 45 degrees. The left light then turned horizontal left and then tuned very sharp right and up and at high speed and raced to the other light as if it was trying to catch it up. It reached the other light and they both travelled at the same rate horizontally right but a short distance apart. They both then turned sharply upwards and kept going up until they began to fade and i could no longer see them. The speed and angles they were moving could not be done by an aircraft. When they made their turns is was as if they were hitting a barrier of some sort and bouncing off. Aircraft turns make a sweep and this did not happen at any time.", "Fireball in Desert near Baker, Ca.About 30 miles north of Baker I looked out my right window (looking west) at what I thought was the rising sun... but soon realized it was the wrong direction.  It had the glare of the sun, it was initially in the shape of a sun 2/3 exposed above the horizon.  However, the truncated flat bottom was above the horizon.  The object changed shape to something resembling a bowler hat, the a disk with a dome, and then quickly went to a small point of light (one hundredth the size) and disappeared.  It was definitely some way in the distance, 15-20 miles is a guess.  The only thing I could compare it to (after a distant &quot;sun), was the type of flame emmitted from an oil refinery.", "The light was directly over my head, and no sound of a aircraft.While working for a defence contrator, I was part of a crew that was testing medium caliber ammunition on a US Army training center in central Wisconsin. I and another employee, and a government inspector were in a observation post above and behind the weapon used to test the ammunition. This test was conducted at night in order to see the tracer. We were firing and impacting about 5000 meters down range. To my surprise two lights appeared in the sky about 500 ft high and about 1500 meters down range. Thinking a aircraft had adccidently entered a forbidden airspace I called for a stop to all firing. The lights were lit for about 5 seconds, I telephoned range control to see if any aircraft were in the area, they said no. It was total quiet no sound of a plane. The two lights that were side by side looked about 30-50 feet apart, estimating from the distance from us. After about 10 minutes a light from above appeared on my right, just above the low clouds. This light was on for about 2 seconds, the light came on again, this time directly above us for about another 2 seconds, then a third time to the left of us. No sound of any kind could be heard.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Sunset , multiple objects, mostly round, some triangular, 5 - 10 minute displayAround 7:00 - 7:20 pm, Sunday, October 17, 2004, the following happened: - My wife and I were walking our two dogs around sunset, trying to get finished before it got too dark to safely walk the dogs. We were returning to our house in Alamo Heights, walking past the high school.- I commented on the beautiful sunset to our left, and we stopped our walk and both admired it. It was quite pretty, one of those really good, bright Texas sunsets.- My wife then pointed out a distinct ball that had appeared in the sunset clouds...- It was absolutely distinct, with a greyish edge outline... I looked (skeptically) to where ((wife&apos;s name deleted)) was indicating and saw the object very clearly. It was an &quot;Aw Sh-t...&quot; moment.- The object appeared like a distant but clearly round planet would appear out in space, distinctly round, very likely a globe, but with no surface features. It appeared to have a smooth surface.- Things began to get pretty weird, pretty fast. We saw more and more  distinct balls appearing throughout the cloud banks. then after there were several large globes / balls in view, some of them suddenly began having 3 - 4 smaller balls appear right next to them... I believe that all of these new spheres appeared to the objects&apos; left, our right. Some of these new smaller globes / spheres then would move off...  I simply could not comprehend what I / we were seeing.- We estimated that in total there were at least a dozen large objects and many more smaller objects.- They were primarily in two sizes and round shapes, but there were some triangular ones as well. The triangular shapes had rounded corners.- The objects were as distinct and solid-appearing as marbles.- These were very distinct balls or globes, with definite firm outlines and consistent appearances. Some when they appeared were triangular, but they remained that way, and the round ones stayed round. They all remained quite distinct and clear through this episode.- Early on I saw one that was so distinct and bright that I mentioned to ((name deleted)) that it looked like a plane with its landing lights on... Monica told me she had not mentioned it because she was sure it was a plane. Although the light was red, I thought this airplane might somehow help explain what we were seeing. We both viewed this specific object for a while, and it wasn&apos;t an airplane. It moved to the right for a bit, then stopped and hung there.  It hung in the sky throughout the episode.- We spent the next 5 minutes or so excitingly pointing to other globe / ball or triangular objects that simply appeared, or others that were moving left or right relative to all the other balls.- This type of activity was going on throughout our field of vision and beyond so that we had to scan a bit of the sky to take in all the objects. I estimate around a 20 - 30 degree field of view was necessary to encompass all of this. We of course were primarily going from one specific focus to another, but I would occasionally widen my view to take in more of the big picture.- As time passed, to the left side of the scenario, we watched some smaller balls that had come out of a larger ball morph into what looked like small, fiery-red, still distinct objects against a very dark background. All of this developed quite quickly. The objects continued to morph into more and more complex shapes and more detail against the dark background. It appeared to me that they morph&apos;d into some sort ofcuneiform, or hieroglyphics. The images were quite distinct and clear, if very small, but what they were specifically I could not tell.- ((name deleted)) later described this same activity as looking like &quot;moving braille-like characters&quot;.- This particular display then morph&apos;d into what looked exactly like a medium-sized city at night (black background, white glowing city lights) as seen from onboard an approaching aircraft. This scene first appeared to be a view from directly above a city, but then the view angled down to look exactly like the view one would have as they were landing into a city at night.- I kept telling ((name deleted)) that I wished I had brought our camera. Understatement of the century.- Then, very suddenly the whole show (writing characters, globes, other objects, etc.) began to quickly fade and merge back into (the effect appeared to us) the clouds behind them. General Comments: - The entire incident was completely non-threatening with a calmness about it.- The whole effect was as though the visual &quot;show&quot; was generally unfolding toward us. It appeared that each new activity took place in front of, or at least came out of and to the side or below the previous objects.- We really did not have time to ask ourselves what they were because we were simply too busy pointing out one or another new item or activity to each other.- It seems certain that ((name deleted)) and I saw the same exact images because we repeatedly pointed out one or another object to each other, and we would then get immediate confirmation. It was unbelievable, except that ((name deleted)) and I clearly saw this.- There was a family in a house behind us with a motorcycle in their driveway behind a dark red Hummer. I have not yet contacted them to see if they saw anything like we did.- I called my mother to see if she had seen anything in the sunset, but she had not watched it tonight.- I called my friend to see if he or his wife had viewed the sunset, but they had not. I  spoke to my friend at length about this.- I called WOAI TV news hotline to see if any one else had seen and reported anything, they had not received any news like this, and neither had their weatherman.", "12/12/2004 Chino hills objects hoverin very far from Earth Vshape formation.I was helping my Brother in law move ,we took a short break, walked outside, I looked at the sky because i heard a jet pass by .Well a a greater distance than the jet was flying a saw two oval shiny dots appear as though coming down towards Earth but at a great distance from the ground they hovered for a while when all of a sudden almost immediately we saw about six more objects appear in a V formation.It was a clear sunny day the sun was about to go down we thought they were stars but the objects were moving all of a sudden they all disappeared .Did any body see this on the same day?", "Sphere, Shiny, disapearThis was at around, 7:30am  I noticed a jet way up in the sky when I pulled off (the vapor trail from it caught my eye, o and there wasn&apos;t a cloud in the sky, just as clear as it could be) So I was like, &quot;Hey, there&apos;s a jet&quot; then I looked about 10:30 to 11 o&apos;clock above the jet, probably about... (not good at guessing how far away it was from the jet, but from my prespective it was 5-6 inches, which i guess would be 1,000 feet maybe ??? ) anyways it was round, a perfect sphere, silver, and very shiney.

It was very windy outside (25-30mph) so i&apos;m not possitive what I heard wasn&apos;t just wind. The noise sounded almost like a very odd TV static. A buzzing and cracking noise if you will.  I stayed outside for about 15-20 minutes looking at the sky.  I couldnt see anything.  The sound was coming from directly above me about 100 ft. I went inside and got online to talk to a friend about it.  This friend lives about 20 miles away in Rockford, IL off of charles st.  He went outside as soon as I told him this.  When he came back he described the exact same noise I had heard 5 minutes earlier.  Another friend felt a very large blast then looked outside to see a very large green, white, and red light about 100 feet above the ground.  He then told me that the blast was felt before it actually happened to the best of his knowledge.  He walked outside and one of the telephone wires started to spark.  All of the lights on the block went out for about 10 minutes then came on again.  They stayed on for not more than 15 seconds then went off again.  He talked about how he could actually feel the light in his body, and how he felt very uncomfortable. Shortly after this had happened, a police car came onto the street.  Apparently he had followed the light from East State St. to Fairview Blvd.   The police officer said he did know what the light was.  ComEd know nothing of the power outage and said it was probably just wind, but all who were involved know otherwise.

Having watched flights come in and out of the pheonix airport for awhile now I am positive that no airplne has ever looked like this.

It went into the clouds and that was the last I saw it. The Winds were easterly (clouds moving easterly) but the &quot;dot&quot; seemed like it was moving across the wind. I managed to get a photo.  Not sure if it&apos;s a weather balloon or ufo?  I tried to &quot;blow up&quot; the image but at 200 % just a blurry white dot. A military Helicopter had just passed below it heading south, this is what brought my attention to look skyward. I was in my backyard. It looked like it went into the cloud, but it may have been above the cloud.  Straight direction, steadfast in its course.  It was traveling faster than the clouds. Seems to me that if it were a weather balloon it would be traveling the same speed and direction as the cloud.  In the time from when I snapped the  photo to when it went into the cloud I could not get another photo.  It was traveling every bit as fast as the helicopter.  The whole incident probably took 15 seconds, seven seconds for me to go in get the camera off the coffee table, come out, find the object again, focus, snap the picture. Maybe 45 degrees of arc total.", "I saw a round object in a controlled fall from the sky, the  object  went behind some clouds and did not reappear in it&apos;s fall.I saw a round object that appeared to be falling from the sky, but the rate of speed appeared to be under control. The object was a dull white in color. As the object fell, it disappeared behind a cloud, and did not reappear below the cloud, as it should have done, if it was in a free fall.  The object was not an aircraft, but something round and under intelligent control. I&apos;ve held a commercial pilot&apos;s license for 36 years, &amp; I say it was not of this world. Another encounter of mine: In August 4-6, 1991, I was standing in the snow at the 7000&apos; level of Mt Hood. I saw a round shinny object moving slowly at 090 degrees, at 12,500&apos;, then the object came to a stop directly over Mt Hood.

Declination from the horizon was about 85 degrees.  No contrails or cloud distrubance was seen. The white object was crisply defined and brightly lite against the sky.  The shape was flattened top and bottom with sharply oval ends(cigar shape) and traveled in a straight path.  Its size seemed rather large for a distance object in space (i.e. satellite).  A small plane and a commerial aircraft was seen just prior to the sighting, which is within the inner ring of Class B airspace of Charlotte International.  This sighting was witnessed by my sixteen year old daughter while taking photos for a school project (film out at time of sighting).  She found the experience to be distorting and upsetting and reported the incidence to me the next day.  This report is being sumitted by her father who is an aircraft pilot.  I  believe the object to be a spacecraft, although its precise shape, daytime appearance and apparent closeness is puzzling.

(I live on West 13th St Ashtabula Ohio.)  I was thinking that it was probably &quot;Life flight&quot; coming into ACMC (Ashtabula County Medical Center) so I stayed at the bottom of my driveway to watch. When it got closer the white light diminished. By the time that this craft was over me I could swear I could see a black triangular shape with a series of different colored lights flashing rapidly on all three corners. No noise! Was listening for chopper sounds. Never heard them. Well,  I ran back down to my brother&apos;s house to have him come outside. When he got outside it was to far away. My brother didn&apos;t know what to think. All of a sudden my brother asked,&quot;Whats that?&quot; Another one (higher up; again no noise and flying from the west)lights flashing on and off but no distinctive shape.

Everything was quiet!", "Orange light slowly travels across the sky and rapidly ejects smaller lights downward from it, before disappearing.I had just come home from work and was unloading my car, making several trips into the house.  I noticed an orange point of light in the North sky close to the horizon.  It was the approximate brightness of aircraft headlights.  At first I didn&apos;t pay much attention to it, but as I noticed the light gradually moving in my general direction, the orangeness of the light struck me as being odd, as aircraft have white headlights, red strobe lights, red and green wingtip lights, and white wingtip strobes.  This had none of those lights required by the FAA.  I also started to notice that although this light was moving a bit slower than a satellite, it&apos;s speed kept changing.  Just enough to notice.  It would speed up and slow down as it moved from North to South.  As it got closer I kept listening, but never heard any engines or any noise at all.  I also noticed that it began swerving slightly and it&apos;s overall direction changed to a Southeasterly direction.  The intensity of the light remained constant.  It got to a point where it was as close to me as it was going to get and was now moving left to right.  It was a mostly clear night, with a few patchy areas of stratus clouds.  A couple of times this object passed behind a cloud and could still see some light through it.  It&apos;s altitude was hard to guess, but high enough to be above the low clouds.  At it&apos;s closest point, it was about 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon.  By this time I had run into to house to retrieve a pair of binoculars to get a better look at this.  I focused in on it, and it was a solid orange point of light.  It left no vapor or smoke trail.  As it moved southeast I suddenly saw a smaller &quot;piece&quot; of the orange light fall or get ejected downward from the object.  The odd thing is, the &quot;piece&quot; kept the same forward velocity as the parent object as it fell rapidly downward, so it did not lag behind or trail as it fell.  Once it fell, it quickly twinkled out.  Then I saw another piece drop, and then another, in the same exact fashion.  Then the parent object quickly faded out into the blackness of the night sky.  Nothing further was seen.Had this been a satellite or space junk burning up in the atmosphere, any pieces breaking off would stay together and slowly drift apart.  The &quot;piece&quot; was moving downward at about the same speed as it was moving forward.

I was heading north and this was east of me.  The object did 2 or 3 full 360 x,y,z axis rotations and I saw a blur of motion and it was gone. When I looked forward it was now over Badger Ordinance, again rotating and moving slowly up and down.  It then stoped all motion and a white lite came out of the bottom.  Then the same blur happened again.  A few minutes later when I was on Badger Hill goin past the junk yard on Hwy 12 the object reappeared above my car.  It couldn&apos;t have been more than 15 feet from point to point and it was made of a black material.  I saw the underside very clearly because it couldn&apos;t have been more than 20 feet above me.  The surface was not completely smooth, it had smooth vulcano shaped object on the bottom that a white light came out of.  Like a spot light.

For this reason, I was paying more attention to the night sky than I usually did. I was walking toward my house at the top of a hill. On the sidewalk, I was facing up the hill. There is a large bridge that crosses the river to my left and a graveyard on my right. I had just cleared the bridge when in my peripheral vision I thought I saw something in the sky. I turned my head and expected there to be nothing there, but I was surprised to see that there was something. It was an unlit, noiseless hovering object that was floating slowly toward me. There were no lights and no markings to speak of. The only way I even detected it was the light reflecting off of the bottom of the object from the bridge&apos;s street lights. The object was at the height of a 3 to 5 story building, it was hard to tell. It was size of a large vehicle or bigger. Since it was difficult to judge the distance it was also difficult to judge the size. As it got closer to me I thought I could make out some detail - maybe a corner or a surface feature on the bottom. It could have been triangular, square or pentagonal - really no way to tell. Once it was nearly above me, I panicked and picked up the grocery bag - which I had dropped moments before - and ran up the hill about 15 or 20 meters.

I looked up and thought I was witnessing a very low plane headed right for the end store and the parking lot but there was no noise and I did not feel any panic or fear.  There were three lights almost in a row but slightly diagonal from left to right (raised higher on the right).  Two of the lights were closer together on the left and the one on the right was at the tip of the diagonal.  They were amber and white and very bright.  All three moved rapidly above the end store and then hovered there for a few seconds.  I was shocked when they suddenly went completely vertical but I could not keep from staring.

A minute or two later, the flashing started again as it headed south. There were about 5 smaller orange/red flashes. The whole experience was about 5 minutes. This was not lightning. The sky was a little overcast/cloudy, very windy  temperatures had recently dropped with light flurries.  This was cool! We&apos;re not crazy.

The formation consisted of three red lights (one behind the other in the direction of travel) on the western side of the formation, and two red lights (one behind the other in the direction of travel) on the eastern side of the formation. The group of lights were in &quot;bowling pin&quot; formation, not a &quot;chevron&quot; formation. The lights had approximately 2-3 degrees of arc separation between each of them. Each light was a diffuse red &quot;disc&quot;, approximately 0.2 degrees of arc in diameter.  All the lights were uniform in color and size, and had a constant intensity. They moved in exactly a straight line, at constant velocity, from the North-Northeast to the South-Southwest. It took approximately 8-9 seconds for the group of five lights to travel from directly over head to approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. No noise was observed. The sky was very clear-no clouds, or haze. The ambient was approximately 15 F. No shape, glow, or shadow was visible between the red lights. I am an amatuer astronomer. This was a naked eye sighting. I was looking at the Pleides and Orion, when I noticed the group of lights moving rapidly overhead. I have seen high and low altitude plane lights, satellites, and meteors, but I have never seen anything like this pass overhead across the night sky before.", "Six lights appear above Harrisburg skylineThere were six objects total.  At first I thought it was just a plane coming from behind a cloud because I saw one light appear, and then another.  Three lights appeared side by side and in order (slightly down and to the left), and then the first light disappeared and the fourth light appeared in order with the others.  Then all lights disappeared and two more showed up at the same time slightly lower on the horizon.  The colour of the light was like an orange street light colour.

As we stood outside, we saw three red lights in a &quot;v&quot; formation, followed by 5-7 greenish-white lights moving in a fluid, wavy motion.  The closest analogy I can think of is a tadpole or a sperm. *  *  .  * . Red=* Light green = . The red lights were about the size and brightness of Venus as it appears to the naked eye.  The trailing lights were smaller. An airplane was in the sky concurrently, and though the mysterious lights looked further away than those of the plane, they were moving much, much faster. Also, their motion didn&apos;t seem like anything we&apos;d ever seen before.  Rather than moving as though propelled by a motive force coming from a fixed place ( ie a jet or prop ) , these lights seemed to change direction instantaneously.  They were also capable of hovering in place, then jumping to an incredible rate of speed, and always in formation.  I still remember it clearly because I&apos;ve never really seen anything move like that in my life -- particularly an aircraft.  It reminded me of how a hummingbird hovers, then darts. When the lights flew over us, they again picked up speed in their jerky-but-fluid way, startling my companion and causing him to fall in a hedge beside the house. Anyway, that&apos;s it.  It was weird.((NUFORC Note:  Image provided by witness in the text of his report did not survive the transfer to the database and website.

OK - but closer into town and now in morning rush hour traffic, directly ahead of me I noticed the same light appear into view, and I thought a plane was banking and caught sunlight, but again the light disappeared, it was there one second, then gone.

I didn&apos;t know what they were and my boyfriend thought they must be tower lights of somekind.  I was not aware of any toweres being built there, but thought it might be a reasonable conclusion.  As time went on, I thought they were moving to the east and toward us and the town.  At that point, we thought they might be military planes as there is a strip in the area somewhere.  But, I felt these craft were too big to be military planes.  However, it was dark and so one couldn&apos;t see much but the lights.  As we passed through the interestion, I continued to watch and noticed the lights on the craft.  I felt they were not the usual lighting of commercial planes.  I am not that familiar with military planes, but the back lights did not seem to reflect that of tail lights - but a circular set of green lights (maybe 5).  There was at least one red blinking light. We turned around to get a better look while the crafts were flying over the Hwy.  We thought we would be able to get a good look because they seemed to move slowly.  But, as we turned around, we were not able to see much else at a close range.  They were at a low altitude like military planes, but we did not hear any loud engine sounds like I have heard in the past.  I guess I didn&apos;t think that much about it because we were in a car and may not have been able to hear a noise like that.  I think the biggest thing that stands out is that the &quot;wing span&quot; of the bright 2 lights (left and right) seemed way too wide for a plane and most of all, I have not seen green lights like that before on a plane.

From where I was standing/driving the object appeared to be the size of my pinky fingernail. It was long and slinder but slightly oval. Clearly not a plane (no wings), not a balloon (too slinder and metalic-like). It had almost a chrome finish. I heard no sounds. It didn&apos;t change color only reflected the sunlight.

At first I mistook it for a plane flying towards us but it was a bit brighter and maybe a bit larger (lower?) than the other planes in the area at the time, and it was missing the usual red and green blinking marker ligthts. Besides, it should have grown larger and eventually flown overhead if it really were moving in our direction. This object was apparently stationary.  I brought it to my boyfriend&apos;s attention and as we were watching it, the lights quickly dimmed (within approximately  a second)and the object seemed to disappear. There were very few light clouds and it was still light out and the object was definitely no longer there.  My boyfriend said that he could see a dark patch against the sky where it was for a couple of seconds before that also disapeared completely but I can&apos;t confirm this because I had to revert my attention to the road ahead. I did look up again a minute later there was still nothing where it should have been or around that area. I was wondering if anyone else in the area saw anything.", "Light was about the size of a BB held at arms lengthNot much to describe. I was outside, getting ready to take a drive up to the mountains, when I happened to look up, just in time to watch a light briefly streak across the sky.

The direction was southwest.  It appeared to be 1-3 miles away and was somewhat close to the ground.  Initially I thought it was the top floor of a distant building being worked on by a team of welders.  I didn&apos;t recall a building being there so it sparked my interest that much more.  Through binoculars it looked cigar shaped.  The middle of it was radiating with  very bright lights (white, blue, red, orange).  It was stationary for a couple of minutes but then started slowly moving north. The object disappeared behind a building that&apos;s about 300 yards from me and I never saw it appear on the other side. It&apos;s initial location was about a mile or a little less directly north of E.D.S. (Electronic Data Systems) and as I mentioned before, moved north from there.

My husband and I were driving our kids to his sisters house for her to watch them while we tried our hand at Black Friday shopping. It was about 4:30/5 in the morning. We were traveling south east on route 20 in Sussex County Delaware. I noticed this bright &lsquo;star&rsquo; on the left side of the road above the woods. My husband commented about how bright it was. I said yeah&hellip;it must be the north star&hellip;but no that wouldn&rsquo;t make sense since we were traveling south east. I&rsquo;m VERY interested in the stars and the sky and UFO&rsquo;s and such so I kept staring at it because it was so bright&hellip;then it crossed the road and was on the right side of the road&hellip;I said to my husband &ldquo;Um&hellip;its on this side now&hellip;&rdquo; (I was in the passenger seat) We kept traveling on route 20 towards Millsboro and it was following us. I made the comment as such. It would seem to stop in the sky&hellip;then speed up to keep up with us&hellip;it stayed in view of my passenger side window the entire time on 20. It was very high in the sky, so that all we could see was like a round..ball of bright light. When we came to the 113 junction to make a right, the object was going straight and made a sharp right, like a 90 degree turn to stay with us. This scared me a bit. I said to my husband &ldquo;Holy sh*t, its seriously following us&hellip;&rdquo; We were a bit uneasy&hellip;but continued on 113 for a bit then turned into the old Acme parking lot to get to his mothers development, on Mitchell Rd. The object was now above a wooded area near the railroad tracks behind the development&hellip;to the right of her home. We took our kids in and we came out and I observed the object was still there. I said to my husband &ldquo;Its hovering over the woods there&rdquo;&hellip;we left making our way down by the bowling alley on Mitchell Rd in town in Millsboro. I looked back and sure enough there it was, following us again. I exclaimed to my husband, &ldquo;Its following us! Atleast we know its not after the kids (relief)&rdquo; We turned onto route 24, going from Millsboro to Long Neck to Rehoboth. The object  followed us the entire way, doing that stop in the sky, speed up thing as if to keep up with us, but not pass us. There were just a few other cars on the road near Mountaire in Millsboro, I told my husband I didn&rsquo;t care how fast he had to go, he had to keep up with another car&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t want to be the only car on the road for fear of giving whatever was following us an opportunity to perhaps &lsquo;beam us up&rsquo; We stopped at a stoplight and then my husband accelerated very fast  to see if the object would do the same, it did. Near the volunteer fire company on 24, I could see the object a little clearer. It was soo bright that it like &lsquo;twinkled&rsquo; blue and red but so so bright..like the florescent blue light, bright. I noticed as we passed the new high school and nursing school that it would dim, them brighten..then dim..then brighten&hellip;I peered close and it reminded me of a lighthouse light..turning&hellip;like it was TURNING, the light would dissipate then come back as if it made a full circle. It was too high in the sky to be a helicopter, there was no noise and a normal aircraft would NOT follow our path to Kmart at about 5:30ish in the morning as it was. When we made our right turn onto rt 1, again, the object made a sharp right turn to keep up with us but now it was visible in my husbands driver side window. We went to Kmart and the light stopped right over Kmart. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else noticed this since everyone was so preoccupied with getting in line for holiday shopping but I wonder if anyone else traveling the road DID notice.

It was a very clear beautiful night.I was fishing on a boat with a friend of mine, ((name deleted)). It was getting late and we decided to call it a night , as we approached the boat dock we noticed a glowing amber colored light/object hovering over an overpass next to the dock. We were approx 150&rsquo; from the overpass and the object was approx 40&rsquo; above the overpass. This light/object bobbed up and down and side to side as if it was floating on an invisible ocean. We looked at each other and said &quot;what the hell is that?&quot; I immediately stopped the boat and we watched it for a few seconds; it then instantly shoot upwards   It appeared to have gone to the edge of the atmosphere. It moved so fast that it left &quot;trails&quot; from the point it was at to the point above us where it stopped. At this time it appeared as a very bright amber colored star. As we continued to watch it for a few seconds we noticed a red ring of light start to appear/pulsate around it. The red &quot;ring&quot; first started out dim and as it pulsated it got brighter. At the point of it&rsquo;s brightest moment the amber object &quot;disappeared&quot; into the ring. As soon as it went &quot;into&quot; the ring the ring shrunk and dissipated.The amber light looked slightly &quot;fuzzy&quot; as if it was dissipating heat from it, like the ripple affect you see from a hot road or hot car hood on a hot summer day. It did look like an object radiating light rather than just a light in the sky. It appeared to have &quot;substance&quot; to it.

Dear Sir,  I&apos;ve decided to write regarding your investigation of the UFO incident over O&apos;Fallon and Shiloh etc.  I grew up in O&apos;Fallon from 1976-1981 and graduated from ((deleted)). I am intimately familiar with the area that the O&apos;Fallon police officer sighted the UFO as I used to ride my dirt bike as a small boy behind the Jack Schmitt Dealership before it was built. Years ago there used to be an abandoned train track that ran from the O&apos;Fallon Lumber yard over to the old coalmine (as I knew it) towards Hartman Lane. This was before Interstate 64 was open and during it&apos;s construction.( 1977 I believe) My parents still live in O&apos;Fallon and I visit about every 3 or 4 years. I found your investigative report amazing and would like to thank you for such an informative and detailed article regarding the sightings. I currently work for the Federal Government as a ((deleted)) and have recently retired (June 2004) from the US Air Force in Colorado Springs. I spent 23 years as an aircraft mechanic on C-141, C-5 and C-130 cargo planes and the last 14 of those years as a C-130 Instructor Flight Engineer with almost 3,500 total flight hours. I would like to recount an experience I had in the summer of 2001 (estimate) while flying a Tactical Training Mission over the Colorado Mountains near Salida, Colorado. The reason why I mention Salida, Colorado is because of the somewhat famous video taken in 1999 by a restaurant owner who lives in Salida. I have not related this incident to any UFO organizations as of yet and only mention it occasionally to close friends and relatives. I&apos;ll try to be short and hope you find this account as interesting and perplexing as I do. As you may well know the C-130 aircraft is used for intra-theater operations at forward operating bases. We continuously practice low level routes simulating ingress into a drop zone in order to airdrop personnel or cargo. The C-130 unit located at Peterson AFB CO is currently the largest Air Force Reserve unit in the United States with 16 aircraft assigned. We were flying a low level mountain route in a three ship formation west of Salida and north-west of Monarch Ski Area. When accomplishing tactical maneuvers we would typically fly no lower than 500 feet and use the terrain and mountains in order to enhance our survivability. During these low level mountain routes the other aircraft in the formation would normally fly what is called fluid trail. This means that they are able to maneuver as they see fit and it is not until we approach the drop zone within 5 miles do we form back up into an airdrop configuration with each aircraft behind each other approximately 2000 feet. The reason I mention this is because I do not believe any other aircrew members on the other aircraft witnessed what I did. As we were approaching a ridge line crossing at approximately 500 feet above ground level I glanced out of the co-pilots lower right side window near his right leg. If you are familiar with the C-130 you know that it has 23 windows surrounding the flight deck area and has an excellent view not only in front of the aircraft but also down and below the front of the aircraft. I witnessed 2 Silver Orbs or Balls, side by side, moving in the opposite direction approximately 100-200 feet below and to the right of our aircraft. I  have since recounted these Orbs as being in formation.(C-130 Talk) My view of these orbs was only for 2 or 3 seconds as we were traveling between 230-250 knots indicated airspeed. My first thought was that of the orange balls located on power lines for aircraft identification. But these were not orange and there were no power lines in our vicinity given the altitude and mountainous terrain involved. As I look back on it now I can still see these 2 Silver Objects as they moved below and past our aircraft. I do not recall if I mentioned this to the Co-pilot or not. He would most likely have been the only other person to have seen these 2 silver objects unless the Loadmaster in the back was standing in the right rear troop door and looking out. And since this was a mountain route with the possibility of severe turbulence he would have been sitting down and strapped in since we have had injuries in the past. I could not tell the size of the 2 objects but I would estimate them to be 10-15 feet in circumference maybe bigger. Again I only witnessed them for 2 or 3 seconds and then they were gone. I could not exactly determine their size. The funny thing is I know what I saw. And will never forget. I&apos;m sorry if I rambled on but I wanted to thank you again for the article about the Illinois UFO. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I do plan on reporting this to a UFO organization soon. Do you recommend one over the other?? I was thinking MUFON although it probably really doesn&apos;t matter.

Two smaller coloured craft came away from the motherships and kept descending as if looking for something and also took semicircular jumps from one area to another.

It was then that I remembered that in early August of 2003 we had a observed a similiar light in teh sky in the exact location and had reported it to our local sheriff department becasue through the binoculars it seemed to be a spining object with red, blue &amp; green lights that remained in the same spot before abruptly disappearing. My father and I observed the object through 10x binoculars, at this time we observed an object that seemed to spin (as if a conical shape - imaging a short, fat ice cream cone on it&apos;s side) with every color of teh rainbow being emmitted from the circular end. With your naked eye you could continue to observe colors changing, but only in hues of red to blue to green. We then called a friend who lives on the outskirts of Green Lake, he also saw it to teh southeast, slighlty abov ethe horizon and observed teh similar movement and colors that we did through his spotting scope. I then departed my parents home and proceded to a my boyfriends home between Green Lake and Markesan, WI. I watched the object remain stationary in the sky the entire drive and it continued to change colors. At this time, my boyfriend and his nephew and I sat on a hill and continued to view it through binoculars at 10x. The object continued to spin and emit colors from the circular side. At this time we also noticed 4 planes flying from west to east (at a very fast speed) within very close proximity to each other. They seemed to fly right in front of the object, though the object seemed to be quite further into the atmosphere. At about 9:30 we stopped watching the object. Several of our neighbors have reported of seeing the same object until 10 pm at night. No matter what it may be. it was definetly an experience I will never forget.

I had my seat back and was just looking up at the sky out the passenger window.  The sun was shining and there were a few clouds in the sky, a very nice day.  I was looking northeast from the car.  My husband stopped for a red light at Broadway and Transit Rd...and that&apos;s when I saw it. I spotted an object, elongated like a cigar, which appeared to be metal, silver in color, the sun shining on it.  There was no sound at all that I could hear and I didn&apos;t see any windows or wings.  It traveled in an southeasterly direction.  I then spotted a plane traveling northwest and I thought they would collide, but the plane crossed in front of it.  I wondered if the pilot saw this thing.  The cigar shaped object traveled slowly and steadily......then suddenly stopped in midair for a second, then moved in the direction from which it came.....no turning or anything.  I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off it.  I had never seen anything like it in my life.  My husband continued north on Transit Road and I kept my eyes on the object.  By now I was babbling like a maniac.  Then it stopped again for a second, and moved again from where it came.......I kept my eyes on it as we traveled....and I saw it once again stop and start traveling again..but then we were so far I couldn&apos;t keep track of it. Continuing on to Main Street, I noticed before and after the doctor appointment that there were quite a number of planes in the sky, with their white exhaust trailing after them. I am thoroughly puzzled and amazed.  I don&apos;t know of anything that moves in the sky, stops in midair, then goes in the opposite direction, without turning.  My husband suggested it was a blimp, but even blimps have to make a turn to go in the opposite direction, don&apos;t they?  He didn&apos;t see it at all because he had his eyes on the road going north. It most certainly was NOT a balloon, nor a blimp.  It had no wings.  I can&apos;t determine its altitude, but as I recall, the plane looked a bit larger and I could see the plane had wings.  That&apos;s about all I can remember about it, but I can&apos;t forget it.

I was 7 at the time and was interested in space and any kind of airplane. I was actually mad that I had to leave the house that night because of a report that I saw that was coming on NBC Nightly News with John Chancellor that I wanted to see. The report was on the flap in Mississippi at the same time. Subsequently, we found the haunted house and drove by, not stopping to go in, when we turned around to go home and saw a huge bluish-green oval in the sky. People in their cars were looking up and pointing to it. We followed in the general direction of the craft and turned into a neighborhood off Archdale Dr. near Park Rd Park. As we approached a group of trees in a front yard the object seemed to turn and as we cleared the trees the object had vanished. From that point on I have studied the subject intensely. I currently work at CDI Airport and am familiar with all sorts of aircraft. It was no aircraft, civilian or military, that I have seen then or since. It wasn&apos;t a weather balloon, temperature inversion, searchlight, swamp gas, Venus or a &quot;mass hallucination&quot; (my favorite BS explanation).

One was in the lead, the other two were following, one on either side.  As I watched, I turned on my night vision to possibly get a better look.  Looking through the night vision, I confirmed the three objects and noted that they seemed to be travling either East or maybe away from earth. They were not moving really fast or anything, just moving enough that you could tell they were not stars.  They were definately not in our atmosphere, WAY UP. Anyway, the one behind and to the right of the lead one began overtaking the lead one and then they dimmed out into nothing, disappeared, whatever.  I don&apos;t know.  What was it?  You Tell Me?

I was driving east on Peters Colony Rd. in Carrollton, Tx.  My wife and I saw the craft in front of us over the city of Plano.  I dropped her off at home and got my camera, then continued to follow it east on Frankford Rd.  Another driver in a truck next to my lane was also looking at it through his windshield.  It was moving south, so I turned on Kelly Rd. (southbound) to follow.  On several occasions, I considered stopping to photograph it, but could not find a good spot.  I thought it might be a blimp, but it did not change shape as it made turns.  I had to turn again, to the west, on Trinity Mills Rd. as it moved to the west.  When I finally found a place to stop to photograph it, it was out over the D/FW airport.  I was in a resturant parking lot, where a construction crew was working that night.  The Josey Ranch house was across the street from me.  I took 7 photos (4 zoomed out, 3 zoomed in with a 210 mm lens).  I showed the photos to my best friends father who was a flight controller at Lovefield Airport in Dallas and, he could not identify the object.  About six months later (after he was transfered to D/FW Airport), he told me that another flight controller was talking with him on break and he described the same object that I had photographed.

I went outside to look at the stars. The winds had picked up to substantially. It was difficult to stand, news reports gust of 60mph+ I was looking up not thinking much of the insane wind. When what appeared to be a very large almost rectangular craft.(only slightly more narrow in the front.) It was extremely large. But its difficult to say how big because it seemed that it may have been really big but at 5000ft. (maybe the size of half a football field.) or maybe smaller at a lower altitude. I can say from my perspective if I put a small pizza box (6&quot;x6&quot;) at arms length it wouldnt have covered the entire craft. It had 4 circular dim amberish/yellow lights on each corner of the craft that appeared to emit some sort of haze. That had an amber color. It moved very slowly.

I ran inside and got my girlfriend  She ran out and got really frightened nearly in tears saying &quot;oh my god oh my god, What is that thing!?!?&quot; The winds were very intense. The craft continued on its easterly course.  It was visible until it passed over the horizon. We got a fairly good view of the bottom of the craft, being able to see that the bottom wasnt completely flat. but had several ridges running from front to back. Once the craft was out of sight we went inside because the winds were blowing fiercly. Perplexed by what happened we discussed it for a moment I then said &quot;I gotta see another one&quot; We went outside again and looked skyward. about 5 minutes after the craft had flown over. To the northeast a VERY large dome shaped deep blue flash went off. The flash was very odd. It appeared to explode then implode. It appeared to be behind some hills and a distance away. The explosion expanded in a dome fashion and took up approximately 1/20 of the sky.  We both got very scared at that time. The light was bright enough to light up the entire sky. About 20 minutes later the wind was back to being ABSOLUTELY DEAD CALM. I dont know what to think about it. One thing we did notice was many airplanes were in the area after this happened. up to 10-15 (not that it means much we arent to far from sacramento international and beale AFB) It appears others in my community saw the same thing. As we saw many people with pointing spot lights in the sky after the display. Today. I looked in the paper and the cause of the power outage was still unknown. Since then they have released an update saying that 2 - 60kv wires hit each other causing the blackout. I wonder if the 2 lines hitting, is the explosion we saw. Which occured 1 hour after the power went out(it wasnt windy when the power first went out. Not even a breeze). Or obviously the powerfailure and wind can be completely unrelated to the ufo. I know what I saw that is for sure and it wasnt an airplane, helicopter or a blimp. Although my skeptical side reminds me that I do live only a few miles from Beale AFB. This might have been some sort of US craft. I am a helicopter pilot, fixed wing airplane pilot and I star gaze regularly.

I had learned of the comet recently and knew it was bright enough to see without optical aids in a dark sky area and probably visible from most light-polluted areas.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the sky was pretty clear where I live, for it had been raining periodically for what seemed weeks and more rain was due to arrive.  There was plenty of moisture in the air causing the sky look terrible for star gazing; this I know because I am an amateur astronomer.  I grabbed a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars, knowing they would provide much aid in locating the comet under any conditions.  I had looked at a star map on the Internet earlier in the day and knew that I could easily find the right location to look because it would appear near the Pleiades star cluster.  Without using the binos I looked up and immediately saw Orion&apos;s belt and then used the bioculars to scan upwards from that point to pass what appeared to be Aldebaran, a bright star in Taurus, and then the Pleiades (which were not very apparent with the naked eye that evening).  As I moved around from Pleiades it only took a few seconds for me to notice a white, faint fuzz ball that I figured was probably the comet.  I only glanced at the object for a second before I decided to mark its position in relation to the other landmarks so I could verify that it was not just a deep sky object like a globular cluster.  I scanned upwards and located the Pleiades (very close to the supposed-comet) and then I started back down.  As I was going over some stars, something about them caught my attention.  I held the binos on an area of sky with what appeared to be quite a few remarkably similar stars close together.  As I was looking I thought I was moving the binoculars because it was a strain to look upwards at the very high angle that this part of the sky was in.  It turned out that I was moving the binoculars ever so slowly and that I was following these lights I had originally thought to be stars.  I was able to discern this because (after a mental double, no, triple-take) I saw the &apos;regular&apos; stars stationary in the background as these others moved across the sky.  Within a few seconds I counted 9 in my field of view (and recounted), it appeared to be 4 in one group and 5 in another group that were so close together they all could have been just one group of 9.  These lights appeared to me to be a whitish-yellow color; very much like a typical incandescent light bulb in color.  The shape of the light was hard for me to discern, but they could have been a small bar that was perpendicular to their direction of travel.  If it was a bar, the bar appeared to be dimmer on each end leading me to also believe they could have had brighter lights towards the middle of the bar and dimmer ones at the outer edge.  I couldn&apos;t be certain of the shape of the lights but I was absolutely certain that all 9 were identical.  And the best part of the whole story is that this &apos;formation&apos; of 9 lights did not stay in a static array.  The lights were moving amongst themselves changing the &apos;formation&apos; almost constantly.  It would be impossible for me to tell how far away they were, but if I guessed I would say if they were smaller objects they were probably about as high, and moving as fast, as a commercial jet.  If they were much larger objects I&apos;d say they were about as high, and moving as fast, as a standard orbiting satellite.  I watched them for about 2 minutes and that was long enough to see that they were getting slightly dimmer and slightly smaller as they headed in a southern direction.  The course never changed but the lights were moving among themselves almost constantly - not all of them at once, but maybe four or five being actively moving at any given time.  I put down the binos and went inside to tell my wife and that was that.  I would like to say that I&apos;ve spent hundreds of hours looking at the night sky with and without binoculars and telescopes and I also look at the sky during the day quite often.  It is incredible how many individual small balloons I&apos;ve pointed out to my wife as they traverse the sky, undoubtebly escapees from some poor child&apos;s clumsy grip.  I also have a habit of noticing aircraft and am particularly joyous when I see military craft as they fascinate me (and I&apos;m fairly good at determining what make they are).  I&apos;m very familiar with the sky and I would be very surprised if there are not at least a few more reports that mirror mine.  I knew that the closest Comet Machholz was going to get to Earth in its orbit was to occur on this particular evening.  Because of that and because of the proximity of my sighting to the comet, I am certain there were other eyes (trained ones, too) looking at that area at that time.  I guess I&apos;ll find out soon enough when I enter this site.  On another not, given my awareness of all environmental factors it would be easy for me to get a pretty close fix on the actual location (Right Ascension and Declination) of these objects by using a star map or planetarium program.  Also, I&apos;m checking the box here that says there were aircraft in the vicinity.  The sky here is very busy at this time of the evening but I didn&apos;t see any aircraft chasing the objects I saw. Clear Skies to all!", "Three lights in form of triangle in sky west of Fort Worth disappeared completely. Two were brilliant white &amp; one orange.As I was driving west-bound at approximately 9:50pm, December 11, 2004, I noticed two bright lights next to each other straight ahead that were increasingly getting brighter.  A third light was directly between and a little above to two brighter lights.  The three lights were in a formation of an acute triangle from my perspective.  At first I thought it must be a very large aircraft approaching in my direction.  However, upon further observation, there was absolutely no movement among the three lights.  The two brightest lights were brighter in magnitude than any star in the sky.  They were exactly side-by-side of each other.  The magnitudes of those two lights were even brighter than the star Sirius (which was in the sky that night to the east) and about as bright as Venus sometimes appears.  The two brightest lights had an equal magnitude.  Those two lights slowly faded to nothing over a span of about 5 to 10 seconds, again with no movement.  The dimmer third light, which had an orange tint, remained for a few seconds then faded to nothing as well.    The lights never reappeared.  The sky was clear and only slightly hazy to the north, but stars were still visible above and around the area in which the lights appeared.  I saw no clouds in the area at the time, although I had observed a few thin clouds in the sky to the east about an hour earlier that evening. I observed the sky for several minutes after the lights disappeared and never saw a reemergence of the lights.  My located was south of Fort Worth, TX and north of Crowley, TX while observing the lights to the west.  I could not tell how far away the lights were due to the lack of movement. I have never seen a sight of this nature.  When referencing the lights against the stars in the background, there was absolute zero movement among them.  Two of the lights were too bright to be stars; yet they had the stillness of stars.  Any aircraft would show evidence of movement unless they were ALL on a course DIRECTLY toward me or extremely far away.  However, the lights faded off with no movement, either in reference to the background stars, or each other.  I cannot explain or understand what they could have been.   The lights completely disappeared; a sharp contrast to the bright magnitude they had, especially the two brightest lights, just seconds before they faded to nothing without movement. Many times in the past, I have observed aircraft lights which seem to get brighter in magnitude as they approach in a path directly towards my location, only to dim as their paths change.  But their movements are always apparent in such cases and the lights never disappear.  Although I was driving at the time, the lights were directly ahead of me and I had slowed down to nearly a stop observing them because I could not get my eyes off of them.  While waiting for the lights to reappear I took note of the surrounding stars and, from my perspective, they were located in or below the region of the constellation Pegasus.  My vision was very clear in this case since I was wearing my corrective lenses at the time, which gives me a vision of 20/20.  The dimmer, background stars of the lower portion of the Pegasus constellation remained quite clear.", "2 Chevrons flying in perfect formation during lunar eclipse.I saw the same thing as this report -  Occurred : 10/27/2004 22:15 (Entered as : 10/27/2004 22:15) Reported: 10/29/2004 9:36:55 AM 09:36 Posted: 11/2/2004 Location: New York City, NY Shape: Chevron Duration:1-2 minutes Night of the lunar eclipse, we saw in the sky two gray v-shaped objects flying side-by-side, no lights, no sound. At approx. 10:15 pm the night of the lunar eclipse, my 13-yr. old son and I were observing the moon inside Central Park (near Strawberry Fields). As he was looking through binoculars at the moon, I was gazing up at the rest of the sky, marveling at the stars (which is a real pleasure when you live in the city). &quot;What the hell is that?&quot; I said out loud as soon as I saw the phenomenon. Up in the sky, about as high as an airplane would fly over Manhattan, at a 45 degree angle to the south away from the eastern-rising moon, were two separate v-shaped solid gray metallic objects flying side by side, not touching, same speed, apex pointed directly due south. There were no lights and no sound. They were clearly visible against the black, cloudless sky with the city lights &amp; moonlight reflecting their v shape and gray color. They moved together, silently, steadily across the sky toward midtown. We lost sight of them in the lights over mid-Manhattan. Whole episode couldn&apos;t have lasted longer than two minutes. -  The only differences are that I was in Woodside Queens, I was also looking at the lunar eclipse through my binoculars and I actually saw the 2 Chevron shaped objects zip (about 2 seconds) through my field of view just below the moon. They were moving in an easterly direction. They were silent and flying in perfect formation. As seen through my binoculars, they appeared to be flying at the same height as an airplane would be.I didn&apos;t really think anything of it because I wasn&apos;t sure what it is I saw until I read the report that I copied and pasted in my report. The sighting I had only lasted for 2 seconds, but after reading the report above, I knew that we had seen the same thing.", "Gleaming white smooth low flying egg over Woodbourne, Blenheim, New ZealandI was on a bus with many other members of the Takaka Citizens Band on the way to a competition in Blenheim. I noticed in the sky a fast moving aircraft flying fairly low maybe 700-1000 metres up in a NE direction about a couple of kilometres away. At first I thought it to be a Lear jet but whilst looking at it intently realised it had no wings and was the shape of an egg, gleaming white in colour and no protuberances, of any sort with it&apos;s pointed end facing the rearward direction to which it was travelling. I remarked on it to two girls who were behind me to verify what my eyes were seeing and asked &apos;does that thing have any wings?&apos; they both couldn&apos;t see any wings and then I said &apos;what the hell is it then?&apos; upon which one of them remarked &apos;it;s probably just a blimp&apos; at which they continued with their teenage girly talk thinking nothing more of this odd craft travelling at what appeared to be a supersonic speed in the sky, there was no trail or exhaust emmisions. I lived for a long time near Wigram airport in Christchurch and had seen jet fighters on maneouvres travelling through the sky at supersonic velocities, domestic passenger jets, helicopters etc. It certainly to my mind was not a blimp for it contained no undercarriage and was travelling extremely fast, at a guess around Mach 1 or slightly more? I watched it for the next minute disappear into the distance travelling in a perfectly straight line towards and beyond Blenheim&apos;s Woodbourne airport, it did seem to accelerate a little. It was a perfectly clear day and I had good reference points of the hills south of the main road. It appeared to be about the size of a Cessna aeroplane in length or perhaps a little longer.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

There was a black object above the residential area across the parking lot and across the street.  It was very large, it seemed as big as a house.  &quot;What is that?&quot; I said.  ((name deleted)) looked, but couldn&apos;t identify it either.  It made no sound, had no lights, and was turning in it&apos;s orientation very slowly and changing shape as it hovered about 500 feet above the residential area at a distance of about a half a mile.  It was impossible to make out any features, it just looked like a black lump with a flat underside.  Sacramento is littered with aircraft and I&apos;ve flown myself.  There were no lift planes, no engines, nothing that could be identified with any type of aircraft, and it was completely silent. I told ((name deleted)) to go inside and get the sheriff, but he had already left and another coworker came out to see what she was talking about.  Two men who had also been watching the object from our parking lot came drove up to us adsking, &quot;what is that thing?&quot;  At the same time on of our clients and her children came out and saw us looking up and also saw it.

As it did the bottom showed a distinct triangular shape.  ((name deleted)) went back inside but I continued to watch as it just rose ingto the stratosphere and disappeared. I felt very strange afterward.  Very confused, but very tranquil.  I think it&apos;s because it wasn&apos;t some flashy sci fi UFO thing.  I had seen it, and others with me.  On my way home I called a local news station on my cell to see if anyone had reported seeing anything at that location.  They said no but wanted to know what I saw.  I told them briefly but neither they or I pursued it further.  The tranquil, huanting feeling followed me for days, despite being teased by our coworkers.  I think it just confirmed what I believed was true, in broad daylight with one of my best friends with me as well as a bunch of strangers.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I work at Meadowood Mall and went out to my car in the west parking lot. When I got into my car and looked west, I noticed a thick, white irregular rope-like plume in the sky. It was low in the sky and I thought it might be a stunt plane spewing out a trail. It was moving west to east about a half mile away maybe, and to the north of my position. It move slowly. As it approached closer going towards the Reno airport it was obviously not the smoke coming out of a plane, but two strange objects connected by this snake-like white plume. The substance was not whispy like smoke, but thick and shiny white. This object is a little hard to describe. The best I can explain the the rope-like substance is if a can of shaving cream was shot into a basin of water and then &quot;froze&quot;. The object became more vertical, with an ovoid object on top that appeared to be moving a little back and forth as if creating the plume, with the plume in the middle and an orb-like object on the bottom. One of the dock people was dumping garbage in a big dumpster in the parking lot and I got out of my car and brought his attention to it. We both watched and commented on the sheer strangeness of the thing. The object was passing north of us now, and a couple of customers in the parking lot were noticing it too. As the thing headed east, the plume began to tighten up, and become more &quot;straight&quot;. I decided to get a couple of employees to come out after watching it for about 10 minutes. When they came outside, the object had attained a higher altitude and was sitting south of the airport close to Rattlesnake Mountain. As we all continued to watch it, an older woman stopped her car by us and asked &quot;what is that thing?&quot; We said it looked like a ufo. She smiled and drove on. By this time I was MIA at the store, so I had to go back inside. I took every opportunity to go back outside  and observe the object, which had now turned into a white orb. At 3:30 pm I took my hour lunch, and watched the object for an hour with a friend of mine who popped into work to see me. It moved west of its position south of the airport and closer to us. It appeared to change shape sometimes from an orb to a rod, then back into an orb in a blink of an eye. We saw four or five planes fly near or over the object. They appeared to be taking an interest in the object. At 4:25 or so I had to go back inside. A couple of young guys had stopped thier truck near us and asked what it was we were looking at. As I walked back to the store they were still looking at it. The next day more people at work said they had seen the strange thing also.It is now 12/11/04 and once again I went to my car around 3:15 pm to take a break and saw another white orb-like object to the north east moving south west towards my position. It moved in a slightly zig-zag way, and sometimes appeared to have a small tail. It looked like it was swimming through the air. It stopped and headed north east then, getting smaller and smaller until it was out of sight. It was a warm still day with few clouds and good visibility. Well, it is after this sighting that I decided to put my two cents in. To be fair, I have had several sightings of these things in Sparks where I live. My unit is almost directly above the flght paths of the commercial airlines. These sightings always happen on clear still days.

Obviously, the conclusion that 99% of the people will reach when they read this report is that is was &quot;fireworks&quot; for the new year. But this is a repeat occurrance and the number of individuals watching this event were all sure this was not fireworks or a jet aircraft.", "At first we thought it was lighting, when 4 rapid bursts of light went off, but they illuminated a LARGE saucer style craft- very shiney silver- with a red light shining down from the bottom.

While we waited the fire had gone out.My father came back with the local constable and they walked around the site. We didn&apos;t go over there as my father had said no. A little later on another guy came up and it was then my father came back over. We all asked questions but he didn&apos;t seem to know anything. I do know he stayed up late talking to my mother.I guess he had gone back over there while we were sleeping because the next morning he had a cylinder, kind of like the ones you draw blood with, filled with this green/blue/silver metal looking liquid. He showed us how when you shook it up the liquid vanished. After about 30 secs it reappeared. Pretty neat huh? He said it was all over the ground and hadn&apos;t seeped into the ground at all. Later on that day more people showed up. They seemed like workers from the nearby aluminium plant and they had some heavy equipment. They, or other workers stayed for a couple of days at least. The next day a helicopter showed up and some guys in white shirts and ties got out. I kinda lost interest as I was opening Christmas presents and stuff, plus we couldn&apos;t go over there or see it from the road anyway. So I&apos;m not sure how many people actaully were over there.After about 4 days everything over there was over. Me and a friend from down the road went over and the entire area, get this: Had been planted over. You could tell because the grass was a different color! There were still tracks and stuff from vehicles but if you didn&apos;t know there was a crash and fire there you would never know it.Wondering what happened to the container of liquid?

I was at the field dining facility at about 6:00AM and noticed the fog rolling into the valley that our unit was set up at.  I noted that due to the fog, that there would be no flying that morning until the fog cleared.  The sun had come up and it was daylight.  As I was watching the fog move I noticed that the fog began to part as if something was disturbing the air.  Out of the fog came a cone and top shaped object of silver color, smooth skin, and had rotating green, blue and red lights at the top and at the bottom. The craft made no jet engine noise or internal combustion engine noise whatsoever.  I did detect a slight humming noise but the craft was about 1/2 mile away and I could not hear it well.  The craft hovered slowly at about 10 to 15 KIAS (knots indicated airspeed) and did not deviate at all from its course.  It slowly passed over our training site and then moved up into the valley and then disappeared into the fog.  I looked over at the Dining Facility Manager, a senior NonCommissioned Officer of the US Army, and asked him if he just saw what I saw.  He nodded in agreement and then stated, &quot;We didnt see nothing&quot; and then turned around and walked away and never mentioned it again.  I detected no military markings, weapons, or any type of surveillance equipment.  I detected no US Flag markings or any International Flag markings or International Number designators on the skin of the aircraft at all.  It left no fuel vapor and it left no exhaust smoke as a jet engine would or an internal combustion engine would.  In the area were 18 US Army Attack Helicopters, 12 US Army Observation Helicopters and over 250 US Army personnel.  When I mentioned this incident to my squad leader he just laughed it off and told me that it was probably something from North Korea checking us out.  I explained to my squad leader that it was not a military aircraft.  He told me to forget about it.  To lend credence to this incident, I made the military my career and retired as a Senior First Sergeant/Master Sergeant of Army Aviation.  I also had for over 15 years a US Government Secret Security clearance that was renewed every 5 years after a thorough NSA background check. To me and to the dining facility manager this was something that neither of us were familiar with and knew that it was not something that could be classified as a military aircraft or top secret spy platform.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

I could see the blinking navigation lights and just hear the engine noise faintly.Just then a golden sphere moved into my field of vision moving west to east, across the normal flight paths and below the altitude of the light plane that was just disappearing.

I am a amator astronomer, and i was intrigged by the lights. I didn&apos;t knew any stellar objects in that zone of the sky, and they were too bright to be stars. I kept looking, and i saw that the lights were conected to each other by light, and saw the lights moving away in the sky (just imagine when you see a plane taking off from behind - it gets smaller and smaller) so did the lights, smaller and closer to each other, loosing intensity and becoming red - probably because of our atmosfere. The size i cannot tell exactly, but from the aceleration vs distance vs aparent size, i would say it had the size of about half a mile across the left and right lights (yes, THAT BIG).My wife witnessed everything. The shape of the lights (remember, it was a REALY dark night, so i could only see the lights, not any aircraft) were like a triangle pointing down (3 lights): 2 on top and one in the middle of the 2, but slightly below, connected by a thin light to each other (forming a V).", "Orange lights with many strobes over ocean in Surfside.December 8th from the porch of our beachhouse, our first sighting occurred at about 7:30 PM just below and to the right of the belt of the constellation Orion, probably about 20 degrees above the horizon.  There were three orange lights aligned horizontally with a fourth light directly beneath the middle light. These lights seemed spherical, and larger than Mars, which is visible. They appeared for 1-2 seconds, flashed two or three more times, and  there was haze around them.  Then small blinking white strobes were visible in a large surrounding vicinity. I initially thought that these were multiple tiny aircraft, but it became evident that no small aircraft could follow such erratic courses. It was obvious that a few grouped together, flew off to the right, and then returned. About this time i called for my daughter to come look, because she said she had seen an orange light driving home one night.  We observed a plane liftoff over the ocean from the local airport, heading North, and a few moments after it turned, the lights reappeared, but with different formations. The first to appear was a line of approximately 3 orange lights, which quickly faded, giving way to a similar shape which immediately appeared about 5 degrees below and to the left, and soon accompanied by another similar construction of lights. After these faded away, there were about five or six strobes visible to the naked eye. They had no obvious destination or pattern until some began to closely group together and gravitate towards the center of Orion. At first I thought they were afterburners, then maybe engines that had caught on fire, but realized that the configuration was wrong.  The tiny strobes made me think that it might be a prank, and that the strobes were small aircraft until we noticed the erratic pattern.", "We were doing a patrol during the night,me and my friend were on guard duty in a military camp wich was a big field in the middle of a big forest.Since was cold me and my friend went into the driving cabin of a military truck so we could see all over the camp without moving and so we could be warm.We heard a quite loud and vibrating mechanical noise and then in front of our eyes we saw it....floating just above the 10meters trees from left to right....we went silent...i said to my friend &quot;do u see what i see????&quot; He answered &quot;yes&quot;.Since nobody would have believed us we did nt mention it to anyone.The ufo was of a saucer shape with rectangular windows on the side/s  as the side of a passenger plane with the lights on in the inside....and it went floating away...great!((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

It was a very clear night, not a cloud in the sky. My backyard is on the north side of my house.  I was looking up at the stars because the sky was so clear.  As I was looking a large craft appeared over my head.  It was the shape of an equilateral triangle and was heading NNW.  About 20 degrees to my left of where I was standing.  It made no sound as it traveled.  The craft&apos;s bottom was all I could see.  The base color was black with a hint of grey.  In each of the three corners, not the tips, were three circles that gave off a very dim blue-white light.  It was just the outlines of the circles that gave off the light.  The centers of each circle were the same color as the rest of the bottom.  I remember thinking that craft was so geometrical.  The inner circles were also in an equilateral triangle configuration.  That is if the center of each circle were the points of a triangle.  It felt as if the craft was very close, 200-300 feet over my head.  But as there were no clouds to judge distance with I really don&apos;t know.  My view to the North of my house is blocked by the town-homes that are directly to the north of my house.  I estimate that I can only see the sky above 50 degrees from the ground.  The craft traveled over my head till I couldn&apos;t see it for what I estimate to be 9 seconds.  I never took my eyes off of it, I felt stunned to be watching it.  If I were to held my hand out as far as I can open palmed it would have not have fully covered my view of the triangle.  After it had passed I went inside and told my roommates what I had seen.  I grabbed a pen and paper and noted the time on my microwave:  9:32 PM. I then grabbed my video camera and went outside to see if it would return and I could capture it on film.  This time I went out the front of my house and into a field that borders my neighborhood to the South.  I did not see the object again.

It was still visible as we hit the town and cruised about a mile through it, north bound, as well as about an additional 2 miles north of town as we headed to turn east onto Hahn Rd. Allthewhile, it continued to flash a great distance out, as it stayed pretty much just a little north of our vision - indicating a great distance between us and the object or that it was moving with us, more than likely it is the former explanation.

If they were high, which is how it looked, they were huge and hypersonic.They were already past me when I spotted them, and faded from visibility within maybe five to ten seconds, after which they had covered possibly fifteen or twenty degrees of sky. There was what appeared to be a more conventionally lit aircraft (though definitely not conventional) moving in roughly the same direction, low and fast, but without noise.  Since it looked more conventional, though, all my attention was on the dim lights.  If the brighter craft was just an airplane, it was unrelated, because I think that the dim lights overtook the path of the brighter, and their paths diverged noticeably.  The brighter one disappeared first. The lights were very dim, but appeared white.

The night sky was filled with stars that night as well. I noticed points of light that were steady in speed, which I quickly realized were orbitting satelights.

It had no blinking lights but just a steady orange glow and seemed to be fairly high up and far away. As I was waiting to see fireworks in that vicinity I saw a light fall directly down from the object. It was smaller than the large light but the same color and was falling straight down for about seven or eight seconds and then would disappear. My first thought was that it could be an airplane breaking up, but the larger light continued to move slowly then eventually looked like it stopped from our viewpoint. As it was stopped we saw the same balls of light fall from it four more times, each one disappearing after about five to ten seconds. The larger object then began to move again due east and appeared to be climbing in altitude, and another light dropped from beneath it. This fell straight downward until it disappeared.

We were taking, looking out over the field, when I saw this thing coming toward us.  It was floating/bobbing along, at just about the height of the apple tree in the field, possibly 25&apos; off the ground.  It was pinkish-colred and it glowed.  It was clear, not fuzzy at all, perfectly symetrical except for a small triangular &apos;tail&apos; on the back side of it.  It came toward where we were, and I just knew, somehow, that it was going to stop when it got to us.  It did stop.  We were on the porch.  Across the driveway, just out in the field, just above the apple tree, it stopped and held perfectly still.  There was no sound at all.  I looked for features on it and there were none that I could see.  There were no doors, no windows, no sign of how someone would enter such a craft.  We both just stared at it for awhile, talking to one another about what it might be.  Then I yelled for my parents to come out and see it.  My parents and my aunt and uncle were in the living room, talking, and they had locked the front door to keep us-all from running through the house.  (We could get in through the back door but we used to like to run through the house from the back to the front and run out the front door and my aunt didn&apos;t like us to do this.) So, keeping my eyes on it, I backed up to the front door and yelled and knocked on it, but they still didn&apos;t pay attention.  Finally, in desperation, I turned around and pounded on the door with both fists and yelled my head off.  This got some results and they all appeared on the front porch, but by then the object had left.  My cousin said that when I began to really yell, it &quot;took off like a shot, like a streak of light, and disappeared&quot;.  My parents took us inside, took us into separate rooms and had us draw pictures of what we had seen.  Our pictures and descriptions were similar. I remember being frustrated with my drawing because I couldn&apos;t make it look like what I had seen.  I still can&apos;t.  The geometry of the object was so perfect that I don&apos;t have the talent to draw it, even though it is essentially a sphere with a triangle in back of it.  It appeared to be machined; there was nothing at all plasma-like or unclear about it.  There had been a rash of sightings of UFO objects around the Snoqualmie Valley around this time.  A friend of my father&apos;s, a timber faller who was on a ridge with his crew, had seen a formation of 5 silver discs pass below them.  They watched them move up the valley and out of sight.  They were astounded, to say the least.  So, UFO&apos;s were on people&apos;s minds at that time and place.  This is the reason I am writing.  I just heard Peter Davenport mention on the Jeff Rense Show, that he has often heard of people talking about UFOs before sighting them.  I have a distinct memory of walking up from the river with all of my cousins (3 boys) and talking with them about UFO&apos;s and wondering what seeing one would be like, about 5 minutes before this event.  Although we have talked about this event over the years, my memory of it and my cousin&apos;s memory are no longer the same.  The cousin I saw it with now claims that what we saw was a &quot;silvery disc-like thing&quot; that was &quot;spinning around&quot;.  Also, my older cousin, who was not with us at the time, now backs him up and also says he was there on the porch with us!  I have a particularly good long-term memory and am pretty sure I am right about ths.  Another thing I remember is my father coming into the house the next day (or so) and saying that there had been a &quot;streak of light&quot; or UFO,  spotted over Seattle at approximately the time that our object would have gotten there.It had taken off going in the direction of Seattle, which is very close to Snoqualmie and North Bend, approximately 25-30 miles. I should add that my parents and my aunt and uncle absolutely believed our story.   My sighting time and the date are my best attempt to pinpoint time and date.  It was a summer evening, it was warm and had been a sunny day, it was before we moved away from that area.  I am not positive whether it was 1952 or 1953, therefore I am not positive about my age.  The object would have been approximately 50 feet away from us, 25&apos; in the air and smallish, maybe 6&apos;in diameter.  If I had held out my hand at arm&apos;s length, it would  have just about covered it; but it was awfully close to us. Don&apos;t know if you have any interest in this, as it is unlike any other story I&apos;ve ever heard.  Seeing it changed my life because i don&apos;t &quot;think&quot; there are UFOs, I know there are.  And I know, too, that this object wasn&apos;t from a terrestrial source...it was very strange and otherworldly.

They were realy bright colors, it had two difrent colors they were red and yellow. At one point one was hovering, it look like it was runing on some kind of gas becouse it had very bright flames coming from the bottom of it. I could&apos;t tell if was flames or not. When they were flying they were flying in a {v} shape. Well that&apos;s what my friend and I seen.", "two bright beams of light in the eastern skyI was in my driveway watching my young son and a few of the other neighborhood kids playing kickball in the street. One of the children pointed to the sky and asked me what those lights were. I looked up and saw what appeared to be two helicopter spotlights hovering / hanging motionless at slightly different altitudes in the eastern sky well above the tree line on the horizon. The light on the left was higher than the one on the right and there wasn&apos;t any noise coming from them. It became apparent to me shortly thereafter that these &quot;things&quot; were not helicopters. As I observed them, the light on the left began to dim and I noticed a shallow beam of light emenating from it. The faint beam of light broadened and narrowed as it swept slowly from left to right. This went on for maybe 10 seconds as the light to the right began to do the same thing. The dimming light on the left (towards the north) began to close in on itself slowly, sort of like the shutter on a camera, wrapping itself in a shroud of fog as it vanished. The second light, within seconds thereafter, did the same thing. Neither object moved up or down or side to side during this event. They simply vanished in the same position they were in initially. The entire event lasted approximately 3 to 5 minutes.", "I was sitting on my front porch and noticed a bright light in the distance over the trees. I mentioned it to my fiance and he said it was an airplane. I said it couldn&apos;t be an airplane because I had been watching it for a few minutes and a plane would have been over us by then.  As we watched, the light got brighter and, when the craft got close, we knew it was a UFO.  The craft was only about 100 feet over our heads. We called three more family members outside at this point for them to witness what we were seeing.  The craft was HUGE, black and triangular shaped with some lights on the bottom.  The craft made a very low, faint humming noise.  We watched it go over our house.  As it passed overhead, some helicopters and small planes were following it. Five of us witnessed this sighting. We didn&apos;t discuss this until some years later, when we thought how strange it was that, on a warm Sunday evening, on our usually busy street, we were the only ones out to see this amazing thing.  We wonder now if we were maybe &quot;taken&quot; and the memories were erased from our minds. Since then, my son has had sightings where we now live in West Virginia.  After our Connecticut sighting there was no mention in the newspapers or TV news of this craft having been seen.  It was as if the craft was there for us to see and only us.  This sighting occured at about the same time as the sightings in New York state.  We are still profoundly affected by this experience.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))", "About 7:15pm in the North..A bright bluegreen light very large moved slow across the sky..Moveing NE to NW...Then Moved NW to NE very fast and disapeared...Very large..((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Coming over the trees was an elongated triangular shaped &quot;thing.&quot;  It was hovering over the east end of the small farm pond I was fishing.  It moved over the frozen water and lowered slowly.  It sat motionless without a sound for a minute or two.  As it rose silently, &quot;steam&quot; rose from the lake.  The object slipped quietly past the trees and floated out of sight (my line of sight was obscured by trees).  We used our cell phone and called the local sherriff, but there was no answer, as our cell phones had both gone dead.  This was strange.  Also, our battery operated fish locator (Vexilar) was also affected, we believe.  The area of the pond where the object hovered was melted into about 2 inches.", "Two unidentified objects flying in left echelon formation over Kansas City, MissouriOn this night, I had been enjoying the crisp, clear star lit night in my backyard hot tub relaxing after a long workday. I had been observing the starry night for about 20 minutes prior to the occurrence. The air temperature was about 25 degrees with a moderate wind from out of the norwest, approximately 10 to 15 kts. I had been observing several of the star formations during this time frame in the northern sky when a movement in the sky caught my attention. I had observed several commercial airline departures from Kansas City Intl Airport, located about 45 miles northwest of my locations prior to this occurrence. When my attention was drawn to the subject craft, I thought that it was the only one. I was surprised to see another one following the first craft in a left echelon formation about 8 seconds later. Both of the craft were completely blacked out, that is running without standard FAA lighting required on all aircraft flown with regulated airspace of the contiguous United States, at an approximated altitude of below 10,000 feet. The observed craft were of a flat black surface color, with a solid structure(as they blocked out the stars) as they passed just to the west of my location. I thought to myself, (a veteran pilot with over 10,000 flight hours, in commercial multi-engine fixed wing and rotor wing aircraft with instrument ratings). What the heck are those craft flying with any markings or light designations in regulated airspace! Then it occurred to me that maybe these were stealth bombers on maneuvers and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would know about it.  The military is even required to have permission to cross active airspace utilizing a discrete transponder code as to avoid other aircraft operating in the area. The two craft that I observed came from the north at an altitude I estimated as being below 10,000 feet above ground level and a speed of that required for jet aircraft operating at an altutude of below 10,000 ft agl.  Somewhere between 200 and 250 kts. This I estimated based upon how long I observed them for the distance traveled, having an intimate knowledge of the area from having flown in it for many years. As the two craft passed from my view of them and within about one minute of their passing, I observed a commercial jet aircraft displaying the standard FAA required lighting, having departed the Kansas City Intl airport coming from the northwest, climbing on a southeasterly heading. The commercial jet passed through the track of the two craft at approximately the same altitude I had observed them flying, on their nearly due south track.  The two craft were approximately 3 times the size of the commercial airliner with a slight V or rounded front fuselage and a flat bottom solid structure. As a veteran pilot, I did not jump to any conclusions as to what the craft were, but was more concerned that they were operating in controlled airspace and I wanted to know more about their mission.  I called a friend of mine on Tuesday who works with the FAA ARTCC facility located in Olathe, Kansas to ascertain if he could help me identify who or what these craft were and if they had any radar signature or transponder data readouts. The FAA approach control facility supervisor responded to my call on wednesday AM and I relayed my observations to him. He indicated that he would reconstgruct the occurrence based upon my observations and let me know if they can identify the subject craft. He also indicated that I should contact the National UFO reporting center and provide them with my observations. My credentials include military service with the US Coast Guard from 1967 to 1973 as a communications specialist E-5. US government service with the Natl Trans Safety Board (NTSB) as a senior Air Safety Investigator from 1983 to 1990. As a commercial pilot from 1972 to present, an expert witness, aviation safety consultant from 1990 to 1996 and as a corporate security specialist from 1997 to present. One further note that I failed to mention is that the two craft during the track to the south made no noise, but moved silently on their flight. The commercial jet aircraft was making it&apos;s usual noise from it&apos;s jet engines as I heard it approaching from the northwest with the time frame I observed it.

I will mail a pencil rendering of my observation to you in order for you to have a clearer picture of what I observed.

PD))", "Two nocturnal lights almost intersect - one becomes ten times brighter.I arrived home at 18:05 and noticed an unusual amount of air traffic in the night sky. There were five objects moving in different directions. Three of the objects were clearly aircraft, with each having multiple red and white lights (one or two blinking on each object). However, a fourth object - a single white, non-blinking light, which appeared twice as bright as the aircraft lights, and was at a higher altitude - moved from west to east in a straight line. (From time to time, it seemed to zig-zag slightly, and this may have been an atmospheric effect, but I did not see this effect when watching the other four objects.)  As the west/east light entered the eastern part of the sky, a fifth object - a smaller, non-blinking white light - moved south to north through the eastern sky in a straight line, on a path and at a speed where it would meet the west/east light. Before this could happen, however, this fifth, south/north light grew very bright (about ten times brighter) and then quickly faded out. The west/east light, after crossing the point where it would have met the south/north light, also faded out. I thought clouds could account for these disappearances, but I immediately checked local and regional radar at Wunderground.com, and the skies were what they appeared to be: &quot;Clouds: clear. Visibility: 10 miles.&quot;  I also thought that the steady brightness of the west/east and south/north lights could be fuselage reflections of the sun - but sunset was one hour and thirteen minutes earlier, at 16:42. Both objects, though higher in altitude than the three aircraft, were much lower in altitude than satellites I have watched from the same location.", "Bridlington, EnglandI was in my room talking to my boyfriend on the phone when i heard a noise that sounded VERY close. It sounded as if it was down my street kind of the noise a plane would make i guess but more of a consistent humming noise it was very loud and seemed to keep getting louder and louder then stopping completely then about 2minutes later it would return. I guess I am the only witness i put 2 because my boyfriend could hear the sound on the phone. I was really quite scared at this time it didnt cross my mind that it would be a UFO or anything i was thinking more like a helpicopter crash landing at first but then when it stopped and came back again (it repeated this cycle about 3 or 4 times, i had no idea what it could be and i didnt dare look. It got quieter and seemed to be further away so i finally got the courage to go look out the window and i saw a really bright flash of light so i backed up from the window and ran out the room woke my parents up and told them what had happened, they thought i had been dreaming because i looked shocked as if id just has a nightmare. My boyfriend was still on the phone because id just left it on my bed while i looked and he said he had heard a high pitched machine like noise then heard me open my bedroom door so must have been when i ran out. When my parents went to check nothing was there i spent the rest of the night downstairs watching tv and havent heard/seen anything since.

I was still in my hometown of Penge in London at around 8:30 give or take a few minutes. I was in the front seat and looked up out of the windscreen to see a hovering cigar shaped object just above the clouds. When I looked a bit closer it appeared to be glowing a white light of some sort.  It seemed to be just hovering as opposed to moving but I didn&apos;t see it for very long because the clouds covered it up, I must have seen it for about 4-7 seconds. I am a schoolboy of 9 years old and although I was not scared or shocked by the sighting I am very interested to found out what this could have been and if there were any other sightings in the area.", "On November 15, 2004, in Placerville, California, My daughter and I had both gone to bed. Right when I was just about to fall asleep I heard a large noise that was accompanied by a great hum. It felt as if everything around me was humming also, even our home. This hum was even inside of me like a great vibration. I heard my 13-year-old daughter scream and I ran into her room. Her light was off and she was sitting up in bed with the blinds open and said that something flew by her window with a long white light following it that caused the whole sky in front of her to turn white. It then flew up into the sky and disappeared. She said, it made everything in the sky white. I looked outside and only got to see the stars and nothing else. I then asked her a few more questions and from that, she said that she felt a hum in her body and sat up, which is when she saw the &quot;big thing&quot; fly by and the white light. Our neighbors felt the hummmmm but didn&apos;t see the lights because their apartment sits in front of the building and not in the back like ours.

Suddenly I noticed an oval shaped set of reddish, ethereal lights approaching from the southwest just above the treeline about 100 yards from me. There was no sound associated with this low, slow moving multiple red light object.  The woods behind my house are my property in all directions for at least a mile and there are no buildings on the property except my home. Both dogs began to bark like mad and started running toward where the light was descending. My nearest neighbor lives 3/4 of a mile away and I have almost no light intereference because Stone Ridge is rural.  In fact, I live only 8 miles from where Whitley Streiber used to have his upstate cabin (Accord, NY).  In fact, I spoke on the phone with Mr. Streiber several years ago and after talking for about an hour he confirmed that I was witnessing multiple viewings of UFO&apos;s.  Anyway, the dogs gave some chase towards the reddish object which consisted of 6 or 7 lights which I could not determine if they were separate from each other because of the strange &quot;ethereal&quot; glow the emitted They did move in complete unison though.  The glow was confusing.  The lights lowered all the into the woods (definitely on my property) and then I couldn&apos;t see them.  Meanwhile I was describing to my friend on the phone exactly what I was seeing because I couldn&apos;t believe it. I lost sight of the lights once they dipped into the woods and the dogs relaxed their barking and I wasn&apos;t about to go into the woods to go see for myself what it was because it was too weird.  I kept talking to my friend about it and I described it to her and kept talking about  it when about 6 or 7 minutes later (maybe less time went by but not too much) the exact same silent 6 or 7 weird glowing reddish hazy orbs all lifted up again to just above the tree level and floated off the way it came.  When it lifted up the dogs started going berserk again but they stopped short of chasing into the woods too.  When I went back into the house my husband wanted to know what on earth had made the dogs make so much noise barking and I told him what had happened and he told me that I had just imagine the lights.  Well, I didn&apos;t imagine them.  It&apos;s the 3rd time I&apos;ve seen similar lights while walking my dogs in our back field but this was the only time they descended and then ascended again.  I went into the woods the next day when it was light out (obviously) and checked around to see if I could see anything unusual on the ground but I found nothing and my woods are pretty remote and I was kind of freaked out, even in the daytime with the dogs (who didn&apos;t seem to sniff at anything overly either).  So, I got out of there fairly fast because I&apos;ve heard that some people have seen &quot;greys&quot; in broad daylight in Stone Ridge and I think I&apos;d be scared to death if I saw something in daylight that I couldn&apos;t expain.   In closing I just wish to say that if I have ever been abducted I have no memory of it but I believe that my younger son may have been.  He&apos;s too young to talk to about it.  It scares me though.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

I pulled over to the side of the road, afraid that I might lose sight of the object and rolled down my car window.  The object had been pulsing slowly brighter then dimmer at a slow but steady pace during my observation of it and seconds after I stopped it faded into the clouds.

The object then turned right (my left) and traveled directly over my car. There were the two bright white lights in the front, one smaller white light in the back, and two small red lights in the center. The object appeared to be triangular in shape. There were no strobing lights and no sound that I could detect. This happened at 18:40.When I returned home, I called my daughter and she reported seeing what sounds like the same object on her way home.

My husband went outside with the dog &amp; saw a craft in the near distance. There were several lights that shot out of it in a loop form &amp; then they were gone. He came inside to get me, by the time we got back out there it was VERY strange. This is around 3AM &amp; we saw the lights that shot out just as they returned &amp; seemed to go back in the ship. They moved VERY fast. The clouds slowly rolled back &amp; opened up as the large craft came closer passing over Casey&apos;s. The large craft had no lights at all, it was totally dark, like blacker than black. The sky was a deep red (like a sunset)but the clouds themselves were stilldark. The craft seemed to stop &amp; hover over the area on the other side of 58 from SkyVue (at that time it was all field there, now there is a duplex/4 plex housing). It came in so slow, you would have thought it was going to fall out of the sky. It did make a very slight sound while hovering, but I can&apos;t really describe it. It wasn&apos;t a hum. but it was very quiet &amp; ONLY made noise while it hovered. We just stood there watching, didn&apos;t really say anthing to each other, I think our brains didn&apos;t know what to think. But it sure wasn&apos;t the way we would have ever expected to react. It was almost like we were frozen in that moment of time. When the craft left, it moved as slowly as it did comming in, traveling E-NE. And the clouds seemed to roll back into place behind it returning to a normal 3AM night sky darkness. As it floated off (it went so slow it was like what I would expect out of a floating object, not a flying one) it went right over 58. But as soon as it was behind our house &amp; out of our view, we silently &amp; slowly walked back into the house, sat down &amp; basically just sat there saying nothing, as if we weren&apos;t supposed to talk about it or just didn&apos;t know what to say maybe. Which to this day is very strange for us, seeing a UFO is something we would have expected to talk about between ourselves for years, until this actual sighting occured. After this sighting, I spent a couple weeks being unable to sleep. I would fall asleep ok, but every night around the same time of the sighting, I would be woke up by a VERY bright white light through the bedroom window. And when I awoke, it was like I had been awake for hours &amp; had just sat up, vs. wakeing up. My husband is retired military, we know what a stealth is &amp; this WASN&apos;T a stealth. Yes the military base was still open back then, but this WASN&apos;T from there &amp; they had no air traffic during this night. And the lights that came out of it &amp; went back in were a combo of changing colors. But we are sure they were ships too, because the moved with purpose. We never talked about it much, every time we started to we felt as if we were in a extreamly mellow state....sorry very hard to explain the feeling. Many years later they came out with Independence Day with Will Smith. The way the clouds roll back in the movie is exactly what we saw...we instantly looked at each other in disbelief. But still said nothing, it&apos;s like some major secret to us but we don&apos;t know why. This is the first we have said of this night &amp; I still feel like I&apos;m saying something I shouldn&apos;t. But typing feels different than speaking about it. If anyone else has possibly seen this that night we would like to know...PLEASE post it we beg of you. The town just seemed so dead that night.

It was 11:55pm (23:55) and we were getting ready to countdown the New Year. I was behind a bar making drinks when my friend said, &quot;You have to look at this&quot;.  So I got out of the bar area in his garage and everyone at the party in the backyard was looking up at the sky and trying to figure out what these 2 very bright dots were. They mentioned one was moving pretty fast and then just stopped.  When I went outside the 2 bright dots in the sky were just hovering in the same place.  I couldn&apos;t hear any sound from them.  They looked like a Roman Candle (firework that shots red fireballs) but very hi in the sky and were not moving.  Some of the girls at the party started to get freaked out because no one could make out what the bright lights were.  I first thought they could have been a helicopter but they seemed to be 5 times higher then any helicopter I have ever seen.  One of the lights seemed to blink a little but then stopped. I am very skeptical about UFO&apos;s and I started making a few jokes like, &quot;HOLY SH!T, its like Independence Day (Movie) and the aliens are going to blow us up!&quot;  After a couple minute, I actually started to get kind of weird about the situation because I couldn&apos;t think what the lights could have been.  About 1 minute before midnight, one of the lights slowly faded out and all of a sudden was gone.  Right at midnight the 2nd light disappeared.  It was very strange. This morning I woke up and went to www.signonsadiego.com to see if there might have been a story about it.  I typed in the search &apos;2 red lights in the sky&apos; and nothing came up.  So I did the same on yahoo.com and came across a news story from 2002 that started freaking me out a bit because it sounded kind of like our experience.  They had a link to this website and I noticed it had a &apos;report sighting&apos; so I thought I would add my comments.  I would have never known how to report this weird event to anyone except word of mouth to my friends.  Is there any way you could somehow look into this event?  I would love to see what it could have been.  I could round up most of the people at the party if needed.  I tried to take a photo from my cell phone but you can barely make out the 2 dots in the photo.  I am not sure if anyone else took a photo.", "Controlled Explosion had been suggested as a way to protect against abduction.I did not see their craft but at approximately 9PM on the date above ( this is approximate as I am going back in time but could probably find a more specific date- as I have a very clear recollection of events that took place around the time it occurred) I was visited by a number of entities. There was a beam of light that surrounded me, a glowing white light.Several entities appeared. at the time I could not see them but could hear them.This was experienced consciously in my place of  work. ( I work for a private wealth management firm in downtown Toronto) From that point on til the present day they have performed various types of experiements and performed surgery on me. For a great of time I believed this was some sort of negative spiritual experience as I could not see any entities. There was an entity that seemed to attach itself to my head on the right side. He continued to communicate with me. He made various claims about his purpose but the main one was that I was to have a baby. I asked the entity to leave and tried various techniques to get rid of it, white light techniques, prayer. At this point the entity seemed to have the ability to constict blood flow and/or ability to breathe in some way. I was in a great deal of pain as a result of their various experiments. At this point, there were several other entities that arrived, they came into my apartment. They had the appearance of reptilians. They performed various experiments on me and would not leave. Later other groups arrived, the had the appearance of the praying mantis type aliens and there appeared to be Zeta Reticuli involved as well. The following claims have been made, they are here to crack the binary code, they are here to create &quot;free energy&quot; they are spies here to control the group mind of North America. They are here to cross bred with humans and my ovum were being used for this purpose. I need help from someone who knows how to stop them and/ protect oneself. I have a great deal of information on how to protect oneself but would like to have as many UFO researchers/ asrophysicists help and/or novice researchers help as possible. I have physical proof of my experience and have been completely MRI&apos;d and x-rayed as recommended by Dr Roger Leir&gt; An annomely was found on both &quot;pinkies&quot; it has not yet been removed. I believe there may be other implants metal and/or electromagnetic in nature. I was guven the information that they were moving me at the &quot;speed of light&quot; or in some way moving/vibrating my cells at a different speed/frequency than that of the Earth. 2 things are important here. They apparently arrive on Earth through &quot;wormholes&quot; some sort of manipulation of space/ molecular structure of space. There is information about this on the website, ET medical.com. Apparently this is also the way they are able to make themselves invisible to us. Also, my understanding is that they are able to perform surgery on us by again manipulating space/time and velocity. Again good information on this is in Adrian Dvirs book- see Et medical medical.com. After the MRIs I decided to head as far to magnetic North as I could to see what would happen. Agian I was given the information that this might disrupt the magnet, if there was one, in my body. As I approached North Bay/ Ontario on my way to Moosonee, Ontario, by train, I felt a thud and my  body seemed to increase in mass. Quite literally various parts of my body got bigger closer to the weight I had been prior to the experience. The information I have been given is that the electromagnetic energy they were using to move me at an increased velocity would not completely function in areas of &quot;rare earth&quot;. Apparently these rare earth minerals are minerals that do not exist on other planets. Many of them are radioactive. I have also been given the information that the secret to protecting the earth and/or myself lies in being able to control the electromagnetic energy they use to arrive here and in somehow using these rare earth minerals. Not completley sure how but again, the aliens were not able to move me at the speed of light in areas of apparent rare eart. I have been given the information that creating a controlled explosion and/ or using these rare earth minerals in that explosion would in some way disrupt their force field. It seems the entities were able to create some sort of energetic field arounf me at various times referred to as a parabola or an ellipsis. There are apparently several implants in body that I believe would be detected by an MRI and / or X-ray in these &quot;rare earth&quot; areas. I need help from an Astrophysicist and/ or someone who knows how to create a controlled explosion. Also, if anyone knows a way electromagnetic and/ or radiactive devices may be detectable, particularly in Toronto Canada. Also a physicist/ dr etc. this would be most helpful. I have various physical anomalies as a result of this experience. My colon is no longer in the same place as it was previously, and is no longer functioning in the same way that it had been prior to this experience. I have also been given the information that there is a spaceship above my place of work- Canada Trust Tower 161 Bay St and have seen an entity- grey about 31/2 feet tall, I did not see its face but believe it may be the commander of the mission. I have also seen entities that appear to be Zetas and Reptilians. I would welcome communication and or help from anyone", "Triangular 3-light formation with &quot;dimmer switch&quot;Hello, I am another witness of the Saturday, Nov. 11, 9:55 p.m. triangular light siting west of Van Alstyne.  The other report pretty much sums it up, I was with those guys so this report is really a confirmation or cross-refernece if you will. I would like to add that at least one of the lights had a pasty light green tint.  There position did not change much, only what appeared to be very slight movement, changes in tint and intensity.  When the lights faded, it was as if they were turned out via a dimmer switch.  It seems that the sky between the lights was darker, thus indicating a large triangular vehicle.  It appeared that if it were a single vehicle, it would be quite large, about 400 meters across.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; triplet of satellites, that orbit in formation.  PD))", "22 orange-yellow UFOs, flying low, fast and silently east to south over Texas A&amp;M University 4 randomly moving followed by 18 in a lineDecember 12, Sunday 2004, 10:15 CST. My husband and I stepped out for a cigarette and he drew my attention to a formation of 4 objects moving rapidly and silently across the sky over the east side of our building, moving south.  The objects appeared in a diamond formation and at first glance I thought it might have been a large aircraft moving sideways.  The objects then began to circle randomly around each other (2 objects rotated clockwise while 2 others rotated alternate directions around the these) while maintaining course and speed south.  They moved at a steady speed from the time that we saw them from the time they disappeared over the trees on the south side of our complex. 45 seconds to a minute later, while moving around to the other side of our complex, we saw a line of 18 objects in a half V formation, in the same direction (South) as the previous 4.  The objects looked identical in shape, color, and speed as the first 4, but they remained in formation until out of sight well over the far side of the Texas A&amp;M University campus, which we can see from our parking lot.  Again, they flew anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand feet above the ground, with absolutely no noise.  They flew faster than birds and as fast if not faster than a jet airplane.  The objects were in a very very tight formation [nearly touching each other].", "The lights followed alongside the carMy mom just introduced me to this web site yesterday and I wanted to post my experience because it was so strange. It was near the end of July in 1996, Myself (20yrs old) and 3 friends (ages 17-19)were driving from Minneapolis to Winona in the middle of the night. We wanted to be in Winona at the scenic overlook by sunrise. I had made this trip one other time before. I was driving an old 2 door Ford Escort, and my friend (who is now my husband) was in the passenger seat, and another couple were in the back seat. It was sometime between 1 am and 3 am, (not sure of exact time) it was a clear night, not very cloudy at all, we were the only car on the road and we hadn&apos;t seen another car for about 30 minutes, the other couple with us had fallen asleep in the car. All of a sudden without any warning there were 9 large, bright, flashing lights out my driverside window, now my friend on the passenger side only saw one of the lights out the windshield (in the top corner on the driverside). The lights were in three rows of three, and the rows were staggered (will email drawing)The best way to describe the lights is like a set of stadium lights, like at a baseball field, when they turn on you can here the flash as the electricity runs to the bulbs. Thats how all 9 lights looked, and they all flashed at the same time, but not in a pattern just random. The lights lit up the other lane on the highway and the ditch. There was nothing but open field in this area, and the lights were very bright I was yelling at my friend &quot;What is that, Do you see that&quot; and he just staired out the windshield and was absolutely quite through this, and the two people sleeping in the back seat didn&apos;t wake up as I was yelling at my friend to answer me. Now, i&apos;m not saying there was something wrong with him he was just shocked at what we were seeing and didn&apos;t know how to respond to me. I was driving about 60 mph when these lights appeared, and they kept pace with the car for at least 30-40 seconds, they remained out my driverside window, flashing, they didn&apos;t change color but I would say they had some color. I don&apos;t know if the lights had color or if it was my eyes messing with me, it was like stairing at the sun, you get some spects of color in your view when you look away. They were very bright white just like stadium lights. I would say the bottom row of lights were 10 feet or so above the ground, just on the other side of the ditch. I had to look up out of the window to see the top row. I asked my friend if I should stop the car, I got no response, I kept yelling what the ---- is that, I was really freaked out. I deceided to keep driving, still a speed of about 60-65 mph, and then the lights drifted just behind my window, and I looked back and they were just out the little side window in the rear for about 2-3 seconds, and then they disapeared just like that. No sound, no trails of light, nothing. It was like someone just flipped off the light switch. Then my friend looked at me and said &quot;that was crazy&quot; and then my other two friends woke up and we told them what happened and they didn&apos;t believe us of course. I don&apos;t know what it was that I saw, all I know is the lights were not there before, I didn&apos;t see the road lit up or anything and then WAM there they are, and the fact that they stayed with the car while I was driving! Stationary lights that are on a pole or something don&apos;t keep up with a car going 60, and they lit up the road so much I would have seen it on approach. Then to just disapear, it was crazy. The other weird thing was that my two friends in the back could sleep through me yelling. I just don&apos;t get it. We told everyone we knew about it when we got back and only a few believed us. Now, we were all older teens at the time but credible people, we weren&apos;t drinking or anything the night this happened. I tried for a long time to find a reasonable explination, but I can&apos;t. I could say that the lights themselves could have been some kind of stadium lights because they looked just like that, but I can&apos;t explain why they would have been in the middle of no where and how they would have turned on all of a sudden and then traveled alongside the car. And then GONE just like that. If someone has a suggestion of what it might have been please share it with me, I am open to hear anything that might explain it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "As I was driving aprox. 10:00, I saw a white inverted rectangle in the overcast sky being intersepted by two aircraft (contrails).I was driving North bound on I-465, headed in a SE direction according to my compass in my van. At about mile marker 25 I noticed a tall rectangle in the overcast sky. The sky was typical gray-blue, as commonly seen here in the winter. I think this is why I noticed this shape, it was just up there in the sky to my right. It was white in color, rectangle in shape with a glow around it. Traffic was light to moderate at the time so I was able to look around in the sky and to my left, about North, I saw two contrails. So now I am watching this shape to my right and the contrails which are closing in on the shape on my left. I kept comparing the two situations and the two contrails were headed right for the shape. As the contrails got close to the shape they seem to split into seperate directions around the shape. The shape never seemed to move, change in appearance, it just floated there. At this point I went past the point to see any more activity. I have been around aircraft all my life. My father was in the Air National Guard and my uncle was a high ranking officer in the Air Force. I also have worked for Boeing in WA. In the report I refer to contrails moving to intercept the shape because I never saw what these aircraft were.", "Light with erratic flight patternMy boyfriend and I had taken a trip down to Fortescue beach, which is very quiet during the winter months.  At night you can see the lights of Dover Airforce Base across the Delaware Bay.  We were just standing on the beach talking and as I always do I was looking up.  The sky seemed to be very active with planes, and I am always on the lookout, epecially on Fortescue beach, perhaps to just to catch a glimpse of a low flying plane heading in or out of DAB.  We were on the beach or sitting nearby from about 6:30 until 7:30PM  It was already dark. My boyfriend is a skeptic and has never in his 51 years seen anything that he could call a UFO. The temperature was about 40 degrees with no wind.  There were some low altitude patchy clouds that seem to be making their way out as I was seeing more and more stars.  There was a slight amount of haziness to the atmosphere, perhaps later in the evening it would turn foggy, but Dover was still visable. I was watching one light that was about 30 degrees up from the horizon, waiting for it to turn enough or for it to get closer so that I could see the strobe lights blinking and confirm that it was indeed an airplane.  It was white, perhaps a slightly yellow color.  It was out over the water, apparently and about 20 degrees right of the last row of visible lights at Dover.  I was facing for the most part West, perhaps slightly South.  I watched the light move at a what seemed a normal speed for a plane, moving &quot;right.&quot;  I noticed what seemed like some irregularity in it&apos;s speed as it continued moving to the right.  It seemed to slow and speed up slightly, but it was not very obvious.  It then shot up and to the right slightly and very quickly at about a 70 degree angle of accent and about five degrees up.  I then alerted my boyfriend who had been looking elsewhere, never taking my eyes off of it.  We both then saw it move right and slightly up a few more degrees more quickly than the first time I had seen it, but it&apos;s erractic speed was more apparent.  It then shot down at about a 45 degree angle with the erractic speed still visible, even though it was moving quickly, only going a few more degrees and then it turned a sharp &quot;v&quot; turn, maybe 15 degrees from being directly vertical and much more quickly than before, shot up, got about ten degrees and disappeared apparently into the low lying clouds.  We looked for it, but it was gone.  We watched the sky for half an hour more but never saw anything else like it. I had a similar experience about a year ago, listed on this website, in Millville, New Jersey, which is about ten miles away. About fifteen minutes later we had gotten in the car to get warm and were still watching the sky.  We saw coming at us another light, but saw the strobe lights, from the same area of the sky as the unexplained light.  We watched it for less than a minute and we could tell it was headed straight for us, guessing I would say a few thousand feet up.  I watched the white part of the light &quot;turn&quot; and get very bright as if a helicopter had made a turn to go right at us.  But it was still too far out to hear the engine.  The light &quot;turned on a dime&quot; and we both agreed at that point that it had to be a chopper.  It headed over us within a minute, seemed to be roughly a thousand feet up or more, and we could hear the engine of what sounded like a prop plane, and not a helicopter.  I&apos;m not an expert on planes, but we both got the feeling that we were being checked out, and just assumed that it would be a helicopter, epecially the way it appeared to make a turn directly toward us without having to &quot;circle around&quot; like a plane. Perhaps the light &quot;turning to face us&quot; makes sense to others who will read this. There are several houses near the beach but there were only two homes that appeared to be occupied with full time residents.  The road along the beach was otherwise empty of cars. We have discussed making further observations at this location and I will further document any occurances here.", "Blacked out craft (2) headed south crossing in controlled airspace in Blue Springs area.On this night I have been enjoying the crisp, clear star lit night in my backyard hottub, relaxing aftera long workday.  I had been observing the starry night for about 20 minutes prior to the occurrence.  The air termperature was about 25 degrees with a moderate wind from out of the northwest at about 10 to 15 kts. I had been observing several of the star formations in the northern sky when a movement in the sky caught my attention. I had been observing several commercial airline departures from the Kansas City International Airport, KCI, located about 45 nautical miles northwest of my location prior to the occurrence. When my attention was drawn to the subject craft, I thought that it was the only one. I was surprized to see another one following the first in a left echelon flight formation about 5 seconds later. Both craft were blacked out, ie, no visible lighting as required by FAA flight regulations. Ambient light from the surface delineated the crafts surface being that of a flat black and distinguishable from that of the night sky. The structure was solid as it blocked out the stars as they passed just west of my location. A calculated lat/long was made, being @lat 39deg,00&apos;-17&quot;, long:94deg,17&apos;-02&quot;.  I thought to myself, a veteran pilot with over 10,000 flight hours in numerous aircraft and helicopters, what the heck are those carft flying without any markings (lights) in controlled airspace. Then it occurred to me that maybe these were stealth bombers on maneuvers and the Federal Aviation Admin (FAA) would know about it. It should be noted that even the military are required to have permission to cross active airspace utilizing discrete transponder codes as to avoid other air traffic operating in the controlled space. The two craft were observed to be flying on a north to south heading, at an altitude of below 10,000 feet agl and at a speed of between 200 and 250 knots. This speed I estimated based upon how long my observation was for the distance traveled. As a veteran pilot, and as a former aircraft accident investigator, I was concerned with the safety of other aircraft in the area, as these two craft could not be seen by commercial or other air traffic operating in the same area. I observed a commercial jet pass through at the same estimated altitude less than a minute behind the two craft, on a southeast heading of about 120 degrees. I estimated the two craft to be about 3 times the size of the commercial airliner with a shape of a horseshoe front fuselage, rounded underneath and with a smooth underside. An area of distortion just aft of this viewable side was present, precluding me from viewing the complete structure of the craft. As a veteran pilot, I did not jump to any conclusions as to what the craft were, but was more concerned that they were operating in controlled airspace and I wanted to know more about their mission.  On Tuesday AM, I contacted a friend of mine wht the FAA ARTCC facility in Olathe, KS to ascertain if he could help me identify who or what these craft were and if they had any radar signatures or transponder data. An FAA approach control facility supervisor responded to my call on Wednesday AM and I relayed my observations.  He indicated that he would attempt to reconstruct the occurrence based upon my observations and let me know if they could identify the subject craft.  To this date, I&apos;ve had no response from the FAA.  Maybe a FOIA request is necessary to ascertain the nature of this event. One further note, during the observation of the two craft, I did not hear any noise eminating from them, but them moved silently on their flight. On the other hand, the commercial jet aircraft I observed crossing their track behind them made it&apos;s distinctive noise signature from the engines as I heard it approaching from the northwest and as it flew over my location.((NUFORC Note:  Second, more detailed, report from same witness, who has impressive credentials in the field of aviation.  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and we find him to be an exceptionally skilled, and credible, witness.  PD))", "At approximately 0515 hrs. on the 11 of Feb. while traveling south on the 101 coming up Thomas Road in the west valley I observe what at first I figured was a airliner in the pattern to land at Sky Harbor it was traveling west to east it had just come thru the cloud layer (it was raining at the time). What I figured was landing lights looked strange, the light where a dull white in color where pointing down or out not forward and they where in a perfect triangle shape and there was no other marker or formation lights on this object. This sighting only lasted about 5 seconds and then it went back into the clouds. I been thinking about this all day and I figure this was no conventional aircraft because when normal aircraft are on approach to land in the rain you can usually make out the beams of landing light pointing forward in the rain, this object lights didn&apos;t do that. I have a background in aviation and have spend 20 years in the military working on F-15 and F-16 aircraft I&apos;ve watch many night time landings in the rain and this was completely different.", "Grandma&apos;s UFOIt one evening while my grandmother was taking her dog for a walk, she had heard a strange noise outside and she couldn&apos;t figure what it was? She had happened to looked up into the sky; and there it was! She told me she had seen a strange oval shape object up into the sky. The oval shaped object had stood there for about 20min. then it started to headed out towards the West, and 15 minutes later, the object had headed towards back to my her house flying very low! Low enough where we can see it more up close. It made another sound that went &quot;Bloop Bloop Bloop Bloop Bloop&quot;. She had notice that this oval shaped object was heading Northeast, My Grandma had told me that this object started heading towards over by the Glenview Air Naval Airbase. (in which it is now closed down known as of today) My Grandma would not admit that she had seen a UFO, because she&apos;s a very religious person, and the only thing that what it could of been was; either an top secret military aircraft or one of &quot;God&apos;s Mystery Suprises&quot; that we aren&apos;t not to suppose about???...((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

The craft was shaped like a classic cartoon flying saucer -- round with colored lights all around it and a bubble shape on top. It appeared silver. It was silent and still for several seconds while the orange, red, yellow, and green square-shaped lights  circled around it. It is unclear if the craft itself was spinning.

It was losing control, then regained and took off.I think it was late summer or start of fall, in 2002. We were visiting family at my husbands sisters house, then me and him left in my car to go get food for everyone, it was about 8:30 PM.  We were in a pretty suburban area. Houses on blocks, apartments, a YMCA right near by. We were driving along a straight stretch and my husband said &quot;oh my goodness that plane is gonna crash&quot;. I thought he was joking told him playfully to shut up and then he said &quot;no seriously.&quot; I looked in my rear view mirror and saw a large black object coming overtop of a hill behind us. It was sort of wobbling side to side like it was about to lose control, and it was dangerously low and close to the power lines, then it seemed to sort of start getting control again. I stopped my car right in the middle of the street, there was no other traffic around. I turned around and started looking out the back window. It was going very slow and then about not even 200 feet behind my car it stopped and started to just hover. I was like a straight up triangular shape looked almost as if you drew a big letter A, standing straight up in the sky. It was black very sleek and on one side it was completely covered with lights, green, red and yellow. They were all blinking and there had to be 200 hundred of them. We just set there in awe. Then all of a sudden it took off. It left so fast you could almost see lines in the air after it (another strange thing I noticed when it took off it made no sound at all, any other aircraft you would have heard take off noise, it just zipped off with nothing). I just went on impulse through my car into drive and tried to follow. I was going about 90 mph trying to follow it. I saw a ramp unto the highway and by the time I got up on the highway we could only barely see the lights of the UFO way off in the distance. When we got back to his sisters house I couldn&apos;t help but try to tell them what we had seen. NO one believed us. So, we haven&apos;t really talked about it since.

We were woken up about 4:30 a.m by what at first we thought was a helicopter hovering above our house. However rather then the sound of blades cutting through the air in a high pitched manner, this was a low droning noise, but very loud. it stayed above our house for about 2-3 mins before I was fully awake and looked outside.

How do I know, both of my children were still in school. It happened one night in late September (date is approximate ) after 10:30 pm. The kids had gone to bed and the evening news was over. I can&apos;t get this sighting out of my head and since we did not have the internet at that time, I am reporting it now. My husband and I got into the habit of going out after the news to watch the sky. He had studied some astronomy in college and we both liked looking at the stars. The kids had gone to bed so, we went out to the back yard (away from the street lights) to watch the stars. We were looking to the west and about 20 to 25 degrees off the horizon, I noticed a light blue very bright light. It was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm&apos;s length. I pointed it out to him since it was so different from the stars we were observing. We watched it for about 10 to 15 minutes. It just sat there, no movement. I got cold as the night was chilly and decided to go in and get a coat, I wanted to get the binoculars also. I came out with the bincoulars and looked at the object. It was still in the same place. As I watched a red light appeared on the left side (as you are facing it) and watched. About a minute or two later, the red light went over the top of the blue object (kind or like rolling over the top of it) and was now, on the right side. I watched it for about a minute or two when suddenly, the red light shot off the blue object and came toward us.(This would have been to the east ) I trained the binoculars on it and what I saw scared the hell out of me. It was sort of delta wing shaped with an extension to the front. It was bright red and moving at an incredible rate of speed. This thing was fast! I quickly handed the binoculars to my husband who was in shock to say the least. He handed them back in time for me to see it arc toward the north. I swear but, am not sure now that I saw windows under the extension part. I couldn&apos;t tell you for sure as it moved so fast and to tell you the truth, I was so scared... I went into the house as soon as it was lost behind the trees. My husband wanted to stay out and see what happened but, I was so affraid that I was crying and begging him to come in. When we got in I asked him to draw what he saw and I would do the same. He did and I did and it came out VERY similar. I am sorry now that I was such a coward, now, and did not stay to see what happened. This was many years ago but, it has stayed in my mind. I just want to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like this or if anyone knows what it was. I am familiar with aircraft and this was nothing like I have ever seen before.", "lights circling inside clouds over NashvilleMy wife and I were driving on I-40 westbound on Sunday night, coming back to Nashville from east Tennessee. After passing the Lebanon exit, I began noticing lights moving inside the clouds closer to Nashville. As we got closer, I could tell that they looked like spot lights shining down from above or inside the clouds instead of from below, and they were moving in large circles. This night we saw two of them moving in large circles and figure eights from east to west over Nashville. One of the main reasons I became so interested was that my wife and I have seen similar lights before. I filed a report back in 8/03 about lights we saw clrcling around inside the clouds during a big thunderstorm. We had pretty much conviced ourselves that this earlier sighting was a spotlight promoting something, or maybe lights from the Starwood Ampitheater, which we&apos;re kind of near (although I don&apos;t know why anyone would have continued to shine these types of lights during one of the biggest thunderstorms of the summer). These lights looked almost exactly the same and were moving in almost the same fashion, except there were only two instead of four. So now we had a chance to try to find the source of these lights and prove to ourselves that we weren&apos;t seeing anything out of the ordinary. We closed in on the city from about 30 miles out and the lights became increasingly obvious. I&apos;m sure other cars must have seen them, but there&apos;s no way to know. I had slowed down a lot because I was fascinated by these lights clrcling and seemingly swooping around just above the cloud ceiling. We kept expecting one to become more visible or distinct though a break in the clouds, but it never happened. They stayed very fuzzy and shapeless. The lights would circle opposite each other, then move together and back apart or do some crazy zig zag. However, we never saw a beam of light from the ground, and that was primarily what we were looking for. We got off the interstate on Stewarts Ferry Pk., when we thought we were finally getting below the lights, and went east. I was driving, but my wife could still see them northeast of us, so I took a left on Lebanon Pk and went north. Now we were very close to the Nashville airport, but the general movement of the lights seemed to be to the northwest and we could never get under them. We were also getting around more city lights and it was harder to see them, and they seemed to be farther away from us. We were tired from our drive so we went on home, but we satisfied ourselves that these lights were not originating from spotlights on the ground. I don&apos;t know that it proves anything about the first lights we saw, but it makes me wonder. I know other people must have seen these lights, as they were all over above the city, so I&apos;m hoping someone else will come forward.", "Strange disk shaped object witnessed in Flordia.I was traveling south on I-75 south of gainesville when I noticed a silver object hovering in the distance.  It first looked like a plane with its landing lights on but it wasnt moving at all. I watched it for about 5 mins while driving and I looked down at my speed and it was gone.

My wife continued to try and race away from it but it kept up with the car ,it suddenly appeared to go up and after a thew seconds the bonnet of our car lit up white,then suddenly the windscreen was covered with this transparent cabbage shaped coloured substance ,after a thew seconds it disappeared,we were both very traumatised by this point and we both felt disorientated, within about 30seconds a car overtook us,it must have been doing about 50 odd miles an hour as it shot ahead of us down the road, then suddenly the vortex appeared again next to the car again but it was higher off the road after a bit it suddenly went up in the air over our car to the left i opened my window and looked up to see what appeared to be two vortexes one electrical spinning on the outside and inside plasma  tear drop shapes spinning around also, it  hovered over a  field to our left for another mile or two before going  right up into the clouds were it seemed to disappear ,this was not light,or lasers we saw ,or anything man made i could quite clearly see the properties of the vortex outside our car,the last thing to say about it of which we do not expect anyone  to believe is that when it was on our windscreen there were moving particles like when you look under a microscope in it,we one again say this is true, this happened,its hard to beleive but it happened the way ive described in this email .Ive become gradually frustrated seeing what we have saw with no evidence, and knowing the science community does not know or understand this, or believe what happened but only we wait now  until someone else sees this too", "A bright light flying very fast across the night sky heading in the east directionI was out side with my flats mats having a smoke with them and I was looking up at the stars when I saw a bright light flying very fast across the sky they ask what I was looking at and I showed them the light.

It lasted about a minute and a half, fluxuating color and intensity about every 2 seconds. I then saw two aircrafts depart in opposite directions from where the lights were.

As I walked into the park next to my house, looking directly north from 40th street/Greenway Rd where I live, I saw what at first glance I thought was a shooting star.  Then I realized how big it was, how low it was in the sky. It had quite a long streaming tail which appeared gaseous.  The trail was fairly long, about 3x the diameter of the main object. The main object, at arms length I would say was the size of a nickel. It looked exactly like a comet.  It was reddish in color. It was moving from East to West, horizontal to the ground although it looked like it was going to come down.  It did not move in any erratic patterns. I ran towards it but lost view of it behind trees. Once I realized there was no impact...I pretty much ruled out that it was a meteor.

Me, my wife and my two daughters, then 8 and 14, where in our car (I&apos;m driving) head NORTH down Hertel Avnue.  It was nearing dusk and the sky was remarkably clear, not a cloud for as far as the eye could see in any directon and the moon was full and very clear to the west of the sky though the sun was still shining (but nearing sunset). We were on our way to Pay Less Shoes at Delaware and Hertel (near K-Mart); traffic was thick and moving slow.  I was going to purchase shoes for my two daughters for &apos;back to school&apos;.  Then we were going to take a family drive to the Tuscaruora Indian Reservation for ice cream, cigarettes and gas. As we approached Parkside - heading North down Hertel, the light turned red and we were the second car from the light.  My younger daughter startled me as she shouted &quot;Daddy, look up! look up!&quot;  We all looked up to the distanct sky directly in front of us, staring about 25 degrees up in the direction of travel and there was an extremely bright round orb of light, brighter than the North Star, BRIGHTER THAN ANYTHING I&apos;VE EVER SEEN IN THE SKY. By distance, it looked like it was over Lake Erie.  The orb of light just stayed in one spot and flickered for the entire time we sat at the red light. When the light turned green, the car in front did not move and neither did we and the people behind us started to blow there horns. I noticed the driver in the front car was staring and pointing at the sphere of light and talking to a female passenger in the seat next to him. We all got caught at the red light again!!  Then the sphere split into two orbs of light!!  Then about 2 seconds after the split, the second sphere or orb just JUMPED TO THE LEFT AND STARTED TO THE EDGE OF THE FULL MOON.  IT SAT THERE FOR ABOUT 1 SECOND; THEN IT STARTED TO JUMP BACK AND FORTH FROM ONE SIDE OF THE MOON TO THE OTHER!!! (traveling the diameter of the moon!!) It did this for about 2 seconds and in that time It moved from the left to the right exactly 10 times before disappering!!  Then the first orb moved towards the moon form it&apos;s place in the horizon over Lake Erie and it traveled next to the moon and did it in less than a half a second!!  (I took my watch off my wrist and held it near my view to time what the orbs were doing)  The light truned green and the second orb was still siting at the edge of the outer diameter of the moon (left side).  Traffic started to jam really bad, it took us over 15 minutes to proceed from Parkside and Hertel to Delaware &amp; Hertel.  When we parked in the plaza in front of Pay Less Shoes and got out of the car, There was a couple (guy and a lady) standing in front of Pay Less and pointing up at the moon and the orb; they too were observing its strange behavior and my wife and I spoke to them breifly about it.  By this time, the orb or sphere shaped light was flicking in and out and each time it flickered out, it would reappear in a different spot near the moon in various places!!  I still get goose bumps thinking and talking about this!!  eeww!!  When we left Pay Less it was still there and we got spooked and did not go to the reservation as it was now dark - we went home and told no one.  during our drive back down Hertel to Main street (head to Dartmouth Ave where we then lived) we observed many people on Hertel in cars and on foot pointing at it and talking about it!!  I&apos;m surprised this sighting never made the news!!  TOO MANY PEOPLE HAD NOTICED IT AND IT WAS CAUSING TRAFFIC JAMS BECAUSE PEOPLE DRIVING AND ON FOOT WHERE NOT FOCUSED AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN!!!!

What was strange is that we all watched it pass by and none of us said anything about it until it had passed. We just looked at it without saying anything until it had pasted by. The next day it was front page news of the Chicago Times, many other people saw it and called police. The commerical pilots were on strike at the time and no planes were in the air.

When I looked up I saw a very bright light that was white and blue with red lights that flashed and moved around the object. I went back into the house and determined that it was at about 190 degrees on the compass dial from magnetic North. I turned on the television and watched tv for about 40 minutes, when I checked on the object again, it had moved approximately 2 degrees to the West. I went back to the tv and checked again 30 minutes later and it had moved approximately 15 degrees to the West. I fell asleep and when I awoke at 03:00, it was gone. When I was observing it, I never really saw it move, it seemed to hang in the sky with small gyrating motions. I know it was not an incoming airplane or helo because it was way above the normal flight patterns that come into PDX at that time of the night and it hung around too long. I always check the sky every night for anomalies during the last 1.5 weeks I have been here and this is the first time I have seen this object, as I report this on 2/11/04, it is not in the sky tonight (I checked before the clouds rolled in).

Lindsay and I sat on the dock in Riddles Bend over the dark waters of the Coosa River beneath a spray of stars, mystified.  I do not remember the moon.  As the lighted craft approached, we wondered to each other why a boat would be cruising down the river at nine at night.  Its light was brighter now, concentrated on the opposite shoreline like a spotlight.  A police cruiser, perhaps?  But it was so huge.  Maybe forty yards long.  And there was complete silence.  No whirring of a boat motor.  No helicopter blades chopping and stabbing at the air.  There was no frothy wake smacking against the dock.  This lack of natural physical effects was eerie considering its great size.((name deleted)) and I were immobile as it moved past us.  It seemed to hover above the water as opposed to gliding through it.  Three ovular white lights on the bottom barely illuminated the river below.

All of a sudden it seemed to be changing shape! Im thinking maybe it could be cloud shadows hitting it. But, I distincly saw what looked like it morphiong into to balls of white and as they did so it looked like they went around each other and then it would go back to being one ball of white.

Curious, I kept my eye on it for several moments to watch its slow southern to southwestern progress.  Finally I went out the back door to get a better look.  When I did, the center of the blur grew in intensity, as if it had been a light shining through clouds but the clouds had now broken apart. At this same moment several other points began to glow brightly within the haze.  Immediately these lights and the glow surrounding them took off in the same direction that the object had been slowly drifting.  It did not take off incredibly fast, but its movement was far more rapid than any plane would seem to have from that distance, and its acceleration from the slow drift was instantaneous.  Its movement was also level with the earth the entire time I witnessed it, causing me to beleive it was not a falling celestial body.I have never told anyone except my friends and family, or ever reported this sort of thing.

About 20 degrees to the left of the moon there appeared one light, then two, then three; in horizontal configuration and equidistant apart from one another.  The width of the three lights when all of them were illuminated was approximately the distance of half of a full moon. They were brilliant white and several times larger than Jupiter&rsquo;s appearance.  All three stayed on for four or five seconds and then disappeared in unison.  Five to seven seconds later and five or so degrees left of the moon one appeared again, then two, then three, in the same configuration and disappeared again.  To me, a plane or jet could not have traveled that amount of distance in that amount of time.  Then four or five seconds later it happened again, but this time they were back around the 15 or 20 degree location to the left of the moon. Then disappeared all together, again.

I have wanted to tell my story since I was a boy.  I was 11 years old and asleep.  I woke up with vibrations in my body and a strong desire to look out my bedroom window.  It was a high window and I had to stand on my bed which was below it to see out.  We had 80 acres of flat land in back to look out on.  In the very back was a bright cigar shaped object that I some how knew was an alien ship.  I called it a flying sauser as that was the only term I knew that would fit.  I ran into my parents bedroom and woke them up.  I told my dad there was a flying saucer in the back yard.  He told me to go back to sleep.  I said, &quot;no it&apos;s real. Look!&quot;  He did and he saw it.  He called Soufidge Field (Spelling is probabbly wrong but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s still there) the military airbase in the Detroit area and asked them if they had picked something up on their radar.  When they asked why, he told them we had a flying saucer in our backyard.  They took his name and address and told him to go back to bed.  Right!  We loaded the shot guns and rifles.  The lights went out on the craft and it was dark in the back 80.  A few minutes later we heard foot steps on the porch and a knock at the door.  I opened the door and my father and older brother put the shotguns to the opening door.  The door opened and a cop was standing there staring down the barrels of two shot guns.  He asked what was going on.  We told him, and he said come outside and show me where.  We stepped into the front yard and pointed back to the area where we saw the ship.  He was taking notes on his clipboard and mocking us when all of a sudden the lights went back on on the ship.  It rose silently in the air about 100 feet or so, hovered a second or two and then rose quickly 10 or twenty feet and then vanished in an instant.  We all stood there in silence for a few seconds.  The cop went over to his patrol car and radioed in what he saw.  They told him to go back and investigate.  He said, &quot;Not me, you&apos;re not going to find my shoes in the morning.&quot;  He left, and that was that until the morning. Around 11:00 a.m. the &quot;Men in Black&quot; arrived.  CIA, FBI, Air Force, I don&apos;t know, but three cars pulled into the yard and my sister and I escorted the men to the back where we saw the craft.  The men weren&apos;t wearing black suits, but were wearing blue suits.  There were four men in suits, and two dressed in lab type suits carrying giger counters.  They found areas where they said they thought the tripods landed as the weeds were laid flat.  My father was at work, and my mother stayed in the house with my three younger brothers. My older brother was also gone somewhere at the time. The weeds in this area were tall, about three feet tall, and now were flat.  They took measurements. I don&apos;t remember the geiger counters going off. That was the last we saw of the &quot;Men in Blue.&quot; I had the same feeling of vibrations in my stomach a few years later when as a 17 year old, I was attending Interlochen Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan.  I told no one, but didn&apos;t sleep well that night in the cabin.  The next morning in the breakfast line, I over heard two of the counselors talking about the flying saucers they had seen last night.  They both said they saw a group of four flying saucers flying in slow formation over the camp.  It verified the feeling in my stomach and I worried that the aliens were after me.  I don&apos;t think they were, but at the time I was concerned.  Oh, also, one winter we had a huge snow storm.  I was 14 years old at the time. (Winter of 1960) and the snow was deep.  I had the same feelings in my stomach and was afraid to move.  I felt the aliens wanted to talk to me, or have me come outside.  I did nothing but lay in bed praying.  In the moring, the blowing snow from that night had stopped and had packed itself on my bedroom window in a thin layer. A pair of tiny bootprints could be seen on my bedroom window where a small alien had walked across my long window.   I thought one of my brothers did that somehow, and so I went outside to see whose foot prints I&apos;d find in the virgin snow.  There were no prints anywhere.  I was the first one to venture out in the new snow fall.  There were no prints anywhere in the snow, not even below my window.  The only fresh prints were on the side of the house and across my bedroom window.  I knew they had been there.  I can still see the prints in my mind.

I had returned home from my fire station to find my Grandma, her boyfriend, my cousin, his wife, and my uncle watching a satellite fly across the night sky. There were minimal clouds and a full moon. The moon was on the horizon towards the North-East of the sky and the satellite was approximately five vertical fists-lengths above the moon. The satellite was flying North to South at what appeared to be a normal speed compared to other satellites I had seen. All of a sudden the satellite stopped and started flying upwards into the sky, all six of us were amazed and convinced ourselves that it was the international space-station and that it was just changing direction. But then it stopped again, and then rapidly increased its speed, flying in zig-zag and circle patterns. It then appeared to dim and brighten every few seconds, i suspected that it was flying up and down, altering its altitude. I managed to get two photographs taken with my digital camera, in night mode so the shutter was left open for a second or two. and also 8 seconds of video footage with the same camera. The object can be seen moving in a circular pattern in both the time lapse pics, and the video. However a skeptic could explain them as me moving the camera around while filming a bright star. I think not.

The little bit of sun left reflected off of something in the sky, a plane I had assumed, and I looked up to see why it was so bright. As I stopped and waited for the reflection to dissipate I realized that there was absolutely no noise accompanying this &quot;plane&quot; so I asked my boyfriend to look up at it as well. when the reflection finally dissolved I couldn&apos;t understand what I was looking at, it was a perfect oval, a brilliant smooth silver surface covered this ovular shaped object and it glided, smoothly, accross the sky. It kind of hovered, it moved without any noise, swiftly but gently accross the sky. I thought &quot;this has to be a plane or a helicopter or something like that, maybe a toy blimp some kid is playing with&quot; but it made absolutely no noise, and living in the town I do it isn&apos;t hard to hear noise it is that quiet. My boyfriend and I just stood there, baffled, wondering what the hell it was, trying to come up with what it could possibly be. We even went so far as to (later that evening while we were still in awe at the encounter) look in the phonebook and ask around about any nearby military bases that may be working on aircrafts. We came up with no leads. This solid, smooth, silver, soundless, oval had no windows. at first I thought it to be small, but as it neared directly above my boyfriend and I, we realized it was huge, and it was closer to the groud than any helicopter or plane could be, it was too big to be a toy or a kite, there were no windows! How was it operating if it had no windows or a remote control? After it had passed over us this, oval (as I like to call it), shot off, extremely fast, and seemingly dissappeared from sight. I have only ever seen it one time again, when I was walking in the mountains, alone, and I dare say I ran back to my dorm room (college student) as quickly as I could because I have heard too many scary tales to open a tale of my own. Believe me, I am not a natural believer of the supernatural, I do believe in ghosts, but I didn&apos;t really until I encountered one, I assure you now I am also a firm believer of aliens, as crazy as it may seem I cannot deny what my eyes beheld on that strange october day.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The subway and the Amtrak share a stretch of rail through this part of Boston that heads to NYC and I often see helicopters flying along this path and figured it was just a TV traffic copter or some other helicopter flying towards us. I noticed it was particularly low (maybe the height of a ten story building) and I couldn&apos;t hear it like I typically do when a helicopter passes over. As it flew past us on our left (driver&apos;s side) we could see that the copter had no discernible markings on it and was a dull, slate grey/black color and had a enclosed rotor in the tail - very modern looking. It slowed to a hover and looked as though it was looking for something or someone (if I had to guess on the way it was traveling - most of the other&apos;s just zoom along towards Logan or the hospitals). Even very near to us it was quiet. The whole thing struck me as odd and figured I would report it since &quot;black helicopters&quot; seem to be common around a UFO incident. About five minutes later another copter passed along a similar flight path and was much higher up and garnered no additional attention.((NUFORC Note:  It is unusual for a helicopter to be as quiet as what the witness describes.  However, there are some helicopters, used for military or intelligence purposes, which have &quot;hush kits&quot; installed, which make them much quieter than a typical helicopter.

At one point I awoke at about 2 am, my freind was driving and we pulled off the hiway to get gas, use restrooms and switch shifts. At some point we noticed a crunching sound on the road and when we pulled in to the fuel station it became apparent that there was a real swarm of crickets. Regular, large, healthy black crickets-everywhere. There were so many they were in the toilets and sinks, unavoidable and hopping everywhere. Strange. We thought. That is until we got back on the hiway. I had taken over driving. It was a pitch black night, in a seemingly unpopulated area. After looking at a map I&apos;m sure it was somewhere between Madera and Manteca. As soon as we re-entered the hiway my peripheral vision noticed movement to the left, right out over a grassy area next to the hiway. As soon as I looked over, my freind noticed as well. I beleive she said with puzzlement something to the effect of &apos;what the hell is that?&apos; At first glance it appeared as though it was connected to the ground and moving slowly north-the same as us. The reason it looked that way is because I&apos;ve never seen anything in the air ever move that slow, except birds, helicopters, and maybe a ferris wheel. Plus it was seemingly vertically arranged. The only thing visible was a bright whitish/yellowish light on top and bottom,and three triangularly arranged bluish,reddish, and orangish lights placed equidistant between top and bottom. We estimate the total height to be 15-30 feet, probably closer to 30. Right after we noticed it, it was going the same speed as us, then it accelerated with ease straight down along the west side of the hiway going north. At this point I said,&apos;That is definitely not an airplane&apos; This thing was so, so strange I felt an instant and major upwelling of fear, apprehension, curiosity. As we continued watching it almost reached a hiway overpass and smoothly, quickly and deliberately crossed the hiway and turned 90 degrees to the south.I felt like it was very aware of the fact that we were watching it. It began coming right at us. My freind began sobbing as I pulled over. She just kept saying &quot;keep going,don&apos;t stop, don&apos;t stop!&quot;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Well I it started a few days before this sighting that something out of the ordinary was going on. For approximately four days two military jets loitered in the area,several of my friends heard and watched them on several occasions that week. They stayed in the same exact area going about five to ten minutes out( west and over the gulf)and then returning almost overhead,I live and work very close to were they were doing this so I could hear them almost continuously. They did this All day and well into each night,could have been all night but I didnt stay up to find out. On the last evening that they loitered something strange happened, at 8:30 PM I arrived at my shop to drop off some equipment I had just purchased, I heard the jets as usuall and watched them as they headed away from me towards the gulf, I turned around and started to unload my truck,A bright light pulse( Only way I can describe it) cought my eye and I looked up, it didnt flash again for about 10 seconds(approx) then it pulsed again, a few seconds later it pulsed again but it looked like it was aimed away from the ground and towards the sky, then a few seconds later another pulse towards the ground. There were no other lights on IT and I couldnt hear IT, it was very dark out so I couldnt see a silouhette of any kind. So Im watching this thing and the next thing I hear are those jets heading back towards were I am but this time the engines are alot louder,I see one more pulse of light slightly west of the last pulse and away from were the jets are coming from and into an area that is cloudy so I couldnt see alot more. The jets arrived over head heading directly towards were the last light pulse occured, I saw a streek of light through a small opening in the cloud bank, Im not sure whether it was the jets or the object.My exact feeling at that time with the aggresiveness exerted by the jets was that there going to shoot this thing down, I watched for a few minutes in almost horror and fear and listened to the jets as they raced away. I didnt see the light ever again, the jets returned approx one hour later stayed approx one more hour and I never heard them again after that.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

This was at dusk. I was inside informing her when reception was clear. She came down off the roof, walked in the back door and told me she just saw a huge UFO. She described the incident to me and to be honest, I dismissed her story as a &quot;mis-identification&quot; of a known aircraft. I&apos;ve always regretted that. Her depiction of the event is as follows: While adjusting the antenna, she looked up and saw a huge kite (diamond?) shaped aircraft, hovering silently, just a few blocks north of our house, near North Star Mall. She said it was about the size of two football fields, the structure appeared black in color and the bottom had numerous white colored lights. It hovered for a few seconds about 600 ft. off the gound then very quickly, shot off to the west and out of site.From her description, the object was very, very large and I couldn&apos;t understand why we never heard any reports about the event. She can recount this even, in detail, anytime. Let me add that a couple of years later, while driving in San Antonio one evening, we both saw a mysterious craft, traveling slowly, a low altitude, near the intersection of I10 and Loop 410. My wife said, &quot;there it is!&quot; Just like the other one I saw. My reaction again, was sort of like &quot;well, whatever!&quot; I think what we saw was just so bizzare, we had trouble accepting it. Now, years later, I do accept it and would like to know if others witnessed these events, the same time we did. Note: I filed another report a few minutes ago of an incident that I experienced in Alpine, TX. In error, I listed another witnesses name(Russ Davis), rather than mine.

When i looked out the window, it slowly went from west to south east, and it appeared to be far away. I went outside a few minutes later to see it better, and because it had dissapeared from my window view. It was fairly nice outside, only misty-looking clouds in the north west. It went slightly past (I think) Polaris, to the left, then made a manuever to the right, which seemed too unreal for a plane to do.... It seemed to hover in the south east sky for about five minutes--and for thirty seconds or so, seemed to be coming toward my direction, then went back again. Then, after going around in a weird centricity, it seemed to still, right in front of what I believe to be Polaris. It did the strangest thing: it appeared to fly at the same rate as Polaris(?) was moving across the sky. I went in becauseit was cold for gloves, and when I came back, Polaris(?) was less intense--it was alone now.... Anyway,It was like a glowing ball of light. I watched for another hour outside on and off; and even brought out a map of the sky for positioning. But the map I have is for January--don&apos;t know if that was Polaris!

Almost as expected, within minutes another Formation appeared, it was coming from the South, and heading North West. In all my sightings, they always come from the same direction.  I suspect that I might live in the flight path of something.  The craft appear to be very high in altitude and very difficult for my video camera to capture.

I pointed this out to my wife and children and collectively we noticed another 4 contrails of what appeared to be identical lengths spaced out into the distance. The sun was setting in the west at the time but the day was clear and would definitely be considered a daytime event. The closest contrail appeared to totally disappear at least twice but reappeared seconds later. There were some wires crossing the road at the traffic signal and I moved my head up and down to make sure that the &quot;disappearance&quot; was not caused by the visual obstruction of the wires. It was not, the contrail totally disappeared and reappeared at least twice though the heading and travelling distance appeared to remain approximately consistent during the disappearance/ reappearance.

Three were heading towards us and two were moving toward the north or right of us.

I gazed into the sky it was extremely clear out. One star caught my attention. It wasnt the movement thought that caught me at first. It was how bright it was. Slightly brighter then most of the stars. It was Northeast of us and I couldnt take my eyes off it. Then I noticed movement. Extremely slow movement. If you werent staring at the star and concentrating you wouldnt of noticed it. I told my friend to take a look and he used the binocculars he brang when we went hiking earlier that night. After focusing for about 15minutes we began to hear weird noises from the back side of the wall behind my house. More than likely it was animals. So we shrugged it off and looked at the star again.

It had exactly four lights. One on each corner of the craft and one dead center.     Each angle one the craft was equivalent. You couldnt tell which angle was the from of the ship. It made no noise whatsoever it was almost like it sucked the sound out of world around us. I knew it wasnt a plain because it was PERFECTLY still and the shape was too perfect to be anytype of plane.

We immediately noted that numerous stars were visible in the sky and that that there were very few clouds.  We also noted that there were no mountains in our line of sight.  We concluded that these two lights were clearly in the sky and not, for example, car lights coming down a mountain in front of us.  About five seconds after these two lights appeared, a third similarly sized light appeared above the one on the left.  The three lights remained motionless for about five seconds, then all three disappeared at the same time.  We continued to watch the sky as we traveled.  About two minutes later, the three lights appeared again in the same L-shaped configuration, although this time they were lower in the horizon and they had moved to the east.  They remained illumined for only about five seconds this time and then disappeared again.  The lights from two small planes were visible in the sky near the second sighting and the three unexplained lights seemingly dwarfed the lights from the planes.  I recalled seeing a documentary on the Phoenix lights of 1997 and after reviewing pictures of this event online, I would say that the lights themselves which we saw closely resembled the so-called Phoenix lights, although they remained motionless while lit and they formed an L-shape rather than a horizontal line.", "on jan 25 2005 about ten at night we noticed bright lights that were very strangewe were on a cruise.While sitting out on owr balcany I notice a intence light flashing red green and white.I thought it was a airplane,but the light never got any closer or further away.we notice that the lights were exstremely bright. as we kept watching it it started darting around real fast and go back to the same spot.my partner went to bed i kept watching it,it seem to be shooting or lawnching something from it.there would be a streak of light shoot in to space.

An object was hovering above the Pacific Ocean, beyond the bay of Las Banderas. It remained approxiately on a 90 degree angle with it&apos;s nose pointing towards the Ocean. There was no momentum, lights, sounds or odd movement. The object gradually ascended into the clouds where it appeared to fade but was still noticiable. The front portion of the object is shaped like an arrowhead with a shaft connecting the rear portion. The rear is huge given the distance from the point of video taping.", "large, well-lit saucer passes only a hundred feet above houseI will never forget my first encounter with an unidentified flying object.  I had been inside my house in a very rural area watching television with my family.  It was after the last show of the night, and I went to my front porch to relieve myself, as many do out in the woods.  As I stepped out of my front door onto the porch, I saw what I can only describe as two car headlights right above the treeline in front of my house, which was about a hundred yards distant.  The trees themselves were about 75 to 100 feet tall, and I estimated the lights were no more than 50 feet above that. So I was stunned at the sight, which my mind attributed to their being a car hovering in the sky.  Instantly, I realized that this was impossible as the lights revealed themselves to be on the front of a large craft.  It was moving at about 10 miles an hour, at about the rate of a running person.  I ran in the house, screamed to my family to see the sight, then ran back outside.  The craft was now directly over our house, and I ran out in the yard to stand under it, to the great distress of my mother &amp; father who assumed I&apos;d get beamed up by it or something. I looked up into the bottom of the ship, of which the outline I could barely see due to darkness, (but I could make out a vague saucer shape) but the craft had four really bright lights arrayed as points on a cross directly across from each other.  I&apos;d say they were roughly fifty feet away from each other.  The craft appeared to be about a third larger, maybe a saucer with a diameter of 75 to 100 feet.  As per most ufo sightings, I heard hardly any sound as the massive craft passed overhead.  I strained my ears and heard a very faint hum.  As the craft passed over the trees behind my house in the direction of the rising moon, I could make out more of the thickness of the saucer and the general shape.  It appeared to be about thirty feet or so with a blinking blue strobe light on top. We were in an intense state of excitement after this occured, and my dad called the police and reported the sighting (with a satisfaction only a life-long science fiction fan could have).  The next day at my high school, I found out that several people I knew had seen the craft as well, and some had even shot at the thing with no effect.  Another friend and her sister had chased the thing in a car only to have it shoot straight upward at a great rate of speed after a lengthy chase. That&apos;s my tale, I found this site and wanted to record my experience for the ages, I guess...even if it happened over ten years ago.  To the life of me I can&apos;t figure out how such a thing could propel itself with no air downdrafts or normal means of propulsion/lift.  If it was a military craft, they are working with some EXTREMELY sophisticated technology these days...if I wouldn&apos;t have been outside I&apos;d never have seen it.", "Large shooting star over eastern skyWhile leaving a Christmas party (where neither I or my husband consumed alcohol), I looked to the eastern skyline and saw a shooting star larger than I have ever seen in my life.  It loked as if it had perhaps entered the atmosphere.  The head was colorful, purple and green.  The tail was yellowish like a &quot;normal&quot; shooting star.  I exclaimed my amazement, and my husband looked up in time to see the tail end of the streak.  I came home and checked the news to see if anything had crashed, but apparently not.  I love watching meteor showers, but this was like nothing I have ever seen in my life.", "Bright BLUE/GREEN object streaked cross the sky from NE to SW.Only lasted a second or two. Suspect it was a meteor, but can&apos;t be sure.", "Dull red giant &quot;bracelet&quot; at Santa Fe Baldy mountain,summer 1978, Pecos Wilderness, New MexicoI studied journalism, learning to answer who, what, when, where, why, how, how much, and how little for 3 college years. I&apos;m 60 now, but not a professionnal journalist. Now I&apos;m an artist. In probably July (or August) of 1978, I arrived on trail 254, I believe it was, at the base of Santa Fe Baldy mountain, in the Pecos Wilderness, just east of Santa Fe city, New Mexico. Checked my watch at midnight there, had walked in 4 miles, and here it began. I saw lots of fog upon leaving the tree covered part of the trail, especially to the West, or left of me. In this fog were small, perhaps 1/4 or 1/2 inch across, lights of a dull red color. They started out a foot or two off the ground, and went slowly straight up, to perhaps 4 or 5 feet, then arched over such as a flair gun would create, but I did not see anything like a flare gun. Some lights may have gone farther,up to 10 feet.. These lights moved slower than any rising anything I had ever seen. I could euphemistically say time slowed down for these rising lights. But this is only a description, not a claim of time slowing down. After watching this for a few minutes, I walked into the area where the lights were, which had ground brush and a few higher bushes, but the lights disappeared before I could reach them. They were spread out over 25 plus feet parallel to the trail, and launching at random intervals. I went back  to the trail and waited but no new lights appeared. So I walked further on the trail. There was considerable fog about, and I turned right to sit on a log and rest. After a while, I saw huge red lights, like balloons 100 feet across each. They were linked by a chain of the same dull red color and its intensity as the &quot;balloons&quot;, indeed as the &quot;flair&quot; lights now 50 feet back on the trail. This braclet configuration, was laid across the top of Santa Fe Baldy, as if a giant child had dropped it on the mountain, above its tree line (thus Santa Fe Baldy) so that the center of the bracelet was where the top of the montain was and the braclet&apos;s &quot;balloon&quot; fobs were perfectly horizontally surrounding the mountain a few hundred feet down from the top of the mountain. I estimated 2 or 3 such fobs would be behind the mountain, where I could see nothing. I saw either 5 or 7 that were partially or fully in view. This dull red color was consistent throughout both the fobs and the thin chain that linked them. I was stupefied and opened up a candy bar. There was no noise whatsoever, and I realized there was no 3 dimensional depth to any of the fobs. I took them to be spheres, nevertheless, rather than discs. The fog cleared a small amount and I was more sure of the sphere shapes. As I sat there some non-corporeal &quot;spirit&quot; type beings, two, one adult male and one apparently teen male,wearing white robes, sort of like the proverbial ghost,floated in from behind me on the left, a foot or so off the ground. I was used to that having extensively practiced mediumship (I become a human telephone between this world and the &quot;spirit world&quot; whether for departed humans or never incarnated intelligent beings) but this appearance was the last thing I expected in this event. The taller adult one telepathized to me: &quot;Too many doorways!&quot; So what? So what does that mean? Oh... I had been thinking of climbing up for a closer look. Had done it in the daylight before, and even that was rugged. He repeated the warning. Then the shorter, apparent teen (say 17 to 18 years old) said: yes, that I could actually get killed doing it. I thought nonesense, and was unmoved by them. The older one then kept repeating &quot;Too many doorways!&quot;  Too MANY doorways, I thought, what does MANY have to do with it? I thought about it for some time and pretended to agree not to make an effort to climb Santa Fe Baldy there that night. The spirits levitated back to where they came from behind me. I chuckled to myself &quot;Like Hell!&quot;  Daddy and Junior came back and Daddy yelled (telepathically): &quot;I said &apos;Too many doorways!&apos;.&quot; I was mad, but yielded. (Damn spirits, I thought, too holy to say more than a word or two. And god forbid there should be a discussion with them. Thank hell for important people! ((No, they weren&apos;t demons, just jerks.))  They left and I continued watching. Nothing changed. I saw no movement. I realized the fog probably obscured the dull red something from being seen at all down below some 3,000 feet in Santa Fe. I watched some more, got bored, remembered if this were a ufo something, its power system could be extremely dangerous, and so decided not to spend the night nearby. I walked away from the mountain for 2 miles and arrived at my reserved camp site at 2am, and the walk was hard because I felt very tired. I couldn&apos;t figure out why I should be so tired, and this walk seemed to take forever.  Then, when I got to Spirit Lake, on the near side, I had to walk through a group of 15 or so, late-high school or early college age kids, 2 or so of which were girls. They had no camping equipment, but 2 or 3 other young guys did. I went through them and followed the shore of the 50 yard-acrosss-lake to the far side.There I resolved to awake at 10am completely refreshed. I ate a bit, zonked out, and woke at 10 am &quot;completely refreshed.&quot; Only the kids with gear were on the far side of the lake, groggily rising. The 15 kids were nowhere and I guessed they were at a camp somewhere not too far away. I ate, packed up, and walked back the way I came, without incident, to the car six miles away. That&apos;s all, for that situation, at least. There&apos;s a lot more, best for another time, when I have more energy. I&apos;m 60 years old and this happened 28 years ago. Thank you for reading.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS))Part 2 of seeing dull red light at Santa Fe Baldy mountain in July 1978.Part 2. I am the person reporting dull red light on Mountain Santa Fe Baldy. I am the journalism backgrounded writer. Loose ends for part one. in 1978, when this occurred,I didn&apos;s need, nor used any prescription, nor any hallucinogenics. As I said, the next morning I woke about 10am, very rested and refreshed, ate and headed back by the same route I came in the night before. No manifestation of the dull red light was anywhere. Everything was completely normal. The next night in Santa Fe, I saw the same dull red light, in the sky in the southern area of Santa Fe. This time it was a single light, going on and off like a plane might do. Due to the dull red color it appeared slightly fuzzy, and was heading south, slowly, like a light airplane might appear to move. Off and on for several nights, weeks, a few months such appeared in the night sky. In late 1978, I moved to Denver, CO. With some friends I went during the summer on an overnight backpacking trip in the mountains, about 100 miles west of Denver. That night I saw another one of the dull red lights flying in the sky. I stopped bothering to look for them. But, 20 years later, I saw a red light and heard a simultaneous sound of a light plane engine, for a few seconds. It was also dull, located just above the buildings east of the intersection of E. Evans and S. University, on the north side of E. Evans. I had just come from Chamberlain Observatory where I had viewed Saturn with their older but powerful telescope. There the astronomer lecturing for 45 minutes, started by telling people who wanted to talk about flying saucers to leave. A legitimate request, since it was his show, that of Denver University, and conventional science. Later, I viewed Saturn through the telescope. This viewing of a dull red light lasted 5 -10 seconds, and when it went behind the building from my viewpoint, the airplane engine noise also went away. Why all the continuation of this dull red light, starting in 1978 as on the land of the mountain, plus the &quot;flare gun&quot; effect, then appearing in the night sky like planes? Then the final light appearing and disappearing in the busy intersection at night?  Kind of every which way but loose. A saying in journalism is: Believe nothing of what you hear, and then only a tiny fraction of that. I&apos;m a long way from a conclusion of what I saw, UFO or not. Someone has a book in which he said Martians have a cave under Santa Fe Baldy where they live and do whatever, but I don&apos;t remember the author or specifics. And there&apos;s been some remote viewing, which is a close relative of the clairvoyance I have used at times. Because the continuity of the appearances of the dull red light in whatever shape, bracelet or single light in sky, I record this. The bracelet did not fly, of course. And I was certainly puzzled by the flat appearance of the bracelet&apos;s fobs, which could have been due to the fog present thickly at first, and thinner later on, but making a false visual of flatness, even though otherwise it &quot;should have&quot; been a sphere (each fob). Heard the saying &quot;You make your own karma.&quot;? This means whatever you do, you set in motion some of whatever happens next. Go to Santa Fe Baldy and use your wits. Also, this was in 1978. I haven&apos;t been back there since. I did not record these events at the time, that I recall. If I go back into researching these memorable events, I think I&apos;ll really want to seek out more current events. I do notice that I almost never, if at all, see accounts of dull red lights in UFO reports. Finally, there is more to this story than I have told, and I suspect it would take a small book to cover it all. I&apos;ve seen enough Science Fiction to help with scenarios which could illuminate these events, however indirectly. And I think there are multiple possibilities for the &quot;story&quot; of these dull red lights, including UFO source and non-UFO sources. And I had no direct reason to believe I was abducted in the 1978 or subsequent sightings of the &quot;something.&quot;  Thank you for reading this.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

I went around a curve near Exeter Road and the RI veterans cemetery, when all of a sudden something in the sky caught my eye.  It kind of looked like a star, but the partly cloudy skies made seeing stars very difficult.  bright white or blue light.  it moved west, curving a little bit before disappearing behind a cloud.  the way it moved reminded me of a kid playing with a laser pointer on a wall...kind of an S-shaped curve.  it was fast...but I&apos;ve seen meteor showers before and it definitely wasn&apos;t as fast as a meteor.  It definitely wasn&apos;t an airplane...it was moving too fast and its turns were much too quick.", "My son and I came out to the back of where we live and was only living there for a short time until our house was being built. So we looked off to the east and saw what looked like a cessna plane and what gets me about this is something I have witness several times before. They look like planes with the same light configuration but they fly way too slow to be up in the air and make no noise what so ever. So there was one coming and this one just had a red light and as it slowly past over you could see that there was another one same thing red light no noise then there was a third one. So as the last one past over it was about two minutes away and my son did not hear anything no sound at all. So I bent over for something and I looked over to the east again and then I seen something to convince me that I truly could not explain it was 3 lights shaped like a triangle and was flying sideways another words the lead light in the triangle was not in the front so it was flying sideways. So I asked my son do you see what I am seeing and he did not see it and I said it&apos;s right there and then he said I only see one light but not three. So I was frustrated by him not seeing the other two lights so I asked him to go get his brother and by that time wouldn&apos;t you know that it disappeared. However it must have flown over Whiteman Air Force Base. So I just wanted to say that since then I have seen other objects since then. But before then since the early 90&apos;s I have seen several planes that have made no noise and fly too slow to even be in the air.", "I was driving home from work east bound on rt.28 outside of Goshen OH when i caught sight of a group of helicopters flying in V formation.They were flying in a southern direction,and were intersecting the road in front of me when i noticed these choppers or or aircraft were not more than a hundred feet from the ground and were absolutely noiseless.I also noticed the lights were a sort of cold flourescent light kind of different cant really say why but i could see they were illuminating the ground as though searching.You couldnt see beyond the lights  to see what they were connected to.What strikes me even more strange is i never told anyone until years later of this event.I was the only witness to this sighting and if I had a camera the pictures would have been closer than any Ive seen on any show or documentary.", "Went out to walk dogs.

Suddenly a yellow orange orb travelled from one cloud to another.... it was too fast to look for distinguising features,but it was too slow to be a so called &quot;lighting ball&quot; and didn&apos;t resemble any aircraft.

After we saw this, we drove around the area a little more to see if there was any police action, or any families gathering outside of their houses because we wanted to share our experience with somebody else.  I do know that it was not a helicopter, as my friend said in his posting.  I was never a firm believer in UFO&apos;s, but this has changed my opinion regarding that subject. My uncle is a pilot at the Oxford Airport nearby, and I explained this to him and he said that nothing would have or could have hovered the way this thing did.

I have looked for reference to it on the internet, but have not found any.  It was reported in the local newspaper and I will relate in this story what the newspaper reported the next day. A student manager was a quasi-security/manager that were used in the late 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s as an alternative to armed police.  I was riding shotgun with a patrol officer that evening on the 2nd shift.  We were travelling south on US 131, this was before the expressway went through the area.  As we were approaching the M-20 westbound intersection, I had looked up and saw an object in the sky. The sky was clear and the sun was in the lower western sky.  The object was south and east of us travelling in a west-northwest direction.  I asked John, the patrolman, what that was.  He looked up and said, &quot;Damn, I don&apos;t know.&quot;  He then turned down M-20 heading west.  The object seemed to be travelling at a pretty good clip.  He sped up and turned on his lights to warn traffic and we started pursuit. I radioed into to dispatch.  We reached speeds up to 100 mph and the object passed us and then slowly went out of sight.  We radioed our position and told them we couldn&apos;t see the object anymore and we were told it had been picked up by the State Police in the next county. Description of object:  It was oval and size was hard to determine.  If it was high up it would have been very large.  If it was close to the ground, it would have been 40&apos;-50&apos; feet front to back.  Actually, John and I could never figure out the size of the object.  It had an orangish color.  It could have been a reflection of the evening sun or it could have been orangish.  There was no pulsations.  There were no individual lights.  There was no details at all, in fact.  Just an oval shaped, orange glowing object that seemed to be travelling at a high rate of speed. The local paper in Big Rapids, The Pioneer, the next day reported the incident.  They stated that the object had first been spotted in Big Rapids, then by State Police in Lake county, then by the Coast Guard radar and also Air Force radar located in Frankfurt, MI.  Two jets were scrambled out of Minnesota and they intercepted the object over Wisconsin and chased it into Iowa, where it was reported to have simply just flown away from the jets. I have not been able to find reference to this event, though I have searched.  Many people saw this object and it was reported by many different government employees.  In fact, two days after the event, John and I were questioned for about a half hour by two individuals from some vague agency, neither of us were able to understand what it was.  When I first watched MIB and Tommy Lee Jones always made up an agence, like Division 6, I thought of these two guys that had questioned us.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

While going east to west in Binghamton, I was watching what appeared to be a twin engine military transport type plane make circles over the valley by Broome Community College, and Otsiningo Park by the Binghamton/Port Dickinson line.  It was spewing thick black exhasut only intermitantly as it flew.  To note&quot; the plane was only 1000 ft above the city.  After about 10-15 minutes of this, it flew off towards the NW over Endwell and Maine, NY. This is becoming a frquent occurance. The plane is usually grey with no symbols, tail color, or numbers on it.  Once it was seen as white with an orange tail.  I find these colors to be very peculiar.  About a year and a half ago, I saw this plane do the same thing even lower over the city.  It was a warm day, and I had the window open.  It was spewing out the same thick smoke.  After a little while, I started to have throat iratation, and sinus pain.  Very unusal for me.  Is anyone else seeing this? Please let the world know. By the way, this plane comes around whenever there is UFO activity in the area like Bainbridge and Vestal in the last month.  Also, when this plane is around, there are no other aircraft in the sky, and Binghamton is 5 miles from a regularly used airport that services major cities.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

The light was in a reversed triangular pattern coming from the object. A commercial aircraft started to approach the area and immediately the brilliant solid white light went out and all I could see was a very faint white light moving quickly forward towards the approaching commercial aircraft. It actually passed the commercial aircraft but at a much higher altitude. I finally lost sight of the object as it was traveling away faster and in the opposite direction of the approaching commercial aircraft. I had a chance to compare object to the commercial aircraft as they passed and noted no flashing lights and no sound. I did hear the sound from the commercial aircraft and of course it had flashing lights.

The light was so blinding that I held my hand up to shield my eyes while trying to figure out what the object we were seeing was. A police officer was also on the freeway, he was out of his car also staring at the object. The object did not appear to be moving, it was flashing its lights in a three on-off pattern.

It was close enough that I could see individual &quot;sparks&quot; coming off the tail. I immediately called 911 on my cell phone. It was heading from the north to the south at about a 15 degree downward angle and appeared to be on an approach path to Sarasota / Bradenton Airport. My work is immediatly behind the airport. I thought it was an aircraft coming in on fire. As I watched and spoke to the officer the tail got shorter and shorter until it was only the bright yellow ball. By this time it was directly in front of me on Tallevast Rd. At this point it appeared to stop moving. The yellow ball the split into 3 white lights in the shape of a perfect triangle. At this point I told the officer that he would think I was crazy and described to him what I saw. He told me that he had several other calls coming in reporting lights. The 3 lights then headed slowly away from me directly infront of me going east on Tallevast Rd. I followed Them for about 1.5 miles. The road was under construction and I could go no farther.

I am in southern Ohio and it would put this object over Africa or maybe the Indian Ocean or somewhere abouts in this region based on what I know about where the moon is when it rises in the east. It can be directly over Africa and be hanging in the lower eastern sky in Ohio.  The moon was about 60&deg; high to the east of this object in the east. I also remembered hearing on the a.m. radio of an asteroid scheduled to hit the earth but later discovered it was for the year 2029. I also heard something about this asteroid being so large that if it hit the ocean, it would cause a tsunami. So, I thought, if I hear of a tsunami on Christmas Day then it was an asteroid perhaps. I obviously got the 2029 asteroid and tsunami confused with what I thought was a prediction for an asteroid this week. Anyway, this is what I saw and it is my duty to report this siting.", "It was 4:25 a.m. on Wednesday 12/15/04 and I was preparing to set out for work. I had taken some water outside to de-ice my truck windshield and turn on the engine to allow it to become warm enough to use the heater. Having done so I went back in the house for a few minutes. Then I went back outside and was standing on my porch when I noticed some (?) clustered lights in the western hemisphere. I just figured it was a plane, however I stood there and watched these lights which appeared low on the horizon. After a couple of minutes they didn&apos;t seem to be getting closer, but neither did they appear to be getting further away. Then all of a sudden a single light (about half way between where I was located and where the other lights were)appeared and SHOT DOWN at an angle and then SHOT UP...IN A CHECKMARK FASHION. This particular light lasted only a few seconds. The clustered lights beyond this were still there. I was in shock...I have never seen this happen before! If it was a &apos;falling star&apos; it certainly wouldn&apos;t have shot up again!! I was in awe and shock of what I just witnessed. After a couple moments I got in my truck and headed for work. Within less than 1 minute after leaving (I was heading east), a plane was approaching from behind me and to my north and this plane was flying east. I couldn&apos;t see how this could be the same &quot;clustered lights&quot; I had seen previously because of the distance it had been during the sighting and it didn&apos;t seem possible it could have approaced me that quick. Even if they are one and the same it doesn&apos;t explain the other single light which shot down and up in the checkmark fashion!!", "V, Shapes with trails, then lights at corner making out a square in the sky, flashing, then rapidly moving to the center of the squareAt approximately 1 am on Monday, December 13th, in the Western sky away from Washington DC, several objects appeared in the skies above Arlington/Falls Church.  In the beginning, one could see a V shaped trail that moved at a speed much faster than a commercial/military type plane.  Moments later, in same area, one saw several lights flash, circle, and them move out in formation.  The lights would appear -- one in each corner of a square, and then move to the center, circle around each other in the center of the square, and then move back.  This occurred over a period of 45 minutes.  I could only say that the only reason I saw this was because my friend also witnessed the same thing...but in Falls Church.  He called me around 12:30 am to tell me to go outside and see if I am seeing the same thing he was.((NUFORC Note:  We note that the description provided by the witness is consistent with a sighting of rotating advertising lights.  PD))", "circular light pattern that flew off with great speed in formation with 2 Air Force Jets on its tail.It was the summer of 1981. I was on an overnight stay at Lake Travis just outside of Austin, Texas, with 3 other friends. I couldn&apos;t sleep for gazing at all the stars. They were beautiful as always. Sometime after midnight, I spotted lights flashing in a circular motion of red and green. They appeared to be about the distance of todays satellite&apos;s, in the sky just overhead of me. This was a popular campsite and probably 20 - 30 people were scattered over the entire campsite. I was camping on the East side of Lake Travis. I became fixed on the site immediately. After 1-2 minutes, they completed another circle and shot off out in to space in a straight line formation. As if to follow one another. The speed was incredible. So fast I lost them quickly as they left a short streak of light behind them as they disappeared in the night, some 30-45 seconds more. I woke my 3 friends with a start! Trying quietly and calmly to explain what I&apos;d seen. This took another 2-2.1/2 minutes. Suddenly, 2 Air Force Jets came flying very low and very fast over the campsite and woke up everyone there. They were extremely loud! We all held our ears for they were low. They flew up and towards the direction of the lights I had just seen going S-SW of the Lake. Everyone there witnessed the Jets. I had no interest in UFO&apos;s at the time, but I felt I had seen what the Jets were after. It was only years later when television began showing a number of shows about UFO&apos;s that I became curious about what I saw that night back in the summer of 81&apos;. Most sightings are near Air Force Bases or so I&apos;ve heard. Also, that military air vehicles are present at the time of other sightings. My best friend of 13 years at the time, (now 27 years) knew I wasn&apos;t joking about what I&apos;d seen, however, my other two friends weren&apos;t sure. Everyone knew about the Jets, though. I&apos;ve been looking up ever since.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Likely explaination for sighting in Lake Wales  1/24/2005Referencing the sighting reported on this date, I am very familiar with this area. The direction the folks were traveling (east) and the fact the wife sighted the lights to her right (south), this was most likely military activity over Avon Park Bombing Range. Flares are frequently dropped from high flying aircraft that float slowly on parachutes. The high altitudes and distance make the flares seem motionless without a reference.", "dark flying craft seen coming down to earth then slowly fly awayI was fly fishing on the south branch of the raritan river and the weather was partly cloudy. I just looked up at the right time and I saw a dark form coming down through the clouds. then all of a sudden it stops about maybe 1-2 thousand feet above the treetops. Then it slowly hovered in the direction down river. I estimate that I watched it for about4-7 minutes. This was in no way anything but some type of flying craft. It had no lights as it was as dark gray as it could be without being black and it had multiple windows around it&apos;s rim. The bottom did not constntly keep it&apos;s round shape but seemed to shimmy an shake like mercury dropped on the table. When it came down and stopped i thought i saw some type of wave in the air from the bottom. This really freaked me out! I could not keep fishing because I lost my concentration, so i sat on a rock along the river for the longest of time pondering this. As an amature astronermer years ago I had seen some strange lights in the sky at times but this thing was without a doubt a intelligently operated craft flown by someone from somewhere!", "Similar to previous night sighting, same time of day, same area of the sky.  Bright light over ocean.Very similar to previous night sighting, same time of day, same area of the sky.  Bright light appears out over the ocean, as if a light switch had been turned on.  It slowly moves from north to south for about 3 seconds and then, disappears, as if a light switch had been turned off.  About 5 seconds later, bright light reappears in about the same area it had previously disappeared.  It slowly moves again, from north to south, for about 3 seconds, and then, disappears.", "White 767 whith a thin cigar shape object trailing in the sky.I came out in my backyard in the day and saw a plain white plane (Probaly a Boeing 767.) Behind it was a thin cigar shaped white object whith a trail of smoke behnd it. Only a quiet humming noise could be heard. The plane and the object flew by slowly but when it was over my head, I went to get binoculars. When I came back after about 20 seconds, the objects were gone. Plane- no passenger windows or markings, white plane, like a passenger aircraft.Cigar object- it was very thin with white smoke trailing behind. THE OBJECT WAS NOT A BLIMP.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a refueling operation at high altitude.  Just a guess.  PD))", "4 bright objects taking turns going back and fourth as if playing a game.Me and sister were outside in the back yard looking at the sky. When first I  seen two lights in the sky. At first I didnt think much of it but then they started taking turns going back and fourth. then out of nowhere two more came and started doing the same thing. Me and my sister looked at each other and said if she seen it and she did. I was sure it wasnt an air plane. Because they cant go back and fourth.I watched them go past a tree and they had dissapeard. Knowhere to be found.", "Multiple types of objects in night sky of central Florida witnessed for over 3 hours.This could take a while...my sighting started at 7:30pm 1/15/05 and lasted until 11pm as I drove south on hwy. 301 from Jacksonville, FL.  As I drove S on 301 I eventually noticed an object in the sky SW of me far away and hovering.  One small red light on each side - distance was impossible to guess due to darkness and the small size of the lights, but they were maybe 2 finger-widths apart from each other at that time.  In the direct center of them at about 1 second intervals a white light blinked.  Alternately, above each red light (solidly lit at all times) a very small and fast white light would flash after the center white light would flash.  As I drove towards Ocala, FL on 301 this &quot;hovering&quot; object neither deviated in altitude nor moved from side to side...also, it never became smaller or dimmer indicating that it was moving farther from me as I drove and I was unable to catch up to it...basically, it became very conspicuous to me due to this because that meant to me that it was going the same speed as me and never varied.  Twice I stopped at gas stations on 301 to get a drink or hit the bathroom.  Each time I basically forgot about the object until I got back into my truck and back onto the highway.  Both times this object was still in the exact location of the sky and neither looking closer or further away from me, yet as I again would drive towards it at 70mph it still seemed to stay exactly the same distance from me no matter what. By now I&apos;m very much unsure that this could be a plane, helicopter or blimp...the lights just weren&apos;t right, plus it&apos;s odd way of staying in the same place all that time whether I was moving or not just seemed impossible and very improbable for a typical aircraft.  Then a second one appeared in the sky just down and to the W of the first one...hovering in the same way.  I say appeared because it didn&apos;t fly to that position but just appeared or turned it&apos;s lights on...same configuration of two solid reds, center white blinker and two blinking whites above the reds. These two objects stayed this way until I turned W on I think hwy 40 north of Ocala to head to I-75.  then instead of viewing them high up out of my windshield I had to look out my side window and up.  Not long after turning W the object that had appeared second very noticeably began to move W away from the first object, still hovering.  It seemed to be heading SW as it was definitely get smaller in size and much dimmer after a while, but the rate of it&apos;s movement was very slow and deliberate in a straight direction and I was able to view it for a very long time even when it was apparent that it was many many miles S of me. At the I-75 intersection I again stopped at a gas station.  When I came back out 5 minutes later the first object was still hovering and the second though still visible was definitely much farther to the SW but I could still see it&apos;s red lights and blinking whites. As I turned S on I-75 still watching these two objects I finally decided that I needed to tell someone about this because I just didn&apos;t believe now that these were typical aircraft.  So I called my girlfriend and described to her everything I&apos;d seen and thought up to that point asking her not to think I was crazy. I could still easily see the stationary object blinking away, and I could still see the one that had flown SW away from me.  At this point things went absolutely crazy and unbelievable and I kept my girlfriend on the phone as I described every event to her and I was completely shocked to be seeing what I was seeing...the next events happened almost directly over I-75 and also over the fields to either side E and W and all over the sky S of me as I drove S on I-75...and they happened for over an hour straight:  A very large, bright white object appeared in the sky to the SE of me on the E side of I-75...kind of far from the original object...however that object now began to move W and fly directly over I-75 out over the fields...still in some way looking the same size and brightness even though I was traveling at 65 mph towards it the whole time...very wierd.  At first I was thinking the new object was a planet or star...very large and bright white and not moving at all even though I was heading for it, which is was what made it seem like a star.  As I described to my girlfriend the red lighted object flying left to right in front of me, directly over the highway in the darkness straight to my S a very small white object blinked...then blinked again but easily 2 hand widths to the right...not being sure if it was the same object or a second blinking object at that time all of a sudden multiple white blinking objects  (I think maybe from 3 to 6 or so) began blinking all over in a group form right over I-75.  They weren&apos;t bright...small star type brightness and flashing very fast then maybe off for a second or so...but there were definitely more than 2 since I could see a group of them moving around flashing and then I guess appearing in other locations in the general area of the sky, so either very fast moving and in quick turns of direction or several of them...it was just hard to tell also due to oncoming headlights and also the intervals of very tall street lights messing w/ my eyes...plus it wasn&apos;t easy keeping my eyes on all this as well as the large semi-trucks and other vehicles that I was trying not to swerve into...I was pretty excited at this point and describing it all to my g/f at the same time. It appeared after a couple minutes that I did travel underneath the location of the fast blinkers and I couldn&apos;t see them anymore...during all of this I could now still see the constant hovering large white light plus now three of the red lighted objects moving back and forth to the S and SE and SW of me...moving in different directions very slowly and deliberately and not making any turns. One of these flew towards the large white light, and around this point my g/f said that I should just pull over but I didn&apos;t want to...about 1 minute later I passed a pick up on the shoulder of the hwy. and the driver was standing next to his truck staring up at the sky...it definitely looked like he was witnessing what I was...I just don&apos;t see how anyone could have missed the red objects, but the fast blinkers were very elusive unless you were paying attention as I had been. At this time the large white object began to move from E to W over I-75 (this was after the one red lighted object flew over near it&apos;s vicinity).  This really got me excited because now I knew it wasn&apos;t a star...it moved slowly and deliberately from left to right over the hwy to over the farm field area that borders the hwy.  At this point that white object most obviously turned due N to parallel the hwy. though off to my W. It then also decreased altitude so rapidly and sped so quickly towards me that the diameter of the light easily doubled in size and intesity...it actually shocked the shit out of me and I started yelling into the phone, I mean it almost looked like it rocketed down and towards me...it was amazing.  At that point I said screw it and hit the shoulder of the hwy and slammed on the breaks.  Unfortunately I stopped next to a small grove of pine trees blocking the view....but...and this is where I began to believe I wasn&apos;t seeing normal aircraft...This bright object had slowed down very slowly again...the very bright half moon that was out last night was above the object...the bright white light then dimmed almost off and at that time I could then see three tiny green lights in a slim triangular shape as if I was seeing the bottom of the craft at just a slight angle as if it wasn&apos;t quite perfectly horizontal and maybe angeling away from my point of view just enough to see underneath it.  Even better...due to the large bright white light going so dim and the slight illumination of the three green lights at the points of the triangle, I could easily make out the edges of the object connecting the green lights as a triangle...I saw this shape for about 1 second before the white light in the center turned on super bright like a beaming spot light towards me so that all I could see was a large white ball again and it was descending to the ground going behind the tree line I was parked at.  Or else it turned more W away from me making it look as if descending, but it was going lower in the sky either way and through the trees I could see it&apos;s bright light very easily.  I&apos;m conviced this was a triangular shaped object just as I&apos;ve always heard described on TV...I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes and was still describing this to my disbelief over the phone. The wind was hard that night and temps were probably 40 or less, so after this 5 or so minutes of exposure I had to jump back in my truck.  All this time there were still 2 or three red lighted objects either hovering or flying randomly in the sky to the S still.  I saw one tilt itself to a 45 degree angle as it hovered also and then go back horizontally. I finally got back on the hwy still watching the red objects and about 200 yards down the road the trees ended and everything openned up to a vast farm field...I could still see many objects out there so I pulled over again.  And again the sky went nuts with activity.  At one point I could easily count up to 6 red light objects flying in different directions from N to S and E to W and back again as I looked to the W towards the field.  Some flew at angles directly over me but it was impossible to tell their altitude or size...my hunch though was that they didn&apos;t seem much larger than a commuter plane...Cesna sized or something.  The triangle object was somewhat easier to tell it&apos;s distance from me at that point when the bright light dimmed allowing me to make out it&apos;s edges, and I bet it was not much farther than 1 or 1.5 miles...and since the lights seemed fairly close together I&apos;d guess each side was maybe 40/50 feet or so???  Maybe something like that.  Anyway, back to the field action... Along w/ all the red light objects directly to the W of me I saw so many fast blinking white lights zooming all over the place in a group...again it was just a crazy show.  They reminded me of when you can see a satellite fly over...that general size of light, like small star sized and the same whitish-blue color.  Only they flashed very quickly and then seemed to re-appear very quickly in another location...hard to guess how many due to their speed and randomness, but they were definitely out there blinking all over.  While all that was going on almost directly above me a red-lighted object appeared right up above me...very bright in color, so it seemed kinda low and larger since the red lights were definitely farther apart on this object...maybe not even a mile up, but I couldn&apos;t tell of it&apos;s shape like I could the triangle.  I don&apos;t know if it just materialized in that location or if it&apos;s lights were out and then just turned on, but it just appeared and then started to fly in a straight line to the SE of me...these things were everywhere and some would fly away to the S but then some would fly in from the N and they would criss-cross the hwy.  I can&apos;t believe people weren&apos;t seeing this, but I just don&apos;t know if they would notice it as odd like I did since I&apos;d been watching them for so long by this point.  I think this second stop on the hwy lasted about 20 minutes watching all kinds of activity...I was freezing and shivering almost uncontrolably by then, but refused to get back in my truck for risk of missing even more activity or something more spectacular.  But the fast blinkers seemd to disappear eventually, and the red-light objects decreased down to like 2 and were again hovering to the S of me.  So I got back in my truck and started S again. I&apos;ll tell you that by this point as exciting as it had been it started to get a little boring and even my g/f was ready to get off the phone with me and my descriptions...she just didn&apos;t want me to wreck my truck (I almost did several times though).  So I hung up with her.  I eventually didn&apos;t see anymore objects in the sky and was getting to around 40 miles or so from Tampa on I-75.  I was still in somewhat of shock or disbelief over all of this and decided to call one of my best friends to tell him all about it...I knew he wouldn&apos;t think I was lying or crazy. As I neared finishing my story of everything that happened one of the red-light objects appeared again very low and just to the SW of me on the freeway...just out of no where and bam there it was, and this was while my friend was still on the phone.  You could tell it was moving slightly to the W and then it began to roll into a 45 degree angle to the right and then it rolled back to horizontal and then to about 45 degrees angle to the left as it slowly flew W away from me.  I was able to watch it fly very low to the W until it disappeared from view. These things just weren&apos;t planes or helicopters...I was able to view them for such a long time that I&apos;m convinced they weren&apos;t airplanes, blimps or helicopters.  My main confusion is just that if these were secret government craft then why the hell fly them over a freeway with lights flashing and not in the desert of Nevada.  And if these were alien craft why the hell have all those lights on and be seen???  And also is there anyway to find out if they showed up on radar???  I didn&apos;t see any news of this today on the net or TV or radio, so I don&apos;t know what to think. I was even kinda ready to not think they were UFO&apos;s up until that freakin&apos; white ball zoomed like it did and then showed itself as a triangle for that second or so...that blew my mind to see a triangle after hearing about them on TV all these years...this was the most bizarre thing I&apos;ve ever witnessed, and as I searched tonight I found this link and decided to try and write it all down to you.  That&apos;s the whole story though...even though so much of it is like burned into my mind and I can still visualize what I saw and the sequence of events I still think I left some out because there was just so much activity going on at once for such a long time.  Sure wish I&apos;d had a video or something. That&apos;s it though.  I&apos;m going to copy what I&apos;ve written to you and post it on other sites if I find any worthy ones.  Maybe someone else who saw those things last night will stumble across my story and corroborate it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  thank you.

I stopped my rig on the side of the road to observe the object, turned off my engine and lights. Lucerne Valley, CA is in the middle of the desert so it&apos;s a very quiet and dark area located 30 miles East of the 15 in San Bernardino County. As I observed the object I noticed it had three red lights in formation of a triangle, it traveled at a good pace at approx 40,000 feet. It must of been very large because it seemed large. It was traveling from West to East. At 6:31 PM it stopped for about a minute and the lights turned in a circle twice, at 6:32 it began traveling East once more, I also noticed that it would block out stars in the back ground as it passed them by. By 6:34 PM the object became very faint in the western horizon to continue observing it, additionally, this was a very clear cold night and I also heard no noise from this craft at all. I took all of these notes to have a more precise report, I frequently watch the skies, and have seen many others in the past, but this is the first one I am reporting.", "On the night of Dec. 13th while watching the meteor shower, I saw a large, silent, and completely dark object travel across the sky.While out watching the meteor shower, I noticed a distortion in the sky.  The sky was clear, no clouds in any direction.  I noticed something traveling through the sky from south to north over our town.  I was able to track the object because the stars would disappear from view as it traveled in front of them and then would reappear as the object moved on.  The object was completely dark.  There were no lights anywhere on it, at least as seen from my angle of view on the ground.  It made no sound, despite its large size.  I waited for several minutes after it was out of sight for a delayed sound, but I never heard anything from it.  Its altitude is difficult to determine; however, it appeared to be at least several thousand feet high.  Its size was about 6 times as large as what a 747 looks like when it is at 30,000 feet.  When the object was near overhead, I was able to make out its shape against the sky despite the fact that both sky and object were dark.  It was roughly oval or egg shaped, but had a pylon or similiar structure on either side of it.  I tracked the oject for about 15-30 seconds as it moved from about 40 degrees above the southern horizon, overhead and off to the north until it was obscured from view by the trees across the street from my house.

I then informed security at my work and when they arrived they too were in amazment and could not explain what they seen ..... there were no lights emitting from the ground up ..... no sound of any aircraft in the sky and no explanation of how or where this brilliant white light was comming from ....... quietly moving in this pattern .....

These lights were moving very fast and not in any pattern of any known aircraft.", "Has anyone else in RI, CT or MA seen this?I have seen this light in the night sky since the summer of 2004. I see this light in the south eastern sky after dark on a very regular basis, any night that is clear it is about 40 degrees above the horizon. The light at first glance looks like any other star but if you fixate your eye to the other stars in the area, this one twinkles more AND it has motion up down and left right. The color as best I can describe is like a police car light bar red/white/blue at great distance. I can&apos;t tell how far away the object is. I have observed this light with 2 other witnesses at different times. I do not think it is a planet, air craft or satellite. I do see aircraft in the sky occasionally when I see this object. My guess would be that it can be seen from Connecticut and Mass also. It would seem that the object could be off the coast over the Atlantic Ocean but I cant be shure of this. I would like to hear if anyone else from the RI, CT or MA area has seen this.", "Hi Mr. Davenport: Just spoke to you about the &quot;meteorite&quot; that I saw or think I saw last night,Dec. 13, 2004 at approximately 10:15 to 10:30 pm.  I was out walking my dog, came to a spot on the bluff where I can see the Sound clearly as well as the mountains and across to the Olympic Peninsula.  The sky was scattered with clouds, probably mostly clear, but as I looked to the West, I could seen an extremely bright object fiery object, the size of a baseball, that seemed to come from above a low-lying cloud and shot downwards from a slightly easterly direction toward the West.  My impression was that the object must have hit the water somewhere west, beyond the midpoint between West Seattle and Bainbridge Island.I could not clearly see where in the water it landed, mainly because there are some trees that would block my view, but as you said to me, and as I ponder it more, it seemed that it fell down below the horizon line.  At one point, I was certainly above it.  It took no more than a couple of seconds to move out of my sight down toward water.  I now wonder if it may have been something that fell off a plane or was shot up into the air and fell downwards?  The reason I say this is because of what you said to me in our conversation:  it made no sound or if it did, it was not much of one.  It was, however, very bright.  I looked around the water and saw a ferry crossing from Bainbridge Island going toward Seattle.  The boat was past where it might have landed, in my mind&rsquo;s eye anyway.  I even checked with the ferry service to see if anyone reported it from the boat.  None of the TV news stations had any reports.  What did I eat??? It did not seem that it was something the trajectory of which would indicate that it had been shot up and then fell back to the earth.  It had a definite trajectory, east to west, and if it does not act like a meteorite, then maybe it was from an airplane.  It had that feel of something falling from the sky, not going up from earth and falling back down.  Does that make sense?  Also, if it were a flare, I would have easily heard the shot, and it didn&rsquo;t act like a flare.I know you&rsquo;re doing a show right now, but if you&rsquo;ve got any other ideas later, let me know.  It sure was fast and furious, the way it landed, or maybe didn&rsquo;t?!  And if it was a piece of airplane or space/satellite debris, then it was quite amazing too.Thanks for your time.((name deleted)), M.A., M.F.C.C., Psychotherapist ((telephone number deleted))", "We Saw Disc-Like Object, Flashing Bright Lights and Smaller Lights Dotting The SkyWe were on Hwy. 60 near River Ranch and Lake Wales, Fl when I noticed big lights on an object in the sky - it looked like a disk with lots of lights (window like) which was moving about 45 degrees from the horizen.  At this same time, I saw bright lights resembling a flare ( about a half-dozen) that sparked and then were gone.  In addition there were little lights flashing all over that area that reminded me of grasshoppers jumping from place to place. We tried to pull off of the highway in a safe place, finally found one and my husband got out the binoculars and by the time he got them adjusted, the disk-like object was gone.  However, I still saw the bright lights (a second time), and the little lights dancing around like grasshoppers were all over the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Wife&apos;s report of same event reported by husband.  Event was reported to have occurred on Monday evening, January 24, 2005.  We have amended the date above.  PD))((COMMENT FROM READER))Likely explaination for sighting in Lake Wales  1/24/2005Referencing the sighting reported on this date, I am very familiar with this area. The direction the folks were traveling (east) and the fact the wife sighted the lights to her right (south), this was most likely military activity over Avon Park Bombing Range. Flares are frequently dropped from high flying aircraft that float slowly on parachutes. The high altitudes and distance make the flares seem motionless without a reference.((END COMMENT))", "high traffic area in Arivaca, S.E. Arizona numerous sightings of up to six objects at a time and low altitude chaseThe area around Arivaca, Ariz. is well know by locals for wierd activity in the air.We commonly see objects from low to high level and witnessed one chased by two F-16 fighters. The object played with them out turning and out accelerating then slowing and letting them catch up then off he would go again. This went on for about 10 min. The fighters had to break off as they were under afterburner for most of the chase and had to be running low on fuel. Then the object shot straight up out of sight. We watched part of the show with Owl night vision glasses with magnification of 4X. The object, when watched by eye turned red-white-green repeatedly and was disc shaped.  What I am also reporting here are other sightings at higher altitude. When in the Arivaca area we have sat out at night and watched objects entering and exiting the atmosphere in  E.- W. N.-S. and S.-N. directions. Possibly going in and out of to Area 51? One night we watched six of them come in about 5 min apart on a S.-N. approach, except the last one was about 10 min later than #5. He skipped twice on the atmosphere we could see the flash and what appeared to be a short trail from the heat before he entered successfully and we watched as he followed the same route as the first five while slowly loosing altitude. We joked that he must have stopped at another party and had a bit of a problem with his drinking and driving. This is not the first time we have watched the high altitude objects that were clearly not planes or satallites. We have observed them changing directions 3 and 4 times in a period of 1-2 min. and then fly out in space until we couldn&apos;t see them any more with binoculars or have watched them come down to lower altitudes, you can tell when thay are dropping as they lose the suns reflection and are not as bright. I don&apos;t particularly want any type of chance contact. We have enough Illegal Aliens coming in from Mexico and causing problems without these. If anyone wants to take notice just get up in the mountains or out on the desert around Arivaca and keep your eyes open at night for high flying objects that emit no sound. Seldom have I gone a week without observing at least one of them-especially in the summer, of course thats when I normally sit out most of the time. Nights when the moon is down are the best but there seems to be more traffic when the moon is half or fuller making the objects more difficult to see.((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report, but it seems curious that NUFORC has received no other reports of this apparently dramatic event.  We would welcome other reports from anyone in the area who might have been witness to the event.

I happened to look up because of the beauty of the clear blue sky color, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed a craft moving very slowly northward.  It had no wings, no lights, but appeared to be a smooth oval except for an indistinguishable darker area around center - horizontally.  It semed to be about the height of the cloud bases.  The color was silver  or white reflecting the color of the sky.  I watched it saunter along for a few minutes, I turned my head, and when I turned back It had disappeared.

It was a relatively clear evening in that part of Miami and we eventually turned our attention to the constellation of Taurus.  Sometime between 8:51-8:53 p.m. that evening, while viewing the constellation without the aid of the telescope, a moving object traveling through that section of sky caught my attention.  I have seen shooting stars and satellites before and this did not resemble either.  It was like no sky object I had seen before.  I made sure my friend&rsquo;s attention was focused on the object as I asked him what he thought it could be.  It stayed visible for about 10 seconds as we discussed and tracked it in an east to west direction across the sky.  I dismissed the possibility that it was a plane since it moved much too swiftly, there was no engine sound, and had no noticeable navigational lighting.  My friend concurred.  It appeared to me to have what I describe as a dull, orange-red glow.  Its intensity and shape did not change as it passed over us.  It did, however, deviate slightly and rapidly from a straight line path two times before disappearing into the skyglow.  The object had a shape that was wider than it was long with a bulge in the center.  It traveled with the wider side oriented from north to south.", "Unseen Lights In The SkyI had my digital camera less than a week when I decided to take a picture of the multi-layered sky as a storm front was tracking into the are where I live. The storm was tracking nearly straight west to east and I was looking south down the line of the approaching storm. I only took one picture at that time and didn&apos;t see anything unusual flying in the sky. It took me a few days to even review the pic on my camera before I noticed something odd. It took me a couple of more days to get my camera&apos;s photo software installed on my computer, download the picture, and import it into Paint Shop Pro. The orginal picture shows two unusual lights in the sky, one dim one in the upper left and the obvious one in the upper right. All I&apos;ve done in Paint Shop Pro is to brighten the image, do a couple of zooms on the lights, and create a negative image of the light on the right side. The zoomed light on the right appears to me to have a energetic field around it, and the negative of it makes this look even more apparent. If these are actual objects, they would have to have been shooting upward into the dark storm clouds so fast that I never saw them. I&apos;ve seen my share of air traffic in the area, but with that storm rolling in, there wasn&apos;t a plane in the sky. Other than fighter jets, I&apos;ve never seen any aircraft flying upward at such steep angles, and never into a storm!

I have since had a cowardly object &quot;look my way&quot; on two seperate occassions. My opinion is that these objects move in a friction-less pathway(vacuum?)that is somehow created in an open environment. I can&apos;t help but feel like however and whatever is going on up there gives me a feeling of &quot;trouble on the horizon&quot; and short of grabbing a .50cal or whatever I can get my hands on and trying my best to &quot;get some&quot; or have &quot;my effect&quot; on their lives.

As I turned we all saw a formation of three lights in the western sky I would say anywhere from 1 to 5 miles from our location east of the town of Van Alstyne and about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon.  It could have been hovering anywhere between the airspace above town center and past highway 75 above the fields to the west.  It was a very clear night, no clouds and high visibility.  At first I thought it may have been a plane or 3 planes headed in our direction with landing lights on wich is strange because the flight path to DFW International Airport has traffic that usually heads east to west in our area.  What was unusually strange is that it did not move at all for at least 10 seconds and then all 3 lights faded simultaneously for about 5 seconds all in complete silence.  All four of us definately agree to this part of the description whereas the details are mixed.  I seem to remember that the topmost light in the middle was bright yellowish white much like an airliner&apos;s landing light while the 2 lights on the side where a duller blueish green much like a street light.  My friend and his dad seemed to remember the opposite with the greenish light in the middle and the white lights on the outside.  I did not see if there was anything in the middle while the friend and his dad seem to have noticed a dark triangle in between the formation of lights.  While the other friend vehemently belives that they were 1 or 3 airplanes they did not follow the normal patterns of any airplane I have ever seen in a low approach (I live just south of DFW airport and I am used to seeing exactly how airliners behave at low altitudes).  Also there were no port and starboard running lights or strobe lights and the other major detail, no sound.  I am thinking about reporting to the local news in the area because it would have to have been seen from the highway if not seen from the locals who where at the time throwing a Christmas parade and festival.

The craft stood on end but floated slowly down, it momentarily was surrounded by a slight puff of white haze, the rear of the craft was slightly rounded, recessed from the end of the wing tips of the triangle. The craft 1/2 rolled and banked showing it&apos;s top, which was the blackest, black I have ever seen. If it had a windshield it did not show, it&apos;s lines were very low and defined.

Each of the bright spheres emerged, i.e. faded in, one at a time until all three were easily visible. They appeared to be very different from normal aircraft lights. We know that there are several airfields in the area, but these were not wing or tail lights from any aircraft I know. I can usually recognize those types of lights, since I used to be in the Air Force and had worked in the aerospace defense industry. Shortly after they emerged, they began to fade out in the order they appeared.When they were visible, they seemed to have lined up in a straight line but were not evenly spaced apart. Along with these large bright lights we noticed what seemed to be dozens of smaller white lights flying around in no particular pattern that we could distingush. These lights were much smaller than the three big ones mentioned above but were even more intriguing to us. We noticed that these lights would streak across the sky from east to northwest, south to north, and west to east, some in a straight and level flight pattern, some in a random pattern. We saw some of these fly level and then suddenly shoot upward or downward vertically. I have never seen an aircraft move in this fashion. I know that the g-forces alone from such maneuvers would make it highly unlikely that these aircraft were ours. I could actually see what appeared to be contrails behind some of them at times.

When I used to live in Maple Valley Washington me and some good friends would spend a couple nights camping a few miles up some logging roads in a town known as cumberland. I believe the locals call it huckleberry hill its a left turn a bit passed kanaskat palmer state park, the gravel road winds its way up to a rock quarry where we usually stay. Around sunset a strange green meteor came from the east headed west and faded out around the olympic mountain range passed the puget sound. I thought that was strange but of course not strange enough to think twice about. We camped late into the night since none of us could sleep until around 3 to 3:30 am when oddly enough I became adventerous and bothered everyone to drive up further than we ever had into cumberland hills. We drove a nissan sentra datsun wagon up there so it wasnt in the best shape after climbing the 5 miles yet we agreed to to go anyway, about 1 more mile up and arrived where we now know as huckleberry point. More cities could be seen than before to the west, and to the south mt rainier stood with all of its valley. We all jumped out pretty excited that we had found such a spectacular view. we all had stood around for a couple of minutes when three lights appeared to the lower left side of Rainier. At first glance I mentioned that they were fast moving semis on a long straight gravel road because of the way they appeared. until the back 2 lights as though connected by a piece of elastic, sort of swung themselves passed the leading light and reformed into a straight line. they had to have been moving in excess of 400mph to move ahead of the other lights like that. They appeared to be a little brighter than any stars in the sky but looked like stars nonetheless. The lights traveled all the way across to the right side of the mountain and moved into position to form a triangle. the triangle as a whole then shifted to reveal two more lights and a half diamond shape was revealed, it tilted as a complete object that looked geometrically perfect so the poin of the shape faced the mountain, the light then flared bright red and all the lights seperated. the top light that turned red morphed into 2 lights, and the bottom sets of 2 stayed together....they acted fixed like a pair of eyes, and as they would wander around looking back and forth one eye would dissapear before the other as though they were giant  black heads with glowing eyes. One of the pair of lights then dissapeared behind a hill about 300 feet away and about 150 feet tall so the thing was close. What appeared over the hill still to this day makes me question reality. What we all described as a jelly-fish or octupuss the size of a blimp that was clear like glass with small lights running down along the tentacles and very bright lights for eyes.I became very frightened but calmed down as it just seemed to wander up check us out and float away. it sort of bobbed around as though it was propelling itself through water. after that all the lights pretty much appeared far away near the mountain moving from place to place, morphing into pairs of 1, 2 ,and 3 and then combining again.we watched them all night until  the sun came up all the lights returned to where the original diamond shape had first appeared and landed on a small hill that had been logged away. they appeared like little white dots in the day time occasionally catching the sun and shimmering like a s signal mirror. We all went down with plans to come up the next night with cameras and video tapes which we all had but none of them seemed to work. all we had was a disposable camera in which we snapped a few shots with of the lights the next night when they came out and wandered around again but all the pictures came out completely black with stripes of light going completely across the picture where a dot of light should have been.  we kept going up for many months until it eventually became expensive to keep doing so but we all had many encounters with these entity&apos;s. I now live in california, this all took place last summer of 2004. Though I recently went camping with a buddy and around 2 am a bright light appeared on the side of a hill about a mile away, seperated into 2, and they both started wandering around until they reconnected and dissapeared. Seems as though they remembered me as I do them. Anyway this is all very true and I have read of many similar sightings especially a place called sattva sanctuary. they have videos of some of the EXACT things I saw during all my visits  P.S. we found out there is a highway running through where we witnessed the sighting and after a few days could destinguish cars running along the highway with these things floating above them as though they were chasing them. At times what we thought were planes because of the way they moved steady and blinked with colored lights but either vanished in thin air or moved right towards the lights and dissapeared into them. we had flashlights and tried to signal them by turning them off and on in timed patterns which seemed to catch their attention and other times not. The flashlights would always have trouble turning on and off even with new batteries. And most importantly one thing we did Notice whenever we screamed EX: &quot;Hey over here!&quot; the entity&apos;s would follow our echoes as we heard them bouncing through the valley. Everytime we all screamed loud enough for their to be a good echo all the lights would stop what they were doing and all move toward the sound. Its been awhile since the even and I saw so much of them its hard to distinguish everything properly I believe I have submitted these encounters before closer to when they happened.  EVENTS THAT SEEM SIGNIFICANT BUT MAY OR MAY NOT BE ATACHED TO THE DEFINATE SIGHTINGS. I remember after the meteor appeared, I found a old piece of card board paper around midnight at the edge of the campsite I picked it up thinking how odd it was to find litter and the the two M&amp;M&apos;s guys were standing on one side of a rainbow and a pot of candy at the end. and below it read &quot;See you on the other side,&quot; which meant nothing at the time but the next day I kept thinking about how that was some sort of subliminal invitation. Though I accept that this could be my own delusional thoughts after witnessing something so profound. Also when the lights first made a half diamond and pointed the tip towards the mountain I said &quot;the mountain is gonna explode?&quot; and then the top light flared red.this could also be coincidence but is worth mentioning. I remember having a thought in connection with the idea that the mountain was going to explode and the top of the half diamond flaring red. They appeared to be jelly fish with intentions to imply that the mountains eruption would go all the way to puget sound and extend it all the way to Mt. Rainier. This could be my own rationalization as to what happened since the idea of real floating jelly fish seemed impossible even staring right at them. The Next morning when we were driving down, we saw a total of 8 red identicle ford rangers heading up towards where we camped. All the fords had a logo of a road with a leaf on it, I think it stands for custom built or something. that was more cars then we had ever seen heading up to cumberland at one time. Also I noticed Weyerhaeuser has a very unusual method of cutting timber unusually close to the northern base of Rainier. Somebody mentioned that weyerhaeser cuts trees in triangular patches so the wildlife can run to the strips of trees inbetween the triangular gaps. This also is possibly coincidental but there were literally hundreds triangles spread across the valley.  During the day where the lights had landed me and one other may have seen a white dot dodging in and out of the treeline but it was too far away to tell.  we brought groups of people up during the months we saw these things they didnt seem to act up as much with larger groups of about 10 or so but I think it was an equal shyness between the people and the UFO&apos;s but they always managed to show off a little. It seemed as though the ufos were alive with emotion and curiosity attemtping to mimick things they saw and interact with us. at times they come very close but appear very small. and sit and hover for hours rocking back and fourth atleast 100 yards away. One of the original 4 people claimed that when the big jelly-fish peered over the hill for the first time the first night what he claims to be a floating fish with fins all the way down its sides and no fins ontop or bottom like an eel passed right through him. I remember him saying it happened and having trouble breathing but none of us saw it and were standing right next to him so that is also inconclusive. Many months before this event happened and had never driven passed the quarry because we assumed it was the highest campable place to drive to without a truck. Late that night what appeared to be infrared goggles clicked on and off over one of the side of the quarry, we all ran up to investigate and when we did someone had run by with a what looked like a potatoe sack with no markings full of sand and slit it open over the fire. when we all looked back the fire was out and we could hear several people moving around the campsite. they also managed to collapse the tent puncture every single can of soda and water we had and slit the rim of the tire so it exploded about 4 minutes after we passed kanaskat state palmer. 2 days later we drove back up with guns because we we all scrambled out of there leaving my friends 6 person tent which was strung up perfectly even though it was torn down when we left also all the small trees that were around the outside of the quarry were cut down and replanted around the tent. we looked around and what appeared to be body sized holes with caps made of woven brush and mud. My mother says before I was born she used to camp with my dad up in the same area when he went hunting and one night a bunch of people with night goggles circles the camp and put out the fire and tore all their gear apart. She filed a report about it and the police said there had been a few cases of what seemed to be secret army operatives playing war games on unsuspecting campers. Supposedly their is a ranger base around where we camped and saw the sighting. All I know is this even was too strange to not mention since it only happened a few months before the sighting.   ALL OF THOSE THINGS CAN BE PASSED OFF AS MY OWN COMMENTARY AND CONCLUSIONS,     NOT CONCRETE DETAILS OF THE ACTUAL EVENTS. I HOPE THIS EVENT BRINGS LIGHT TO THOSE WHO GAVE WITNESS TO SIMILAR EVENTS BUT DIDNT WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF BEING A FOOL.OF COURSE AFTER MY OWN PERSONAL TIME SPENT WITH THESE BEINGS I NOW KNOW THE ONES WHO DONT BELIEVE ARE THE FOOLS.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We drove over a hill on I-70 and saw 2 lights in the sky.  We were both immediately drawn to them, and we assumed that it was just a plane.  I commented on the size of the plane considering how far apart the lights were.  We kept watching it and realized that it was not moving.  My friend said that it must be an airplane tower, but as we kept driving we realized that it was directly over the highway and it was not moving.  All we saw was two lights until we were directly in front of it when we realized that it was a ufo.  It was very flat and cylindric and sort of a gray color.  We were both mesmorized by it and everything seemed to just stand still.  The entire trip it had been very windy and the car was knocked around a lot but for the time that we were driving underneath this the wind stopped, there didn&apos;t seem to be any weather or temperature.  Neither of us were even paying attention to driving, we were just staring upward at this ship.  As we entered the middle of it it went up into a dome.  There was a flashing red light at the center of the dome, and I don&apos;t remember anything after that until we were a few miles away.  We then noticed that there were a lot of lights in the sky and we could still see the ufo in the air behind us.  THe new lights turned out to be a swarm of army helicopters that were all formed together throughout the sky all headed toward the ufo.  I watched the ufo sit there, and then all of a sudden shoot up directly into the sky.  It zoomed around the sky for a while shooting back and forth, almost like it was messing with the helicopters.  It would come right back down to being 200 feet off the ground right behind our car and then it would shoot back up in the air.  We then pulled over and got a hotel room once the ufo vanished for good, but for and hour afterward we saw the apache helicopters in the sky in the same place the ufo was.  There were alot of police officers out also that night zooming down the highway in the same place the ufo was.  My friend had his window down when we went underneath it and when we arrived at the hotel we noticed that he had what looked like a bruise on his face and we were both nauseaus and had very bad migraines.  We took blood tests to test for radiation poisoning and both were inconclusive.  My friend didn&apos;t sleep for 3 days after this happened.  Also the same night that we saw it we heard very unnatural things in the air all night, sounds that we have never heard before and things that we can&apos;t explain.  The next day my friend and I checked our cell phones to see what time this had occured, since we had made several phone calls and received several in that hour timeframe, and found that our cell phone call list had been deleted.  The calls made before 7pm were still in there and the calls made after 10pm were in there, but the calls during that time were not even in the record.  Also 1/2 tank of gas was gone for some reason.", "i was just taking pictures of night view with my digital camera, and i suddenly realized that i took a picture of UFOit was the first day of year 2005, well, today&apos;s daybreak. i and some of my friends went to the bridge preparing to see the 2005&apos;s first sunrising. i arrived a little bit earlier, so we were playing and taking some pictures. and, suddenly, i realized that the picture i took, was not a simple night view picture, but a UFO picture! it was forming a figure of circle, or egg, i dont know how can i explian it better. but it was so strange, it had some auras of two colors. by one side, it had a orange light and by other side it had a blue light. i took various pictures without realizing that i was taking pictures of UFO. i think they were various because i took those picture at several minute intervals. some of my pictures show their shape vaguely, but i got a picture that shows its shape almost perfectly. and that same picture i could see some other gray shapes that i thought that were effects caused by bad condition of the camera(lens), but now i think differently. the camera was in perfect condition so it had absolutely no problem with its lens, and above all those gray shapes were forming COMPLETELY SAME figure with the clear one, just with different size. i think it caused by the distinct distance between the camera and them. before taking this picture i was doubtful of UFO&apos;s existance, but now i can believe in that.(sorry if there were some grammatical mistakes or expressions not fluent, please consider that im a foreigner)", "Silent flying rectangle with lit windows at dusk close to the ground out in the desert flying in the direction of White SandsI don&apos;t remeber the exact time or day, but I was on my way home from work in Albuquerque, NM.  It was dark enough I could see a slight reflection from my dashboard console but still light enough my headlights were ineffectual.  I was about 15 to 20 minutes outside of Socorro, NM on southbound I-25 which is essentially in the middle of the desert.  I suddenly noticed something in the air off to my upper left.  It was close enough I could see the outlines of windows.  It was shaped like a rectangle with rounded corners and I saw no wings, props, etc.  It was proportioned like a candy bar.  It looked like it may have been indented around the middle, but I was unable to really focus on it as I was travelling at 80 mph.  The windows were rounded squares and the light coming out looked to be from an incandescent source (i.e. - it looked like the light that comes from residential homes&apos; windows after dark.   slightly warm-looking or yellowish).  When I saw it, I realised I was able to see the windows clearly, but I could not hear it, nor did I hear it approach.  It seemed to be on a slighlty disconverging path with the interstate, travelling in a south east direction.  I kept glancing back to the road to make sure I wasn&apos;t going to hit anyone, but that stretch of highway is pretty deserted, so I was able to look at it several more times as it slowly pulled ahead and farther to my left.   There are several small road cuts which blocked my view of it&apos;s location in the sky for a few seconds (somewhere between 5-10) and when I could see that portion again, it was gone.   Absolutely gone.  For the rest of the drive, I kept an eye to it&apos;s presumed trajectory in the sky.  Suddenly I saw it again MILES from where it had been.  When I relocated it, it was a tiny speck, but I&apos;m sure that was it.  It was in empty sky space (no towns, airplanes, etc.) and then it was gone again.  I&apos;m not sure if it flew out of my line of sight, if I just couldn&apos;t see the lights anymore or if it just disappeared like it did behind the road cut.  I do know it was flying in the direction of White Sands.  A bit about me:  I&apos;m a graphic designer and I am going back to school to get my geology degree, I have no history of hallucinations,  my husband is an engineer.  Every day for 18 months my commute to and from work took me directly under the flight path into and out of Kirtland Airforce Base, so I am famliliar with what jets that can move that fast sound like and look like in flight, in both day, night and dusk conditions.  One more thing I know, for 18 months, I cannot recall seeing aircraft flying the same flight path except for about a week or so after I saw &quot;it&quot;.   My final thought:  I don&apos;t know if what I saw was alien or not, but it did seem to stay close to the road longer than it need to, almost as if it wanted me to see it and get a pretty good look at it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I watched this object spin for about 10(?) seconds and not believing what I was seeing, I leaned forward and to the right to convince myself it was not a reflection.  I could clearly see that the object was 3 dimentional and could see the bulkhead behind it.

At about 21:14 when a plane flew over us (while well beneath the &quot;red star&quot;) it seemed to pass the object in question, but then the &quot;red star&quot; looked as if it flew away or simply fell with gravity toward the earth and faded out.

We sighted the light as we approached middle country road the lightlooked as though it was at an extremely low altitude it scame out of no where i thought it was a plane flying low and about to crash. I was truely frightened upon the site of it.

We were so astonished by what we saw we decided to turn around about a quarter mile up 83 to inspect the parking lot where we thought this greenish-blue light had decended into. We found nothing out of the ordinary. This object traveled south to north at what appeared to be decending at a very low altitude. I would say around 100-200 ft in the sky and about 3-5 ft diameter. This only happened a short while ago and I still have goosebumps..The light actually vanished before it came near the ground but it seemed as though it would crash. I found no evidence of any impact in the parking lot where we thought it might have landed. We went back over the same route we traveled when we saw it to make sure what we saw was no glare or anything from a traffic light or something...even though we both saw the light decending clear as anything. We detterminded that we saw the light aproximatly 20 feet before the left turning lane for middle country road on route 83. The skies are unusaully clear. no clouds at all.

Driving home on US Rt.40 near Brier Hill Pennsylvania I witnessed a fairly large saucer shaped craft just hanging about three fourths out of a cloud that was just a little bigger than the craft. The ceiling I would have estimated to be about 3 to 5 thousand feet. I couldn&apos;t exactly estimate the size but, there was a farmhouse below and the craft looked about the same size as the house about 50ft across. Given the altitude - the craft must have been a couple times the size of the house. I saw the craft for 15 seconds or more. I viewed it as I traveled towards it going east to west on Rt. 40. Almost wreaked my car, ran off the road before I could stop. When I stoped and looked back up the craft was just disappearing into the cloud. The craft was flat black in color and was a classic flying saucer shape. Like two pie pans welded together as in the drawing enclosed. The ouside edge was sharp looking and the sun reflected off it like the paint was worn off and the metal was showing. The upper surface and the lower surface were flat with a concentric ring which was only slightly raised. If this thing was in the night sky you would not see it, beautiful design, very simple and clean. The surface was smooth and there were no visible antennas or windows showing. Although I saw the upper surface and the lower surface as it went into the cloud, I did not see any lines for hatches or doors for gear etc. There was no noise comming out of the cloud and it just seemed to drift with the other clouds in the area. I watched the cloud for a few minutes and then went home in amazement. Though about going back to the area with a camera but, I couldn&apos;t be sure of which cloud contained the craft, pictures of clouds wouldn&apos;t carry much weight.

It was a clear blue sky.   Our home was in the town of Teaneck in northern New Jersey which is just 3 or 4 miles west of Manhattan.   The cylinder was traveling in the direction of its long axis.    It was blunt or squared off on both ends.   It gave the impression of being at the altitude of a jetliner (Boeing 707&apos;s were just beginning to fly around 1957).     But of particular interest was that the cylinder was followed by a gold colored circular object that was about one length of the cylinder to the rear.   Both objects traveled in tandem.    The circular object was no wider than the width of the cylinder.   At first I thought it might be Sputnick and the booster that put it in orbit.     Besides the fact that the round object was following the cylinder, I also knew that Sputnick was too small to be seen by the naked eye.   I knew it wasn&apos;t an aircraft since it was not tapered in the front and rear and in addition there were no wings visible.    Years later I read that cylindrical shaped UFO&apos;s had often been observed with disc shaped UFO&apos;s that were sometimes seen entering or leaving the cylinder UFO.   I&apos;d guess this was one of those cylinder &quot;carrier&quot; UFO&apos;s with an accompanying disc.  It would be very interesting if others also observed this cylinder UFO in the greater NYC area in the fall of 1957.    I come from a family of scientists and engineers (my dad was a MIT grad) and I love science myself so I believe I am a reasonably objective observer.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

No one has taken me seriously because I was so young and could not recall the exact year though I know it was 1975 0r 1976. I remember it was 8pm and my brother and I were having a stick fight (like a sword duel) outside of the house when my Mother (now deceased) went into the house. While we were playing I noticed a light in the sky and pointed it out to my brother. Within a blink of an eye it was close to 200 feet away from our road and then it dipped down and hovered over our driveway in front of us. Now it was about 20 feet away from us and it looked like a meteor with craters and it changed from orange to white then to red. It was about the size of a volkswagen bug. It hovered there for a couple minutes and made no sound, absolutely silent. I asked my brother what it was and he said he didn&apos;t know. My brother was 7 or 8 years old at the time, but I recall the UFO better than him. I asked my brother, what if aliens come out of it? That&apos;s when we ran to our door which seemed to be locked. My Mom opened the door and said it wasn&apos;t locked. We never saw the UFO again but I recall not getting much sleep that night. Years later I looked in the Newtown Bee (a local newspaper) for articles about it, because others had been witnessing UFOs at the same time, I came up empty handed. I knew it was in the paper because my Mom told my brother and I that it was published. I know I don&apos;t recall dates and ages well but the UFO itself was real and I remember it like it was yesterday. I hope this helps others who may have witnessed the same object in Newtown. I know it WASN&apos;T a meteor because it would have made quite an impact in our driveway.

This meant that the vehicle would be over 50000 ft above sea level to be visible. This incident simply confirmed to my father what he had full believe in, that life did exist outside of planet earth.  For the rest of his life until his pasing at 98 years of age, he tied this sighting to an event that took place in 1924 when he did most of his flying up the coast of British Columbia.  That year his comrade was lost in Sept  on a flying patrol up the coast to Prince Rupert, and they set out to try and find him in an old Cutris H2SL flying boat. After a day of unproductive searching they flew into an olf fishing village at Bella Bella, where they had fuel stored, and a wharf.  They tied up for the night in the small harbor, and were awaken at 02:00 hrs by the sounds of gushing water.  In the harbor, lit only by moonlight was a killer whale, with floating bebris nearby.  My father armed with his 3030 went down to the warf where the whale has made his way along side.  They made eye contact for a few seconds, a profound moment in my fathers life, the whale retreated leaving the debris exposed, where the log book of the downed flying boat was retrieved.The ebbing tide then took the rest of the debris out to sea and the whale disappeared.  The search was over, however this event which I was told about since I was a kid, coupled with the UFO sighting in 1966, convinced by father that the forces which produced the UFO where the same as those that directed the whale to the village.  I have attached a photo taken in 1924 of dad and his flying boat.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I was driving a tractor/trailer, (Automobole Transporter), southbound on I-4,south of downtown Orlando. As I came to an overpass, I saw at the extreme East side of the overpass a UFO, that had apparently moments before lifted off the ground, because it was very low and moving slowly.  I got on the radio and said, &quot;Does anybody see that?,&quot; and there was no reply.  I worked it out in my mind as to what it could be other than what it appeared to be, and there was nothing of manmade origin that it could be other than some kind of holographic projection from an aircraft or satellite.It appeared to me to be approximately 35FT in diameter. And it was not shiny, nor illuminating light. In fact it was the exact opposite of the typical UFO story, the craft was a color of beige, brownish red. It was sporting and shotrt strut like antenae, that had about a 80 degree bend at the elbow. Also, the harder I looked at it the harder it was to see it in crystal clear clarity, it was as if there was some kind of energy field around it. There existed a certain blurr to it, though not to the point of obscuring it. Again, this is in broad day light and it is at low altitude. The craft actually passed over me, movong from my left to my right. I exited off at the next exit and saw it still. It was moving along I-4 toward Orlando. There were condo units that it was moving toward. The whole thing was unbeliveable because it moved low and slow, (i.e., 50 mph?). It move higher than when I first saw it, which is why it appeared to me to have just lifted off. The area where it would have lifted off from is woody. I have no strange tales of alien abduction to share, nor  seeing at little green men. I saw what I saw, and it was real, not imagination, and not man made.  Remarkably, I attempted to write it off as anything but what it was. Barring a holograhic projection, it was an alien craft of unknown origin.  The antenae was the same color as the rest of the craft.  It was by trying to see the see the detail of the antenae, that was on the side of the upper part of it, that I first decerned that it possessed a blurr to it, as if it emanted an energy feild of some sort. and it was just enough blurr to obscure 100 percent visual acuity.The color was odd to me for is contrary to typical UFO sightings? Was it camouflage? It&apos;s color closely resembled typical Florida roofs and ground terrain.Not much is it? But it is what I saw. No big deal. What I found interesting in retrospect is that it apparently did not give two bits for our interdiction capabilities, it was was low, slow, and in your face. Always thought if I ever saw a UFO it would be at night, never did I ever believe that I would see one like I did, in broad daylight near a major city. 35 ft. diameter does seem conducive to what we know of the requirements for interstellar flight, so where does it come from?  To me, in truth, man is technologically speaking, retarded. What we think is laughable. For here is a craft that defies the intellect of our monkey scientists, who would say it does not exist because our understanding prevents it&apos;s existence. Apparently, the occupants of the the craft I saw possess a different viewpoint.  Most scientists are waking talking  boobs that are indoctrinated in schools of learning from our masters, and therefore possess no independent thought.  They are unable to think beyond the confines of what they were rotely taught, and as such - a typical scientist is a boob. So spare telling me what I saw was impossible because it defies are science??????   And then these self appointed scientist rubes will say because it defies our monkey science then it must have been imagined?

My boyfriend looked back up at it, now above us, and said it was a black triangle shape. It made no noise and emitted no trail, and it also blacked out the stars behind it. It was approximately 70 feet in width and only about 50 feet above the ground. we ran in the house and were too afraid to venture outside to see if it had left.There was also a second sighting of the same lights/craft in the same location about a week and a half later, seen solely by my boyfriend.((NUFORC Note:  Date of the incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "Star-like lights moving in incredible and unorthodox waysIt was a very dark night in rural Kentucky.  I was at a festival on a farm, with several hundred people in attendance.  The sky was cloudless and no city lights interfered with the view.  I was standing on a hillside and looking out over a small valley with another small hill dotted with trees about 200 to 300 yards away.  Above the trees I could see a sky full of stars, some bright, others dimmer, and many others that faint speckled color you get on such clear and crisp evenings in the autumn and in rural areas.  As I looked up into the sky, I noticed that an object the size of a dimmer star was moving, but in an up and down, back and forth, and &quot;s&quot; like fashion.  And, it was moving as if it was like a laser pointer in that it was not the speed of an airplane but simply too swift and too unorthodox.  After it caught my attention, I watched some more and tried to fix on it so get to an approximate distance.  What was really curious was that it seems to be &quot;among&quot; the stars but if that were true, it was moving at 100&apos;s of light years a second, which was simply both impossible and most likely to be measured by every astronomer on the planet.  It clearly had to be within earth&apos;s atmosphere, or just on the edge of space.  On the other hand, if that was the case, and using either the speed of high altitude plants or satellites as a gauge, it was moving over a few 100,000 miles per hour, which was impossible both because of lack of technology and its maneuverability.  It seemed &quot;playful.&quot; When I concluded this, I noticed a second light that it seemed to be playing with.  They would chase, do the loop-the-loop, squiggle, zig-zag (but not with sharp angled cuts), and move otherwise chaotic or seemingly randomly.  After about 10 minutes I was convinced I was seeing something, but still wanted to confirm what I was seeing was real, or at least could call on one witness later on to confirm it.  I called a friend over and pointed it out to him.  He too saw them, stood for a minute, remarked on how curious they were, but then left to chat up a female near a bonfire.  I stayed and watched some more.  I guess that they had to be about 20-30 miles away but this guess still played havoc with the idea that they seemed equal size or visual appearance to a somewhat faint star.  Whatever they were, they were there, they were not airplanes, helicopters, satelites, or weather balloons.  They did not hover.  If they moved slowly like an airplane one would not have noticed them.  But, from the place I was at, they also were faint enough not to draw attention from the crowd.  No other details could be made expect that they were lights moving in incredibly unorthodox fashion and did so for about 20 to 30 minutes...maybe longer, but then I remember the women over by the bonfire and went to join them.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "The light was vey strange and it remained there for about 3 minutes or so and then dissappeared in the skyI was observing the stars on the sky with naked eye when i saw a strange light that flashed again and again(on and off)at the same spot for about 3-6 minutes and it was quite large to be called as a star and then it started moving away from me(upwards) and then dissappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

USA at 9:30pm ESTI was driving home after work, approx. 9:30 est, heading west. I had seen unusual looking lights pretty far out to the southwest; they caught my eye, and i sort of kept an eye on them, off/on for a few miles. They had an unusual shape/were sort of a greenish tint. There were a few cars on the road with me for awhile. As I neared home, all the cars I had been traveling with left the road, and I was alone traveling west, about 3-4 min. from home. The area I live in is in the country, but not desolate. There are quite a few homes, separated by fields/large lots. There was almost a full moon.  As i approached an intersection, suddenly the lights seemed to come right toward me,fast,then slowed down and went right across the road, in front of me,about 20 or 30 feet above the road,and then stopped and hovered above a field.There is a section of trees about 30 or 40 feet high running parallel to the field.The trees hid most of the craft;when it went into the field, an incredibly bright light flashed for about a minute or so.The craft seemed to turn around. I could see enough from where i stopped to see that. It was like a greenish white huge, oblong shaped light...as bright as a laser. I didnt know what to do. I was petrified and thought that if i went forward, God knows what would happen to me. So i pulled up into a driveway that was nearby. Two houses were there with their lights out.I turned my lights/radio off and tried to sit very still. The light went out and the craft lifted slowly up over the trees toward me. i looked up and saw underneath the  craft. It moved very slowly. It was black and triangular shaped with a rounded sort of nose. It was about 60 feet wide.with green lights spaced equal distances apart.There were lines, black lines underneath. It hovered over me for about 5 min, mabey less. It didnt make any sound at all. Finally, it moved slowly on toward the east.I watched it go for a few minutes and then got the courage to tear out of there and go home. I have been unable to get the images out of my mind.I was so scared/in utter disbelief at what was happening that i put the car into reverse andbacked up without looking.", "A color-changing, spark-like migrating light in the western sky -- seen in Reno, NVAt midnight, I was standing outside facing west and noticed a bright light that seemed to be a star.  I watched for several seconds, as the brightness intrigued me.  It seemed that the &quot;star&quot; was changing colors: red, blue and white.  I went and got my binoculars.  Looking with binoculars, it appeared as a bright light, changing colors routinely from red, blue, white and occasionally all white, and then back to red, blue and white.  My husband came out to view it at my request at this point.  He noticed that it also appeared to be changing shape and size.  When it changed size to smaller, the lights tended to converge.  The object at first appeared to remain stationary in the sky (while still changing size).  I stood in one spot on my deck and made note of the surrounding background (i.e., a neighbor&apos;s pin-oak tree, where I noted the object in relation to the branches, and to determine whether it was moving.)  My husband and I continued to view this from 12 am to after 1:15 am.  After the first 15 minutes of viewing, it gradually &quot;migrated&quot; further to the right, so that after 1 am, it was far to the right of this pin-oak that I had used to &quot;measure&quot; this &quot;star&quot; and give relevance to its location.  It started to become more red and orange in color, and around 1:25 it was gone, seeming to have &quot;migrated&quot; beyond the mountain range to the west of Reno.  We made note of the other stars and the moon in the sky.  During the entire time of seeing this light, the position of the stars and moon had changed slightly, but the light was moving more gradually than the stars and moon, by far.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius.

I wanted to get a better look so I ran to the back of the house. It was still there. I saw no doors nor windows. I remembered that the binoculars were on the diningroom table so I ran in to get them.

We were a crew of three professional airline pilots, with a cumlative flying experience of 50 years. As the object drew closer the approach speed slowed and it flew along beside us.  It showed three lights at the top and four at the bottom in a trapezoid shape, with a trailing colored glow at the rear. It changed altitude, up and down, as it flew beside us. A query to air traffic Control (USAF) resulted in no radar contact in the area.   As we descended to 6,500 the object descended with us in formation.  Upon approaching the bright lights of the city of Berlin, the object fled South at an incredible rate of speed.  After landing we found some other pilots who had witnessed a similar object, while flying into Berlin through the south air corridor, streaking south and climbing, at about the time it left us.

Walking by the intersection of McCowan Rd. and Danforth Rd., I was already paying attention to the planes in the sky.   Then, incredibly a large fire trail formed across the sky, just under the constellation Orion, as some large object burned up, heading in the general direction of Buffallo.  The trail then faded after about a 4 count.  This was no garden variety meteorite or &apos;shooting star&apos; that I am familiar with from camping trips to northern Ontario.  I was absolutly stunned by the sight.  There might have been some flashes from the direction of the landing, but the light pollution made it hard to discern that positively.

I happened to look up at the moon and noticed, what at first, looked like two planets (one over the other). I recall thinking how unusual this would be without any pomp and circumstance in the news. They appeared to be planet-like instead of stars because their light was steady - not winking. I just couldn&apos;t believe the closeness of these two celestial bodies. They were below the half-moon by about a hand width at anns length and very bright - similar to Venus and Jupiter. It was too high above the horizon to be Venus (approximate location of the sun at high noon), but there wasn&apos;t any other explanation in my opinion. The objects weren&apos;t moving - they were stationary. While standing there frozen in my gaze, the top one began fading in strength much like a variable star but happening so fast it couldn&apos;t have been. I thought perhaps it might be a cloud or mist rolling across my view of this planet like object, but when I checked the sky, there wasn&apos;t a cloud or mist of any kind whatsoever. The stars and the moon were crystal clear and there was a faint star just below the moon that remained the same brightness throughout my observation. Within less than 20 seconds the light from the first object had disappeared completely. I was flabbergasted.  And then shortly afterward the second source began fading until within a short period of time, it too was gone. It couldn&apos;t have been two stationary satellites reflecting the rising sun, because the sun would be shining on them (rising within the hour) - not setting on them.(NOTE: This note is not for publication - I have included my work phone - not home phone number.)((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of planets??

They described the event to me minutes after it happened. The pattern was at first a shifting kite/diamond shape directly overhead that reorganized into a horseshoe pattern of red lights and sped/zipped to the horizon at high speed. They did not discern a solid shape or hull of a craft only the red lights changing patterns and departing at a phenomenal speed - one second or two to get to the horizon and out of sight. No prank was played on me as the four buddies were missionaries for the church and no one gave the slightest hint of this being a joke on me. They drew on paper the light patterns and said that they behaved like separate objects rather than off and on lights attached to a single craft or hull because of the jigglly positioning or jockeying the lights did when changing from the kite shape outline formation to the horseshoe formation. Then they departed in a locked in formation as &quot;one&quot; entity.

I was a high school senior at the time.  My mother had been visiting her sister that evening.  My aunt&apos;s house is about a mile from the base of an area called &quot;Big Ridge.&quot;  Its a residential area.  As my mom was going to the car to leave (between 9:30 &amp; 10 p.m.), my aunt walked out with her.  They stood in her yard talking and my mom noticed bright lights coming down Big Ridge.  She told my aunt to look at those funny looking lights on a car coming down the ridge.  My aunt told her that couldn&apos;t be a car; there was no road in that particular spot.  They agreed the lights were highly unusual so they continued to watch it.  All of a sudden the lights (or craft) shot straight up into the sky.  They continued to watch as it zipped up &amp; down the length of the ridge faster than anything they had ever seen in the sky.  Its movements were quick and sharp; up, down, back, and forth.  It would go so far away they could barely see it; then as fast as it disappeared it would zoom back into full view.  At the time, we were hearing about lots of UFO sightings so thats the first thing they thought about - it had to be a UFO.  My mom came home (about a 10 minute drive) and told us what they saw.  My sister, her son who was about five at the time, and myself got very excited and wanted to go back to my aunts house to see it.  So we all piled into the car and went back over there.  When we got there, some of my cousins were trying to see it through binoculars but all you could see was fuzz; it was much clearer with the naked eye.  After a while it got very far away and didn&apos;t come back our way.  My adventurous mother figured out which direction it had gone and said &quot;it looks like its up around Valleybrook.&quot;  Valleybrook was, at the time, one of the most exclusive subdivisions in our area.  This is where it gets GOOD.............We all jumped back in the car and headed up Hixson Pike toward Valleybrook (about five miles or so from my aunt&apos;s house).  I swear to God somebody/something in that craft knew we were looking for it and knew exactly where we were going.  Theres a large curve right before Valleybrook.  As we came out of the curve we had full view of the subdivision on our left. And there it was, at the back of the subdivision, moving slowly along the tree tops toward the road we were driving on.  I believe that finding the craft in the exact location my mom said we were going to was no coincidence; somehow they were tapped into our thoughts, knew we were looking for them, felt maybe we were going to be receptive to them, and came down to show themselves to us.  The craft was huge and beautiful and it scared the living daylights out of us.  I don&apos;t think our reaction was one they were looking for because we freaked out.  If we had continued the direction we were driving and the craft had continued on the path it was on, we would have driven right under it.  By that time my mom, who was driving, was frantic.  She was screaming &quot;I&apos;m not driving under that thing&quot; and we were screaming back at her to not drive under that thing - to do something to keep from it.  Luckily there was a second entrance to the subdivision so we turned left onto that road.  The second house on the left was the only one with outside lights on so we pulled into their driveway.  This put our back to the craft which was hovering at that moment over a small pond at the edge of Hixson Pike.  My nephew was screaming &quot;Oh God, Oh God, Oh God.&quot;  My sister threw open the car door and had one leg out of the car; she was going to run into some stranger&apos;s house.  By the time we pulled into the driveway and i turned around in the backseat to look at it out the rear window it was gone.  Totally vanished like it was never there.  We have no idea which direction it went when it left; it disappeared that fast.  I can&apos;t help but wonder if it would have stayed longer if we hadn&apos;t panicked.  I also sometimes wonder if they still watch me and know when I&apos;m reliving the events of that night.  WHAT THE CRAFT LOOKED LIKE:  It was oval in shape, had a metallic body, small windows around it, in the center of the bottom was a cluster of the brightest, whitest, clearest, most brilliant lights I have ever seen.  That was 30+ years ago and I&apos;ve yet to see any white lights that have remotely compared to them.  Around the entire craft was a red glow.  There was no physical/visible red light (like a bulb); only a glow.  It was being driven with precision along the tree tops and made no sound.  When we first spotted it at the back of the subdivision it was skimming along the tree line behind a row of houses.  It moved slowly and continuous until it reached the road we were traveling on.  Thats when it stopped and hovered over the pond.  It never crossed Hixson Pike; it just vanished into thin air.  We didn&apos;t report our sighting to anyone because we didn&apos;t know who to tell.  When we told our story to friends/acquaintances/family in the following days, we were treated like idiots and just made fun of.  After seeing the ABC special last week and finally getting names of people who might be interested in our story, I decided it was time to tell it.  Whether anyone believes what we saw or not is irrelevant; we know what we saw, the story hasn&apos;t changed in 30 years, and will never change.  I only regret that video cameras weren&apos;t available then like they are now.  My mom is now 85 years old and her memory isn&apos;t what it used to be, but one things for sure, she still remembers that first Sunday in October 1973.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

As we passed under it, I tried to get a glimpse of it&apos;s shape and deducted it to be a solid form, either circular or triangular, maybe cubical. The friend sitting in the passenger seat leaned his head out the window and said he thought it looked like a triangle. There was a single light at the side moving forward, rather large and seeming to take the entire corner of the object. Roughly 1 and a half minutes later, after leaving the highway then returning to it, the object had easily moved another 4 miles - much farther than the pace it had been going should have allowed. It was continuing to move south when I again left the highway, a change from the western course it had been taking. The object was clearly not a plane or helicopter, nor any other flying craft I&apos;ve ever seen for myself. My counterpart sitting in the passenger seat agreed, and also accepts that what we saw was likely some sort of UFO.", "Small triangular formations in desert sky,  forming into larger triangle formationWatching the night sky over the Mojave desert, I noticed a small light traveling across the sky from East to West, assumed it was a satillite, but as I watched a triangle  formation joined it, traveling at the same speed.

That is, 3 at the head of the triangle three at  each of the points of the triangle.(9) I was within 10 miles of Edwards Air Force base and thought at first it  was something from there, but as I watched more and more of the &quot;lights&quot; joined the first til the sky was full of them.

It appeared to give off its own light, although there were no visible windows.  I recall having car radio on, but a high pitched noise coming from the sky made me turn the radio off.  The &quot;something&quot; was a silver-blue disk-like object which gave off this high pitched noise.  I estimate the distance to be approximately 1000 feet in altitude and in a southern angle.  Over the years, what has always stayed with me is that the object was turning on its axis in a semi-slow circle.  The bottom of the disk/saucer was not concave, but more or less flat.  After approximately 30 seconds, the object suddenly raced across the sky at an unbelivable speed in a north, north eastern direction.  The sky, in that part of the country, always displayed many stars on a clear night, and this was a clear night.  I don&apos;t recall a moon.  Furthermore, my friend and I raced to our hometown to tell people what we saw, and the movie theater was just letting out, and the first friend we saw we told of the incident, and he said, &quot;I know. We saw it too.&quot;  This was 5 miles south of where we saw it, so the object had to be at a fairly high elevation.  There are many mountains in that part of the country, but where we saw it, was at a place where there was an open area where one could see about 6 miles to the next mountain. We asked around, and there were no county fairs or other happenings that would have a spot light turned to the sky.

I can have her fial a report but you probably don&apos;t want a bunch of reports from teens and stuff. But we see alot of things too, things that like adults would just say is a new kind of air plane and things like that. I feel better about telling an adult what I saw. Thanks.

At some point the 5 yr old said quote &quot;Look up&quot; &quot;Look up&quot; very persistantly. His father told the boy to shut up.This responce by his father bothered me so I told the boy &quot; ya those are stars&quot; The boy again insisted that we look up. At this point I looked not straight up but looked to the south of our location and spotted what looked like a chevron shaped object moving silently through the sky. The object was larger then an airliner had sharp edges to it and the entire surface emitted a white glow. The object reminded me of a giant peice of glass. I was completely shocked at the sight of this object. After the object left I asked my friend to draw for me what he had just seen, I didnt want to influence his mind in anyway. His discription of the object was just as I had viewed it. The object I might add was on the same flight path to kirtland AFB that many planes use . My friend and I grew up under this flight path and spent many a summer night trying to reflect spotlights off the wings of planes as they would come in for a landing. We both became very adept at I.D.ing types of planes day or night. What we saw was not a plane or a balloon or anything else that we had ever seen. This whole experience was like seeing a ghost and left me very un-settled. Every time I tell this story I am met with great skeptisisum, but i know in my heart that I was fortunate enough to see something that most people will never get to see in their lifetime.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Sometimes numerous flashes from at least four other lights, one of which moved slightly from left to right, and a primary that more or less stayed in the same relative position and shone for 2 to 3 seconds, then stayed off for half a minute before repeating until all activity stopped at approximately 19:50 hrs. CST. A bright full moon was rising in the east at the time. Think of orange fireflies winking on and off while hovering in the distance. The distance of these lights from the sighting location is indeterminate. This is the first sighting of unusual lights after 4 years of amateur atronomy on almost every clear night. My personal theory is some kind of bizarre refraction in the atmosphere of either the full moon or car headlights. A clever prank involving model rocketry, modified/homemade fireworks, or radio controlled craft not to be ruled out.((NUFORC Note:  We express our special gratitude to the source of the report, given the objective, factual, and apparently accurate nature of what the witness has written above.

PD))((ADDENDUM TO REPORT, SUBMITTED FOUR DAYS AFTER ORIGINAL REPORT))Update to previous report of orange lights sighted in western Arkansas.This is a correction for coordinates mentioned in a previous report filed on  02/24/05 from Coal Hill, Arkansas. My telescope is a computerized GOTO model which was aligned to the north celestial pole tonight {02/28/05}, synchronized with Aldebaran, and then put into &quot;terrestrial&quot; mode before slewing to the exact spot in which the &quot;fireflies&quot; {orange lights} were observed as mentioned in the previous report. It turns out the more precise coordinates are 246 degrees azimuth plus and minus an estimated degree to encompass the region of sky the lights were seen.The previously-reported altitude of 10 to 20 degrees above the horizon, however, was grossly inaccurate and exaggerated. My apologies. The more accurate altitude of where the phenomena was observed, according to my scope&apos;s Autostar handcontroller after slewing its Red-dot finderscope to a spot that coincided with nearby landmarks {a tree in the backyard and some streetlights a few blocks away}, is about no more than 4 degrees above the horizon at the most and 2 at the least. A protractor, map of Arkansas, and a pen showed a line- of-sight that goes directly over the town of Charleston, Ar., Ft. Chaffee military reservation, Greenwood, Ar., and also Poteau, Ok. This would of been revised sooner if not for inclement weather in the interim. And this is why I love my telescope. Thank you.((END ADDENDUM))((SECOND ADDENDUM))Follow-up to report of orange lights sighted from Coal Hill, 02/24/05.Date of report:  03/06/05. The acquisition of a detailed county map of nearby Franklin County enabled me to better pinpoint the line-of-sight all the way to the Arkansas River. Right underneath my line drawn on the map is an area south of Altus, Arkansas that is a wildlife refuge that borders the river. A quick drive to that site and some slow cruising along the dirt road just a few dozen yards north of the river resulted in seeing some patches of burnt ground running along next to the road and out into the large open fields north of the road and river. It was while investigating on foot when a local driving up and down the road, and hopping out of his truck to pick up beverage cans and other trash, that I was informed while chatting with him the Army Corp of Engineers had been in the area &quot;a few days ago&quot;{exact time and date uncertain} either doing a controlled burn in the region or fighting the fire. The conversation was hard to follow as his truck was idling noisily and he would not stay in one place to talk with me as he moved back and forth doing his thing, picking up trash from the scorched earth, after I informed him of what was observed from my backyard on Feb. 24th, 2005 between 7 and 8 PM. And then he moved on down the road as I thanked him and left the area to move on to other spots underneath the line drawn on my map. Nothing apparently unusual was noticed in any of the other open fields near county roads between the Arkansas River and my house that intersected the line on my map. If the Corps had been dealing with a large fire on the night of my sighting, then it would all make sense if they had been sweeping high-powered spotlights onto the columns of dense, rising smoke from ground vehicles and maybe one of their boats anchored nearby on the river. They do indeed have powerful searchlights for patrolling the river and its banks which fall under their federal jurisdiction including all tributaries and even mud puddles. I hope this was of some help and thanks for your time.((END SECOND ADDENDUM))", "Object seen 11PM, Aug., 1962 or 1963 over ocean, Ship&apos;s Bottom, NJ.It has been a long time since this event occurred.  It happened in August of either 1962 or 1963.  I was visiting my aunt at the Jersey shore. We deceided to take her dog for a walk around 11PM.  We walked up to the beach road where we could see the shore and the ocean.  An object was in the sky.  It wasn&apos;t an airplane because it moved too slowly.  It wasn&apos;t a helicopter because it moved too smoothly and made no noise.  It had yellow and white lights. We could not make out the shape but by the position of the lights, I&apos;d say it was curved.  It came in our direction, hovered, then took off at an acute angle without the body of the ship changing direction.  It sped off quickly and disappeared over the ocean.

We watched it for a few minutes until it too off at on a sharp angle without turning around.  It disappeared over the Atlantic.  I would say it was going northeast in the direction of NYC.

They lasted variously from 5 to perhaps 20 seconds all moved in an easterly direction. I dont believe they were aircraft. Perhaps satellites but I have observed satellites for the past 8 years. These objects appeared not to move as fast as the satellites. Yesterday morning at approximately the same time and in the same location I observed 2 similar sightings. One lasted so long I thought it was the landing light on an inbound Lufthansa or other cargo flight. It was southbound. After about 25 seconds the light went out. About 10 minutes later another light, not quite as bright, appeared headed east southeast and lasted maybe 10 seconds. There was no sound.

Seen a light very far away with numerous other lights moving around it, sort of circling.  Very hard to keep an eye on them as the contrast and distance made it difficult to see.I witnessed this main object (all objects seemed white) move up and down, sometimes slightly to the left.  Various times, I had seen other lights move around this main light at higher speeds, until they just seemed to disappear.It was very difficult to keep track, kind of like looking at a sea gull at a high altitude on a bright sunny CLEAR day. The white on blue makes it hard to see, especially at great distance.Whatever it was I saw, I know it was NOT a plane or aircraft as we know it. The movements where just to odd.

This hotel is located on Queen Anne Hill, just south of the Aurora bridge.  At approximately 7:45pm, our computer, Xerox machine, and several lights in the lobby all seemed to blink and then began to hum for a split second. Being the only employee on the premises, I was worried that the hotel might be in the middle of an electrical outage.  I looked at the clock on the wall, which read 7:45, grabbed a flashlight, and headed towards our parking lot. Once outside, I found that our parking lot was completely dark.  Four of our exterior lights, and one street light, were all out.  I then walked to the sidewalk which runs along the east side of Aurora avenue and looked north.  Several street lights, including those at the corner of Aurora and Halladay avenue, were out, along with several near the Canlis restaurant nearby. While I was walking towards a utility room to search for the circuit breaker the lights suddenly came back on again, they were out for a total of three minutes.  It should be noted that the four exterior lights which went out are not activated by sensor, they are turned on by timers at the same time each night. I would not have been bothered by this occurrence until later when I heard on KIRO radio that some sort of object had passed over the Pacific Northwest at the same time (7:45pm).  I also heard from the radio that a variety of other electrical problems occurred in the Queen Anne, Fremont, and Ballard areas of Seattle. I have a very strange feeling about the entire episode.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be both objective in his description of the events, and quite credible.  Given that the presumed meteor was at least 200 miles to the south of Seattle, we doubt that its presence could have anything to do with the power failure here.  No power failures in Oregon have been reported to NUFORC, as of the date of this writing.

AND &amp; tend to be long-winded, sooo....I think it was either late December, early January or March, in either 1992 or 1993. Sorry for being so vague; I know I was home on some kind of break from college. ****SIDE-NOTE...a few months earlier while I was still at school a friend of mine from Round Rock called &amp; told me that she &amp; her fiancee (also a friend) had seen a UFO (in Round Rock). She said that when they went outside they immediately saw it because it was the brightest light in the sky; you couldn&apos;t miss it. She said they sat there &amp; watched it for over an hour.****  Anyway, so its a few months later &amp; I&apos;m home from school. My friends (the 2 I mentioned earlier) &amp; I had planned on meeting at his apartment in Round Rock &amp; going to dinner in Austin. Leaving my parents house I was driving North through their neighborhood &amp; turned East onto a main road, driving towards Round Rock. It was already dark outside, I&apos;m guessing about 6:30 or 7:00. As SOON as I made the turn East onto the main road &amp; looked up, I saw this bright, captivating light. It was in the Northeast. I had completely forgotten about the UFO my friend had told me about earlier. This light was so bright &amp; out of the ordinary, I watched it for the entire drive to my friends place. The drive took about 5 minutes &amp; the light didn&apos;t appear to be moving. It didn&apos;t even enter into my mind that this was anything other than a really odd light of some sort. But it was so interesting, I had planned on mentioning it to my friends. So I got to my friends place &amp; I hadn&apos;t seen them in a long time, so we got caught up in talking &amp; I completely forgot about this light. I&apos;m guessing its around 7:00 or so now. We went into Austin &amp; had dinner. We were driving back to Round Rock (north) on I-35 around 8:00 or 8:30 or so. I think we were somewhere between Pflugerville &amp; Round Rock &amp; my friend said &quot;Oh my god! There it is!&quot; &amp; told me that was the UFO they had seen a few months ago. It was the same light I had seen earlier that night &amp; I told them that I had been watching it on my way to his apartment. We watched the light as we continued to drive up I-35. We decided to go park on this small hill about half a mile or a mile East of his apartment &amp; watch the light. It was a quiet area w/no lights around. I dont think it was an overcast night, but I dont remember there being many stars in the sky either. So we back the car up the hill for a better view &amp; we&apos;re facing South now. I dont remember the light being any color, just a bright clear light. It was very dark &amp; the object wasn&apos;t close enough to make out a shape. It would blink occasionally in a seemingly random pattern. As soon as we got there &amp; were sitting still we could see that the light was moving. And MAN, was it MOVING!!! It was jumping all over the place. We couldn&apos;t actually see it moving, it must&apos;ve been moving too fast. One second it would be in one spot &amp; half a second later it would be to the left or to the right or up or down. It was absolutely not moving in any kind of set direction like an airplane, etc. It was bouncing all over the place. A little while later another light showed up &amp; then a little while later a 3rd light showed up. They were all in the same general area &amp; were close to each other. They never seemed to get right next to each other though. It never looked like any of them were close enough to touch. When the 3 lights were there, they seemed to be more active than just the one when it was by itself. They were all blinking &amp; moving around &amp; seemed to be communicating in some way. They weren&apos;t constantly moving though. They would each stay still for a while &amp; then jump around and then stay still again. We sat there &amp; watched the light/lights for about 1 1/2 hours, until they left. About an hour into watching the lights, my friend &amp; I (not her fiancee) got the VERY distinct feeling that the UFOs knew we were watching them. We both felt like they were extremely upset at us; that we were seeing something that we weren&apos;t supposed to be seeing. Guessing I first saw the light around 6:30 or 7:00 and last saw it around 10:00 or 10:30. Between my drive to his place &amp; the 3 of us sitting in the car, I viewed it for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Haven&apos;t seen anything like it since.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

But then I noticed it was moving very very slowly, and it wasn&apos;t being whipped around.  It was hovering over the building about 6 feet or so, and ever so slowly moving north, staying the exact same distace up in the air.  Then I also noticed that there was no reflection coming off of it, which was also strange, since the sun was shining right on it.  And it was jet-black.  It continued along the top of those two building, and then went across a rather large football field - all the while moving extremely slowly and at the same height off the ground - never once being whipped by the wind or changing its oval shape.  I watch it for some time as it went into the distance.  To this day I can&apos;t think of any know object that fits that description.", "Blue SphereI and fellow Marine were on guard duty at an armory on Camp Pendleton. The events that transpired that night I have only ever shared with my wife; who the other Marine has shared it with I do not know, but we never spoke of the incident or reported out of fear.  I have been in several combat situations, but this was the most terrifying moment in my life.  I reluctantly share it now as I have tried to never think of it after I made it through that night.We were on duty that night at the main armory for that area of base.  We had been on this post quite a lot and had become familiar with the surroundings inside and out.  We were locked into the perimeter after the last Marine that worked in the armory left, as we were every night.  We had no key for obvious security reasons.I was the first to see it.  It crested a hill approximately eight hundred meters to the east of the armory.  I thought it strange but we were on a military base so it could be anything.  As the object moved closer I realized that it was something I was unfamiliar with and not another marine or piece of equipment.  My gut was that something was very wrong.  At this moment I called the other Marine over to see what he thought.  We radioed in to the guard HQ but could not adequately describe whatever it was and they felt it to be no threat so the response team was not sent.  It approached at a slow enough rate of speed that we were coming up with all kinds of explanations from hummers to snipers but as it got to within a hundred yards we realized that we were in trouble.  The trip from the top of the hill took approximately eight to ten minutes to this point.  We immediately locked and loaded and took defensive positions.The object was not like anything I have ever seen so to compare it to anything would be pointless but I will do my best to describe it.  It was a sphere, a ball of glowing blue light.  It was not bright, it did not shine.  The best way to describe it is that it was a fluorescent blue ball of light that could move.  The glow of the light was slightly more intense in the center, but I would not say that it was the source.  It was translucent and I could see no object or anything that would lead me to believe that it was solid in anyway but it had a definite shape.  It was positioned about 15 feet above the ground and was about three to four feet in diameter.  I don&rsquo;t know if it actually got smaller as it approached because it looked larger when it was further out.  There was no sound coming from the object.  It stopped above the front gate guard shack for a few seconds and then proceeded toward the armory.  At this point I almost fired on the object but fear of what it might be and what might happen, and the thought that I was going crazy, made me wait.  From my observation I really don&rsquo;t believe there was anything a bullet could have harmed.  Have no doubt that had it come closer to me I would have fired anyway.  The object continued toward the armory until it came to a point above the center and then began to move downward.  I could not see the object actually enter the armory as the perimeter fence prevented us from moving back that far, however we knew it was in the armory because the inside of the armory began to glow the same blue color.  At this point we tried multiple times to raise someone on the radio but all attempts failed, not due to equipment malfunction, but because the ((deleted)) on the other end fell asleep.  The glow coming out of the window on the front door seemed to get brighter and darker, so I assume it was in motion inside the armory.  Three and a half hours after I first saw the object it raised up outside the armory and continued directly upward at a much faster speed than it approached.  We waited for a brief while and decided together not to tell anyone as we wanted to avoid the repercussions that sharing this story with anyone, especially our chain of command, would bring.  We did watch in fear as the first armory Marine showed up at 0500 and walked inside, as we had not told him what had happened.  Nothing seemed to be out of place or harmed so we kept quiet.  This is the first time I have shared this full story as I have only told my wife that I saw something while guarding an armory that scared the shit out of me.  I can only imagine that what ever it was was checking out the weapons inside as there were thousands of them and many different types.  No harm came to me or my fellow Marine. I AM POSITIVE beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was not gas, a light trick or some kind of light coming from Venus.  Believe me when I tell you I wish it was.  I was not amazed.  I was locked in a very secure fence with something that I did not feel I could protect myself from and I had no idea what it was.  I was petrified.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My memory is that the object was more circular or oval; however, my huband remembers it as cigar shaped.  I think that it was a silver metallic color.

It was about the size of three full moons.  Since I do not know how far away it was, I have no idea just how large it was.  It was approx. at 20 degrees on the horizon.  The object began going down and took about 30 seconds for it to slowly descend behind a hill with trees in the distance. It made absolutely no noise.  The area was a remote hilly area with pastures and trees.  I ran into the house and told my mom and dad but they would not even look out the door. The next morning I asked my dad to drive us to the pasture because I was convinced we would see something.  My dad would not even take me to the pasture. I was in the first grade at the time but have an excellent memory of the event.  I have talked many times about it to my mother, wife and my own kids.  I am the owner of an oilfield service company.  I have a college degree in accounting and am a very responsible person with no other experiences such as this.", "The craft was visible at different positions for about 20 seconds at a distance of 3 to 4 miles to 4 to 500 feet.While transiting a vessel across the ocean from Abijan, Ivory Coast to Port of Spain, Trinidad, we noticed an object over the starbord bow, hovering at the horizon app. 3 miles distant, the object moved quickly to the port bow horizon hovered there for a couple of seconds, the quickly went directly in front of the vessel, hovering at a distance of about 3 or 4 miles.  The object then quickly went those 3 or 4 miles directly in front of the boat, hovering at a hight of 4 or 5 hundred feet for a couple of seconds, then took off the the north at a speed unheard of, totally without a sound.  The weather was clear skies and no wind, we had a 3 or 4 foot swell from the SE all the way across.  This was the first of our sightings on this crossing and the only one witnessed by all three of us.  The other sighting was described in an earlier posting.  All sightings were documented on the log and the captain was informed.((NUFORC Note:  One of two seemingly objective, factual, and documentable reports from the same witness.  PD))", "Craft hovering stationary over trees in residential neighborhoodBack in aprox. 1977 at the age of 10 I awoke unexpectedly in the middle of the night and immediately went to my window and pulled back the shade.  I could never determine what caused me to do this.  I witnessed a saucer shaped object hovering stationary over what would be our neighbors back yard.  It was aprox.  40&apos; off the ground and 30 yards from my position and did not move or emit any sound.  I would estimate it&apos;s size as 35&apos; diameter and 8&apos; in height.  The &quot;top&quot; had a smaller diameter of perhaps 10&apos; and there was a bank of multicolor lights slightly above where the diameter decreased.  These lights did not blink or flash but were rather in a &quot;constant on&quot; mode.  I observed the craft for what I would estimate to be 5 minutes.  At that point I recall becoming extremely frightened and quickly climbing back in to bed under the covers until I fell asleep again.  I related the sighting to my parents in the morning. I do not believe I had ever heard of UFO&apos;s at that point in life, and not until many years later when finding a book about UFO&apos;s in the library did I realize what it may have been I saw.  No subsequent sightings of note.  If I can provide additional info I can be reached at email below.", "bright lights in front of the dark body of the object with perhaps windows over the lightsI am not exactly sure of the shape.  There were bright lights in front of what appeared to be the body of the plane or object, and perhaps windows.       My husband and I were on our way to Gainesville, Florida, on our morning commute at the time.   I thought I could see a wing of the plane or ship behind the lights, but my husband could not tell.  It was hard to tell the exact shape.    It began as a bright light in the early morning distant sky, which we thought was just an aircraft.   Suddenly it started moving towards us and came right over the top of our car, and stayed very briefly, then took off.   There was no noticeable noise.    I kept wondering if anyone else on the road with us could see the thing.    I called the FAA in Atlanta, I believe, and they recommended I call air traffic control in Jacksonville to see if anything had been reported.    No one offered any explanation.    I have never seen anything like this again.   I mentioned this experience to someone I was working with at the time, and she told me she had seen a very similar object over a shopping center in Boca Raton one evening.    I would just like an exlanation for what we saw, if that is possible.    My husband and I are both baby boomers, in our late fifties, or early sixties, and while we do enjoy science fiction, we are not making this up.    We are both college educated,  and we just do not understand what we saw.   My husband felt at the time this must have been a military test plane, but the way this object moved,     I just don&apos;t think so.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
