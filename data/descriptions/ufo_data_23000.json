["Large, red  jellyfish-shaped UFO crossing night skyWas watching Leonids when I saw this craft race across the entire night sky in about 1/2 second went from horizon to horizon.  It looked something like a jellyfish, or an LED, the rounded tip as the front.  Coloring was glowing red at the front.  I do not believe this was one of the meteors because I saw shape around it, someting like Wonder Woman&apos;s tranparent airplane.  Also, this came up over the horizon from the northwest, not from above  as the meteors came into view.  It was also MUCH larger than any of the meteors, if it HAD been one, would have devastated a large area of the Earth.I waited so long to report because I didn&apos;t know there was anyplace to report to anymore.This is a rural area, no military bases anywhere around except one that closed decades ago.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It floated down over the pier restaurant, and hovered.  The red and green lights extinguished.  White lights along the circumfrance lit (they may have been portholes, and the interior was illuminated).  The ship rotated for several minutes.  Rotation stopped, circumfrance lights extinguished, red and green lights re-lit, and the ship tilted, moved across Puget Sound westerly, then northerly, out of sight.  Silent operation.  Many pedestrians glanced at it and acted as though it was not there.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I hear his drummer say would you look at that, as i looked up i saw a large triangle shaped craft flying from northeast to southwest. It was shaped like a triangle with a nose on it. I could see four lights on the nose, one on the very tip one on each side of the nose and one slightly back. It also had one light in the middle one on what i would call the tail end and one on each wingtip. The lights on the nose and the one in the middle of the craft were the only ones blinking. All lights looked to be red in color except the four on the nose which appeared to be yellow in color. I would have to say it looked as big as a quarter held at arms length, and looked to be moveing very slowly for as big as it appeared.", "Strange Looking UFO and othersI was talking with a fellow student at ITT Technical Institute (northwest side of Indy) when she looked up in the southeast sky and said &quot;what&apos;s that?&rdquo; I turned to look and seen a craft traveling northwest at a moderate speed. It was about as high as a small plan would fly. Now get this, it looked like a bunch of balloons tied together flying across the sky (sun setting/no lights). The wind was coming out of the northwest the direction it was flying into. We agreed on its appearance, but couldn&apos;t understand how balloons could move against the wind current. I drive to school from a town called Kokomo which is 50 miles north of Indy Mon, Wed, and Fri afternoons (night classes). On my trips back home I have been witnessing strange lights in the sky since October to now (Dec). I have seen lights that fade into view move then fade out. I usually drive the country route unless of snow then I take Highway 31. Since the end of this summer I&apos;ve seen many of these strange lights in the night sky on my return trips from school. I keep forgetting to grab a camera or camcorder, but with work/school I tend to be on the move a lot (not thinking of a camera). I even stop the car to see if it&apos;s just my eyes playing tricks on me. Bingo, I see them moving in erratic patterns then fading out of site. I&apos;m just waiting for one to fly over my car and pick me up to take a ride. Hahaha, I&apos;d probably freak and run home with my tail between my legs. I have seen UFOs my whole life, but these are the most sightings I have witnessed in such a short time frame. I noticed some similar sightings on the board in Indiana by others, so I know people are seeing the same UFOs.", "hovering light over Avon for 10 minutes sends signal then disappearsSaw light for about 10 minutes or so not moving at all. Upon flashing my flash light at it, it seemed to flash back but not in any specific order. I thought for a while it was the top of a distant antenna about a mile away. I turned away to start my work and looked back in less than a minute and it was gone. There were no other lights or planes to be found in the sky, and at dawn in about 20 minutes i was able to see there was no antenna((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Moved to the northeast, approx. 5 miles, then turned and went straight into the air until it disappeared from sight into the sky. Light moved at an incredible pace, no noise, no contrail, no strobe or wing lights.I do not know how far away it was, or how far it travelled. I estimate it was 15 miles away, and travelled a total of 12 - 15? miles.

The object was on the same place for over 10 minutes and suddenly it separated in two parts, one bigger and other one is smaller, the smaller part become move rapidly around bigger part and looks like it was going to ground and back to bigger part. In about 20 minutes two objects merged together and moved away with a great speed. Also we did not hear any noise. Next day I found out in my school that number of people experienced the same, I am not saying that it UFO, maybe some Russian flying device but definitely not a helicopter and plane.

I looked south and noticed a bright pink-orange stationary round light aligned over a tall building in Portland&apos;s downtown.  I had a camera with me so I stopped on the overpass.  Trying to zoom in to the object, I saw in the viewfinder a very bright &quot;burning ember&quot; uniform light over the full visible area of the object.  However I was unable to snap the picture due to underexposure.  I reframed at less zoom factor and was able to get the shot, emailed separately, PICT0145-1.jpg.  By the time I got the shot, the object had dimmed considerably while shrinking in size, and I was not sure I even got it.  The picture has a 10x scaled up blow-up of the object.  It was not an airplane or helicopter, the light was too large for that. When I see things like this, I wait to report to see if anyone else reported it.

It definitely had a green color to it but didn&apos;t seem to have a tail or anything. It was big and did not seem to get smaller as it went down.It lasted about 4-5 seconds before going out of my view behind some trees. I would estimate that it was about 10 - 15 miles away. I live near Tyndall AFB and called our local sherrif dept. to report. They called the Coast Guard who called me back and questioned me. They were going to check with Tyndall and see if they had anything going on, he did say that the green color was unusual for flares.

Thank  You.", "Earlier during the day on the 19th of November at about 2:05 pm, I saw a gray cylinder that resembled a fuselage without any wings going upwards and it seemed that it had some type of a faint trail following it.  It was a bright sunny day and there were several other planes out leaving contrails in the sky but this object was just going straight upwards and it disappeared from sight in about a minute.  The object was almost straight upwards from where I was standing but I was facing eastwards when I saw it so I had to have been eastbound.  There were no markings on the object, it was not shiny, but just a dull gray or dirty white color, and it&apos;s speed was difficult to tell since it was going upwards. Next, for the past two nights there has been a light that is stationary close to my school in Richardson which is where I go to school and work.If you look towards the west, you can see that it is about at a 45 degree angle with the horizon.  Both times that this light appears, there had been several witnesses both faculty members, staff, and students that have witnessed this light.  The object itself just seems to be a white or yellowish star that is out of place but has been seen in plain view at 5:45 pm and is extremely too bright to be a star.  The idea that it was a weather balloon seemed to be a more valid case but with all the wind that we have had these past days, I find it hard to believe that a weather balloon would be stationary for over an hour.There were several students that watched it until approximately 8:00 pm when I was told by them that &quot;it just left after a while&quot;.  When I asked how exactly it departed, the students told me that it left slowly towards the west. These same students also claimed that they saw another craft fly by with three red lights on the front of it.  The details of the shape of the craft were quite sketchy but I took it that it was shaped like a plane but the lights were arranged strangely.((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date of the alleged sighting was in the year 2003.

I went out onto my upstairs balcony to see how many were there to be fed. They sit on a tall lamp post directly in front of my home. As I looked up, I saw a large white orb/circle traveling from south/east to north/west at a fast rate of speed. It went right behind/past the direction of the lamp post. It looked completely white, not glowing. Holding my extended hand out in line with its travels, it was 1 1/2 the diameter of the end of my thumb. I couldn&apos;t judge how high it was in the blue sky but the sky to the east was blue, while to the west, high clouds had already moved in. I ran indoors to look out my window to the north/west to watch it. As it traveled north/west the clouds soon hid it.I have no idea how high the clouds were, so cannot judge how high the object was, although it moved above the clouds. The sighting was no more than two minutes total due to its rapid rate of speed and being hidden above the clouds soon after.", "Bright light appears over power linesI am fairly sure of the year but the date and time are a guess.  I do know that it was cold enough to have been in the Fall.  The reason I am posting this is because I have been sitting on it for so long and I have read and reread the report for 11/01/95 from my town and what my friend and I saw seems so similar that I am wondering if it was the same thing.I was driving my friend home really late at night- some time between 1am and 3am I guess, as that was the normal time for me to drive her home when she&apos;d visit.  I turned down a side street, using the same way I always took her home (so I would not have to turn around on her street to get back to the main road).  When we got to the stop sign at the end of the street there was a very bright light kind of hovering above the power lines in the field across the street, I think what you call high tension lines- the ones on the huge metal structures.  I would say that, if I think about it, it may have been the size of a dime at arm&apos;s length.  Anyway, we&apos;re at the stop sign and looking and I said, &quot;Do you see that?&quot;  And my friend said, &quot;What is it?&quot; and she wanted to get out of the car.  It was kind of surreal.  I can&apos;t remember if I put the car in park but I must have.  I reached to my friend and held her shirt so she wouldn&apos;t get out because I was terrified, like the blood drained from my body (I can feel it as I am typing this and remembering).  The thing hovered for a little bit, maybe 2 minutes or maybe more, it seemed like forever.  I also remember briefly wanting to get out of the car and look but by then it started to move parallel to the street I had been going to turn onto, going the same direction which I believe is W or NW.  So I turned the car and we watched it going faster until our vision was blocked by trees and I had to turn onto her street (the street we were on ends abruptly).Afterwards we talked about it and I remember saying her mother would be angry she had missed it because she was very much into reading about UFO&apos;s and other things like that.  We both agreed it was not a plane.  Neither of us were drinking or doing drugs and we were both several years out of High School by then.  I live right on one of the flight paths for Logan Int&apos;l Airport and am pretty used to and familiar with the airplane paths and their looks.  The night was also clear so they were not running many patterns over our area.  Never reported this to anyone except family.  To this day if I drive down that particular street I stare up at those wires just in case.If you need to contact me, I&apos;d prefer by email.  I feel kind of nervous making a report as it is, because of all the stories you hear.  I can make a drawing or diagram if it would help.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Sunday at 4:45 p.m. I was watching a bright white light hovering low in the south west horizon. It was in the wrong place for Venus. A few minutes of observation and I knew it wasn&apos;t a plane or a helicopter. At about 4:50 it was slowly moving toward the west. It remained a bright white light. A few minutes later and I watched it descend into the trees on the hill directly south of Vernon airport. Through the binos I watched it disappear from sight, and the bottom of the light &quot;seemed&quot; to turn orange red as if it was shutting down. Then just over the lake my eye caught strobing lights moving too fast for a small plane about to land.I saw an  &quot;orb ascend quickly&quot;  towards (sort of) the north from the lake and in the binoculars it seemed to go right by a plane heading southwest. The plane was low (approx. 15,000 ft) with its wing lights on.The orb had pink strobing lights but was barely visible to the naked eye.The orb reminded me of the globes that appear when Ghosts are filmed.

As we stood there talking for about five minutes, the light never moved from it&apos;s position. At that point we relized it was not a plane. Now, we were not really talking but paying close attention to the object. There was no sound and it did not move from it&apos;s position in the air.

He told me as he drove east back towards his house, which was about 15 miles to the east of my parents house, he lost sight of the light.

Full 360 deg ridgetop view.  the event &quot;followed&quot; us to Hawaii as well. Will describe three episodes. 1. Looked to the west on very clear summer night, no forecast of clouds.  Clouds as described moved in, ceiling @5Kft. One cloud glowing with something inside, apparently.  Balls of light decended through the clouds, moving down and &quot;playing&quot; with each other in random, beautiful patterns. Immediately looked in vain for ground source (first impression, spotlights playing on clouds) but in country area, little liklyhood of that.  Possible prank or hoax with lazers? But wait. Balls of light left nascent trails behind them. Plasma? and would occsionally pass up and through glowing cloud area to be seen faintly through cloud and dissappear, only to surge back down through the cloud. Also, balls seen in cloud background and night background mostly the same.. Then, above cloud, could be made out spinning &quot;armature&quot; of light, like a great wand (estimate length, at at least one mile) with greater glow at its end. Like the spoke of a wheel only light.  round and round it would go like clock work and the plasma balls  would seem to go up into this phenomenon and come back down.  This went on for some time at least 45 min as we watched the show. Kept trying to think of logical expl. (total skeptic, feel that most UFO either imagination, mistake nat. phenom or primarily secret gov. tech or gov mass hysteria hoax/deception) No ground source.  Balls covering many square miles of air in their dance.  Had the impression at times that the  &quot;wheel of light&quot; was spitting these things out, like a vortex. Almost seemed alive.  Next day (we are not far from Travis A.F.Base) Huge and silent A.F. surveilance planes with bulbous nose, etc. cruising back and forth around area at very low elevation. Have seen phenomenon several times since. One ti! me, wheel of light phenom above cloud quite separate from   &quot;plasma balls&quot; that were streaking very high in atmaoshpere at great speed in definite alignment and purposeful direction, unlike playing balls.

I saw in the sky two round disks white in color with smokelike clouds around it and flying very jerky movements. they were making 90 degrees turns like chaseing each other. When one of them turned, I saw the sun reflect off the disk. then just like that they were out of sight. All of this lasted for about 30-40 seconds.

We made camp half way through the journey. In the middle of the night, I became completely awake and looked up to my left. I saw a large disc shape craft that had what looked like portholes with, what looked like a ball of light going around it. When the light went around the back of the vehicle, the light could be seen glowing over the hull. I shook the girl I was hiking with and told her to look up in the sky. She lifted he head up and then plopped back down - not interested. As I continued to watch, I noticed there were about nine samller discs coming toward the larger disc at about the 2:00 height. They weren&apos;t lighted, but I could see them against the backdrop of stars. As they were nearly to the hull of the larger disc, it began to evaperate. As the smaller unlit disc entered into the are where the larger disc was, they disappeared from light also. We wouold also see disc shaped clouds over our heads while working on our ranch. It would often be windy and the disc shaped cloud was often close - about the height you to throw a ball - and wouold sit stationary, while the clouds were flying by. The perimeter of the disc shaped cloud was cleary defined and looked like it had energy radiating off of it. We were always happy to have them around.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had a duty between 2:00 and 4:00 in the morning. Those days I hadn&apos;t a swatch on me, that&apos;s why I often used to check the time looking at the stars. This time I saw a light, which was moving with random speed, changing its direction rather chaotic. First thought was that this should be a helicopter from the near airbase, but helicopters do not move like that, and do not have this type of light. I would say that the object was looking like a bright star, which was probably not so far from us. It moved sometimes slow, sometimes faster, and traectory was not straight, but rather chaotic. I actualy have some idea where this object exactly was, but I am no sure if I can say that in the Internet. At 4 o&apos;clock my colleague came to change me. With him there were three more people. Later on he said that after about 15 more minutes, the object suddenly disappeared: &apos;It was like a falling star - not falling on the ground, but falling in the sky.&apos; I would add that there was no sound, no flashes, no color changes.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My first sighting of this ufo occurred on August 24, 2003, and it has appear just about on every Saturday since. The longest and my second sighting occurred on August 31, 2003 around 23:30pm. It was a very bright red spherical ufo, that blinked, blurred, brightened, dimmed and somewhat changed color to white, and that traveled in a north easterly direction for about one hour. And you know what the strangest thing about that night. There was hardly any commercial or general aviation activity at all during the event. Not even chemtrail activity. After the event of that night, I counted four police helicopters flying around as if they were looking for something. The chapter of MUFON L.A. has a clip of news footage from KTLA of the event on their website. Check it out. In fact, they all(local news stations) have footage of the event. And of the professional-kind footage that is.My third sighting occurred during the wild fires of Southern California: October 18 2003 around 23:30pm, SATURDAY. During this sighting, the ufo appeared first as the usual bright red spherical object traveling in a north east direction when suddenly it took the shape of a chandelier. It was unbelievable. Within this wheel-like transformation, there was about a dozen small bright white star-like objects dancing or moving oddly within the glowing chandelier. I and other witnesses were in awe. There is more to this event to much to get into. I reported this back on,...I can&apos;t remember, but you must have my report, right? Duration of this event: 40 minutes.It is now December 4, 2003 and my last sighting of this habitual ufo(if I can call it that) occurred on November 29, 2003 around 19:50pm universal time. Now, during this event, the ufo appeared early in the evening, but this time it was a bright white and yellowish color spherical ufo that suddenly turned into what looked like a Christmas tree. Complete with red, green, white, blue, and gold sparkling lights. Also it appeared to be getting bigger, or growing when suddenly it just blinked out of existence. Gone in a flash.(Duration of event: 5 minutes) One weird thing I&apos;ve notice during my encounters with this ufo is that when it is about to blink out, there are unusual meteor streaks or what looks like laser fire up in the stratosphere. I&apos;ve notice that in all my sightings. Also, I notice on some of my sightings, the almost non-present of man-made aerial vehicles, such as airliners, or general aviation crafts, like a helicopter.My educated guess as to how high the ufo is during my sightings,...about 3,000 to 5,000 feet in the air. It is not a plane, or a high altitude jet of chemtrailer. It is definitely not Mars, or Venus, or a supernova, or any other planetary or celestial objects. It is not an astronomical anomaly period. It is not a man-made object either. The people in those areas or cities where the object appears above them have formed ufo watch groups. In fact, many people are scared now, and I&apos;ve heard strange things happening within those cities. Some are calling the sightings: apparitions of the virgin mary. Please! Some bold individuals are now driving around armed with cameras, video recorders, and even armed with shotguns and handguns. The local police department doesn&apos;t want to inquire into it. They don&apos;t even want to talk about it. They&apos;re only statement to me was, &quot;Get going, or you are going to be arrested.&quot; Arrested?

I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT EXPERIENCE, AND HOPE NEVER TO SEE ANOTHER THING LIKE IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.", "Mother-Ship, preceded by four helicopters and some other craft with a red, circular light.I fully understand that people often do not report in a public manner having seen what seemed to be a UFO experience for YEARS.  I fully understand, because I have lived it. My husband (at that time) and I lived in very rural Robertson County, Texas, a beautiful area with tens of thousands of trees.  We had many neighbors, all living on 10 to 50 acres of land, and lots of uninhabited land in between us, a peaceful, rural area of Texas. We lived there 9 years.  When this happened, we had been living there maybe 8 years.  (As a footnote, my former husband lives there now.)  We call our place, &quot;Hole in the Woods&quot;. What happened was this.  We lived in a silver, metal, aluminum luxury-type mobile hunting lodge, about as big as one can transport behind a truck, 33&apos;, with a travel license.  Of course, it had been immobile since we trucked it in those many years ago.  It was our home. When home, we had serenity!  So did our neighbors.  The closest town was Bryan, Texas, (15 miles), twin city to College Station, Texas, home of Texas A&amp;M University. Well, my husband had gone to bed.  I was sitting in the living room, which had a view out of a 8&apos; picture window of the beautiful southern sky, enjoying the silhouetted view of a tree-line that was just past a 50&apos; power line cut.  I was peaceful, I was happy, I was just minding my own business.  I&apos;d lived there, and looked at this view, for years. What happened next rocked my world.  And I do MEAN, ROCKED.  Suddenly, a massive sound started, and then, as I was LOOKING out my window, four helicopters were flying directly towards the window, at an amazingly low altitude.  It seemed to me they were not hardly far above the top of the major power poles crossing the land.  Not very far over them. The sound became deafening, I saw the four helicopters, in a rectangular pattern, two in front, two behind, so low, so loud, that the ground, the house, everything was shaking!  I was freaked out.  And then, to make matters worse, beside the back two helicopters, off to the left (from my perspective) I saw also a somewhat pale, but definitely red, round light flying in what seemed to be in tandum with the back left helicopter.  I noticed that it seemed to not be making any sound, and I sensed a body, but couldn&apos;t see one. But the overwhelming experience was, the horribly loud sound of those four helicopters so close to the ground!  Shaking everything with their roar. This came upon me very quickly and I was overcome with confusion, and seeing the red light also confounded my experience.  Next thing that happened was that my husband came stumbling out of our room, from a deep sleep, yelling, What in the hell was THAT. I told him what I&apos;d just seen.  The noise was now gone, and he went back to bed.  I was left sitting in my chair with an uncomfortable thought, aliens.  What if they landed in the woods and are coming to our house!  Believe me, I had never spent any time thinking about aliens!  I had not purposely ever read one single thing about aliens.  But I had a memory of having read that sometimes, helicopters signal alien craft.  Why I thought of that I don&apos;t know, what I knew at that moment was, I was feeling afraid that those helicoptes had maybe landed in the woods and aliens might be coming towards my house. So, my husband had gone back to bed, and although I was a little uncomfortable, I guess, I just sort of &quot;got over it&quot;.  NOT FOR LONG.  I was still looking out the window at the sky.  After about 5 minutes (this is an ESTIMATE), I saw something that to this day I don&apos;t know what I saw.  But I know what my mind thought I was seeing. Suddenly, lights in a line, &quot;dropped&quot; into view in my window.  My mind said, &quot;Oh my God, a Mother-Ship.&quot;  It was GIGANTIC. And sure enought, that damned thing kept dropping down, and I could see an outline in lights of what looked to me to be a mother-ship.  Believe me, I didn&apos;t think about or believe in alien spacecraft AT ALL. And it was moving closer.  I sort of freaked.  I started screaming, &quot;((name deleted)), ((name deleted)), get up.  YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS!&quot;  My husband came stumbling out of our room again, and I frantically pointed out to him what I was seeing.  He immediately said, let&apos;s go outside.  He ran out the door, and I ran out behind him, down the side of our building.  But I panicked before I got to the end of the house, and turned around and ran inside, honestly, holding my hands on the side of my head, scared to pieces!  When my husband came in, what he told me, I refused to believe.  I refused to believe it so much that I don&apos;t remember what he told me he saw.  I would be lying if I tried to re-create what he said.  What he and I both know is that for the next couple of months, we were &quot;suspicous&quot; of what might happen in the night sky which we had been so familiar with. Nervous about it, to be honest.  I kind of didn&apos;t want to look at the night sky, afraid something would receive a signal from me and appear. Less than two weeks later, my husband and I were driving home from work, about 1/2 a mile from home, down our winding, curving lane (Taylor Road), not thinking about anything, when we came into a clear place on the road, the only clear place on the way home down Taylor Road, and we were just looking forward, driving, when we both saw another spaceship.  Just happened.  There was this huge Texas blue sky, with a huge billowly white cloud in it.  And so help us both, we just both accidently were looking at the sky, when a UFO came flying out of that cloud, shrouded, zoomed forward and then zoomed back into the cloud.  We just looked at each other and said, did you see that?  End of story.((e-address deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I thought it was an rocket from the air base but it sat there in the sky for almost 30 min. Then it began to sink into the horizon out of my point of view. It could be a star but this would have been the birghtest star I have ever seen. It looked like it was definitley inside our atmosphere. Simply because I could not see any stars around it. The only stars I could see were directly above me. The stars above me were very dim due to the marine cover that was setting in. We are due for rain tomarrow so the clouds are building off the coast. The light was west of me so it was in the direction of the fog on the horizon but I could see it like it was right in front of the marine cover. I could see lots of planes flying around in the sky mostly five at a time. I saw two jets one below the object and one above it fly past the object coming from the south. I could tell they were jets because of how fast they moved past the object from such a great distance. It looked like alot of activity in the sky all at once then when I couldn&apos;t see the object because it went below my point of view I saw less and less air traffic. I am used to seeing bright stars in the sky but this was not a bright star it was inside our atmosphere.

My military occupation was Aviation Ordnance technician. I was assigned to an EA6-B Squadron. I don&rsquo;t remember the exact date this happened but it was in the month of June, I remember that because I had just started working &quot;Swing Crew&quot; (that&rsquo;s the shift that starts at 23:30 and ends at 07:30) at the beginning of June. We were just doing a shift change and there was a heated discussion between the two Petty Officer First Classes that were the supervisors of each shift and it was about something to do with some duties that were not completed by the previous shift. The supervisors had all of the people from my crew and the previous crew leave the shop while they had there heated discussion. Are hanger is on the side of the base closest to the water of the Puget Sound. Are shop was a trailer type building out side the west side of the hanger on the flight line. There is a clear view of the water when on are flight line. On this night, all flight sorties were over and the field and control tower was shut down for the night, which doesn&rsquo;t happen that often, and it was very dark on the flight line that night, with all the runway lights off and all.There were about five people on my shift. With the exception of my self, they headed to the &quot;Gedunk&quot; (snack-bar) in the hanger. I decided to just hangout out on the flight line and wait for the Petty Officers to get through. I walked over towards the wash rack that was to the west of are shop. It was a very clear night and some times you can see the northern lights. I had seen them from the flight line maybe a month or so earlier. I was also looking up to see if I could see any falling stars or satellites passing over. I had been out there about four or five minutes looking up and facing west, when all of a sudden I saw out of the corner of my left eye what looked like a meteor falling at what I would guess to be around a 70 degree angle towards the earth. I looked right at it and I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was witnessing. It was bright white and moving very fast, I could clearly see a smoke trail following it and it was so close to where I was standing, that I could actually hear it sizzling. I was waiting for it to impact the water of the Puget Sound where it looked to be heading. All of a sudden it changed directions abruptly at what I would guess to be some where between 200 to 500 feet above the water.I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing, it leveled off and headed in a northwest direction. I was speech less, I felt like a panic attack was happening to me. I looked around real quickly to see if anybody was around besides me to witness what I had just seen. I didn&rsquo;t see anybody and looked back at the light right away. I couldn&rsquo;t believe I could still see it. I was watching it for a few more seconds now and it turned from a bright white light to a red light. A second latter two more lights split horizontally from each side and there were now three red lights in a horizontal formation moving away from me towards the horizon, a second after it split into three, it did it again and now there were five red lights in a horizontal formation. I watched them until they flew out of sight.I told the guys on my shift about what I had just witnessed and they just laughed and thought I was pulling their legs. I asked around the squadron if anybody else had seen it and somebody said that some one else was talking about seeing strange lights in the sky that night, but I didn&rsquo;t find out who that was. I watched the local news the next day and there were reports of people seeing strange lights in the sky around that time. I can&rsquo;t explain what I saw that night, but I know for a fact I didn&rsquo;t hallucinate it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was heading north &amp; was probably heading towards the Clinton Nuclear Power Station, that had just been built. It was flying very low, just over the cars (which were many). It could NOT have been a helicopter or other conventional aircraft for several reasons. ONe fact was that the snowstorm was raging. The wind was blowing very, very hard, &amp; each flake of snow would hit out windshield about the size of a 1/2 a dollar. No conventional aircraft could have been flying in that weather. Two, it had no wings or helecopter blades because they would have hit the trees that overhung the 4 lane street. It was using a very large, very bright searchlight. It had to be some kind of Carbon-arc light because of the brightness of the spot it prodiced on the pavement. It seemed to be using the light to nevigate. It was moving about 5 MPH at an altitude of approximately 15 feet above the pavement. I was sitting at a red light. When the light changed to green, I continued driving (south) again &amp; it flew right over out heads.  &amp; because I was in the center lane, I was unable to turn around right away to follow it.

The object was difficult to see as it was black against the night sky. It was a thick chevron type shape, visible in silloette and left a vapor trail behind it. there was a slight orange glow at the rear (I assume) of the craft that was emitting the trail. I attempted to point out the object to my fellow Scouts and my Scout Leaders, but no one else was able to pick it out of the sky. The Scout leaders called me a liar so I shut up about it. I would estimate that I was seeing a sizable object at an altitude comparable to that of commercial jets.

Although most description&apos;s are very different from mine, some are very similar. I would like to change my mind on being contacted by an investigator, as long as it is discreet.((END))", "White oval craft with a solid blue right around it.I was stopped today in the mall and pulled off to the side. A lady who I know very well wanted to tell me about something she and her husband and two children witnessed on December 8, 2003 at approx: 8:45 p.m. Her husband had just picked her up from a friends house and they arrived back home shortly after. They pulled into their long driveway only to see the two kids standing outside yelling and pointed towards the mountain behind their home. The husband stopped the car quickly and both parents jumped out in fear as they had no idea what was wrong, thinking the worst. They almost immediately noticed a white oval shaped object sitting stationary over the back of their property. The oval shaped object had a solid ring of blue lights which seemed to be moving around the white colored object. A slight and annoying hum could be heard coming from it. The Mother went over and grabbed the two children and went into the house with them, Dad followed close behind. They thought it would be safer than standing outside as they had no idea what is was they were looking at. Once inside the home, they proceeded to a back bedroom, closed the door behind them as not to allow any light from inside the home to give away where they were. (feeling frightened at this time)  But still curiosity was getting the best of them. So they watched the object, still sitting in the exact spot from when they first noted it. The family told me the trees which were below it were all lit up in a white light, and for a good distance around the area. After a total of approx: 4 minutes of watching this unusual craft, it slowly started to move. As it did so the witnesses claimed they could see sparks dropping off the bottom side of it. The sparks were reported to be a white in color. They told me that there was no quick moment to the object, it just rose up rather slowly and as it reached the top of the mountain this is where they lost sight of it. The craft did not blink out, they thought it just crossed over the top and maybe moved down the other side. They reported that whatever it was, was huge. The husband told me it was not a helicopter, no way !! He said we were very close to this thing, and what noise it gave off was minimal, except for this consent humming sound. The husband also said area residents would have been blind not to see this as it was so bright and large in size. HBCC UFO Note: After I talked with the witness in the mall I made arrangements and did go to visit the whole family earlier today. I sat with all of them for a long period of time and I can say this for certain. I believe they saw something really strange as everyone was still very excited over what they saw that evening. I also will be going back tomorrow to look around the area where this object was reported to be hovering.

I&apos;ve been reading about the Hudson Valley sightings and was excited to read that there are many similarities to what I saw, and I&apos;m certain that what I saw is consistent with those events.  Here goes:  I&apos;m really not sure of the date, but on the evening of the sighting, I was at the opposite end of my house, which was a duplex, sneaking a smoke with my 2 brothers.  I remember looking at the sky and saying out loud how cool it would be to see a UFO.  Suddenly, my mother called for me and said that I had a telephone call.  It was my friend from up the street.  He wanted to borrow an audio cassette of my brother&apos;s, and asked if I could bring it to his house.  He lived in the third house up the street from us, to the east.  As I walked to his house by myself, I looked up to my left (North) and saw a formation of lights heading Southeast.  There was no sound coming from the lights, so I figured this was something to keep an eye on.  I ran to my friend&apos;s house and told him he needed to come outside and see what was going on.  We walked further up the street to the east and just past the next intersection where we could see that the lights had stopped directly over the local recreation area&apos;s pond.  There was no noise, and no movement.  I can&apos;t recall whether the lights were blinking or not.  As we were observing the object, a smaller object of white light came over us from the original direction of the larger object (North to South) and seemed to fly up into the center of the lights, where it disappeared.  After a few minutes, the object started moving to the Southeast.  The recreationarea also has a big sledding hill, over which the object eventually disappeared out of sight.  We were pretty excited about the whole incident.  I went home and told my mother and brothers what I had seen, and on the local 11 o&apos;clock news, a report about it claimed it was a bunch of private pilots out of the Stormville, NY airport flying in formation as a practical joke.  Knowing that airplanes don&apos;t hover and do make noise, I can say with 100% certainty that we were not watching private airplanes. Again, I know this was a longtime ago, but I noticed in the articles on the ufoevidence.org wesite there aren&apos;t any mentions of anything being sighted in my area.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Fast moving, high altitude.Witnessed a high altitude light moving at very high speed with no sound. At first we thought it was a satelite until it changed direction several times but always continuing in the same general direction. The night was completely clear and the moon had not risen yet. Temperature was about 80F, winds were calm. Dry, with high humidity. It took the object about 6 minutes to travel from horizon to horizon. Incidentally, a few minutes later a blue colored meteor burned in witnesses by myself and one other person.", "huge bright yellow light appeared then landed on a mountain topA large saser shaped object bolted across the sky.  It then huvered in mid air and then dived down to the earths serface ( a moutaion top)And either hovered or landed.

But,unfortunatly,nothing did.", "Silent, triangular object with three dim, greyish lightsMy family and I were leaving a restaurant after a late dinner.  The night was clear and cold. I noticed three greyish lights moving across the sky, approximately SSE.  At first, the lights reminded me of geese flying in formation, but after watching for a few seconds, they ultimately appeared to be part of one triangular object. There were lights at each point of the triangle, although the lighted areas themselves seemed rounded, not sharp-edged or pointed.  The lighted areas were dim and hazy, and they were fairly large in size compared to what appeared to be the relative size of the object.  It is possible that the lighted areas consisted of groups of smaller lights, but the lights were too dim to tell.  The lights were moving in a very smooth, consistent manner, and were moving in a straight line.  Ultimately, not very far away, the object faded away, as it had moved quite a distance fairly quickly.  However, a normal aircraft would still be easily visible at the point where this one effectively faded into the sky. I could not see an outline of a triangular craft, as there was no moonlight in the sky, so it is also possible that there were three objects flying in formation.  However, I believe that most likely they were all part of one object.  The object was completely silent, and it was not directly overhead, although it was close to being so.  It was flying at a fairly low altitude, well below where planes fly in the area.  Any planes/helicopters flying even remotely close to where this object was are quite noisy and clearly heard.  Again, this object was completely silent, and it was moving much faster than an aircraft (at any altitude). I have lived near airport flight paths in Los Angeles for many years, but I have never seen anything remotely similar to this object. My wife also saw the object, and she recalls seeing an outline of a triangular craft.  I have reviewed other reports from the NUFORC website, and the May 2003 report from Seattle, WA is very similar to my experience.((NUFORC Note:  See other reports from AZ for this same date.

The object was as black as the night sky and if we were not looking at that exact spot we would have never seen the object. The object was huge in size I would guess the size of a football field it had what appeared to be round circles at each point of the triangle.The circles appeared to be some sort of thrusters but made no sound what so ever,it was as if they were trying not to be seen.The perimeter of the triangle looked cylindrical in nature .The object came straight down for about 1 minute then glided forward for another minute or so then vanished.

We live on an extremely short street, two houses from a stop sign. We were laying in bed, having just turned off the television moments earlier, when without any warning, something passed down our street, only 20-25 feet from where we were laying, traveling at an incredible speed, at least 100mph. This object did not produce any light, and it was gone as quickly as it came, and it definately wasn&apos;t earthbound. There was no engine sound of any kind, just the sound of the air moved by its force. Also, we could &quot;feel&quot;, so to speak, the disruption of our space as it passed.", "I looked out of the bus window and saw a horseshoe-shaped thing flying away like it had just taken off.It was a silverish-chromish metal outer part. And had a gold-brown dome on the front. It was shaped as a horseshoe, with pointed ends. The backgrounds were cloudy. I figure it was about 3-5 meters wide and 6-10-meters long.

At 20 min after midnight I noticed a group of red and white lights, locked together, zooming across the sky at what seemed to be airliner cruise altitude, from east to west. They seemed to be about twice as wide as the jet&apos;s light formations. There was one red light in the middle of the group of white lights denoting a diamond or trianlular pattern. These were much, much brighter lights than those of the jets. The red light did not seem to blink, only &apos;flutter&apos;. They seemed to be running at the same trajactories all the east-west airliners were traveling along. No sound from anything in the sky that night, including the lights in question. Too late in the night and too fast to be satellites. **The thing that stood out was that these crossed the sky in 30 seconds.**  All the other jets took 3 minutes. Thats 6 times faster than the jets: which means that the craft was moving at 6*.85Mach = ~Mach 5 if it was at cruise altitude -OR- If it was closer to the ground the speed may be closer to Mach 1 but I should have heard it either through engine noise or sonic boom.", "Unexplained Light over Hardin County.Observed an unknown light traversing the sky at an undeterminable rate of speed.  The light moved from NE to SW in the span of 5 seconds or less before it was out of sight.  This incident occurred as I was passing the exact spot where I first spotted the triangular shaped UFO several years ago in the mid 1990&apos;s (I recently submitted this event, but have yet to see it posted) but this sighting occurred at a much higher elevation. As I was driving down Hutcherson Lane at a speed of 20mph, a bright yellow light entered my field of view from the top of my windshield.  At first the light was travelling relatively slow, but then accellerated to a speed greater than I&apos;ve seen any aircraft fly.  It crossed my field of vision in 5 seconds or less, traversing diagonally across my windshield in a NE to SW direction before disappearing from sight. I&apos;ve ruled out the light as either a falling star or meteorite due to the fact that every event I&apos;ve seen or heard of involving one of the above details the object as possessing a tail behind it.  Besides, I&apos;ve never known either of those stellar event to accellerate mid flight.  The object also appeared to be moving parallel to the earths surface instead of angular, as if on a crash collision.", "Bright blue flashes in the sky and zigzagging light - 1994This is for Peter and from memory. Approximately 6-8 women were gathered on the beach on Orcas Island to watch stars. Off to our left and in the sky, were two to three bright blue flashes.They appeared to be the same color as old flash cubes. Following that, I saw a light that I assumed to be a satellite until it started to zig zag right and left. Then it shot out a bright light with a small fiery tail to it.  It zig zagged down towards the earth and about 60 degrees above the horizon, it disappeared from view.  Then I heard a low hum as if an outboard motor were running out on the lake.  That lasted for about an hour and/or until we left the beach to return to the cabin.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We are grateful to the witness, who is well known to us, for he submitting the report.  We have five other reports of this event from independent sources, who reported it to us shortly after it had occurred.

We believe the date to have been Saturday night, September 24, 1994, and we have amended the date above.

It was flying lower than most of the planes from that direction usually do and higher than a helicopter. Thinking it was strange I stepped out on the back pourch. The flight path was heading directly above my house, which is unusual. It wasn&apos;t going as fast as most planes in my area go, do to the distance from the Chicago airports airports. I watched this plane, which was silent, until it came right above me, and at that point all I heard was a &quot;shhhhhhh&quot; sound. Well, I could clearly see the bottom of the plane. It was a white trianglular craft with bright white lights on all three corners that didn&apos;t blink. The strange thing is it resembled (not exactly but similar) a stealth fighter. The tail section was not as notched out as a steath is, but it just looked similar. Anyway, as it went over, I knew I&apos;d have to goto the front to watch it further south. I ran through the house to see in to the south and when I got there it was gone. It was still day light, there weren&apos;t any clouds in the sky, and nothing to obstruct my view. Also, the craft wasn&apos;t moving very fast as I watched it out back. The craft looked like it could have been a military craft to me, although I have never seen a white craft like this on tv or the internet. I did some searching on the internet to try and find any documentation of such a craft and was unable to find that information.", "Steady red lights that appeared for a few seconds, vanished and then re-appeared elsewhere in the sky.Driving home, going North, on a clear night, I saw a bright red light appear in the Northern sky.

They vanished and then 1 re-appeared west of the first location, but at the same height.  After 1 or 2 seconds it vanished.

It was approximately the size of 3 or 4 stars put together and was whiteish in color.  The city street lights were so bright that I said that it must be low to be seen below the clouds.  Once we got out of the city, we saw the stars come out because the sky was clear so this object had to be very bright to be seen by us through the street lights.  It covered the distance in the sky in 2 seconds and did not leave a trail.  I am familiar with seeing satelites, conventional aircraft, and meteors and this definately was not one of those.  Two other couples at our family get-together saw the object as well.  I am trying to convince them to write a report.

It was about 1963 and my husband and I were walking home from a trip to the neighborhood drug store.  Half way home and at a corner, something made me look up into the sky.  Right overhead and no higher than the planes coming into O&apos;Hare airport was a flying saucer, hovering in place.  It was aluminum colored, had a huge white light in the bottom of the vehicle and around the middle a band of portholes.  There was a light behind the portholes and they seemed to be rotating very slowly. We watched in awe and even waved at it. Soon a one engine plane appeared and approached it.  It had no problem avoiding it.  Up, down, sideways, it never let the plane get too close to it.The plane finally left. Then we thought it was leaving only to realize it was going out towards one of the passenger planes coming in for a landing.  The pilot saw it and for one moment veered off its path to look at it and then right back to its landing pattern.  The UFO then returned to where we were and hovered over us until it starting getting dark.  It then headed for downtown Chicago.  We could see its light for a long time before it disappeared. The UFO made no noise at any time. There were lots of people watching but no one had a camera and we were too far from home to get ours.  Besides I wasn&apos;t about to leave. We reported it and I am sure many others did too, because the morning paper printed a small article about it saying it was an advertisement pulled by a small plane.  Sure it was, right in the midst of the flight pattern being used at the time by O&apos;Hare for all its flights.  My husband, a skeptic and a mechanical engineer would only comment that it was not like anything he had seen before. I will never forget it and have been a complete believer in UFO&apos;s ever since.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had been fishing most of the afternoon while waiting for the sunset. This was day 6 of a three week vacation. We had been to the beach for the sunset about every evening. It was just after the sun had gone below the ocean. The sky was clear. My wife pointed and said can you see that bright light? It&apos;s moving. I looked to the southwest in the direction she was pointing and immediately saw a light at an elevation of about 30 deg above the ocean horizion. It looked like the landing light of a large airplane. It was as large or larger than Mars was at it&apos;s closest this summer. The light was white, steady, and unblinking. It moved from the south toward the north parallel with the horizon. It looked like it could be a fast moving airplane. We watched it for about 10 to 15 seconds. It came to a complete stop without slowing, it just stopped almost due west of us (about 260 deg). We watched it for another 20 minutes and it did not move anymore. We talked about how far it had moved as we watched it. If you held up a yard stick (3 ft) in the middle at arms length, it traveled about the length of the measure in only 10 or so seconds. We looked around the clear sky and could see other lights from planes moving both high and low. All were blinking and all were closer to us than the light and moving much slower in comparison to the speed of the light. We watched two aircraft pass between us and the light in the approach to SouthWest Regional Airport at Ft. Myers. We have taken that flight several times ourselves. It was impossible to tell how big or how far the object was except it was far beyond the normal path of the aircraft and much bigger than the lights of the commerical airliners we were looking at. We finally left after half an hour and it was still there. The following Monday (11/10/03) we went back to the beach at sunset to see if the light was still there. During the same time period on the 10th, no ! light was present. We went again on the 11th (Tuesday, 11 November 2003) and after sun set, suddenly the light appeared in about the same location we saw it in on Friday after it had stopped but just a little more to the south of west (about 250 deg). We had watched the sun set and had a sense of time of setting objects. A while after the sun had set, it was completely dark, the object began to slowly sink toward the horizon until it went out of sight below the ocean level. It did not sink as fast as the sun did. The ocean horizon at a standing elevation is about 12 miles away. We did not see the light any more. It could have been in space for all we could tell. It looked like a big bright flood light. I have followed UFO reports for some years. Except for an incident in 1954 when I saw 5 silver disk the size of a new dime, at arms length, in a V formation, go over in Kentucky, I have never seen anything I could not identify. I read several other people have seen very large bright lights recently. Perhaps something similar. My wife and I are both college grad professional people.", "Oval with a red light at the bottom. Flying at an angle.Oval shape. Red light on the bottom. Flying at an angle. When looked at with binoculars it seemed to have windows or something on the side but it didn&apos;t look like a blimp or a helicopter and it was completely illuminated unlike any airplane would be. It was also much more round than an airplane and it moved really slowly.", "pefect pace ;straight line;stopped dead in mid air hovered momentarily went straight up in cloudsi was at work and was outside having a smoke.i watch the commercial airliners turn left to head west and try to identify what company they are.another guy came out about halfway through my smoke to have one himself when i saw it.a perfectly round silver sphere chasing behind a s.w.a.l. plane keeping perfect pace about half the planes distance behind and appeared to be about as big as the engine is round on the tail of the plane.6 to 8 ft across.i pointed it out to the other guy and he saw it too.shocked he said what the hell is THAT?i turned towards him and replyed i dont know.we both looked at it again and it stopped in mid air held there for about 3 seconds and then went straight up into the clouds.the airliner was about a mile away and approx. 8000ft up.i know this cause the mountain next to us is at 9800ft.we were both shocked and didnt know what to say next so we didnt say anything to anyone.to this day i rarely speak of it and only briefly so as not to have people think im a nut.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Bright white light, very fast, no sound or sonic boom, impossible maneuvers, too fast for aircraftWhen I was in my early teens I was walking down a street in our neighborhood with one of my friends. This was on October 31, 1973 or 74&apos;, Halloween night. Younger kids were Trick-Or Treating that night. When we turned down a street that headed West, I had the feeling that if I looked left, to the South, that I would see something interesting. I have the definite feeling that I somehow anticipated what we would see. I then saw a very bright light moving in the sky from East to West. It appeared to be disk or spherically shaped. I knew something of astronomy at that time and about the appearance of the planets. It was brighter than Jupiter and probably as bright and as large as the planet Venus. It was a bright white light which had the appearance of a planet, not a star. It did not &quot;twinkle&quot; like a star. It moved very fast from East to West but not at all as fast as a meteor but much faster than any aircraft could possibly move. There was no sound or sonic boom. As a very fast (approx. 30 mph) wind was blowing from East to West that night (this could be used to pinpoint the exact year of this sighting) I wondered, for an instant, if it could be an aircraft in the jetstream. The speed it was travelling made it appear that it could go from horizon to horizon in perhaps just 10 seconds or so. After watching it cross at least 25% of the sky, we were amazed to see it start making 90 degree turns as if it were tracing the outline of a series of steps. it made about 3 of these imaginary &quot;steps&quot; and just blinked out. At that moment I was sure that whatever we had just seen, it was not an aircraft, meteor, bolide or any known object. Upon thinking about it later, I decided that the high wind conditions would also rule out any kind of optical illusion caused by a &quot;temperature inversion layer&quot;. The memory of this has stayed with me for the past 30 or so years. This object left no trail in the sky of any kind. It was a circular light with clear &quot;edges&quot;. approx. planet sized (in appearance). It appear! ed to be a considerable distance away like a distant aircraft would be.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Brilliant Red Starlike object in east sky on 11-20-03 in Tempe AZDriving home from the store my kids and I noticed an object far to the east that looked like a very bright star only it was a very deep red. It&apos;s difficult to explain but you knew it wasn&apos;t an airplane by the intensity of the light and the color of the red (the red was too concentrated) also the object seemed to be hovering in one spot. My kids and I watched it after we got home as it seemed to be drifting forward, then drifting to the north.  During the last 10 minutes it stayed stationary before finally in one sharp movement that seemed to be eastward it just disappeared almost as if it evaporated, disappearing into thin air. I would love to know if anyone else noticed this or what it was.((FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION SUBMITTED NOVEMBER 30, 2003))Additional information to my 11/20/03 report (Brilliant Red Starlike object in east sky on 11-20-03 in Tempe AZ)In addition to the report I left on 11/20/03 (Brilliant Red Starlike object in east sky on 11-20-03 in Tempe AZ) I also wanted to add after reading (Flashing red light moving slowly) from the same date that I too saw the two airplanes in what appeared to be the same area where the object had been. One of the aircraft continually circled the area for approximately 15 minutes, it could have been longer but I went inside after determining the red object wasn&apos;t going to come back.  These seemed to be private planes although it was too dark to say for sure I&apos;m guessing by the lights and the sounds. I got the distinct impression from the planes behavior that they were looking for the same thing my kids and I had seen.((END))", "Fireball slowly decended to fence row and rolled on the ground slowly then back into the airWe were in an open field on our farm in rural kentucky, we had been for the last several hours shooting my neighbors bow at sterafoam targets, it was to dark to shoot anymore and were about to walk back to our houses, when we saw a ball of fire about 25 feet in size come from over an ajoining farm house to the rear of my farm along the fence line boundry. it came fairly slow to the fence line. we walked to the gate beside the barn and watched it as it rolled down the fence line causing it to glow. The fence was mostly cedar posts but there were 2 trees, cedar, about 30-40 feet high in the fence row also, the trees glowed as it rolled through them. I was about 10 at the time my nieghbor was 16, the ball of what we thought to be ball lightning moved completely and slowly to the end of the fence line and went back up in the air 20-30 feet and disappeared. I remember fear and awe and wanted to go look at the fence but we didn&apos;t at that time. The next day I was going to go back there and see if the trees blew up when it hit them but when I opened the gate to the feild I noticed something very strange, we had a few white ducks and one was sitting on the ground as though sound asleep, no head or neck, no blood, no scattered feathers, it only had a slight concave portion were the neck would have conected to the body, again no blood. It wasn&apos;t even red or meat colored, it was grayish. I went on to the fence line 300 yards away and all was the same as normal, trees fine, no marks or burns. Maybe I&apos;m wrong but wouldn&apos;t lightning have singed the bark, or leaves or weeds along the fence row? Later that morning, within an hour of that anyway, I had my first nosebleed, the only one I have ever had in 49 years. There is also 1 more detail I am very hesitant to put in here, actually 2, 1 I will tell you the other will remain a secret because it is way, way too weird to tell. The morning I got up to go check the fence line, the day of the nosebleed, that morning when I awoke to go downstairs my brother started telling my grandmother about a dream he had, I stopped in in the middle of the dream and finished it, I had the same exact dream. No I can&apos;t say it was about aliens, I don&apos;t remember what it was about, but it was exactly the same dream. The fire ball was exactly as it sounds, fire ( Orange,red, and yellow) ball, close to the size of the largest tree in the fence row, thats how I ascertained or guessed the size. Please feel free to ask me any questions or for the name of the witness. The fire ball by the way made no noise, and left a glowing trail as it rolled down the fenceline that lasted a few breif seconds.", "multi coloured disc landed in kettering ohiocraft was landed three houses down from where i was living at the time, on fields st.in kettering ohio.  it had multi coloured square panels that were changing different colours from red,blue,yellow,orange and assorted variations but strangly no green... i was escorted out of my house right through the front door and returned at dawn..my sister let me in through the back door of the house... and still after all these years, i just cant beleve that no one saw or heard a thing!!!", "Very bright light, flickering and traveling faster than a normal commercial jet.We were sitting in living room, watching TV.

On this occasion, I noticed a bright, flickering light traveling along the Columbia River, about 2 thousand feet above horizon.  I couldn&apos;t see the craft. But the light was incredible: it was very bright and flickered, like a disco light flashing. It also resembled a tool I used many tears ago to set the timing on a car tune-up, where the light flickered.  And it was also noteworthy that the light was so bright and looked like the new halogen (?) lights on new cars.  Very BRIGHT, it was unusual.  Another thing, the object was fast but jerked up and down slightly.  Much faster moving that a commercial jet.  Also, the light was eminating from the rear of the object, as if it were on the back end of the craft.  There was no sound like jet engines, not the thumping of heliocopter rotor blades.

There was a 1/4 moon and clear skies with no fog/haze.  The object flashed blue, green, red, and orange.  Altitude was probably 25-30,000 feet as I also watched 1 jet flying south in the west at what looked like the same altitude.

Nor her or I have seen a plane that looks quite like that. Nor have we seen anything drop straight towards the ground at that speed. It dropped for about two seconds before it was out of sight. In those two seconds it covered the entire sky. We both know what planes look like and how they run, as we live near Boston (logan airport) This was not a plane. It happened somewhat near the Hockomock Swamp (the bridgewater triangle)  Shortly after, a millitary style plane came acorss the area at a high rate of speed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Both objects were perfectly round and traveling paraelle with each other. I have been a sky watcher for thirty years and can honestly say that I have never seen anything out of the ordinary. This day was an exception. The objects moved at the same speed, but the one on the outside was moving infront of and then inback of the other.There where two women crossin the same street as I, but when I called out to them to look at the objects, they did not hear me.I must also mention that both objects where traveling nnw to a easterly direction.The objects seem to be at approximatly 3,500 ft. and moving at apx. 500 mph. and curved into an easterly direction and were gone in a matter of ten seconds.The story does not end there! Later that day I went onto my roof with my binoculars to check out the birds in the area and also to look at the aircraft that pass over my house, being that the LaGuardia flight way passes over my building and the airport is just a five minute flight to the airport. As I trained my binoculars onto the sky, I once again had the same two objects come into view of my binoculars. It was only a second or two, but I was able to get a good look at the two objects. This time they were also coming from the nne and heading west. They were the exact same objects, but this time moving faster and both equally at the same speed. They both were gone in a matter on seconds.I now believe that UFO&apos;s are for real!  Sinserly,  ((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports submitted by same witness.  PD))", "update 9/11/95 ufo Pierce CityI am adding to my report of a sighting near Pierce City, Missouri on September 11, 1995.I first posted my account online in 1996 or 1997, but I&rsquo;m not sure where I posted it, and have not found any record of the report to date.  My original report may have been written better than my recent one.  To the readers, I apologize for this shortfall.I spoke recently with the other witness and I have made a composite drawing of our accounts.  I neglected to describe the presence of &quot;portholes&quot; or windows in the side of the UFO.  The oversight is the result of poor preparation.  I apologize.Perhaps a more personalized account of the event will shed some additional light on the event. The sighting occurred on September 11, 1995, the day after my father-in-law died.  My friend and I were traveling in my 1985 Pontiac Sunbird south along highway 97.  The time was certainly between 4:30 to 6:00 pm because the sun was still fairly high in the sky, but was beginning to cast long shadows. The sky was clear, but there were high clouds, the air was fine and all things considered, it was a fine day for a drive.  I&rsquo;ll recount the thoughts in my head in italics as the event unfolded:  &quot; JUST DRIVING. Great weather, nice drive; dry pavement, sunshine, cool breeze As we headed south towards Pierce City, I was driving 50-55 mph and was getting prepared to slow down in a few moments, the edge of town was in sight from the hilltop and we began to crest down it. A BLIMP? What&rsquo;s that to my left?  Big Silvery metal-looking thing. Floating just above the trees.On down the hill, in a field to my front and left I noticed a cigar shaped object with bright lights coming from the center below it.  I assumed it was a blimp with a flashing advertising sign underneath it. WHAT&rsquo;S TO ADVERTISE? What are they trying to sell?  There&rsquo;s just trees and squirrels out here.  Where&rsquo;s the gondola (where people ride).. Oh portholes! how weird, retro, looks like something from a Jules Verne novel! Cool!  HAH At this point, I had noticed that there were porthole windows inside the object itself.  That is odd, blimps have big windows on the little gondolas that hang beneath it.  I remember seeing a single row of about 10 little glassy portholes along the side.  The lights below it were very bright, which I expected were just advertising lights.  Then I laughed out loud and pointed the object out to my friend.  I said,  &quot;Look at the blimp!&quot;  He knew I was wrong immediately.In a later conversation, we discussed the number of portholes, I thought there were between 7 and 10.  My friend said there were twelve.  When I asked him if there could have been 9, he said in a very matter of fact tone, &quot;There were TWELVE.&quot;  Rather than get beat up over the matter, I dropped the topic, and now that I think about it, 12 seems about right. THOSE ARE BRIGHT LIGHTS! Those are bright lights on that thing. Ow they stab my eyes.  Maybe it&rsquo;s just a reflection from the sun. &quot;Damn that hurts, why is the car all lit up??  Why is he being so quiet? In this very short time I found myself being confronted with bright lights, an awestruck passenger and a UFO, even though I still thought it was a blimp.  My laughter died when I was being  &quot;flashed&quot; by the lights.  If you&rsquo;ve been flashed by a car on the highway at night, you can begin to understand the annoyance I was going through.  The car had a reddish-yellow glow on the inside from the lighting and I could see my own shadows in the back and passenger&rsquo;s seats.  My friend was absolutely catatonic with his stare at the craft.  It was only then that I began to realize what was going on. NOT A BLIMP AT ALL What&rsquo;s he gawking at?  That&rsquo;s no blimp. There&rsquo;s no tail on it, no writing.  No gondola.  No propellers!! No tail fins!!  crap. As soon as I pass this tree, we can get a good look at this thing.&quot;   At the point I realize it is not a standard blimp is the point where my mind begins to race.  It should be noted that my eyes had a burning sensation. And we both felt a strong &quot;current&quot; going through us.  The current is no more than that weird feeling you get by standing to close to a microwave or watching tv from less than a foot.  (We both agree that there was nothing to get excited about) &quot;Because I am an avid reader and a speed reader, I have terrific eye speed.  I was able to search the craft for humans, writing and propellers.  It had none of them. As we began to approach a roadside tree, we were on pace to be alongside the craft in a matter of seconds.A SILVERY STREAK Alright let&rsquo;s see what this is. Around this tree.  What?  Where is it?  A streak, going up  and right.  IT&apos;S  OVER THE ROAD  &quot; Gone!  Gone  GONE.I wouldn&rsquo;t know it was a UFO until the thing just vanished!  As I prepared to look as the tree passed from view, it plainly wasn&rsquo;t there.  My friend just made a weird &quot;huh?&quot; noise and I noticed it was streaking up and to the right.( for you geometry people the rate of angle was 60 degrees, straight and at the speed of a blur).  When I say blurred, I mean the craft flashed like a strobe light and at a high speed.  It was quickly overhead and then disappeared completely.  The object had moved from a hover to a speed I would estimate as a little faster than the speed of aerial rockets in fireworks displays.What WAS that? I didn&rsquo;t know then and I still don&rsquo;t know now.  But I have happily reported all I know to the people of the world.  My friends have seen UFOs but they won&rsquo;t report them.  That&rsquo;s too bad.  But it is their own business, and I respect it.  I encourage others to report what they have seen.  It&rsquo;s doubtful that the government will send thugs to your house, or aliens will abduct you for talking.  I don&rsquo;t really believe in either entity much.I was moved by my sighting, as was my friend.  He would see another one later.  I know I shouldn&rsquo;t tell his story, it&rsquo;s not mine to tell, but I&rsquo;ll share it anyway.After we saw the UFO in 1995, we searched the skies looking for another.  I haven&rsquo;t seen one since, but in June 2003, my friend saw his SECOND UFO.He had been waiting for over 7 years to see one again.  He calmly pulled over to the side of the road, parked his car, and reached into the back seat.  What he was reaching for was his camera.  He had it handy.  He pointed and clicked.  But he had forgotten to wind his film.  He quickly wound his film and aimed.  As he got the UFO in the viewfinder, it disappeared!  Now he keeps his camera wound and ready.  He&rsquo;ll get them next time I&rsquo;m sure! It might sound like a made-up story, but I believe it, he&rsquo;s not the type to kid around.  He just sighed and laughed, because he knows I believe him, we&rsquo;re not crazy, and life is still too good to worry about things like that.", "Bright orange light lasts 3-5 seconds over ocean, accompanied by multiple strobe lightsHave seen this phenomena several times over the last couple of months, and did a web search to see if anyone else has seen it, hence this report. I live in an oceanfront condo, and was sitting on my balcony overlooking the ocean when a bright orange light appeared approximately 25 degrees off the horizon over the ocean. The light was bright enough to reflect in the water, although how far away it was I could not discern. The light basically blinked on, remained bright for about 3-5 seconds, and then quickly faded out. It did not move. Another light appeared about 5 minutes later at about the same height, but a quarter of the horizon north. Another appeared 10 minutes later, directly in front of me, at the same level, and as soon as it faded out, another one appeared maybe 5 degrees away from the first. The light is large, to my eye approximately 10 times larger than Mars. Focusing binoculars on the light does not provide any discernible object, with no running lights visible after it fades to indicate an aircraft. There was a full moon out, which backlit the sky enough to make any physical object visible through binoculars. The sky was clear. Each time I have seen these orange lights, they are accompanied by a multitude of white strobes, numbering anywhere between 10-30, which move across the sky at various altitudes, but the movement is erratic. I am used to seeing aircraft strobes as planes departing and landing from the Myrtle Beach airport fly across the ocean regularly. These strobes do not track like an aircraft, but erratically bounce around. At times a red strobe can be seen alongside the white strobes. Mostly the strobes can only be seen with binoculars, however it is not uncommon to discern them with the naked eye once you know what to look for. I have always seen these objects between 9pm and 11pm, sometimes they last for two hours, other times for a half hour. Tonight I observed a set of 6 white strobes move inland for the first time. They normally remain offshore. The strobe! s are very small, which makes judging their distance difficult. The strobes and orange lights sometimes appear on one side of the horizon, then the orange light will appear on the opposite side, and the strobes appear to race across the sky to it. A multitude of aircraft with strobes moving as a group may appear they are moving erratically due to the nature of a strobe light. The only explaination I can devise concerning the orange lights is possibly the glow from afterburners, although there is no aircraft visible when it fades, ie no running lights. Two guests have seen these lights on different nights with me.", "Light swooped in, I was on highway 400 north at exit 88. Light was Greenish blue about400 feet off the ground, thought it was going to crash but it suddenly took off all you saw was a red dot. I was following another car and when we stopped in Barrie the sighting was confirmed.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "At about 6:30 p.m. 11/08/03, our next door neighbor&apos;s litte girl came over, knocked on the door, and asked if we wanted to see a UFO.  I find it very difficult to describe.  There was what appeared to be light clouds surrounding it. It was fully dark outside.  The sky showed a dark cloud bank to the north and east and partly cloudy conditions with lots of stars visible to the south with what seemed to be a light low drifting cloud cover to the west. What I saw I can only compare to the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It seemed an object made of clouds was approaching from the west, approximately a mile away judging from the landmark it seemed near.  It was round, apparently flat and very large.  Holding both my hands at arm&apos;s length would not cover it.  The outside of the circle appeared to be moving very fast with lights in the pattern of a circle, blinking somewhat in strobe fashion, and the entire circle of cloud seemed to be moving in the direction of the lights about as fast as a fan blade would move on a box fan.  Inside the outer circle of lights there was another circle of lights also moving in a circular motion, but not as fast.  The object slowly approached were we were standing.  It made no noise whatsoever.  When it was almost directly overhead I could see that the very center of this cloud phenomenon was clear and stars were visible through it.  At the point it was almost directly overhead it turned on it&apos;s side (like a tire being picked up from being flat and put into a position of function)and took off at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing into a heavy cloud bank to the north and east.  Immediately after it did so, the sky overhead became completely clear with stars visible to the west and south, as though the thrust and/or heat had disippated the clouds behind it.  This lasted about 15 minutes from first sighting to disappearance.  I don&apos;t know how many people actually saw it, as a friend had called my neighbor and told her about it. It was so quiet that we (my husb! and and myself) would never had known it was there if we had not been told.  I find it very hard to describe, but I cannot think of any natural phenomenon to accout for it.", "I was captured, encapsulated,  I was one with that light, the objects were light.I was travelling north on I-5 at approx. 80 mph.  I was alone in the car, I had to urinate and was speeding towards a rest area I knew was thirty three miles ahead.  There were no other vehicles around me when I saw to my right out in the fields paralleling the interstate a very bright light.  I looked into it and it appeared to be a combine working in the field and loading a big truck.  At the moment of this incident I thought it odd this would be going on in the middle of the night and that the light could blind someone.  Then the combine and big dump type truck seemed to be Tonka type toy&apos;s.  Then the rest area was at hand and I realized I had to urinate quite badly.  I slowed and followed the rest area road info the parking lot and parked.  As I did so another smaller car followed mine and parked to my left and the driver got out and hurried over to my car as I was opening the door and he said &quot;did you see them?&quot; I said &quot;see what?&quot;  He said &quot;the bright lights following your car.&quot;  I said &quot;no, but I did see the combine with the light shinning on the highway&quot;  he said &quot;not that, the round lights that were all around your car?&quot;   I said &quot;no , just the combine and I have to use the toilet fast.  I ran to the rest room and when I came back I went to the passenger side of his car and a woman put the window down and there were three children in the back seat.  The woman and the three girls in the back seat were obviously frightened.  The woman asked me again if I had seen the lights and I told her the same as I had told her husband.  &quot;No, I only saw the combine light but that it had held me and I did not remember the last thirty three miles.&quot;  I told them not to be afraid, if whatever it was wanted to harm us it would have, and all I accomplished was to further frighten the children.  I got back to my car and headed back north on I-5 to a motel in Stockton.  As I was trying to sleep I felt as though I had been one with that light.  I&apos;ll never be sure how long I was with the light, I know I lost attention with the road for at least thirty miles at 80mph.

It had colored lights reminiscent of the Speilberg multicolors in Close Encounters, but no electro effect, no sound. It was oval to saucer shaped and possibly one hundred to one hundred fifty feet between the above cited twin towers at an angle of about forty degrees. It began to move very slowly in the &quot;makai direction,&quot; or toward the water direction behind the tower facing towards the beach on block away close to St. Augustine Catholic Church.This was much larger than the scale of the Speilberg special effect, but this was not a movie, it was real life. At that distance it took more than half the angled vertical space between the towers.As it moved, behind the tower I tried to &quot;keep a low profile,&quot; walking not running towards Kuhio Avenue, across Ohua and around the other side.

Whitney.  Our elevation was above the 10,000 ft. level in the Sierra Nevada Range. While not quite asleep around 10 PM I heard a strange &quot;whirring&quot; sound in the sky.  I opened my eyes and looked directly up towards the crystal clear, black and moonless, star filled sky.  This slow moving object flew directly over us.  The object radiated absolutely no light whatsoever.  If it wasn&apos;t for the fact that as it passed over head it blocked out the stars behind it, I would have never seen it.  It moved rather slowly across the sky.  Much slower than a jet would travel.  Its direction of travel was from north to south.  Several seconds later, maybe 30 or so, two jets flew overhead in the same path of travel as the object, as if chasing the object.  I could tell they were jets due to their wing tip lights and that I had served on an aircraft carrier in the US Navy I have had plenty of night sightings of US Aircraft. I could not tell the exact height of the object as it flew overhead, but it must been at least 1,000 feet above us to clear the ridge line that surrounded the lakes.  We were just east of the spine of the Sierras and the elevation at the peak is about 11,000 feet.  The two jets were flying at higher than normal speeds but without their afterburners fired. It just seemed so weird to see an object fly over and block out the stars behind it in a total blackness.  It must have been rather large for it blocked out the section of the sky as if I held my hand out at arms length and blocked out the stars.

As my eyes adjusted to the dark, I noticed many of these UFO&apos;s, which appear to be all around in the nights sky.  They look very odd to the naked eye, however, with binoculars, it is clear they are disc/oval shaped/ect. with green, blue, and red lights flashing around, and are perfectly still in the sky.  One especially stuck out to me tonight, perhaps because it was much closer, but this object had a flashing red light in the center, with blue and green lights circling around it; it apparently looked about 1 mile high in the sky, and had smaller objects of the same description all around it.  Perhaps it was a mothership, but I do know this.  They are appearing more often in the last couple of weeks.  They seem to have many with them, but are disquised to the naked eye as very bright stars. What I ask people to do is if they see a star that seems to be twinkling very brightly, LOOK CLOSER.

It hovered the whole time we watched (my mom had slowed the car down to a crawl by now). It was about 150 yards away from us, right above the trees, directly over the river and 3/4 the size of a football field.

I woke up early to check my blood sugar, &quot;I am a Type 1 diabetic&quot;, I went out on &quot;((4th name delete))&quot; deck, &quot;my fellow musician&quot; above Redondo to have a cigarette. I looked out over the Puget Sound, &quot;because it is so beautifull there&quot;. His cat had come outside with me. I then saw a large Oval ball floating over the bay directly in front of Redondo, approximately 3 football fields away from me. It was black and silver inside, and the two colors seemed to be mixing together and rotating inside like wet paint. I would say it was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter from my perspective. It hovered and paroused the area until it went out of my sight, to the right because of the large trees in the area. The strange thing was, is that ((name deleted)) cat was watching it the whole time with me. Of course ((name deleted)) and my friends thought I was crazy. I now live under the flight path coming into Sea/Tac, in Des Moines, WA. I have many times thought I heard, stange sounds and lights outside of my condo/bedrooms window. Since I am a type 1 diabetic, and am prone to insulin reations, &quot;911 medics have been here more times than I wish to mention&quot;, I do not know if these experiences are real, or part of my imbalances in my brain. I know that on July 4th 2001 my blood sugar was 125 mg/dl which is normal. Go figure?", "Bright hovering object.It was a bright object. It appeared to be circular in shape.  It moved slowly and at times seemed to stop in one place.  we followed it with a camera thats mounted on top of (approximately) a 20 story building.  The sky was clear.  It was about 60 degrees outside.  We followed it on video zooming in and out for about 45 minutes until it got very dim and disappeared into the horizon.((NUFORC Note:  We note that Venus would be in the western sky at about the time indicated by the witness.

PD))", "UFO sighted over U.S - Mexico border town.On 11-24-2003, at approximately 1920hrs, in Laredo, Texas a UFO was seen in the southwestern sky. The UFO seemed to be suspended in the sky in the vicinity of the Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, across the Rio Grande river from Laredo, Texas. The UFO was the shape of a circle and gave off a bright white glow, though not shiny or glaring. Several witnesses intitially confused it with an airplane on approach to Laredo International airport. However, the UFO&acute;s glow suddenly intensified, with a slight light blue tinge, and it appeared to expand its diameter (this may have been the visual effect of the glow). The object then moved at an incredible rate of speed, at approximately a 45 degree angle upward and in a southwesterly direction into Mexico. And with a second burst of speed the object disappeared into the night sky. At approximately 1927hrs,  two aircraft flying in formation, coming from the northeast (possibly Kingsville Naval Air Station) and at a very high altitude followed the direction of the UFO&acute;s flight path. These jets crossed into Mexican airspace.

On 11/23 or thereabouts, my girlfriend and I were walking in Ballard. It was cold, dark, and misting a bit, and around 10:30 pm there was a freak lightning strike; the flash was blinding and disconcerting, as if we were in the middle of it, but the thunder came about five seconds later. We thought nothing of it until the following week when my girlfriend&apos;s sister returned from California (Santa Cruz, I think) and told us the same thing had happened there. The night may not have been the same, but it was the same time - around 10:30. She also said she talked to people in other places on the west coast (in California) who witnessed a similar phenomenon, all at around 10:30 pm.

Garden State Parkway, going south, it was about 8:15 P.M., at about mile marker 15,that all of asudden there was a bright bluish-green light, that filled the entire front windshield of the van.  We were all struck in awe, and after about 4 seconds one of us said, what the hell was that.  There was no sound, like an explosion, that we could hear, and if there were, I am sure, that we would have seen maybe some reddish color before the bluish-green.  There were seven of us in the van, but only five of us saw this event.  The other two, were asleep.  We continued talking about it all of the way home.  We figured that maybe the light originated in maybe Delaware, cause as I said the &quot;&quot;LIGHT&apos;&apos;, filled the windshield and it was away from us, I would say about 25 miles away, cause we were on a like straightawy on the parkway, and we could seen the outlines of the trees against this light.  The trees are in the middle of the parkway and on both sides.  The light did appear far off, but none the less it was there. The next day, the driver of the van, called a friend of his, who has something to do with reporting either weather or news for a local newspaper, to see if he had heard of any type of story regarding what we saw.  He said &quot;NO&quot;, but suggested that we contact the United States Weather Bureau, for a event report. The event of the sighting was:  Wednesday, November 26, 2003 at approximately 8:15 P.M., at about mile marker 15 South on the Garden State Parkway, in New Jersey.  The night sky was clear, and I would say, that visibility would be unlimited. I am 53 years old and have never in my life ever seen anything like this. The next day, Thanksgiving Day, I checked the local newspaper, and there was nothing in the newspaper, but we figured being that it was late, in the day, that the newspaper would not report it yet.  I checked again the local newspaper of which is the Press of Atlantic City, New Jersey, and checked the entire newspaper twice and there was nothing about the &quot;LIGHT&apos;&apos;.

It is a &apos;comment&apos; report on a follow-up investigation done by a Michigan MUFON Field Investigator. Occurred : 9/20/2003 18:00 (Entered as : 09/20/2003 18:00) Reported: 9/21/2003 6:45:44 PM 18:45 Posted: 9/24/2003 Location: Fraser, MI Shape: Light Duration:25-30 minutes star-like lights in the form of triangles and diamonds dancing in the late afternoon sky  My Brother was out in the yard and called to us to hurry and come look at &quot;this&quot;. In the sky directly above us were what we at first thought were hot air balloons that ascended so high they appeared to look like stars in the clear blue sky. There were 3 in a formation of a perfect triangle to the left and 4 to the right in the shape of a diamond. Then they began to dance in the sky with each other returning to their positions. Coming very close to each other but never colliding. There were 3 sets of these formations. One had a stream of light coming from it leading me to believe it was a hot air balloon but when it ascended up and disappeared I dismissed that idea. Nearing the 20 minutes of watching these star-like objects dancing in the sky others started to appear as dim stars and became brighter up to 50 were in the sky at one time dancing, but never colliding. They ascended and just disappeared. There was no sound, no aircraft in the area, no tails on the craft above us.

Field Investigator) David Twichell&rsquo;s photocopied forms and report on Sunday November 9, 2003.  My initial impression of this case was that it was a solid case that would produce quite an extensive report due to it being a daylight sighting.  The investigator originally included with his report a copy of the original WUFOD report in context of an email I sent him, Form 1 (2 pages), with an extra page for the spillover of the reporting witness&rsquo;s personal account, a 2 page hand-written description of the object by the witness, Form 2 (3 pages), Form 4 (1 page), Form 5 (1 page) with an added handwritten page describing the psychological and physiological effects as reported by the witness, a 3 page typed report by FI Twichell, a 2 page printout of the weather conditions for Mt. Clemens, MI on September 20, 2003, a one page small printout of a map of the sighting location and two cassette tapes of the phone interviews of all witnesses involved. There were 8 witnesses in total however after all was said and done only 1 witness&rsquo;s signature and form are on file with Michigan MUFON.  The 1-hour onsite interview was done on November 3, 2003 with R G and her mother S at R&rsquo;s home.  Afterwards, R met with FI Twichell at a local Tim Horton&rsquo;s restaurant, for another hour, to further discuss her possible abduction, as she didn&rsquo;t want to discuss this in front of her mother.  The attention of the investigator has been drawn towards R G, who appears to be the dominant witness and whom initially filed the report.  I will summarize my thoughts on the other witnesses accounts first, then R G&rsquo; account, and finally on the case as a whole. MA D, wife of L D, described the event in a very straightforward serious manner, with excellent detail.  The time of the event as noted by M A was around 4:00 pm (2 hour discrepancy here compared to other witnesses T.L.) or a bit thereafter.  She mentions that one of the objects could&rsquo;ve been a &lsquo;party balloon&rsquo; floating upward with a spiral tail attached to the balloon.  She mentions that L, her husband, in fact said it was a party balloon.  M is in agreement with most of the other witness&rsquo;s in the fact that she stated she was facing south and the objects were moving from west to east.  She suggested that she thought it may have been a &lsquo;weather gadget&rsquo; as appears in the movie &lsquo;Twister&rsquo;, and may have had something to do with weather testing.  She mentions a 45-minute duration to the sighting.   She described the movements of the clusters of objects as being &lsquo;like a butterfly&rsquo;, no jerky movements.  She also didn&rsquo;t report any physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting. L D, the witness who was first to see the objects mentions them catching his eye while he was walking up the back steps, to go in the house, around 3:55 pm.  He was looking towards the west at about 40o up from the horizon.  He stated the sighting duration was approximately 47 minutes.  He too reported no physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting.  He mentioned initially seeing 7 shiny &lsquo;dots&rsquo;&hellip;. 3 being in a &lsquo;straight line&rsquo;, and 4 being shaped in a &lsquo;straight edged arch&rsquo;.  He mentions some of the objects rotating around in a circle very slowly.  Most of his account matches closely with that of his wife M A and that leaves me with the question of, &ldquo;Was there significant collaboration between the two witnesses resulting in some level of contamination in these two accounts?  This seems most evident in the time at which they estimated the sighting began. S D - L&rsquo;s Mother - The initial part of this taped conversation has only the voice of FI David Twichell due to the fact that his speakerphone was not turned on. After David asks her about what time [the sighting began - T.L.] there is some silence and then David mentions a time of 6:30 pm during the early part of their conversation.  I&rsquo;m making what I believe is a valid assumption, based on the taped conversation, that they are speaking of the onset of the sighting event.  She mentions her friends present at the sighting location counting about 8 -10 lights. She stated they were moving around one another and darting back and forth.  She also mentions a sighting duration of 15-20 minutes.  Here we see a large discrepancy in the time of the event onset and the sighting duration as compared to L and M A&rsquo;s account.  S states the objects were seen &lsquo;overhead&rsquo; in the southeast initially and then darted to the west for a short distance further stating that she didn&rsquo;t have to move her head very much to follow them.  She mentions also that the sun had set approximately 1 hour after the objects disappeared.  The sunset, as listed at the bottom of the weather data, was at 7:30 pm so her approximation of the onset of the event being at 6:30 pm could very well be correct.  She too mentions the possibility of the objects being helium balloons. She also stated she was emotionally excited and had &lsquo;chills&rsquo; up and down her arms.  This witness has had a previous sighting of a cigar-shaped object, which she experienced in Canada but no specific information was given about this sighting. AM G - She initially states the time of the sighting started at 5:30 pm.  She states she was initially facing south, which is in agreement with most of the other witnesses.  She mentions the objects slowly moving, or drifting across the sky and that she watched them for approximately 2 hours (a notable discrepancy in the sighing duration here - T.L.).  For the most part the description of the objects is in agreement with the others.  She states she suffered from no physiological or psychological effects, however she does mention one interesting effect and that was she saw &ldquo;little white specks&rdquo; like TV static in her eyes due to her head being craned up towards the sky.  She had to repeatedly look down to relieve this effect and readjust her eyes.  She believes this may have been due to her looking up in the sky for long periods of time.  She said the objects were at an elevation of approximately 80o to directly overhead. (Here too is a discrepancy in what was said to be a 40o elevation for the objects mentioned by the initial witness L. - T.L.)  J G had very little to add to this investigation.  His interview was extremely short.  He was in the house watching a football game and showed very little interest in determining what the others were viewing.  He states the sighting onset was approximately 6:00 pm.  He stated he didn&rsquo;t look at the objects long enough to discern much detail.  He stated what he saw was a bunch of cluster type star shapes and then went right back in to watch the football game, not looking at them long enough to even determine if they were moving.  He stated that the other witnesses stayed outside for 15-20 minutes watching the objects. M Z stated onset of sighting event was about 5:30 pm.  She stated she saw white &lsquo;balls&rsquo; like a balloon but it wasn&rsquo;t a balloon.  She states there was about 15-20 of them and the sighting duration was a good 45 minutes.  She stated that the objects were in different areas and not in one spot.  The witness says they [her and the other witnesses] were all kind of nervous.  M stated that R called [reported them to MUFON] because her and her mother thought these were some kind of thing from outer space.  She states the objects were moving in different directions, yet says that it could&rsquo;ve been the wind blowing them.  She said at no time did they change color.  No physiological or psychological effects noted by this witness.  Witness, in my opinion, seemed very hesitant to give out her address, and left only her phone number with FI Twichell.  Her husband M was interviewed later. MZ stated he saw 10 whitish things that could&rsquo;ve been balloons.  He didn&rsquo;t watch them too long and didn&rsquo;t think anything of it.  Stated it didn&rsquo;t interest him so he went back in the house.  Onset of event he says was 5:30 - 5:45 pm.  To him it looked like balloons.  He stated they were kind of drifting not going any certain way.  Objects were at a high altitude.  He watched the objects for approximately 5 minutes.  Nothing unusual noticed, as they were too far away to tell.  No color changes noticed.  Very short interview&hellip;approximately 3 minutes. R G, the witness who reported this incident, was affected quite differently by this event.  She states the onset of the event was around 6:00 pm with a total duration of 25-30 minutes, which fits in well with most of the other witness&rsquo;s accounts, except for those of L and MA D.  She first thought these were hot air balloons.  She went on to describe their movements using the word &lsquo;dancing&rsquo; meaning they would move towards and away from, and around each other.  She initially saw 7 objects in two different groups.  She describes the color as being dim blue then turning brighter.  She goes on to describe in detail, as evidenced in the taped interview, many perceptions that weren&rsquo;t described by the other 7 witnesses.  R&rsquo;s size estimation being that of an aspirin, as suggested by the FI is quite in opposition to the starlike description given by the other witnesses.  She relates her account in a very excited way with a lot of emotion in her voice.  The other witnesses sounded much calmer when relating their accounts. R mentions another sighting she witnessed about 17 years ago in which she called Selfridge ANG at that time as well, with no response from her message left on the automated answering system at the base.  20 minutes into her phone interview R adamantly mentions there was not a plane anywhere in the sky.  She then mentions, about 27 minutes into the interview that &ldquo;after, a jetliner was by and it was higher than that&rdquo;.  This point being unclear as to whether or not the objects were in the sky during the time the plane was seen.  I asked FI Twichell to clarify this if he could.  He states, &ldquo;As to the plane involved in the sighting of Sept. 20th, I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m not making myself clear on this.  I didn&rsquo;t make a copy of the recorded interviews so I can&rsquo;t check them for clarity but the witnesses agree that they did not see any conventional aircraft in the sky until the very end of the sighting episode.  While the objects were still above them, a jet, coming from the direction of Selfridge, came into view and headed in the direction of the objects.  At this time, the objects ascended and were gone from view.  MA stated that the plane was visible while the objects were still visible. R goes on to mention her husband&rsquo;s flu-like illness previous to the sighting and it&rsquo;s complete reversal during the sighting, and then a subsequent relapse afterwards.  She feels this may be relevant.  Her husband did not mention this during his interview.  R also noticed a definite difference in local animal activity whereas the others did not, and also mentioned an eerie silence during the event.  She goes on to describe the remainder of the sighting as mentioned within David&rsquo;s report. David then sent another report to me, via email, dated October 2, 2003 regarding RG&apos;s possible abduction event.  This report brings up the question as to why this wasn&rsquo;t mentioned in her initial telephone interview with David.  I believe there is some level of malleability evident within R.  I posed a few intentional leading questions to David that he posed to R.  I asked, &ldquo;Was there any physical evidence left as a result of these abductions?&rdquo; and she replied, &ldquo;I have a scoop marking on the left lower leg learing [nearing? T.L.] the front of my shin. Also on my right leg the first night of my &quot;dreams&quot; I recall injuring the inside of my leg just above my ankle with a terrible hemotoma, as I hit it trying to run away, I believe. When I returned to my bed there was dirt and tiny stones in my sheets and I had no socks on. (I ALWAYS wear socks to bed) The hemotoma was so bad I thought I had broke my leg...I iced it for several days. Today my flesh is still discolored, but it is no longer black and blue it is a dark reddish with a slight purple tint color that you would see from a fresh bruise. It is 4 inches across by 2 1/2 inches up and down. I will say this... when my doctor saw this back in May, he said it was a terrible bruise and it would heal right up with time... I never brought it up again.&rdquo;  It is difficult for me to understand her knowledge of how &lsquo;scoop marks&rsquo; are associated with abductions without any previous knowledge of UFOs or the abduction phenomena. Another question asked was, &ldquo;Did these abductions take place at the same time on each consecutive day?&rdquo;  She replied, &ldquo;Yes they took place at the same exact time each night consecutively @ 3:00 A.M. This is the first time I recall distinctively the time. I see the time on my clock in my room and I cannot wake my spouse. I am being pulled by my feet from my bed.&rdquo;  Another question asked was, &ldquo;Any poltergeist type activity in the home before or after the abduction event? She replied, &ldquo;There has been an abundance of poltergeist type of activities in my home from the toilet fully flushing and the handle moving to the downward position. We have had books moved from bookcases and placed opened onto the table, mostly civil war books. I have had my college papers missing and my books only to look feverishly for them and they appear before my eyes as I could have stumble over them. We have gotten phone calls with tones instead of static and we have caller ID... nothing appeared or registered.  My sister came over and did a Catholic exorcism in my home with a tape and holy water saying prayers and Blessed candles lit. I was still in tears from the &quot;dreams&quot; and emotionally upset because I hadn&apos;t saved the baby... unable to sleep or eat, and did not want to be bothered by anyone as I felt they did not understand my emotional state. Oh yes! The radio would turn on in the bedroom and change radio stations from one to another and another and another.&rdquo;  I believe her emotional state at the time of the above exorcism up until the September sighting event and possibly afterwards may be an important aspect of this case and should be looked into further, probably by Dr. T.  FI Twichell states that R claims not to have been previously interested in the UFO phenomenon prior to this event. She said that she hasn&rsquo;t read any books or watched any documentaries on the subject.  If this is true then her &lsquo;abduction dream&rsquo; is simply astounding and would correlate well with other KNOWN abduction accounts, however the question remains with me, where would she have obtained knowledge of the often reported, &lsquo;scoop mark&rsquo;. According to R, there also appears to be evidence of an abrupt change in her personality.  There also appears to be other serious differences of opinion and disagreements between R and her other family members regarding the above-mentioned exorcism, matters regarding R&rsquo;s mother, and her husband&rsquo;s health issues that may be compounding factors in this case which would best be dealt with by Dr. T.  Again, a further in-depth background check would be necessary to confirm these personality changes as well as any family problems now existent and any previous interest she may have regarding the UFO phenomena. On Form 2, first page, under &lsquo;Shape&rsquo; I noticed that &lsquo;disk&rsquo; was checked off but I hadn&rsquo;t heard any witness mention anything about a &lsquo;disk&rsquo; shape to these objects.  I queried David about this and he replied, &ldquo;The one object that appeared to be larger than the others, with the curly-Q tail, was described by R G as being more disk-shaped than star like. She was the only witness that made this observation.  I&rsquo;m not aware of where this statement appears in the context of the material that has been made available to me (T.L.). I completed forms 4 &amp; 5 as indicated on the forms.  These were sent by the FI, via postal mail, to the witness to be completed and signed.  Once she returned them he felt they shouldn&rsquo;t be altered after her signature was placed on the form.  I added the necessary data in order to complete the forms. At this time R&rsquo;s possible abduction event and the sighting that was initially reported to MUFON will be handled as separate entities.  WUFOD, NUFORC and Filer&rsquo;s Files were checked for sighting reports that may be relevant to this report but nothing of any significance was discovered.   This sighting was also reported on September 21, a day previous to it being reported to WUFOD, to Peter Davenport&rsquo;s NUFORC website.  See http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31702.html I&rsquo;m not aware of any other communications between R and Mr. Davenport.  Mr. Davenport has made the original report available to me. Due south of the sighting location is Victor Airway 221- 464 which is on an 85o (E-W) heading.   Wind direction from ground level (329 ft. at DTX weather station at Pontiac White Lake) to ~35,000 ft. ranged from 240o - 270o (blowing from the west to east approximately) at speeds ranging from to 6 - 50 mph respectively.  From 35,000 ft. to 97,000 ft. the wind direction was a bit more sporadic, ranging from 20o - 240o at speeds ranging from 58 - 3.5 mph respectively. These figures were taken from radiosonde data from the above-mentioned Nexrad weather station located approximately 30 miles northwest of the sighting location near Waterford, Michigan.  Archived NOTAM&rsquo;s (Notice to Airmen) were also checked for the date in question but nothing of note was listed. In my opinion it is evident that helium balloons tied together could account for some of the movements described by the majority of the witnesses.  As far as the event time and sighting duration discrepancies are concerned I would tend to think the 6:00 pm time range is correct due to the fact that the party was completed and the cleanup had begun.  The football game (Michigan vs. Oregon) was televised at 3:30 pm with the postgame show starting at 6:30 pm.  The sighting duration discrepancies are wide ranging but all estimates are, as far as typical UFO sightings are concerned, rather long in duration.  This would make me lean even further towards the &lsquo;balloon&rsquo; hypothesis as a possible explanation due to the objects slow and drifting movements.  There are some aspects such as the color change and &lsquo;beam of light&rsquo; or &lsquo;light bar&rsquo; noted by a few of the witnesses that would be difficult to explain via the balloon hypothesis, other than it being some type of reflective string used to tie the balloons together. Overall, I would have to evaluate this sighting as BORDERLINE IFO due to the distance between the witnesses and the objects, the object&rsquo;s &lsquo;point like&rsquo; appearance yielding no notable surface characteristics or structure, and their slow drifting movements. Currently R G has been put in touch with Dr. T concerning her abduction type experiences and she may be scheduling a regressive hypnosis session in the near future.   I feel that her abduction experiences, and their associated emotional difficulties, should be dealt with by a qualified Doctor who can separate the abduction experiences from the more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; emotional difficulties that may have arisen due to unrelated health and family issues which R G is facing. This could possibly provide her some relief or coping mechanism for both situations.

The source of light did not move the entire time(5 minutes plus) and it would fade to a pinpoint then increase to a white(as though reflecting sunlight) source several times its previous size.

I saw two dots heading in out direction very rapidly and as I concentrated on focusing on them I saw this little dot in front of them.At first I thought maybe it was just vulture or some other raptor flying in the foreground, but as I observed, I saw that this dot was staying in sync with the two bigger dots as they were closing on our location.Then within just about 15 seconds we (wife/I) saw two military jets (black long noses, w/green camo(/f-16/f-111?)) enclosing on this cigar shaped object.They nearly flew just couple 100 ft above the hill we were just on. They were so close that the sound was deafening.One jet tried to come up on the ufo and even banked a little bit to maybe get a better look of the ufo.The ufo then seemed to really move quickly, and it started to pull away from the jets.My wife and I excitedly grabbed the kids and ran up the path to top of mtn we had just climbed.When I got to the top I could just see the two jets rapidly heading, I guess east over the mtn range.My wife says she saw a glimpse of a silver shiny color on the underside of the ufo.I don&apos;t recall seeing color; I just saw what look liked a dark line or cigar shaped object just a little shorter than the jet&rsquo;s noses. I served in the u.s.a.f  for 4yrs as a security police and never have ever seen anything like this before with military jets flying so low over semi-populated area.Vandenberg AFB is just down the road from Los Alamos, but does support fighter jet aircraft.VAFB mainly deals with missle launches.Interesting thing is later on in that month I would see these fighter jet kind of aircraft flying into VAFB.Which is odd, because when I worked at VAFB, I rarely saw these kind of fighter jets, except a day or two before an air show.My wife and I are not sure what we saw.

It was a bright sunny day and there were several other planes out leaving contrails in the sky but this object was just going straight upwards and it disappeared from sight in about a minute.  The object was almost straight upwards from where I was standing but I was facing eastwards when I saw it so I had to have been eastbound.  There were no markings on the object, it was not shiny, but just a dull gray or dirty white color, and it&apos;s speed was difficult to tell since it was going upwards. Next, for the past two nights (11/19/03 and 11/20/03) there has been a light that is stationary close to my school in Richardson which is where I go to school and work.If you look towards the west, you can see that it is about at a 45 degree angle with the horizon.  Both times that this light appears, there had been several witnesses both faculty members, staff, and students that have witnessed this light.  The object itself just seems to be a white or yellowish star that is out of place but has been seen in plain view at 5:45 pm and is extremely too bright to be a star.  The idea that it was a weather balloon seemed to be a more valid case but with all the wind that we have had these past days, I find it hard to believe that a weather balloon would be stationary for over an hour.There were several students that watched it until approximately 8:00 pm when I was told by them that &quot;it just left after a while&quot;.  When I asked how exactly it departed, the students told me that it left slowly towards the west. These same students also claimed that they saw another craft fly by with three red lights on the front of it.  The details of the shape of the craft were quite sketchy but I took it that it was shaped like a plane but the lights were arranged strangely.((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date of the alleged sighting was in the year 2003.

One of those experiences I reported on an earlier date that occurred last year.  I was awakened from a sound sleep by a blinding light which looked like a full Moon, but didn&apos;t make any sense at the time.  Later, I called a local observatory and found out that my experience happened on a night when the Moon was not full, and that the direction it would have been in made it impossible for what I saw to be the MOON.  Now in the past three months or so I have seen a light flash above my head over the bed on the wall in my bedroom.  There has not been any sound, but I am extremely agitated some nights and find it hard to go to sleep ever since the last experience with the light coming through my venetian blinds.  The first instance with this experience happened here the Summer before last.  I have found praying the Rosary, helps me go to sleep.  I only started doing the Rosary on October 18th this year.  I find that saying it while I am laying in bed helps me go to sleep and the fear factor has diminished due to this practice.  I had not felt compelled to say the Rosary for years and am what some would call a fallen away Catholic.  By coincidence the night I started saying the Rosary a friend gave me one.  The gift came a day or so after a good friend died.  Something neither the giver of the gift or myself were aware of, so the coincidental nature of all this is very strange.  Another event, I have not formally reported occurred last March and involved a huge triangle over the edge of the property where the driveway is situated which curves around to the apartment in which I have lived for close to two years now! I noticed around the time of my experience a pilot of a private jet aircraft saw a similar object in the air about 140 nautical miles SE of Columbus which is located approximately 20 miles S of where I am living.  I was never sure of the date of that occurrence, but have wondered if what he and I saw occurred on the same night.  He saw a huge triangle which is what I saw also!  Appreciate this website since it is helping me to relate and understand that other people are having the same expeiences I am.  It also helps jog my memory about them, since somehow I have a natural tendency to deny or block the stuff from myself!

I had the distinct impression that they had been trying to mentally contact me, because I seemed to have been hearing a sort of haunting music that was coming from no external source during the whole incident.((NUFORC Note:  The dramatically bright, &quot;twinkling&quot; star, Sirius, is just to the left of Orion&apos;s Belt.

The object came from the west and was moving at a very high rate of speed just a one would expect a meteor to do. It approached at appx.a 40&apos; angle to the ground and was a bright yellowish green color, similar to a tennis ball. I quickly noticed, however, that this was no meteor. As it neared the ground it came to a complete stop and began pulsing and it&apos;s color changed from yellow to orange.

The craft I saw was small and gray/silver far off in the distance.  I was watering the trees and plants and I just looked up at the sky(I was facing south) and there it was just a small gray object in the sky that did not fit in with my memory of any object I have ever seen before in my life.

I have enjoyed your articles on Rense, and thought perhaps you would be interested in my story, or could point me to someone who would care to investigate. I live about 10 miles east of Cloudcroft, New Mexico, in a rural subdivision bordered by the Lincoln National Forest. On Nov. 28, 2003 at about 1pm I was walking my Akita Nikki in the National Forest and came upon a dead elk laying in a shallow ravine. The elk was no more than 200 yards from our subdivision, and perhaps half a mile from my house. There is a substantial elk population in the area, and sightings are not unusual. The dead elk was a small one, the length of which from chest to rear end perhaps 4 feet, and weighing maybe 400-600 pounds. Rigor mortis was full and complete. There was no apparent bloating. Nor was there any evidence the elk had been gutted by a hunter, as there was no apparent longitudinal incision on the lower abdomen/chest area. The head had been removed, as if cut from the body right where the neck joins the body, and the vertebrae stuck out from the cut area about 6 inches or so, ending in a smoothly sliced vertebrae. So far one would suspect a trophy hunter possibly who just killed for the head to mount on their wall, eh? However, I believe this elk to be much too small to have had any significant antlers (maybe no antlers at all). Now for the really interesting part. As you can see by the photo I am sending you, the rectum of this elk has been smoothly cored out. Further, the genitals have been removed, and there is no obvious way to tell the sex of this animal. The removal of the genitals could be attributable to animals perhaps (we have mountain lions and bears, as well as coyotes) as the removal does not appear  to have been in such a clean, surgical fashion upon my limited observation. I will allow you to draw your own conclusions. You may reach me via email, or at (deleted by HBCC UFO) for any further info I failed to give you. I will be happy to assist further in any way, plus provide additional photos. Also, if it will lend credence to this situation, I am a former Federal investigator, as my wife was also.

We watched it till it went out of sight to the east. We went back to cooking our hot dogs and looked up about 5 min later and watched another long narrow cloud like thing again race across the sky from west to east. This also reached from horizion to horizion. Like the other it RACED across the sky no way was the wind blowing this that fast.

I witnessed the flash umtil it dis-appeared behind a nearby tree top. At first I thought it was a meteorite, but then I realised that it was rather large/close and between me and the clouds.

After hearing him again with Art over the last weekend, Peter said that only 10% of sightings get reported, so I have decided to report a sighting from 1969 to add to your data base. This sighting has never before been reported by me, but there were other witnesses to the event. I will give details as I remember them. I was 14 yrs. Old and lived in a small town called Lamont just southeast of Bakersfield, CA. I don&rsquo;t remember the exact date, but it was a warm August evening, around 10:00pm, and the skies were very clear. I was with my best friend and we were in his back yard. He was talking to his girl friend, which lived next door to him, through her bedroom window as she was not able to come out and visit with us. Not wanting to eves drop on his conversation, I was walking around his back yard staring up at all the brilliant stars in the sky. I was looking northeast when all of a sudden I saw approximately 9 to 13 objects that looked like falling stars enter the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere or ionosphere. These objects were flying in a perfect &quot;V&quot; formation (I&apos;d be happy to send you a crude drawing). I actually saw them enter the ionosphere at what I guess was approximately just west of Las Vegas, fly true north to south and then watched them exit the ionosphere at what I guess was approximately over San Diego. This took about 4 to 5 seconds to travel that distance (approx 400mi). The objects made absolutely no sound, not even a sonic boom, and remained in perfect formation the entire time we viewed them. I say we, because as soon as I saw them, I hollered at my friend to look, and he caught them about mid way through the sighting. If you hold your arm out at length, the &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; encompassed about the length of your thumb from one end of the wing to the other. They were individual objects because I could see stars in between them as they crossed the sky. I couldn&apos;t see any lights on them, as they were too high up, but they glowed red hot and had long fiery tails with short smoke trails following the fire, very similar to meteors entering the atmosphere. They just entered the ionosphere, flew across the sky never breaking or veering at all from formation, and left the ionosphere just as easily as they entered. This sighting scared me because I couldn&rsquo;t explain what I had just seen, so I ran in the house covered in goose bumps. My f! riend stayed out a while longer talking to his girl friend. He came in and told me another set of them flew by after I went in. 10 years later, while talking with a fellow musician up in Lake Arrowhead, the subject of UFO&rsquo;s came up. I asked him to explain what he had seen, and he described the same thing I saw, the same month of the same year. We assumed it had to be the same objects because his description matched mine perfectly. He was in Whittier, CA when he saw them. Whittier is about 100 miles south of Bakersfield. We both remarked that we just happened to be looking up at the sky during those few seconds, and anyone else who may have been looking up at that particular time could not have missed them. It&rsquo;s also sort of interesting at how this event affected both my friend and me. I got so excited, I started reading all about UFO&rsquo;s and talked to everyone I could about them. My friend clammed up and wouldn&rsquo;t talk to anyone about it, I think for fear of being called a kook. I have never had another personal sighting, although I look up at the skies whenever I can in hopes of seeing something again. Thank you for being an outlet for all of us who have had sightings. It&rsquo;s a validation for us.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Spotted two round craft coming from the n/e and curving into the east. Both craft were perfectly round and white. No other external appendages could be seen. Of the two, one flew perfectly in its curved destiation, but the other on the outside flew too and fro of the other. I followed these objects until they were out of my sight. I feel they were at apx. 4000 ft. and traveling at apx. 400 to 500 mph. That evening I was tempted to go to my roof with my binocilars, not to look for UFO&apos;s, but to look at the Barn Owls that were nesting a few blocks from my house. As I did not see any Owls that afternoon, I decided to lay down and watch the sky. within seconds what appeared to be the same two objects came into the view of my binoculars.As most people know, you can not keep a steady view of objects flying high and at a fast speed. I continued to watch them for apx. another ten seconds until they were out of my view.After thiry years of sky watching, this was my first truly encounter with objects that I can not explain.Begin that I live in Brooklyn over the LaGuardia Airport fly zone, I am very familiar with all sorts of objects that fly in this zone and these objects were nothing that I can explain.", "Craft seen hovering over field and then same craft seen over my house 25 miles away along with crafts hovering in distanceJust after sunset my mother&apos;s friend was taking my friend back to her house in Stockbridge, along with me in the passenger seat. About 15 miles into the trip we all see this bright light in the sky fade away, then get brighter and then disappear, with no clouds around it. Well after we drop my friend off we were on our way back when we see this strange object with pulsatinc lightsover a cow pasture and corn fields. Each light would pulse three times once at a time.. and it hovered over the car as we were driving.. going almost the same speed were. As it went over us i saw it had a humped shape on top and it was like a triangle. But it also had a light on top and lights all around it. The way it moved is the strangest however.. instead of moving in a straight line, it teeter-tottered it&apos;s way slowly across the sky, rockin back and forth like a plane woul with it&apos;s wings when it &quot;waves&quot;. It looked like a worm wriggling it&apos;s way across the sky. Throughout the 25 mile ride back we saw lights in the sjy get brighter and fade over and over again... when finally as one got so bright and then it jetted across the sky faster than any plane, and within 5 seconds it had reached so far past the horizon you couldn&apos;t see it. When we arrived back to Whitmore Lake just over the lake was this saucer shaped object with red lights all around itjust hovering abover the lake. Well that was freaky enough right.. well when we pulled into the driveway.. the same craft we saw over the field was right over my house... waiting for us.. just above the trees. Shaped like a triangle with a large blue light coming from the center and pulsating white light all around it.. it wiggled it&apos;s way once again slowly very very slowly across he sky. I immediately hopped out of the car to grab the video camera but it had already disappeared when i got back outside. So determined as i was i sat for only 10 minutes outside before i saw lights begin to appear just above th horizon. I started rolling film. My mother, 2 of her frien! ds, 2 strangers and I all saw what were anywhere from 2-6 crafts at a time appear and reappear in the distance slowly moving hardly at all really.. and hover in one spot over a period of an hour. I got about a half hour of footage where you can see the lights moving from side to side and fade away and appear out of nowhere. I don&apos;t have the equipment to send the video footage over the web however. And just as I type this at 11:30 i see more lights in the same spot so maybe there will be more to this story...", "Wobbling Disc Daylight SightingI was in back of our house looking at the sky and noticed an odd looking object. I was not sure what I was seeing at first. The object was wobbling slowly. It was moving slowly from South to North, against the prevailing winds, which were blowing West to East. I would estimate the alititude at 1500 to 2000 feet. The sun was low in the sky. The object was reflecting sunlight from western edge, and appeared to be a silver disc shape with a brown or dark colored center. I would estimate the diameter of the object to be about 20 to 30 feet. I could not hear any sound from it. I ran in the house and got my binoculars, which took about 30 seconds. When I returned the object was gone. If it had been some sort of balloon it would have still been in sight. There was a small private airplane approaching the area where I had last seen the object. Duration of the sighting was about 2 to 3 minutes.((BEGIN FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM WITNESS))Hi Peter,I just filed a report on an object that I saw here in Portland late this afternoon. I had been watching the object for 2 or 3 minutes, and decided that it was probably not a mylar balloon or something like that. It was moving Northward towards me, and appeared to be moving against the wind. I ran to get the binocs, and it had flat vanished, which surprised me. I didn&apos;t get a feel for the size distance or altitude of the object until I had returned with the binoculars. There was a small private plane moving into the vicinity of where I had last seen the object. I don&apos;t know if the pilot had seen it or not. The plane seemed to be a bit lower than the object. Which would have meant the object was much larger than I had susupected. If the object had been something floating on the wind it could not have disappeared inthe 30 seconds, or so, that it took me to get my binoculars. That is why I was surprised that it was gone from sight when I returned, back outside. I had the distinct feeling, at that point, that this had beenan intelligently controlled craft, it had seen the small plane flying in it&apos;s direction, and had vacated the vicinity. By the way, when I had finished filing the report I went in and looked at the reports from Oregon and read the ones from 11/6/03. I live about 1 1/2 miles Southwest of the control tower at PDX, and about 20 blocks South of Lombard. Not too far from where those 2 sightings happened. I watch the air traffic all the time, day and night. Today&apos;s sighting was about the 4th one I&apos;ve had at this location, in a little over three years, since we have lived here.

The craft was a combination of a barrel and teardrop shape. Several colors shining very bright. The craft climbed at a very slow rate. Slower than any plane with out stalling in flight. This craft had very distintive colors red, blue, white, yellow or amber. The reason I noticed it was the lights where shining so bright and the absences of sound. I could hear birds calling and also see other commercial aircraft in the same area just at much higher elevation. At first the craft was at tree top elevation. I was talking on the phone at the time of the sighting and noticed a failure in the cordless phone to a cellular connection. This craft elevated at a very gradual rate at the same angle of acent about 75 degrees. This craft was not the average.

Even my wife is not aware.  If it ever gets out, I will be an outcast!  But I know what I saw. At about 9PM on the 7th of July, 1998 while watching TV, I heard what sounded like a distant explosion. Seemed to have come from the Southeast (toward my back-yard).  Thinking it might be some illicit fireworks left over from the 4th (fireworks are VERBOTEN in California), I stepped out into the back yard to watch.  I saw some 4 or 5 more explosions (rockets) with the traditional red-white-blue streamers coming down.  After the 4th or 5th rocket there was a long pause.  I didn&apos;t know if that was the last rocket or not so I just waited. While I was waiting I glanced around the sky.  It was very clear and the stars were bright.

I estimated it took about 2 minutes to complete a rectangular trip, and made approximately two of these trips while I watched.  Then there was a split second when it streaked off at about a 45 degree angle which led away from the rectangle it had been making.  In about 1/10th of a second the light just went out.

At this time, it is still moving about in the same portion of the sky.  This same object has been seen for over a two months period (from September to December 12, 2003, by two of the witnesses that is presently making this report.

The object we are now seeing in the western sky, appears to be the same as what we have been seeing, only then it was it the south-east portion of the sky, and moving about just as it is this pm in the western portion of sky.  I looked for it for the last two nights and could not see it.  We then saw the same object in the Western sky, as stated on this report.  We do not &quot;do drugs&quot; and have not had anything to drink (yet) and of a clear mind and of average to upper average intelligence.We have NEVER seen anything like this before and we are certain, without a shadow of doubt as to the accuracy of our statement.  The object appears to have bluish green lights underneath or across it and they appear to be flashing.  In my observing this object from September to December 12, 2003, I would spend two to three hours just watching it move about.

I had propped my elbows on a rooftop ventilator to hold the binocs steady--when I suddenly saw, coming into the left of my field of view and holding an absolutely straight lateral line, a very dark object, cylinder-shaped (really it was more like a segmented caterpillar, with &quot;bumps&quot;). It was tilted at an angle of about 30 degrees to the horizon, and held that attitude. What the heck is that??? I wondered, and followed it with my binoculars, thinking that I&apos;d see it better when it crossed in front of the moon.But it did not cross in front of the moon--it disappeared then reappeared on the other side! which was really mind-blowing, and rules out aircraft, flights of geese, loose helium balloons, and any other hypothesis I can think of. Also, it stayed at exactly the same 30-degree angle, Very dark against the night sky, no nav lights or any other kind of lights. Utterly silent. It wasn&apos;t something on the lens of the binoculars, either, because it moved independently. I took the binocs down to try to see with my naked eye, but couldn&apos;t see it, then couldn&apos;t find it again.I don&apos;t even believe in these things, so the joke&apos;s on me.", "Four circular lights in the eastern sky.Objects look almost like stars, but are pulseing red to blue to white and is too bright by comparison to other stars.

It had something like 6 or more round white lights indicating the shape of the infamous &quot;V&quot;.

We all jumped out of the car and watched it until it disappeared out of view over the distant tree line. This object was defiantly neither an airplane nor a squadron of helicopters. We still talk about the incident and still have no explanation.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))It was in 1985. I remember the date vividly because I was on my way home to watch the Led Zeppelin reunion concert; the first of it&apos;s kind since Bonham died in 1980. I did however think that the concert had taken place in 1986 and always looked for other similar sightings that took place then.Yesterday I saw an article about Live Aid and it had July 13, 1985 listed as it&apos;s date and when I crossed referenced I noticed a similar sighting nearby in NY. I wonder if there is any connection. I live in a very rural area just 15 miles outside NYC and thought that surely others must have noticed this craft flying low over their homes but was very surprised when I heard no corroborating events. I have been looking up in wonder ever since.((END))", "UFO streaks past hotel and unreported aerial search of beach and ocean is conducted by the navy (most likely) or coast gaurdWe were staying at a hotel on Jacksonville Beach with a room facing the ocean. We were on the balcony and something flew very close to the hotel, about 20 to 30 yards from where we sat on the 8th floor. We could easily have thrown a rock and hit it if we werent stunned by seeing it. It seemed oddly shaped like a rectangle but wobbly and it made the same noise a helicopter makes and it had a bright red glow coming from it which made the whole side of the hotel red. We didnt know what it was but an hour later we noticed lots of activity up the beach by naval station mayport, spotlights and the whole base lite up like a christmas tree. We then drove as close to mayport in neptune beach as possible and sat watching for hours all the activity out in the water. There was several helicopters with search lights skimming over the water, there were at least 12 total helicopters, 7 were skimming over the water about about 2 to 3 miles out, they would pass each other and come back and there were at least 5 helicopters we could see up the beach and up in the sky above the beach. We left after a few hours because we thought MPs would come out from the dunes and arrest us but as we left the electric boxes on the poles were all buzzing very loudly, we have been to the beach here before and the electric boxes didnt buzz like that normally. We went back to the hotel and in the morning there were still 4 or 5 helicopters skimming the water and at least 2 we could see flying about the beach.

Me and my friend were staying up all night just to look at the stars. We saw a light that look like a plane but we kept looking at it coming toward us. As it came flying above us it had no sound an it was flying low. It was going slow too. It look like a clear circle with lights a round it. It had one light that changed colors.

I often, when outside walking our dog, gaze at the night sky. We have a large piece of property out back-where you could walk around looking at the sky, without bumping into anything. I happened to see what I thought was a jet miles away- a single light moving accross the sky. About the size and brightness of a large star. As I just began to casually track its flight; my eyes picked up two other lights of the same size, moving towards the first light at what seemed like the same speed. It did not take me long to realize, that, they were all travelling towards an imaginary center point in the sky. As they approached each other, I could see that they were maintaining the same speed, and distance from each other as they got closer. When the three lights reached the center and each other; there appeared for just a few seconds-one light. Then, like a bursting firework in the sky, the one light became seven or eight, that, moved away from each other in a near perfect circle, at about the same brightness, speed and maintained distance. I watched as they disappeared, over about 20 seconds or so. Afterwards, I felt calmly elated, sort of comforting to observe this sort of show in the sky-that I still feel to this day, was meant for me to see. I went back in the house with our dog to relay my experience-which no one really paid any attention to. It didn&apos;t matter then-or now if anyone would care to hear about what I had seen.

I was closing quickly on the stationery aircraft and then observered a third aircraft to my left traveling South, by this time I was within less than two miles from the two hovering aircraft.

I pulled over and we examined the window. the picture on the window matched our drawings of what we saw that night. the strange thing is that it will not come off the window. we rubbed really hard but it would not change or come off. I am hoping that there is a logical explanation for this. I thought at first maybe THAT (the marks on the window) was what we saw that night, but I saw it out of the side window as well and there are no marks on the side window.

The object was moving very slowly. The sky was overcast. 3 of us observed it: my girlfriend, her daughter and me. The disk seemed very big and very high in the sky. It came from the north-west part of the province of Quebec and was going south-east. There was no sound. I ran to the neighbor&apos;s house. His wife answered the door and as she was coming out of her house a commercial airliner flying at a high altitude was about to cross path with the object. The airplane was about the size of a 707 but the disk was much bigger than the plane. The object started to zigzag quickly to get up through the clouds and disappear before the airliner crossed path with it.  I went back inside and watched channel 740 on cable TV.

I also telephoned the witness to find out a little more about the sighting. I had a nice conversation with him, and he went on to explain exactly what he saw. On December 5, 2003 (in the video clip the witness tells that the sighting took place on December 6, 2003. The sighting actually took place on December 5, 2003, a simple mix mistake) he saw a pair of unknown objects at 5:43 p.m. while out Barbecuing. When he noticed the two objects, his first thought was a couple of satellites were flying side by side. But he starting thinking this was really strange looking because one of the objects would quickly move past the other, then the object which then followed behind, would make the same moment and fly up a head of the other. The witness said it looked as if they were racing across the sky as each one tried to pass the other. He mentioned that the speed of these two unknowns was incredible as both moved so very quickly. The two objects eventually went into a cloud bank and disappeared. They were a very bright orange in color. An example he gave for the color and size of the two objects were that of the brightness and size of the planet Mars when it was at it&apos;s closet to earth. The fellows son, at a different location from where his Dad was saw a single unknown object traveling south at a low rate of speed,  it quickly sped up and was gone. The reported time for the son&apos;s sighting was between 5:50 - 5:55 p.m. Thank you to the Dad and son for their reports. Also the video clip will be placed to my website once the new site is completely sometime after Christmas. There are tons of updates and new material to be posted at that time.

The area the sitghing took place in was sparsely populated at the time so there was only 3 sources of light polution in the night sky in line of site of the craft which helped me make a guess at the size of the craft, it was enormous. My house was a few blocks off a main f.m. highway and i45, the fm highway ran east to west and i45 north to south from my position. From the spot i was standing observing the craft i45 was 2 miles east and the closest edge of the craft was close to the end ot the road i lived on which dead ended 2 blocks east of where i was stranding. Between the end of the road and i45 were maybe 20 houses and several acres of woods and pastures. There were a few scattered clouds in the sky and no moon but the light from i45 and the mall could be seen clearly reflecting off near the center of the craft. Id say the craft was less than 1000 feet up and it moved very slowly. There was some traffic on the near highway but over the slight road noise i could hear an audible hum. After making note of the scale of the craft i knew it had to have been something on the order of 4 or more miles long near to far end though i couldnt see the far end, the center of the craft was just slightly above the treeline/horizon with the rest of its outline disappearing below the treeline. The craft had a number of lights on its leading edge and at least 2 on its trailing all of the same hue of red and a constant light no flashing as an aircrafts marker lights would. Against the night sky it was pitch black save where the lights of the highway and the mall reflected off its underside. I would have written it off as a collection of planes flying in formation if it werent for a few things that dont add up. It was clearly a solid object. Jet black against the dark blue of the night sky, stars visible over the light polution disappear! ed as the craft flew between them and me line of sight. It flew too slow to be any regular aircraft save for maybe a blimp but it was far too big to be a blimp of any known make. The thing that convinced me it was a solid single craft was the scattered clouds described earlier. In the 2 hours i watched it passed through 1 of the errant clouds and parted it some going over the top and some underneath. I went inside to get a drink and a sketch pad to draw out what we were seeing and when i got back outside it was gone. It had taken the craft 2 hours or so to move roughly 3 miles but in less than a minute it had gone completely out of sight without making any noise.

The sky was completely clear.  There was very little ambient light in this area. The object was in the southern sky.  It moved covering the area between 40 and 70 degrees vertically from the horizon and a horizontal area of about 30 degrees.  The object did not make any sound that I could here. The object moved at a continuous velocity.  When I say a continuous velocity, I don&apos;t mean on average.  I mean that it&apos;s motion was mechanical in nature.  It&apos;s motion made it obvious that it was an engineered device of some sort.  It was very precise in it&apos;s movement and speed. The object would move in a straight line for a second or two, and then continue at another angle between 90 and 180 degrees of the preceeding path.  It did not stop or even slow down for these changes in direction.  I can&apos;t call the changes in direction turns, because the motion was not at all curved.  The changes in direction were precise corners with no change in velocity.  This motion reminded me of the motion of a spot of light on a vector CRT or that produced by vector controlled laser optics.  By the way the object moved, it looked as if it had somehow been projected onto the clear night sky. The object itself was a point of blueish-white light not much different from any star in the sky that night.  It was dimmer than the brightest visible star but brighter than any moving satalite I&apos;ve seen with my eyes alone. I saw this while relaxing with my grandmother on her patio.  We would often stay out late, listen to the radio and talk.  I was very dissapointed when the object finally vannished low in the sky.  I was unable to get my grandmother to see the light.  I wanted a witness to my claim but went to bed knowing I was the only one to see the object. The next morning my grandmother and grandfather called me into the kitchen.  A small article in the local paper explained that dozens of people in northern West Virginia, including law enforcement, had reported seeing a ufo that zig-zagged across the sky befor disappearing behind the hills.  It seemed I had some witnesses after all. A bit about my background-  This was my first UFO sighting.  I was about 14 years old.  My grandmother was in her 50&apos;s.  Everyone in my family- I mean everyone has or has had a belief and interest in the spiritual/ paranormal.  My interest in such things is probably the strongest out of any of my family aside from my uncle when he was younger. I have had many dreams about future places and events.  Some have already come true in ways that were very obvious to me, others I feel will, in time, unfold. I have a background in electronics, fine arts, and music.  I have composed two feature length musical scores for B-budget films.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Object appeared just below the Big Dipper. Colors were red,yellow,green and blue.

It eventually stopped and was in the shape of a ball with low burning lights pulsing from it.  More objects have begun to appear over the last week.  Last night, my friend and I counted six objects, all with the same colors, red,green,blue and red.  There was one object located on each side of the Big Dipper, both seemed to be on the same parallel.  There were also four obejcts in the western sky.

The witnesses to these events has been myself and two different neighbors.  I tried to photograph one of the objects but it was too far away.  I know this is not something from this world as no sound has ever been heard and they are very distinct in the heavens due to their brilliant collors and pulsing lights.

In that time frame, my mom and other relatives saw craft and lights on differnt ocasions. Also there is a cattle farm right next to where I saw the crafts.

Taichung is in central Taiwan and accessible to the whole island within a 2 hour drive. On this particular day, my boss from the USA and I had visited a factory south of the city and were returning to Taichung in the late afternoon via the north/south freeway.  There is a Taiwan Air Force base near the city (CCK) that was formerly used by the US as a base for flying supplies to Viet Nam, and the freeway passes directly beneath the final part of the landing strip and the ocean approach.  The planes on final cross the freeway perhaps 400-500 feet above the ground at this point.  The landing strip itself has two parallel runways and it&apos;s common for fighter type airplanes to land 2 at the same time. As we approached the flight path area, two F-104G fighters were crossing the flight path directly in front of us preparing to land.  Directly behind one of the F-104&apos;s was and oval shaped object, about the same length as the F-104 (maybe 30 feet long), dull silver in color and perhaps 10-15 feet thick at the thickest part.  It was perhaps 10-15 feet behind the tailpipe of the airplane.  In an instant, the object flew off at a right angle, and as luck would have it, directly in my line of sight.  It just got smaller and smaller and disapeared in an instant into a clear sky with good visibility on the ground.

I&apos;ve had another sighting in the sky over Los Angeles that I&apos;ll write about some other time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting  is approximate.  PD))", "On August 6th of 1996, while driving North on Route 9-W from Fort Lee, NJ to Englewood Cliffs NJ, I observed (what appeared to be) a large jumbo jet at a very low altitude. Having lived in this area all of my life, I know that air traffic into Newark, Kennedy and LaGuardia Airports are some times deverted in a &quot;hold&quot; pattern and then cleared for approach I believe this is called the &quot;Alpine Apporach&quot; but could be wrong...I am not an aviator. This night, I thought this plane / jet was going to crash. Let me start with my condition. I am not, nor have I ever used drugs, drink or take medications....and I am not psychotic or delusional and do not seek money, fame or lie. I have no reason to write this other than to get this off my chest, after all these years. Now that we have that straight.... It was a clear night (no rain), but there was a &quot;ceiling&quot; of clouds above. The lights from New York City / Yonkers and the Bronx (On the other side of the Hudson River) cast a &quot;pinkish tint&quot; of color on to the clouds above. The object I saw, was a &quot;Chevron shape&quot;. It had one big light in the center and several lights on both (what appeared to be) wings running all the way to it&apos;s tips.  I observed this while driving at about 40/45 miles an hour north. It&apos;s direction (from what I noticed) was coming in from the north headed south west. I noticed this because it appeared to be headed at the water tower in the back of what was then the Thomas J. Lipton Company, Scholastic Magazine Company, Lever Brothers and Volkswagon of America buildings. All have now departed and the new CNN World Head Quarters exists at approximately the spot from which I first spotted the craft. As It drew nearer to Clinton Avenue (this road runs east and west) and Route 9W, I pulled my car over and got out to observe this object. To my amazement the ship slowly appeared over the tree line with absolutley NO NOISE.Since this area of New Jersey sits on the Palisades Cliffs, my only guess as to how hight it was, was about 300 to 500 feet above route 9-W not above the Hudson River. Traffic was very light and few cars were headed north at that interval but several cars drove south. They probably couldn&apos;t see this craft or object because as you drive south on 9-W the trees will obstruct any view of an object coming in this direction. The Palisade Interstate Parkway also runs adjacent to 9w with lanes going in a north south direction but I did not take note of this road or how many cars were on it. As this massive, I&apos;ll call it, &quot;Mothership&quot; passed...everything seemed extrodinarily quiet. I made sure to pinch and smell myself just to make sure I was not dreaming.This thing had to be the size of &quot;Giant Stadium&quot;...it was incredible. Thats the only way I can describe its mass. It passed over 9-W....I got home found my binoculars and went back to Clinton Avenue. It had passed. I drove back down Route 9W towards the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey which crosses the Hudson River and brings you on to the Crss Bronx Expresway, Routes I-95, or Manhattan roads such as the Henry Hudson Parkway or the West Side Highway or Harlem River Drive......hoping to see this object. It had flown away quietly!!! Why people crossing the George Washington Bridge from NY did not see this, I can not explain. I went to several Police stations...Englweeod Cliffs, Fort, Lee and Alpine....I was told there had been many calls from local residents during this time frame...so I wasn&apos;t going nuts. Years later, while skimming through a famous &quot;alien&quot; book, it was confirmed in the back by the authors friend, that on that same night, he saw the same object pass over the Long Island Express Way in New York, head in the same direction and coming from the same coordinates that I have just described. It was a great relief to know I had seen, &quot;something&quot; that was not a plane, jet or conventional craft. It could have been a blimp of some sort....but the size was just too outstanding (similar to the &quot;Arizona - &quot;Phenoix lights&quot;) to be a blimp. Here&apos;s my question....if it was military, why would they fly it over a very populated area with the possibility of it malfunctioning, crashing or going down?  But I will tell you it was the color of a dark &quot;battleship-grey&quot; or possibly a charcoal grey and it blended perfectly into the night had it not had the lights on. It also appeared to have srtucture to it&apos;s underside / belly.... something similar to &quot;girders&quot;. As it pass over it was a diamond shape from underneath. NO SOUND, The size of several Jumbo Jets ...I can&apos;t tell you what it was but it was nothing like I had ever seen. Thank you", "silver orb associated with chemtrailsI had stopped the car at a park and got out to watch planes spraying what looked like chemtrails. I had just ran across that subject on the net and waas surprised  the first time I looked up at the sky and saw what I had just been reading about. There was only one other car at the park and I asked the lady in it if she had binoculars or camera, but she didn&apos;t. She got out of the car and as we observed the 3 planes apparently spraying, we noticed a small flash of light right at the junction of 2 trails, where the trails made a large X in the sky. The flash was only momentary and we couldn&apos;t perceive what it was, it seemingly ddisappeared.  We turned our backs on that spot to follow a certain plane as it was preparing to swing back around for another flight over the city.  Then we saw, at our left field of vision, a peculiar object. It seemed to rather glide, and it maitained a consistent altitude, and it came our direction.  I became rather frightened as it approached. It was not too far away, not so high. (I have difficulty estimating distance and altitude, as I&apos;ve never had a reason to do so before) At first I thought that whatever it was, it was the same thing as I&apos;d just seen, ie. that &quot;flash of light&quot;, though it may have been a totally different thing. As it got closer, I  could see that it appeared metallic silver, and it was perfectly spherical.  Also, completely silent.When it reached a point that was more or less in front of us I noticed that it seemed to be exuding a purple or violet haze.  I asked the lady with me if she could see the color, but she couldn&apos;t see it. I know that as an artist I am more sensitive to color that the average, non-artist.  The color was not solid, the substance seemed to be a vapor, a mist, or like a gas.  When it just about had made a complete 180 degree parade across our field of vision, it began to ascend, rather quickly, and straight upwards.This sighting occured on a relatively clear day. I don&apos;t use drugs or alcohol, and don&apos;t take any medicine that would interfer with perception. I can&apos;t speak for the other witness, but I did find out that she was a Christian also, and after this incident we were both frightend and we prayed together before leaving the park. Two days later, over my house, I watched similar planes apparently spraying.  Another silver orb seemed to appear at the X mark of the trails.  This orb I saw through my binoculars and it was at a high altitude. I maintained sight of it for only about a minute. I reported these incidents to the local Air Force Base, and to the local FAA district manager but no one wished to take a report.", "went out side at 11.10 p.m.to get mail.seen objects south/east of siren.object changed colors moved up and down fast .disk shape move up and down then would stay in one spot.different colors bright blue red green.look like had windows around it too.", "Flaring star:  star got brighter 4x that of mars) and then faded gradually to nothing 2 timesI do not know that this was a &apos;craft&apos;.  I saw a bright &apos;star&apos; in while looking south just after sunset.  It looked like venus at its brightest and maybe a little more.  It could not be venus because it was too high up in the sky.  As I watched it grew in brightness and then faded away to nothing.

It had windows, but I couldn&apos;t see how many because one of my trees covered part of it.  It looked like it should fall out of the sky by lack of motion. We viewed it for about 15-20 seconds.

One night when we were out the back, I glanced up at the silhouette of Mt Ngungun and saw a light flash near it&apos;s highest point.  I first assumed it was some campers up there, so didn&apos;t pay much attention.  Then when I next looked, it flashed in a completely different area, this time I could see that it was a fair distance above the treeline.  I pointed it out to my roomies, and we watched as every few seconds it would flash in a different area: sometimes well above the mountain, other times in spots that I knew to be halfway down 50 metre cliffs (I walked and abseiled that mountain quite a few times, so I knew it well enough to pinpoint where the lights were flashing from).  Occasionally the lights changed from white to orange, and once red, and at one stage I thought I saw it split into three, although it was back to one a few seconds later.  Just for reference too, I realised that my initial thought of it being a camper was ridiculous, as the intensity of the light we saw could never have been produced from a torch, camp fire, or even a spotlight.Eventually the &apos;light show&apos; slowed until it was a flash every few minutes instead of every couple of seconds, and in the end it just stopped and we went to bed.", "1945  RED  FLICKERING  V FORMATION  CRAFTS  MOVING  EXTREEML  FAST .While sitting on a wall at the warerfront looking towards Norfolk Va. skyline , i saw several flashes of crimson red crafts flickering in v formation going at a 45 degree angle from an upward possition downward toward the skyline traveling almost as fast as a lightening bolt  .

Still thinking the object looked rather odd they slowed the vehicle and watched, eventfully they pulled the car over to the side of the road and got out to have a better look at this thing. After they all watched it, it did start to move away and extremely fast. They knew that it could not have been a helicopter just due to the speed it was moving at. He said it may have been in the shape of a cube, or rectangular is shape. The witness told me it may have been dark in color, like charcoal. But it was hard to tell for sure. While these men were watching this strange sight, three cars and a van had already pulled off to the side of the highway on the opposite side of the road from them and were all watching the same object.

Unfortunately, our eyes were not adjusted to the dark so we could not see the body of the object, which seemed to be cigar shaped.

The night was very clear, no fog, I do not remember seeing the moon or recall if there was a lot of moonlight. It was a &quot;warm&quot; evening, for I had the sunroof open on my VW Jetta. I had just gone under the Highway 92 overcrossing and was between (2) Vista Points headed towards the &quot;Edgewood Rd&quot; Exit. I recall squinting my eyes for a bright light was shining through my back window. I reached up flipped the mirror to night mode and assumed nothing. The light passed under the over crossing and continued to bare down on my car and the two next to me. I slowed down and moved over to the slow lane, for I thought it was a police officer with his spot light on. We came around a slow curve to the right and the light had closed to within a 1/8th of a mile of traffic. At that point I realized that it was just too high above the road to be a car, but perhaps a tall truck. I couldn&apos;t make out any shape to it, just an intense white light. It continued to close distance and by this point I could tell that it was not connected to the ground for its movement was &quot;smooth&quot; and &quot;frictionless&quot;.

I recall looking at the driver in the car to the left of me and getting a quizical look back from him, I motioned with my shoulders an &quot;I Don&apos;t know&quot; expression... When the light was a couple hundred yards behind us, it was clear it was at approximately 50&apos; off the ground, but I couldn&apos;t not make out any sound over my car and the wind noise from the open sunroof. Once again I made an assumption and figured it was a police helicopter with a spot light, or perhaps a small Cesna. My mom and uncle are private pilots and I have a lot of experience around small aircraft. The white light certainly could have been a landing gear light, but I did not see any blinkin! g colored lights to depict a plane. The light then sped up and passed directly over the my car, and the two other vehicles near me. SILENTLY. I could make out a slight dull figure contained within the orb of light, but cannot faithfully say what shape it was. After passing us the light continued off in front of us for roughly another mile, when it made a HARD angular ascent at roughly a 65 degree angle and sped out of site. Shocked, myself and the guy in the car next to me pulled over to the side of the freeway and talked about the &quot;thing.&quot; Neither of us could explain, or hypothesize what it was. Creeped out by the dark and lack of other cars on the road we left the scene. I exited at Edgewood Rd, and headed to my house on Crestview Dr in San Carlos. I told my Mom about what I saw and retrieved my police scanner. We sat outside on the back deck watching the western sky for hours, too wired to sleep. We heard little on the scanner of reference, but did hear a call for a CHP officer to investigate a bright light seen at a Vista Point, which are supposed to be closed at dusk. I hope this report helps or provides a link to someone else&apos;s experience.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Very large disk shaped structure with lightsOn August 12, 2003 I was driving my semi truck southbound on Hwy 95, about 12 south of Jordan Valley, Oregon.  This part of Oregon is one of the most isolated places in the United States.  There weren&apos;t any lights and the sky was clear, so you could really see the milky way going across the sky. I was the only one on the highway at that time and my partner was in the truck sleeper.  I looked in my rear view mirror and saw another semi truck coming up fast behind me.  I thought he would pass me but when he got up behind me he slowed down really fast and started yelling to me on his CB radio about lights in the sky.  He wanted to know if I had seen the lights in the sky to the left (east).  I told him that I hadn&apos;t seen the lights but that I would keep my eyes open for them.  I could tell that something was wrong because you could hear he was afraid of something in his voice. We traveled down Hwy 95 for about three minutes when he started yelling again about lights to the left of us in the sky.  I looked out my left window and saw two large round lights sitting side by side in the sky.  I could see the outline of the hills and the lights were about 45 degrees up.  They were a yellowish white and not moving at all. At this point I slowed my truck down and watched the lights for about 10 seconds when, all of a sudden, no other way to explain it, like from the movie Close Encounters, below the two top lights the bottom row came on.  The lights started coming on from the left to the right, then started all over again. As one light came on, about the third light back would go off.  There were always three lights going across from left to right.  These lights were the same color as the two top lights but were shaped like beer cans. When the bottom row of lights came on, I yelled at my partner to get up and see this.  The top and bottom row of lights stayed on together about 10-15 seconds, then all the lights went out. There was a turnout on the highway so we pulled both trucks off the road and the three of us got out and for about 40 minutes, the three of us watched the sky but the lights never came back on.  One thing we noticed was was only one cloud in the sky and it was a clack cloud that was in the area of the lights.  There was a strong wind blowing but the cloud never moved. When were were looking at the lights you could tell they were hooked to a structure.  The structure was very large, dead still in the sky.  With your thumb at arm&apos;s length, it would cover about 1/2 of the lights.  I would say it was disk shaped by the way the light looked. I heard the military took pictures of it and was on the news.  I am a retired deputy sheriff and have studied astronomy all my life.  What I/we saw that night was not one of ours. This is the first chance I&apos;ve had to report this to you.", "4 cone shaped lights (pictures of them) in group of 2s plus 2 possible aircraft. in front of clouds over hills. taken from car while site seeing in town. can see parking lot light post that are not on. flash not on. did not notice at time of taking pics just found last week when relooking at pics. thought it might be car headlights reflecting however spacing of lights, shape, and zoom of pics does not show any light reflection of a car as might be expected. would like to know what you think.", "My husband and I were driving eastbound on Interstate 80 between Rocklin and Auburn, California.

It was more or less round in shape and glowing. It was very bright one second yet vanished into total darkness the next. It was fairly large, perhaps about half the size that a full moon appears when seen with the naked eye.

A bright white light almost directly above me and to the east a bit was moving slowly north, northwest.  It was roughly the size, maybe slightly larger, than a full moon, but the moon wasn&apos;t up yet at that time, and this was moving.  Not knowing the actual size of this object, it&apos;s difficult to say how high up it was, but if I had to guess, I&apos;d say  between 500 and 1,000 feet.  (Since I live in the mountains, I&apos;m already at approximately 5,000 feet.) There was no sound or noise of any kind.  I watched it for about  ten seconds, then it suddenly shot straight up into the sky and in less than one second, it was the size of any average star in the sky, then gone.

I had seen a simular type light, about half as bright on 20Nov03 at 6:30 pm local.  The light on 20Nov seemed to vary in brightness with a irregular rhythem before dropping suddenly and &quot;flickering&quot; out from my position in Mesa.  The light I seen on 1Dec03 appeared to be in the same area, but was quite steadily intense and stationary.  A woman I saw walking her dog just before I emptied my garbage, was nowhere to be found whilst I looked for any witnesses to opinion with.I immmediately ran inside my apartment and phoned my wife at her work that a red light was in the sky again.I grabbed a pair of binoculars and ran outside and the red light was gone.  I waited a few minutes to see if it would reappear.  It did not.  Since Mesa sees much air traffic, It would be unpractical to discern chase planes.", "several crafts flying in a V-shaped formation; Guelph, OntarioI was walking through a wooded area near my home - I walk with my dog in this area nearly every evening.  It was between 17:30 and 18:00 hrs., and I had stopped to search the sky for meteorites.  Although I am not even a very amateur astronomer I do enjoy looking at the night sky through my binoculars, and I try to keep track of upcoming celestial events, such as allignments, eclipses and the recent close pass of the planet Mars.  Anyway, on this particular night I was hoping to catch sight of the tail end of the Leonids, as it had been far too overcast on the previous two nights to see anything.  Suddenly, I was aware of a large, V-shaped craft coming from the Southern sky.  I was immediately struck by the fact that, although there appeared to be no lights of any kind on it, I could see the object very clearly.  It seemed to be giving off light but there was no halo or aura visible.  As it came closer, i.e. moved overhead in a direction that was almost due North, I could see how fast it was moving, and that it wasn&apos;t a large craft at all, but rather several smaller, bronze or copper-coloured eliptical-shaped objects flying in a V-formation.  As I watched, and I had an excellent view of it for at least ten seconds, some of the crafts flying on the right hand arm of the V started to change places within the formation, while keeping the V-shape intact and maintaining a constant speed.  I couldn&apos;t believe how fast and maneuverable they appeared to be as they moved around within the V; I have seen many acrobatic air teams perform and no aircraft I have ever seen could move like these did.  These craft seemed to be flying at about the same height of a small plane like a Cessna.  We have a small airfield nearby and we are on the approach path for Pearson International in Toronto, so I am very familiar with the many ways aircraft can appear in the night sky.  I also was struck by the fact that there was absolutely no sound emanating from them as they flew overhead.  I watched the formation as i! t flew overhead and out of sight over the Northern horizon.  However, there seemed to be an unusually large number of aircraft in the area on this night, and the buzz of the small aircraft engines and the whine of the larger jets approaching from the Southwest were making rather a large din and could have drowned out any noise it was making.I probably wouldn&apos;t have reported this sighting except that I saw this exact object in the night sky almost one year ago.  I was in my backyard at the time, again scanning the night sky for constellations, when it flew overhead from the Southwest.", "Bright Globe Circles HouseI woke up on my couch at aproxamitly 1:00 in the morning and I couldn&apos;t breath, and I could not move my body. As I looked up thruogh the window I saw a large globe of light that was aproxmitly 10 feet in diameter, glowing very brighyly. Soon the globe started to circle the house, and then somthing was following the globe. The object following the globe was just a black streak of some sort. After thirty miniutes the globe left and I regained movment and breathing.", "Pair of lights over Lake MichiganI noticed a pair of lights, orange and blue, over Lake Michigan to the east and southeast dimming and brightening alternately.  The lights were in a straight line and seemed to remain stationary for about 4 minutes or so.  I heard no noise and the lights continued to remain in place.  The formation gradually moved very slowly due north, again silent.  The lights continued to dim and brighten alternately.  When the formation moved due east of my position, the lights disappeared and did not reappear.", "Disk shaped craft hovering above house in Stead, NevadaMy mother and I were walking down the street in Stead,a community about eight miles north of Reno Nevada,when we heard a group of kids hollering &quot;Ufo&quot;.

He had been following it across the desert from highway 395.The strange thing was , he was in the military and said he had seen this type of craft before outside a base in Colorado but only at night.Stead is a decommissiond Air Force base.After a few minutes it slowly rose up,again without a sound reached a height of a hundred feet or so then it was gone.", "I was sitting on my couch watching the sky I live on the 4th floor of an appartment building, Sun was going under and sky was exelen clear...

I paid no mind, thinking that it was an Air Force plane, since I live near a base, going for a landing of some sort.  Then after a couple of minutes or so, either it, or one just like it, was moving northward, but it was losing altitude at a gradual pace.  After it disappeared behind some tall, thin trees across the street from my home, I waited for it to come out again, but it didn&apos;t.

He first told me he lives in the next town north of Airdrie, Alberta. Back in the year 2000 he was living in Calgary, Alberta and they had just purchased the home north of Airdrie. The fellow works evenings, so one night when he finished off his shift at work, he asked a good friend if he wanted to take a drive and have a look at his new home he had purchased. He told me it was a beautiful evening and they decided to take the trip to look at the new home. They headed out, both men discussing the distance they would be traveling from Calgary to the new home. The driver thought they would be traveling some 40 kilometers, but his friend thought it would be a little further then that. The driver hit the button on the odometer which set it at zero kilometers. This way they would know just how far they were about to travel one way. The two men arrived safely at their destination and had a look around and took some time talking etc... It was starting to get later into the evening so they thought it best to get back on the road heading towards home. The passenger in the vehicle mentioned to the driver that he had in-laws living in Airdrie and would it be ok if they swung by to show the driver their home. As they drove along the highway outside of Airdrie the driver noticed some very bright lights coming up from behind them. The lights were very bright, has the passenger had turned around to look he commented on the brightness and how fast the lights were approaching them. Both men thinking this was a vehicle never gave it a lot of thought, other than these lights which were almost blinding to the driver. Now here is where the story takes a strange twist. All of a sudden the fellows came upon a large sign, it read &quot;Country Hill Boulevard&quot; which is the first exit to Calgary. What is puzzling is that from when the strange lights came up from behind them and to the sign which read &quot;Country Hill Boulevard&quot;, there is a possibility that some time has gone missing. Both men do not recall driving through Airdrie at all. The driver took a look at the odometer and he noticed they may be missing 20 kilometers. As he mentioned to me, he never gave any of this much thought, but did find it rather strange. The driver also said he has driven this stretch of highway many times and nothing like this has ever taken place. I asked the man if he or his friend had ever had any vivid dreams and he said no. As far as he knows nothing out of the ordinary has happened to him other than this one strange event. The driver did mention that his friend did lose a little sleep over the experience.

I was working in the oil fields at the time and we had shut down the ditching machine for the night. Now as you know after operating a machine like this all day, when it is shut down,the stillness you can cut with a knife. We were in an area that was clear of any objects, only low willows and rolling hills. The evening sky was clear as a bell, not a cloud to be seen, a typical fall evening. The time was about 17.00 hours, the month was late sept or early oct. I cannot be sure. there was no oil rigs working in the area that we were at nor was there any flare pits burning anywhere near us. As we started back down the right of way that we had cut through,to get back to the half ton truck to go back to camp, this is what we saw. We were walking east and out of the north and going south came these 2 objects, they were cylinder in shape with one just above and ahead of the other. they both glowed like the red ember of coal but the out line of the cylinder was sharp,not fuzzy. they did not appear to be that high, not traveling all that fast. we both had a good look at them as they went by. It scared the Hell out of me as well as the chap I was working with. Oh before forget they did not make a sound. As I look at him and he look me this is what he said, When we get back to camp don&apos;t you open your mouth to anyone as to what we had just seen, and I did not talk to anyone for years about this as in those days they would have thought you were nuts.

The first time was on December 17, 2002 at 9:00-9:30pm, for about 1 minute while returning from a trip to central Arkansas to my home in Jonesboro, AR.  The 2nd observation was on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2002, again between 9:00 and 9:30 pm with another witness from my parent&apos;s backyard in Jonesboro.  I have been thinking about making this report for a long time but, after reading many reports in this database, I had not read any descibing a similar object until this week. Several days ago I read a report of a sighting on 9/25/03 with a similar object described.  Not only that but the sighting was in the same location as my first sighting and at the same time of night. My first sighting on December 17, 2002 occured as follows:  I was driving north on Hwy. 67 and at about 1 mile southeast of Newport, AR I exited 67 on an offramp to the right and stopped at a stop sign before making a right turn on to hwy 14.  While stopped at the stop sign I looked ahead and slightly up and saw the object about 30 degrees above the horizon and approximately 1 mile away from me.  I am a former private pilot and I would judge the object to have been 300-500 feet above the ground.  The object was moving east to west at a speed so slow my guess is it was about 30 mph or less.  Although I describe it as an object what I actually saw was about 7 or 8 lights.  I had the impression that the lights were attached to an object and may have outlined the shape of it.  I do not recall how many lights there were even after seeing it a second time several weeks later.  The lights were a dim red and steady, not flashing, and the placement of them would outline a football or egg shape.  The outline of the lights was as large as my hand held at arms length.  I do not remember the weather that day or night but the object was well below any cloud ceiling  there would have been.  I watched the object move slowly west for about 1 minute or less (I couldn&apos;t hear any sound), made a right turn and continued home on Hwy 14 heading east. The second sighting of this same (or a similar) object was on Chistmas Eve, December 24, 2002 from my parent&apos;s backyard, again at about 9:30pm in Jonesboro, AR.  Again it was to the north of us (another witness was with me) and again it was slowly traveling east to west.  It was slightly further away from me this time and, as a consequence, the red lights were a little dimmer.  I have no doubt that this was the same type of object I had seen two weeks earlier. I", "4 object in daylightI walked out of a store on Randall road in Batavia, IL.  I saw 3 objets flying in a circle.  My first reaction was to think they were birds.  I quickly realized that was not the case.  They were much too high to be birds and at that altitude, birds could not be seen.  They were moving in a counter-clockwise rotation in a circle and silver in color.  Their path was not perfect or even eliptical.  They moved in an erratic motion going closer and farther from the center of the circle.  One moved away from the rest to the West and then disappeared.  The second one did the same.  The third one moved in the same direction, but went much slower and slowly faded out.  About 30 second later another object appeared to be the size of the first 3 put together.  It was silver at the top and went to bronze at the bottom.  It stayed stationary for 30 seconds and then went straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared.

After a minute or two I saw a dim white light shinning towards us (or at least visible to us) coming from a ridge about 150-200 yards away, and probably 200 feet higher in elevation than where our car (a 1968 Chrysler 300 2 door) was parked. This light slowly started moving from the east to the south on somewhat of a semi-circular path. All 4 of us were discusing, as this was happening, how there were no road&apos;s or path&apos;s in the area that this light (if it were a person w/flashlight, or motor vehicle)could of been traversing. It(the light) seemed to be demanding all of our attention, and we were all (as I learned later) experiencing a sense of &quot;fear&quot; about this thing. We were in a place which we knew extremely well, with regard to the terain, and the proximity of this moving light, and there was no explination we could contrive in our mind&apos;s, either individually or collectively, that could explain it&apos;s movement. The &quot;light&quot; continued on it&apos;s path moving from where it started (in full view of the passenger side of our car) to a point south, almost directly behind our car (about 200-300 yard&apos;s) Everyone in the car had to turn totally around and now view this thing out of the large rear window of the car. The light started to fade out and disappeared all together for about 10 seconds. When it reappeared it was much closer to our position than it had been before. It started to fade again, then went out all together (aga! in) After a few seconds it reappeared and it was much closer to the car (again) and probably only 50 yards away. It started to fade again, and I yelled at the driver to start the car and get the *$%#&amp; out of there NOW! I just knew that when it reappeared again, it&apos;d be right on top of us! We shot down the very steep gravel road at probably 50 m.p.h., and had to stop at the bottom to make a turn and go back to &quot;Downtown&quot; Gresham. We did go back and told a couple other people we knew about what happened, and they wanted to go back up there right away! Two of the people on the first trip had to go home, but My next door neighbor (who was there with me the first time....about 30 minutes earlier now), and myself, rode back up with &quot;Duane &amp; Jim&quot; in Duanes 1963 corvair. On the way up to the hill we told them in detail what we saw, and instead of questioning us or expressing any doubt, they seemed to be uncharacteristically quiet &amp; apprehensive. When we got near to the base of the gravel road, after about a 10 minute ride, there were Two police car&apos;s parked face to face in the middle of the little country road that intersected with the road that went up the hill.They were about 50 feet from where we had to turn. The strangest thing happened. both of their dome lights were on, as were the red flashing lights on top of their car&apos;s (no blue lights back then!) The policemen, one in each car, were simply staring straight ahead, &amp; not even moving, or looking at our car which literely had to slow to about one mile per hour, and pass within 3-4 inches of their car&apos;s to avoid going off in the ditch on our side! Why didnt the police move? Why didnt they even look at us? Sitting in the corvair, passing them, we were only 4-5 feet from where they sat in their own car&apos;s! We could see their expressions! Nothing!! We turned and went back up the hill &amp; talked for maybe a half hour about what the police could of been doing and exactly where we had seen the lights earlier that night. Everything seemed &quot;normal&quot; there, and maybe du! e to the fact that &quot;Duane &amp; Jim&quot; hadnt been there earlier, they were starting to joke around &amp; talk about other thing&apos;s. After another 10-15 minutes, I got what I can only describe as a terrible feeling of &quot;being watched&quot; Things were immediately different, because before I said a word Duane (the driver) said &quot;let&apos;s go&quot;, and &quot;Larry&quot; (my neighbor) who was there before, looked at me with a &quot;really bad look&quot; in his eyes. I remember saying out loud &quot;Wait&quot; &quot;It is back&quot;. After only a few seconds a large bluish white &quot;orb&quot; with an orangish colored &quot;fog&quot; around it flew from down the hill closer to where the police car&apos;s were, to directly above the corvair! I remember in detail looking at it above the car (maybe 25-50 ft.) with my head out the passenger window! We all saw it! After what seemed like only a couple seconds it was just gone! I dont know where or what direction it went, it was just out of there. We went down the hill, found that the police cars had left, and drove back into downtown Gresham. It was very strange how none of us were scared, we just seemed to accept what we saw, and decided that we had a special experience of some sort, and wouldnt mention it to the police or newspapers etc. Not even to other people we knew. The experience seemed like it affected us all on some sort of energy level. I guess I have had many thoughts, since that time that MUCH MORE than a couple seconds were spent underneath that thing, but have never persued any sort of hypnosis or regression therapy to try &amp; find out what really occured. I just &quot;know&quot; in my mind (as do the others that were there) that much more happened that night than we are able to report. Maybe someday I will remember those missing part&apos;s! These thing&apos;s are very real!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I thought that one of my friends was playing a trick but when I came close to the tree i noticed that about 100 feet up was an akwardly shaped object. I called my friend over and when we saw it he could not believe it, the object was star shaped with extra corner sticking out in random spots.

As it passed to the west of our position it had a triangle shape with the lights the tips of the corners and a red light toward the aft of the craft. As it was flying away from our position It had Three lights across the rear. It did not have red or green anticollision lights or any kind of flashing or blinking lights on It. I could not her any sound and It was the size of a 747 or C5 cargo plane. The area I was in is in one of the main final approach corridors of Deroit Metro airport and I am used to seeing a varity of aircraft at night. From Northwest Airlink Canidairs cr4 and bae 146&apos;s to md-80&apos;s and 747-475&apos;s and this craf did not resemble any of them. The closest planes this craft would resemble is the F-117 and B-2 Stealth bombers and their landing lights are only visable when the landing gear are extended. It could have been a plane that but I have yet to see one that looks like this one did", "A seemingly close object with a rectangular pattern of lights moved silentlyWhen I was in the 6th grade, my friend and I were out trick or treating when we stopped by his grandparents&apos; house. We were standing outside the house when my friend jokingly flashed his flashlight into the sky a few times. We got really spooked when right after that a strange object passed silently right in our line of sight across the night sky. I didn&apos;t see any actual detail of the craft, but it had 8 lights arranged in a rectangular fashion. It seemed to be quite close to us. That is, we were standing on the steps in front of the house and looking across the street where the object was at an angle that put it just above the trees. It appeared to be roughly the size of a helicopter at a distance of a couple hundred yards. The strange part, though, is that it made no sound at all. I live near an air force base and in the path of coast guard patrols, so I&apos;m used to hearing passing aircraft. At the distance my mind was assuming the object had to be at (that is, a couple hundred yards), a helicopter would have been really loud. The night was completely silent, too, as the unidentified object silently glided across the sky. It moved in a straight line at a speed comparable to the coast guard helicopters patrolling over my house, which I assume is something like 40-50 MPH or so. One other possibility is that instead of what I saw being a single, close aircraft, it could have been a more distant formation of aircraft (since I didn&apos;t see any detail of the &quot;craft&quot; besides its lights), which could also explain the lack of sound. The problem with this is that each light was a single, distinct point. Even at long distances a normal civilian or military plane has multiple lights that are easily discernable.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "4 lights  square 1 red dot  traveling anti-clockwiseit was 4 lights in a square formation with a red dot anti-clockwise around it", "For the last two weeks,I have seen a light in the sky that appears to be landing lights on a aircraft,but the lights turn off and there is no bacon lights or no trace of anything in the western sky!!Been in aviation for 25 years and cannot explain what I am seeing!!!", "Blue/green teardrop over woburnAround 6:12 am I got out of my car to deliver a paper (I&apos;m a paper boy). The skyline on Old Farm Rd, is huge. You can see planes taking off from Logan airport, traffic helicopter&apos;s, everything. Now I was about a mile out from route 93 (where the helicopter&apos;s hover near boston, and about 12 miles outside of Boston itself). At that point I noticed a blue/green object stopped behind the treeline in the far distance. I thought nothing of it really (though why I don&apos;t know cause the thing was blue/green) cause I just figured it was a plane taking off facing me. When I came back I looked up and saw two commercial airplanes in the air to the south and strangely enough, a jet leaving a smoke trail directly overhead. Then I noticed the blue green object had started to move in a direction it couldn&apos;t possibly have moved. It was huge, looked to be a weird top heavy shape with a round, thinner, bottome. It was flashing white and red lights. Immediately I started comparing it. It was moving incredibly fast (passing my line of vision over the horizon every 5- 10 seconds). I started to doubt it was a plane (no plane would ever fly that low) and by now was pretty freaked out because I realized I was the only one seeing this and even contemplated knocking on someone&apos;s door to get a confirmation. This thing was viewable from where I was for about 5 minutes (the view on old farm road is massive), and then it fell out of the viewable horizon.  I thought it could have been a helicopter, but I don&apos;t think helicopter&apos;s are A) completely silent, and B) Glowing blue/green. Interesting note the miltary jet that was high above my head seemed to be on an arching rise and when I saw it the smoke trail was descending. I think it might have been following it.", "dull orange group of craft maneuvering and rotating arround each other in the sky over renoI was stopped at a traffic light.  My freind was telling a story of no real interest to me.  I looked up and saw what looked to me like a plane moving above without its lights on, just visible from what I thought was the reflected lights of reno on the bottom of it. It had the same color of the bottom of a cloud that has city lights reflecting on it. There were a few points of this dull orange glow that I thought were the wings and fuselage and other parts of a plane, in that they were moving along together.  It was not bright and nothing especially wierd about it.  I had time to think &quot; Why is that plane flying without its lights on&quot;  I think I said that interupting my friend, but as he continued his story, the individual points of dull orange split apart and seemed to orbit each other, swirling in a sort of pulsating sphere and then shoot of in all different directions.  I imediately had a wierd felling because the motion was so synchronized and so amazing I felt like it was obviously a product of some superior intelligence.  My friend thought I was joking.  The light had changed but there was no one behind me so I stopped for a minute and looked to see if maybe something was reflecting on my wind shield (with so many lights in reno) but I didn&apos;t see anything and the objects were completely gone. There was no contact of any kind with little green men so I&apos;ve just kind of told this story to people that were interested in this sort of thing but I can&apos;t describe accurately to people why the movements seemed so incredible to me.  The integrated maneuvers these things pulled off in a span of a few seconds were obviousely not done by some kind of normal aircraft.  Since that time I have heard so many different accounts of these formations of objects that I figured it happens fairly often but I would like to see if anyone else had seen something arround that same period in that area ( I dont remember the exact date)", "Bright object seemed to move at an amazing speed toward the area I was standing and paused for a moment, then flew away.I&apos;m a little uncomfortable writing this.  I like the idea of aliens and all that, but I tend to be skeptical about the whole thing.  I got out of my car and headed toward my apartment door.  I was looking at the sky, a habit of mine, looking at stars and looking for comets.  At first I noticed nothing at all, then I must&apos;ve blinked or looked away for a moment, but all of a sudden a star seemed to be particularly bright--and large.  If all the stars around it looked like periods on a paper, this one looked like the lower-case letter &quot;o&quot; beside a regular period. (o.)  I didn&apos;t know what in the world it was, but then it began to get very large, as if coming closer to me.  It got to the size that I don&apos;t think I could&apos;ve blotted it out with a nickel if I held it out at arms length.  I don&apos;t know how to describe the appearance other than a ball of light.  I didn&apos;t notice anything that seemed at all metallic or fire-like.  Just a big ball of extremely bright light, I can&apos;t emphasize how bright this was.  It was at this large size for only about two seconds it seemed, and I pushed the door open to call for my wife to come see.  Right as I pushed the door, it began to get a little smaller--and then the speed at which the size decreased became incredibly fast.  At last I found myself looking at a small dot, and eventually it vanished.  There was no sound at all that I could hear coming from it.  It did seem as if, if possible, the ojbect&apos;s &quot;brightness&quot; pulsed once it paused after moving toward my area.  That is, once it flew toward me and paused, there were two very quick pulses of extra brightness and then it flew away.  The thing is, it was so bright before the two short pulses, it&apos;s hard to imagine that it could&apos;ve gotten any brighter. I have no idea what this was.  It could&apos;ve been some rare terrestrial phenomena, I don&apos;t know.  The only thing I can say is that it was not a plane, jet, helicopter, or balloon.  It wasn&apos;t something that we see flying around in the sky.  I don&apos;t know what the thing was.  I&apos;d like to know if anyone else around here saw it.  Maybe the light of a burst star reached our planet, whatever it was I&apos;m dying to know.  Speculating is only driving me crazy. Area of occurance: I live in a small apartment complexe.  As far as I know, I was the only person standing outside.  However, there must&apos;ve been people all around this area who saw it.  Surely I wasn&apos;t the only one standing outside looking at the sky.  There&apos;s a busy road not far from where I live, all one would have to have done to see it from a moving car going east is to look out the right side of the car.  Someone else must&apos;ve seen this thing.", "Colored lights arranged in two parellel chains, vertically oriented.Two parallel rows of lights. Colors blue, green, red and white.  Oriented almost vertical.  They were stationary when first observed to the southwest of my home in the country.  They appreared to be at approximately 5,000 feet above ground level.  About one minute after I saw them, they began to move in an easterly direction at about the speed of a Cessna 172 aircraft at cruise.  As they passed to the south of my home and were obstructed by the house, we could hear no sound. We went to the back yard, but could no longer see the object.  After about five minutes, we looked again and saw it at a much higher altitude, in about the same area were we could see Mars during it&apos;s close passage to the earth a few weeks ago.  It remained almost stationary then for 30 to 40 minutes.  We observed it through a telescope.  We could never see a shape, only the lights which blinked or rotated in a non rhythmatic manner", "boomerang shaped, football field size, gliding silently, reflecting stars above it to the underside of itIt was the evening of the full moon and total lunar eclipse, the night sky was totally clear and we had an unobstructed view of the eclipse.  What first caught my eye was it looked like the stars were moving and as I looked closer, it appeared as a boomerang shaped flying object, possibly the size of a football field.  It seemed like it was like a chamelion and taking on the stars patterns overhead, but we could definitely make out a shape.  It was totally silent, just gliding overhead.  It was headed toward the full moon.  When it got probably a couple of miles away from us it stopped and appeared to flip on its side and one end of the &quot;boomerang&quot; folded in on itself and it stayed there the entire time during the eclipse.  The three of us who witnessed it, 2 are registered nurses and 1 is a computer programer. All of us are older, 42, 45, and 55, and we had not been drinking or partaking drugs. We were just out to watch the lunar eclipse.", "((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the eight photos forwarded by the witness, and we do not know what the object is.  However, it may be a star or planet.  It is simply a round, indistinct light, photographed against a featureless sky.  Orbiting objects do not remain motionless in the night sky.  PD))Orange Ball Joined By Second That Formed a Debris Field - FilmedOrange ball object slightly to my North North East. Two to three times bigger than Mars the last few weeks. Sun was just about to set, but was still daylight. That&apos;s what caught my attention, seemed to early for such a bright star. A plane flew in the general vicinity and the red lights were not the orange of the circle of light.... sooo.... I went inside and got my hi 8 camera and came out and filmed. Seemed like it had moved south since I had I eye balled it last ..... continued filming while standing. Decided with the zooming I was doing I needed to lay down on the deck and film from a more stable position. Did that and filmed close ups. No details, just a orange ball of light, but not a star. Then ........... then I noticed some other white balls of light near by, there was a large cluster of em! ....and they were &apos;drifting&apos; to the north and spreading out. Must have been more than a dozen. Dispersing with out any trails of anykind, just like watching the ufo footage over Washington DC in the fifty&apos;s!! As the sun set they all got dimmer until they were gone. Had to be very very high altitude, and I suspect in orbit, as the several minutes I filmed them they didn&apos;t not travel far. The low angle of the sun lit up what ever was in orbit. After reviewing the tape a few times, I have reached several conclusions. I don&apos;t know what the orange colored circular object is, but I suspect it was in orbit and reflecting the sun. It has to be huge, much larger than the ISS. Something broke apart in orbit and followed a path away from the orange colored circular object, but no noticeable change in appearance to the object. The &apos;debris&apos; field and path looks more like the shuttle break up footage than the &apos;Washington Fifty&apos;s Ufo&apos;s&quot; The reason it looked like that to me was the poor detail of the eyepiece I was viewing through in real time while filming. The difference in this footage to the shuttle break up is that there is no fire, no smoke, no contrails, no paths of any kind. Seeing the debris field expand, it can be noticed that some of the &apos;objects&apos; are tumbling and reflecting light differently as they travel. Two or three brighter bigger objects don&apos;t seem to be tumbling so much.  There are dozens of &apos;piece&apos;s. The brightness of all the objects decreases with the setting sun, with the larger orange colored circular object being seen first and last. The path of the debris field is in a Northerly direction, which is damn peculiar for a geo sync object...... if the two events are related that is.Due to the high strangeness of each, I suspect they are. Filmed in regular eye light spectrum and infra red &quot;SonyNightShot&quot; mode. Images of the mystery objects were much brighter in the night shot mode ..... Orange ball was visible to the naked eye. Once you know there was a debris field from the camera shot, it was noticeable as a &apos;smudge&apos; to the naked eye. In the last few days my thinking is that what I may have filmed is an asteroid coming right at us so the field of motion was considerably reduced.With the high rate of meteorites streaking across the sky world wide of late, and the closest pass of an asteroid ever just last month, I am wondering if this is a continuation of that activity. IF this is the case, then I may have come close to filming dooms day....especially from the debris fields visible in this footage. Have emailed 101203.zip that contains several high resolution frame captures from the film.((name deleted))", "doesnt stop moving, stays in the sky hoovering then spinning around many colorscolorful sphereshaped light moving through  the sky then hoovering", "Very large V shape with lights, haze, silent,moving east extremely fast.I first saw a very large and long lasting Meteor or shooting star or something that caught my attention and I was still looking at the sky wondering if their was a meteor shower happening.  Then I saw what at first I thought was some kind of &quot;reflection&quot; I thought it was a flock of birds flying and some kind of light was reflecting on to them making them visible to me  in the night. But I soon realized it was not birds, it was many glowing objects in the shape of a V.  They were bluish-white and each one was about as bright as a &quot;dim&quot; star.  The V was made up of about 5 of these glowing objects down each side of the V.  There was some kind of blur or mist around each light also.  I could not determine if they were all fixed to one large object or if they were all seperate objects.  They were all staying perfectly alligned as if they were connected.

It was on a clear hot august evening and I&apos;m almost sure it was a Wednesday night. I was watching TV and my mom was sitting on the front porch trying to cool off. Before my mom even said anything I could see a bright light coming over spring hill. At first I thought it was a very low airplane since we live right in the flight path of Spokane Int. Airport and Fairchild AFB., and planes flew over all day and night. Then my mom yelled at us to come see this UFO. My brother and I and my cousin from Montana all went out to see this and it was round, rotating counter clockwise and didn&apos;t make any noise. It didn&apos;t seem very high up, maybe 150 feet.It was about 50 feet in wide by about 12 feet deep. There were square lights all the way around it, maybe 2 feet by 2 feet. The strangest thing was it was totaly silent. As it rotated there was a dark spot where it seemed like a light was out. A neihbor who saw it with binoculars said the lights were windows and he could see white walls inside. It was going from the N/E towards the S/W. But not very fast. A week later and every week therafter for several weeks an advertising airplane was seen over Spokane in crowded places like the Spokane interstate fair and Playfair race track and looked just like the disc shaped craft from a distance but you could hear it from several miles away, an obvious cover up. Everyone in Spokane who heard the stories of people in North Spokane who saw the original silent flying disc were effectivly convinced we saw the advertising airplane.I have lived in Spokane all my life and have seen two other UFO sightings in the 1990&apos;s which I will try and provide information on at a later date.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Low, slow, nealy silent delta wing &apos;airliner.&apos;Location:  Suburban Philadelphia, PA USA  Environment:  Mostly clear sky, after sundown, light breeze  Witnesses:  (2) Male - 25, Male - 55  Aircraft:  One triangular/delta wing shaped object of airliner size at an altitude of not greater than 800 ft (more likely below 500 ft) making very little noise and traveling very slowly (150MPH estimated). -Shape- Triangular in shape, although not a &apos;triangle.&apos;  The outline was distinctly a delta wing configuration and there was a clearly visible fuselage.  The best example of the shape is the old F16 Delta Wing concept.  No rear mounted horizontal stabilizers and a clean, straight trailing edge to the main wing.  No forward mounted horizontal stabilizers were visible either.  Two vertical stabilizers were visible, ruling out many possible aircraft types that fit the &apos;basic&apos; shape (B2, etc).  The total wingspan of the &apos;delta wing&apos; was longer than the totall length of the aircraft. -Lighting- Very familiar lighting pattern.  Red, white, and blue lights on the wing, nose, wing, respectively, as one would see on a normal airliner, but the lights were in the wrong places.  The wing tip lights were &apos;too far back&apos; to denote a typical airliner.  No other visible running lights.  No strobe effect or color changes. -Size- Large.  737 size at least. -Position- Altitude between 500 ft and 800 ft AGL.  Traveling from ENE to WSW. -Speed- Very, very slow.  Best guess is between 150-200MPH - if that. -Sound- Astonishingly quiet.  The exhaust note was more similar to a constant gust of wind than a jet engine. Description of Event:  Standing outside home talking.  During the converasation, the lights of an &apos;airliner&apos; were visible approaching from over the roof of the house across the street.  Initially, the size, speed and altitude through me off.  The aircraft traveled in our direction, although very slowly.  As it came nearer, its outline was visible against the stars and moonlight.  The aircraft resembled a typical airliner in lighting patterns only - and only at a distance.  It was apparent when the aircraft flew overhead that the lights were in the wrong positions as the wingtip running lights were at the trailing edge of the aircraft - too far back.  The delta wing shape became visible at roughly the same time, which sparked my interest as I moved a few feet down the driveway to keep the aircraft in view longer. Other obervations made during this time (~30 seconds from initial view to passing over house) were the flight charectaristics.  The altitude of the aircraft was very abnormal for my area.  Philadelphia Int&apos;l airport does not have traffic patterns over my area and even if they did, an approaching aircraft would still be well above 10,000 feet as the airport is a good 45 miles away.  The local NAS operates mostly C130&apos;s, A10&apos;s, and the occassional F18.  The altitude of the aircraft was almost enough to make me duck - it appeared that the aircraft would be landing no more than 1000 yards away based on this as well as the speed.  The speed again reinforced the idea that the aircraft was landing somewhere very close by.  At rougly 150 odd MPH, you would expect an airliner size aircraft to be seconds away from touchdown, full flaps, etc.  Except this aircraft kept on going straight and level until it disappeared from view over treetops 500 yards away. The sound was the last abnormal charectaristic of the aircraft - there really wasnt any.  The aircraft engines sounded more like a sustained gust of wind than a jet or prop engine.  At that alitude, one would expect even a civilian airliner to drown out the conversation, let alone a military aircraft, but the aircraft was so quiet that we were able to speak to eachother while observing it. Reason for reporting: Was advised to do so.  There is no single aspect that stands out about this aircraft - but the sum of all the aspects made this an interesting experience.  The combination of &apos;way&apos; too low, &apos;way&apos; too slow, &apos;way&apos; too quiet, and shaped like the old British Avro Vulcan were enough for me to question what, exactly, the aircraft was because I know of no civilian or military aircraft that exibits this combination of charectaristics.", "cigar shaped  metalic object with faint lights on outlinethe ofject hovered a bove the tree line and then sped up to a lake before the parking lot of the areal tram of frankonia state park .. it then hovered above the road when i drove under it it was maybe 20ft above my car.. it then proceeded to  rise above the rock cliff in a very fast way... nothing on earth can jump over a rise like that..I then drove to the flume where i stopped because i was very tired and couldnt stay awake.

After a few seconds the feeling subsided. About eight minutes later the feeling came back but stronger. It was strong enough to make me gasp out loud. I felt like it was watching me.

Although there was a noteable diffusion of light across my field of vision due to nearby city streetlamps, the view of the night sky was such that countless stars could still be clearly identified. To my surprise, however, the field of motionless stars I expected to see was instead replaced by a field of &apos;moving&apos; stars, meandering slowly about in a fashion much like tadpoles in a small pond. These objects replaced the stars, they did not obscure them. That is to say, I could not observe anything at all in my field of vision of the sky except the objects. There must have been 30 or more in that particular area of the sky. They had the same shape, size, color and brightness as the stars I fully expected to see. They did not exhibit any visible trails or emit any audible sound. I pointed out the phenomenon to my landlady and she observed them as well as I. We had the luxery of being able to watch the event for as long as we pleased: the objects were still moving when we retired inside for the night which was about an hour later. The next evening was almost identical in terms of viewing conditions. As I sat next to my landlady in the same location as the night before and roughly about the same time, we both observed a repeat performance of the event. A short while later, two friends came by to visit and observed the phenomenon with us. It scared me very much and I can only imagine the reaction of the witnesses with me, although they did not appear to be outwardly that concerned. To this day I cannot explain the event to my satisfaction. For those were the nights the stars themselves came out to dance!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I drove down the street, west on West Little York toward Hwy 290, and I saw two young men taking photos of the lights. The light on the left was 2-3 times the size of the one on the right, and they were both pulsating periodically.

Last night I was in my upstairs kitchen making bread in preperation for Thanksgiving. I had the TV on and there was general noise in the background. It occured to me that I was hearing what sounded like a helicopter very close by outside. This in itself is not unusual as we are on the flight path for the trauma rescue helicopter (which I fly on occasionally). Since the noise was not fading into the distance as it usually does when the copters fly over, I went out to see what the deal was. I thought maybe Life Flight had landed closeby for a &quot;hot&quot; load (load in the patient without shutting the blades down). I looked up and there hovering in my front yard not far off the treetops is this absolutely massive cigar shaped white or light colored &quot;helicopter&quot;. It was hovering in an area close to my pond. We live on 16 manicured acres and this thing was clearly visible in the treeless part of my front yard (this area is roughly 4 acres in size). Not sure what the heck it was doing. Just hovering at an absolute standstill. The thing did not move even one inch in any direction. The sound it made was like a weird sounding helicopter. More like a loud whirring or something. The lights in my house and landscaping flickered and my dogs were freaking out. Occasionally, this thing seemed to make almost no noise at all. It sat there for what I thought was about 10 minutes. Later noticed it was actually more like 40 minutes. This would make sense though because the bread dough I was working with was nearly completely done rising (second rising takes about 40 to 50 minutes). I called my neighbor to see if she was seeing the same thing and she said she did and also wondered what the heck it was doing there. I&apos;m not psychotic. I&apos;m a nurse with a very responsible job and I do not drink, smoke or take drugs, prescription or otherwise. The only mind altering thing I do is meditate...alot. Called the police, but they said they had no other reports of helicopters low flying in the area. They said they&apos;d send over a patrolman to check it out, but I never saw any sign of him. The thing eventually moved off towards the direction of the neighbors house. It moved incredibly slowly. I could have walked way faster than it was moving. I noticed that there seemed to be no downdraft from the rotor blades.In fact I do not recall ever even SEEING any rotor blades. When it went over the neighbors backyard, it turned east and moved off over my woods and eventually out of sight. One other thing I noticed is that when it hovered over my front yard, there was one round light coming from the bottom in the center. It didn&apos;t seem to be a spotlight or anything because the grass beneath it was not illuminated. As it moved off over the woods, it had 3 lights. One on each end and the same center one. One of them was green, and the other two white. I went back out to the area this morning and noticed nothing out of order. I had intense dreaming last night, but not what I would call unusually unusual. I have no idea what this thing was. Maybe just a new type of helicopter I have not seen yet or maybe something else. Not quite prepared yet to assume it was a UFO. The military is always coming up with new designs for things. I don&apos;t live near any military base. I think the closest one is Wright Patterson (?) AFB to the south of me by several hours. This object was clearly hovering in MY yard though. Not like the pilot was just taking a break or something. It was clearly and obviously hanging over my yard not far from my pond. Maybe the pilot was looking at the fish in there??????  Well, this is in a nutshell what happened to me last night. There may be a prefectly reasonable explanation for it. Not sure. I&apos;m not an expert in military flying craft. So many odd things happen to me all the time (you have no idea...) that I can&apos;t immediately rule out something remarkable.", "3 hovering objects making quick compensating waterbug-like movements to hold their position.

The seem to be out every weekday, but not always on the weekends.  The first time we noticed them was when we saw one ascend to it&apos;s hovering position from the North to high overhead.  The object climbed in inchworm like motion, but in quick jerky segments until it reached its hovering position.  I know we have a private contractor developing an unmanned helicopter for the military which can fly at altitudes of 35,000 feet or more.  One of them had a hard landing near the Southern California Logistics airport (where the contractor is based) during the summer.  The Daily Press newspaper covered it but was not allowed to take pictures and they keep people from seeing it up close. We are also not far from Edwards AFB, so I&apos;m thinking they are testing some kind of &quot;Star Wars&quot; defense system.  I&apos;ve actually looked at the objects with a telescope and they appear to shaped as flat slightly oblong disks shapes.  We have also observed flashed of light and objects &quot;shot&quot; from them (for tracking purposes, perhaps).

This has been on going since at least Jan 03. Some of these orbital objects fly over, becoming an extremely bright (mag -2 to -4) bluish-white color for about 10-20 sec. They are  seen 1/2 to 2 hours after sunset.There is a pattern in that they&quot; light up&quot; in the same latitude (34 deg +/- 1deg), which is the same line that approximately connects Los Angeles and Phoenix. The longitude is ( 117 deg +/- 1deg ), coincidently is the same as Spokane where very similar ongoing phoenomena is observed. Interestingly, Yermo, CA,  where a recent landing was reported (Oct 03), falls on that same line.About half of these objects pass over,usually off white or yellow, brighten up at a certain point for 10-20 seconds then  go back to normal and continue on. The other half brighten up and simply terminate or end in a &quot;spiral reentry&quot;of some sort. Ninety percent of this type of object eminate from the south and are on a northerly path. A few fly N-S or W-E. Even fewer go E-W. They are up around 250 miles. (height determined from crude angular measurement then calculated. This method checks well with the ISS). The S-N objects are the most &quot;colorful&quot;, N-S and E-W usually just pass on by. A third of the W-E will display an event.As many as 4 objects have been observed flying in a parallel formation with no other events seen. Formation flying is at about 350 miles high and tend to go the southeast.Other on going observations include stationary strobing lights (1to 4 strobes). Some of the single strobe lights will cast a shadow. Also seen are &quot;plasma balls&quot; that stair-step down similar to those seen in Deming NM (11/5/02). Some satellites/objects display anomalies in their trails , some almost like morse code pattern.Others display small short bursts of light embedded the trail.On a few ocassions, some objects intersect with one another.Most of these events are very fast and were captured by photograph.Well there you have it.

Myself and three other people (2 girls, 2 guys)went to Villa Roma Ski Resort, Callicoon, NY in the Catskill Mountains on vacation.  The third night we were there, we all got into a big arguement.  One of the women we were with stormed out of the Condo and disappeared. We were getting worried because she was gone for a while, so I left to go look for her. The area was very dark. The areas surrounding the resort were wooded. I wandered around calling for her for about 15-20min. I actually started getting nervous because it was so dark out there that I headed back to the condo. Before I got to the door I looked up to my left because I thought I saw something go by. My first thought was it was a helicopter. But I never heard it go by. I only saw it. I walked to the left of the condo, then along the left side. What I saw next has haunted me ever since.

Kind of like glow sticks but hazy. And it didn&apos;t make a sound. I began to make all kinds of excuses for what it could be.  It was moving in what I think was a northerly direction. In the most unbelievable way! It looked like when you throw a Frisbee. It almost bounces on air. Like it&apos;s hitting air pockets or something.  I know that&apos;s probably not helping you, but I don&apos;t know how else to explain it. It looked very unstable in the sky. Like it was vibrating. I was just standing there.  I wanted to run but I didn&apos;t. I don&apos;t know why! So,I just stood there with my mouth open.   It was moving north very slowly. Then it just swung around backwards(south), and stopped! Like it saw me! At this point I believe I may have been in shock or something because I was frozen with fear! It was just sitting in the sky, still.Then out of nowhere it took off. Flying straight in a what I think was south-westerly direction. Straight, then up, then gone! Just like that. The speed it was moving across the sky was incredible. The whole time I was telling myself I wasn&apos;t real. But I know it was! I still have the same feeling in my chest everytime I think of it! This incident took about 15-20 minutes from the time I saw it, to the time it disappeared. I immediately ran in the house and told everyone what I saw. Although they were very inquistive, I felt like none of them believed my story. So I stopped talking about it. I didn&apos;t want anyone to think I was crazy! Since then I&apos;ve only told two people and you are one of them. Since that night, there&apos;s not one night that has gone by that I haven&apos;t stared into space, for atleast a few minutes. This has changed my outlook on man and God quite a bit now. I&apos;m just looking for answers now. I am of very sound mind. For the rest of my life I will swear to what I saw on my children.

As it continued to approach the wires the light got brighter. As the light seem to hit the wires the large flock of birds resting on them were spooked and flew off quickley, most of them in a northerly direction. The light became much brighter at that point (what could be called the point of impact). At the time of impact the street lamps shut down for a second or two and the traffic light at our intersection did the same. The light disappeared after about a second as the birds flew away. We both experienced discomfort in our eyes similar to a camera flash. As the light changed we proceeded directly through it and quickley realized that the power lines followed the turn in the road and were positioned on the northerly side of the road.

I saw a bright light in the sky to my south at a fairly high angle of elevation. There was little apparent motion of the light, not unusual in itself. This is about 10 miles south and a little west of Hulman Field (airport) where F16 fighters fly in and out all the time.  However the duration of event and its lack of apparent motion and the brightness of the light were triggers for my interest.  I turned south on Hutchison Street off of Harlan, still on my path home, and I saw the light was now less intense  and I stopped my car about 1/2 mile south of Harlan Drive and got out to look at this object.  At this point I could discern that there were five pale yellow lights in a symetric chevron with the point in the direction of what I perceived to be a slow movement in the direction of north by northeast. The apparent size of the object was about the size of my thumb with my arm fully extended.  There was a single white light in the center of the apparent triangle formed by the vertices of the pale yellow chevron and this light flashed on and off at a slow rate.  The center light was not a harsh white like a strobe light. Also the white light seemed very big for a what would normally be an anti-collision strobe light on an aircraft.  I watched the object over the period of a few minutes gradually go north and become obscured by a tree line to the north. It was completely dark, the sky was partly cloudy and the moon was almost obscured by clouds.  I could not determine the actual size of the object as I had no references to determine its actual altitude. If it was a small craft like a fighter, it was pretty low; if larger who knows?. I could detect no sound. This object might have  easily been some kind of conventional craft, but I have never seen any aircraft with such pale yellow running lights on the leading edge of its wings, and operating so quietly. There w! ere no red/green navigation lights. Hence this registered very strongly with me as an unusual sight.  For what its worth, I am not qualified in any way as an aviation expert; I am ex-military.  This thing did not spark anything except curiosity in me, and I tend to doubt this was any kind of ET craft. However it was flying; it was a real object; it was strange enough to be called unidentified.

I was laying in the back seat of my mother&apos;s car, traveling from Fort Wayne to Berne, Indiana. What I recall is observing a glowing dull orange ball in the sky through the back window of the car.  I also remember the tan (my mother says red) interior of the car. The ball reminded me of the color of a basketball, likely due to the color. This is the extent of my memory of the incident  From what my mother says, we rounded a curve on US 27 southbound between Decatur and Berne at a town called Monroe.  After the curve of which there was a small woods on the right, my mother observed about five to ten cars slowing on the straight stretch of the road leading to the intersection of US 27 and State Highway 124 known as Coppus Corners. She says she doesn&apos;t remember brake lights, but remembers the cars slowing eventually almost to a stop. From the sky to the right (from the west) she observed an orange sphere or ball traveling downward at about a 45 degree angle towards the highway.  The object traveled to a point just to the right (west) of the highway, made a bouncing movement as if it was hopping the highway, then sped off again upward at a 45 degree angle at an astonishing rate of speed.  She does not recall if it disappeared due to the distance it traveled or if it just disappeared. She was unable to give me a size or distance of the object. The cars in front of us then began to accelerate up to normal speed and she never heard anyone else mention the incident. My mother is a no-nonsense wife of a minister (my father) and says that the incident was &quot;surreal&quot; and she recalls not wanting to discuss the incident with anyone. She was surprised that she did not hear anything about the incident, but that might have been because the other witnesses felt the same way she did about the incident. The date and time are approximate as I thought I was older when it happened, but she told me that my sister was with us and that she was less than a year old when it happened.  My sister was born in September of 1968 which is how I came up with the year 1969.  My mother does not even remember the time of year, but said the windows were up in the car. My mother and I would really like to speak with someone in one of the other vehicles, and that is what brought me to search the website for similar incidents and then post this report myself.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Whitney, CA - 1993My son, nephew and I were backpacking on the trail that leads up to the series of cottonwood lakes just south of Mt. Whitney, CA.  While hiking on the trail we glanced across the canyon to the opposite ridge line and there was a silver colored round object just hovering above the ridge.  It darted in short bursts in several different directions while we watched it.  It was definately NOT an aircraft I had ever seen before.  It would hover motionless for a few seconds and then burst to the left, hover, then burst to the right, hover, then burst upwards, etc.  Each time it hovered it would sit for a few seconds and then burst.  This went on for several minutes and finally dropped behind the ridgeline of the opposite canyon wall.  It was never seen again after that. That night I saw something completely different.

At 14:10 (EST) in Spartanburg, South Carolina, exiting a building, and looking almost exactly east, a plane was seen coursing across the sky.  Immediately after observing the contrail forming, the two observers saw 8 (eight) objects in the sky, appearing like stars (relatively the same size, but more metallic-silvery-shiney in appearance than a star at night) in the blue, daylight sky.  These objects had no apparent formation, but they were moving slowly. Almost 7 (seven) minutes into observing these objects, 6 (six) of the objects appeared to have a two-by-three formation:  two columns, three in each column, almost equidistant in space in relation to each other.  After roughly 10 (ten) minutes of observation, the 8, star-like objects could not be seen; it was as if they had slowly vanished from the observers&apos; sight. This is speculation:   We thought the objects we saw were parachutes for a while, but we deduced that, given the time we observed the objects, we would have seen them increase in size/get larger and more apparent.  However, the objects appeared to slowly decrease in size and then vanish over time.

I know other drivers caught the object when I saw people in front of me abruptly hitting their brakes.  Some began to drive erratically (including myself) while trying to catch a glimpse of the object.  I had another witness in the car. The object&apos;s body was either in the shape of a T or a Y...it was hard to tell.  The lights it had underneath it were definitely in a Y formation.  I remember seeing a blue, red, as well as white lights.  Some of the lights were blinking.  The object appeared to be black in color.  This object made no noise that I could hear and appeared to be completely stationary or moving very slowly in the sky.  Given how I was able to pass by it fairly quickly, I believe the object&apos;s altitude was very low.  The object also appeared to be quite large.

His website is &lt;www.FUSE.NET&gt;, where many interesting cases can be found.  PDI spoke with the witness from Trotwood, Ohio (suburb of Dayton).  Mrs.R.(name on file) related to me her close encounter with a UFO on the evening of October 25th, 2003 around 10:40 P.M.  Mrs. R. was taking her granddaughter, age 3, home. She had been babysitting.  Her daughter lives in a semi-rural area with only an occasional lamp post on the road side. As Mrs. R. approached a 4 way stop which was Union Rd. and Little Richmond Rd., she spotted what looked to be a &quot;glowing red S&quot; just above tree top level. The elongated &quot;letter S&quot; was on its side as opposed to be standing up.  She likened the light of the S to the glow of the coils in a toaster.As Mrs R. came to the four way stop she then saw that the S seemed to be on the bottom of a stationary object. She described the object as a bell shape at top coming down to be shaped like a hat brim.  The object was as long as a Cessma plane and about as tall as a one story house.  The object was black or dark gray in color.  It hovered about 6-8 feet above the tree tops.  Mrs. R. goes on to state that around the bottom of the object there were small round white/bluish lights that held steady.  The object made no sound. At this point Mrs. R. says she became very frightened fearing for her granddaughter who sat beside her in the car.  Mrs. R. says she became so frightened that she did not know to speed off or stay to watch the object longer.  She said that another vehicle was present at the 4-way stop, remembering that she saw a pair of headlights.  She does not remember what the vehicle did as she concentrated only on the object.  She said that she watched the object for a little over a minute.  Suddenly the object shot straight up and veered off to her right and was gone at a tremendous rate of speed.  At this point Mrs. R. states she also sped off to her daughters house.  Mrs. R. went on to explain that she has no interest in the subject of UFOs.  She has seen pictures of them on TV.  She also stated she had no truoble with her car during the sighting.  She spotted no other aircraft in the area at the time of her sighting.  She called her mother and told her of her experience. She also spoke to coworkers of her event.  Weather condidtions for that night were clear with calm winds and warm temps.INVESTIGATION: I contacted the Trotwood Police Dept.  They reported that no calls had been place on the date in question of a poosible UFO sighting.COMMENT: I find Mrs.R. to be a credible witness and truthful in her remarks.ADDTIONAL NOTES: I spoke with Mrs. R&apos;s mother after our conversation. She confirmed to me that her daughter did indeed call her from her cell phone on the way home after the incident. She sounded frightened and upset.  She described what she had seen to her mother.  Her mother relayed the details of the conversation which matched what her daughter told me. At one point her mother said that her daughter is a very no nonsense type person and if she tells you something you can believe her.

I was standing on my driveway looking South when I saw what looked like the landing lites of the evening flight of a Boeing 737.  As the object continued in from the South it was not decending as it normally would so I watched to see what was going on (at this time I looked at my watch to see if it was the regular flight at 22:25 P.M.) After checking the time (now 22:45) I was courious as to what was flying so low but not continuing to decend as usual.  As the craft approached I began to see its shape, it was a Boomerang or Delta wing shape.  I looked to be no more than 500 or 600 feet off the ground, the wing span was about 200 feet and each wing tip was fitted with a winglette which extended 90 degrees virtically maybe 10 or 15 feet. Each winglette was fitted with what looked like little windows or lites simular in size to a 1 ft by 4 ft floresent lite.  The leading edge of the underside of the wings on each side had 3 rowes of simular windows or lites the first row had 4 end to end the second row had 3 end to end, row 3 had 2 end to end.  The craft was flying about 10 degrees West of due North and eventually disappeared from view.  The craft had no markings, no blinking lites on the wing tips or the under side of the craft only two forward facing lites that appeared to be landing lites.  I watched it fly from South to Notrht for 2 to 3 minutes.  This craft made no sound and flew very fast!  I would venture it was Military.  Since I hang out with the Delta ground crew I ask them if they had seen it, they said they were busy with the evening flight and didn&apos;t notice it.  I tryed to contact the FAA tower people but they did not return my calls.  It was very interesting to see, I wonder if anyone else has seen something simular?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I called the San Jose Mercury News,  someone there told me it was a missile test by Edwards Air Force base.  Could have been done at Vandenberg Air Force.  There were sightsing at Monterey Bay.

I have an Assoc. degree in Science and Bachelors Degree in Nursing. I am a 53 year old grandmother of 5. I do not know exactly what I saw. I could not sleep this night. I stepped outside onto the patio facing south. I looked up thinking to myself that the stars were so bright and pretty. I also remarked allowed to myself &quot;Well Lord, the stars are still in the sky&quot;. At that moment I saw what I thought at first to be a falling star. However, what at first appeared to be a star, was extremely bright bluish white. It appeared to be coming directly at me very fast, then turned east while at the same time coming closer. Then, all of a sudden the &apos;star&apos; grew in size, appearing like an irregular oval-shaped rock, still bright, but appearing to be sort of &apos;bumping&apos; going slightly up an down, slightly losing speed, toppling/rolling over, and leaving behind a bluish white trail (similar to a chem trail). Then the object disappeared instantaneously. I stood there trying to memorize exactly what I saw. My first analysis was that it was probably a meteor/asteroid? I also expected to hear something about a meteor thumping into some farmers field. Nothing. So thought I would report what I observed, hoping perhaps that someone else saw the same thing.", "At 9:30 in the evening on a clear night,we saw five or six objects over the top of the mountain behind our house.The objects zipped around like fire flies changing direction instantly then hovering in one spot.All objects flashed either red and green lights, or red and white lights. There was no jet sound at all. We watched the objects for approximately fifteen minutes as they moved first to the north, then east then west. They changed direction quicker than any plane could. When they left they went different directions.A few momments after they disappeared a single point of light crossed from south east to north west, again with out any noise.As the light disappeared to the north west a passenger jet flew over. That was the first jet sound we heard during this whole time.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The object seemed to move in all directions(swoop from side to side and upside down) at times it looked as if it were floating then it would very quickly and smoothly fly further south and then come back. At one point the object seemed to be on it&apos;s side with the top facing us while in that position a very bright white light came from the object. After a couple minutes the object slowly moved further up and further south, my husband ran in to get the camcorder and shot approx 15-20 seconds of footage before the object was blocked by trees and no longer in view.

I do not recall that it made any sound, but at moments it appeared to be elliptical and the intensity of the light it emitted would rise and fall as it changed shape.  I do not recall the exact date but I couldn&apos;t have been more than six years of age.  I am now 34 and I remember it as if it were yesterday.

Object paralleled us as we drove slowly, stopping when we stopped going when we started again. we drove about 5 miles slowly but took old Warm Springs Rd. instead of 4 lane into Columbus. As dusk was almost complete I got out and walked toward it and watched for some 10-15 minutes. Suddenly I had the feeling it was gone but the object simply faded slowly as if it left behind a mist. Within the haze red green and bluish lights could be seen moving but did not seem to be spot lights, more like flood lights. It was strange that it stayed with us for so long staying the same distance and height above the trees from us except when we turned off it crossed eaterly to the opposite side of the road. Although the timeframe was long neither my (now ex-)wife noticed any missing time. it was truly remarkable to us from when first seen it was so bright and moved rather rapidly but as it slowed and paralleled us through this little &quot;speed-trap&quot; town it got dimmer and changed from the bright full moon shape to the definite football shape. It seemed to us we were seeing it edge-on as it paralleled us. Numerous other cars behind us should have seen it also but noone stopped and watched but us. I had a camera with me but had used up the film. On a recent get together in Ga when my mother died, my ex-wife and I discussed this event and she seemed to remember it the same as I remember it.

A star-like light passes in an arc at zenith.  This lasts about two seconds.  The light reappears, following the same arc, for another second then goes out.  Seconds later I see it again, farther away but following approximately the same arc.  This finally disappeared and I did not see it again.  The first time it appeared, I thought it was just like a lightning bug passing overhead.  This would have been very unusual, however, because there were almost no other bugs whatsoever and I had certainly not seen any lightning bugs.  When it reappeared I was sure it was no bug because it was obviously distant, star-like and moving at a rate like a very distant object might move.  A satellite does not orbit in an arc,  an airplane would not have appeared in intervals and would not have taken nearly the same amount of time to travel the way this did - unless it was very, very far away and at such a high altitude.  I have seen so many airplanes, satellites and lightning bugs to know this was not any of this.

It was in the west part of the sky at around 19:00. Thought it must have been a planet or something to be so big and bright. It didn&apos;t move any. Then a few minutes later I saw a dim star directly above me that was moving. Nothing special but one constant light(like a star) moving across the sky from south to north. Not a plane because it had no strobes. Looked like a star moving at about the speed a plane would move at except it looked to be at an extreme altitute. Then when I was leaving at 21:30 I looked and both of the earlier ones were gone. I happened to look around again and saw something odd in the east part of the sky. Another big star except this one looked like it was rotating and the light was changing color. It did not move but it was flashing from white to blue to green and to red. It looked like a star that was going super nova or something because of all the colors. I also noticed about 5 planes in the sky, 2 of which were heading directly at it. Then as I drove home I kept looking for it then when I got home it looked like it had moved farther east because it was smaller but still flashing. Can&apos;t say any of it was a UFO for sure. Could of been something with the atmosphere or increased light pulution as I got to my house. Either way it was cool to watch and not something normal. There were no sounds.", "Metallic cylinder objectI was driving down a an open road when I noticed a metallic cylinder type object hovering about 100 feet up in the sky.

The sun was setting, already below the horizon.  Looking north of the setting sun, were two crescent shaped lights.  fairly large, with the convex pointing down.  As I watched, the two lights got closer together.  I made a turn and lost sight of lights.  When I turned west again, at about 5:37 PM, one light had turned around, changed shape into what looked like a rocket heading straight down towards Earth and the other craft.  But there was no white streak behind it, and red flames coming from the back of the craft.  (the red flame looked like magnesium burning, color-wise).   Then  as I watched, at about 5:40 PM, the second craft (which kept its crescent shape, and was stationary until now) changed into a rocket (also with no white streak behind it, and a red-magnesium burning flame) and headed straight up into the sky away from the other craft.  these two flight paths continued until about 5:50 PM, when the second craft disappeared from view and the first craft changed its course to run parallel with the horizon.  By 5:55 PM,  the first craft had moved back up into the sky, and changed into a stationary bright light, looked like a star.

In truth, I didn&apos;t believe that there was no such thing as UFOs, not until today. I was on my way home after meeting with my friends in a nearby cafe. There was rarely any cars at the moment. Temperature was 48 degrees F. The sky was very dark, clear, and stars were visible. When I was approaching my intersection to make a left, I saw it. On the top right corner of my frontal car window, an round shaped, bright light greenish light suddenly caught my eye. I stopped my car in the middle of the street and looked at it. It started to get brighter and then it &quot;warped out&quot; leaving a trail of the same exact color for about half a second and vanished, as if nothing was there. After it disappeared, I thought about many things for a moment. It could&apos;ve been an airplane, a helicopter, fireworks, or something.. it was NOTHING LIKE IT. Then, my whole body started to get goosebumps and my eyes with tears. I froze right there, in the middle of the street for a good 30 seconds. I once saw the UFO sighting shows in television before. It looked exactly like it. If whoever reads this gives me video clips of different sightings, I might be able to pinpoint something similar to what I actually saw. I know other people will not believe me. I called some of my friends that were awake and some didn&apos;t even believe me! This is the first time I ever write this type of report ever in my life, but this event cannot pass without notice. It will be treasured inside me for the rest of my life.

The one huge &quot;star&quot; suddenly darted a very short distance to the north from an obvious stand-still position a moment before, and then abruptly stopped. Surprised and curious, I went in to get my binolulars for a better look. When I looked at it through the binocular lenses, I was stunned to see a round/circular object that appeared to be the size of a fifty-cent piece,as one would be to the naked eye.I clearly saw that the outer ring of the object was full of what appeared to be rows of lights close together. There was a smaller blank ring section inside that ring of lights. There was also another smaller ring section of lights inside it, and a second very narrow blank ring area with what appeared to be one large solid light in the very center of the entire object. There were four rings, two with lights and two blank,  with a center solid light in the very center of the object. The solid center light appeared to be red in colour. No sooner did I get a clear, detailed view, when the entire object shot straight up, becoming quarter sized, then dime sized, then quickly &quot;star&quot; sized. I watched it for fifteen minutes just to see if it would come back down. It didn&apos;t.

I was lying on my hammock when I saw the object fly straight over my head, fast, no sound from about NE to SW.  The weirdest thing about it was that it opened a pocket in the clear blue sky and disappeared through it.  When the pocket closed a whisp of white cloud came out and drifted over the sky.  The object was shiny and looked like it was reflecting the ground which would make it fairly close.  I&apos;m not a pilot or a meteorologist or an astronomer, so I can&apos;t estimate heights and speeds very well, except that the object was going much faster than the planes that approach the local airport and it had to be pretty low to be reflecting ground.  Also, even though it was usually a busy time at the airport, there were no other aircraft in the vicinity.", "It was moving slowly around in the sky and after maybe 4 min it sped of at high speedsThe object was bright and we saw a yellow flash before it dissapeared.

At or near the point where the flight paths met, the light turned 90 degrees to left very sharply and accelerated upward and disappeared from sight.

I hear his drummer say would you look at that, as i looked up i saw a large triangle shaped craft flying from northeast to southwest. It was shaped like a triangle with a nose on it. I could see four lights on the nose, one on the very tip one on each side of the nose and one slightly back. It also had one light in the middle one on what i would call the tail end and one on each wingtip. The lights on the nose and the one in the middle of the craft were the only ones blinking. All lights looked to be red in color except the four on the nose which appeared to be yellow in color.

I approached my car and in the back of a tree I again saw lights. At first I thought it was a helicoptor but then suddenly it sped over my head and another one zigzagged with it in the sky. I continued to look up,terrified but looking at blue lights zigzagging in the sky..I noticed a blue light above my head not certain if it was a star, but it started moving.

It floated tilted with no sound as it disapeared into the trees.", "object moved from south to north but had an unusual vertical bobbing action to it.Although I&apos;m from a major metropolitan area (OK City, OK), the observation was made at my father&apos;s home.  He lives in an extremely small town about 60 miles from me. I&apos;m generally considered a no-nonsense individual.I&apos;ve been on this planet nearly 50 years and while it&apos;s possible I may have seen a ufo in the past, I&apos;m almost always the first person to say, No, that was an airplane, or heavenly body or atmospheric condition or whatever.  Nevertheless, on Sunday, October, 26th, 2003, at approximately 12:30 am while admiring the vividly clear &apos;country&apos; sky, I spotted a brighter-than-usual light off to the s-se not far above the horizon. The intensity caught my eye but then as I tried to figure out what satellite I might be watching, it began to move in a way for which I was not prepared. The movement was vertical. Up... and then down again.  Repeatedly, at about 1 full cycle per second. While I could not see a &apos;body&apos; attached to the light, if the light had been all there was to the object then the amount of vertical movement was (I roughly calculated) about twenty times the diameter of the light.  Since I had no idea at first how far away it was I was using relative measurements.  In any case, my first impulse was to think my eye was &apos;playing tricks&apos; on me. However, fatigue was not a likely answer since when I&apos;m at home I work as a computer programmer and my most productive hours are from around 11:00 pm to approximately 6:00 am.  In other words, that&apos;s the part of the day when I&apos;m most alert.  Another thing: I had my right eye damaged in an automobile accident 11 years ago, and while this may seem like a hindrance, I consider it an advantage in situations like this because since the car wreck I&apos;ve learned to judge depth differently than most people.Also, although I program computers for a living now, I spent most of my life as a draftsman and had a great many opportunities to work with trigonometric functions while drawing various layouts for anything from buildings to bridges.I&apos;m no stranger to calculating distances using triangulation. In addition, I&apos;ve had numerous trig and calc classes in both high school and college. So,  since the object appeared to be stationary relative to latitude and longitude, I thought maybe I could judge its location by how it lined up with a major near-by tree limb as I moved around the yard.This is not a bad technique.  In fact, I judged the light to be 1.5 to 2 miles away. At this point the idea of ufo had not crossed my mind. I thought maybe it was a ground search light from a near-by town.  Problem is, most small towns don&apos;t own search lights of that magnitude. Plus, the sky was very clear  (no clouds) and the air was thin which meant no moisture for light to bounce off. In retrospect there was another thing that was gnawing away at me and I didn&apos;t realize it at the time:  The thing seemed to be waiting for me to watch it before it started moving.  I know that sounds weird but it sure seems that way now. To continue...Just about the time I thought I&apos;d figured out how far away it was, it began to move northward while continuing the vertical movement. Not all that far away it wasn&apos;t moving very fast.  I&apos;m estimating it leveled out at around 60 mph and by this time I&apos;d estimated it&apos;s relative angle to the ground to be approximately 15 degrees. It was fairly low on the horizon. Within the range of its vertical movement, its average deviation was consistent during this northward movement. After a minute of so of watching it move toward a point which I would estimate to be about a half mile east of me, I began to get concerned. Unless this thing was a balloon, I should have been hearing some noise. However, there are two problems with this line of thought: 1) A balloon couldn&apos;t bob up and down that quickly and 2) On a clear night like that night, sound travels pretty well.  I could easily hear highway traffic a half mile away. The concern finally got to me and I ran to the front door and yelled to my dad. By the time he got his shoes on and made it outside, the light had moved behind some trees that line the east side of his property. I pointed to the area of sky north of the trees where the object should re-appear and wanted him to see this thing with strange flight behavior.Unfortunately, it never re-appeared and he finally gave up and went back inside.  I know this may be disappointing compared to other reports and I barely consider it worthy of most people&apos;s valuable time just to read it, but I tell it here because I have no logical explanation for what I saw.  It actually happened and it really gave me goose bumps when I realized that what I was looking at might be something from our government&apos;s secret arsenal or perhaps something even more exotic like an extraterrestrial object. By the time you get my age,  firsts don&apos;t happen as often as they used to but this was definitely a first for me.", "Bright red light , moving upwards and at crazy anglesok.. me a a freind of mine when we got off of work at NAS LEMOORE NAVAL BASE, we headed down to the river not to far from base.It was a very clear night and i recall seeing a few shooting stars. We settled down fishing off one of the damns that were there and we seen what we thought was a flare being shot off. It just topped over the tree line and it stopped .. we thought nothing of it. Well it started moving towards us slow,and upwards and the same time. This really really intense light started moving faster making these very sharp turns... we watched it do this for about 5 minutes as it was moving upwards. There was this flash,and right after that we seen like a tail as if it was moving like a comet would but only going up. Shortly after the flash,this red ball of light vanished... FAST and at another really sharp angle. Adding to this.. i work on this base.. i know every aircraft that is here, I know alot about many of the planes that fly around here. I know for a fact that it isn&apos;t  one ofthem around here that can fly that fast a make sharp turns as this did.

Every evening after work me and a friend of mine, he is also Maltese guy, we go for a long walk and chatting together just to pass the time, because in the desert there&apos;s nothing else to do besides working all day. It was a clear night with all the shining stars, and we were very far away from our camp site and nothing else was visible around our camp area, we were alone in this location. The area was really flat with no sand dunes around. While we were walking my friend was looking at the sky when he stopped suddenly, and i told him what&apos;s wrong and he said look up there and i saw a round shape very bright red colour the size of a football moving staight slowly then stopped, then start moving again but in zigzag pattern like, then stopped again, then went backwards straight and increased it&apos;s speed that in 2 sec it vanished. We were amazed by this sight and to be  honest i was a little scared after the sighting. When we got back to camp none of our friends believed us and told us you were imagining so i didn&apos;t take it seriously, so i didn&apos;t bother much in mentioning about this for a long time.Who knows maybe it was really a U.F.O.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

In the distance I saw a lighted object hovering at 2000 feet just north of Highway 8. Object was on the right hand side of Highway and I was in the passenger seat. San Diego has many military bases and airports which I drive passed frequently. I have lived in San Diego all my life. This object looked odd to me immediately. I was able to watch the object until we drove directly underneath it. I looked straight up at the object with my window rolled down. It appeared motionless. The object was black with a triangular shape with rounded edges. One circular light was on each of the three ends which helped identify it as triangular against the black sky. The top of the triangle had a larger circular light than the two ends. Circular lights were white and opaque. Red colored lights between the two smaller circular lights. It appeared that triangle was a 45 degree angle type with sides all the same length. Only saw the bottom of object. Maybe the length of three commercial helicopters, guessing. I wish we could have stopped to watch object, but my husband didn&apos;t want to bother. He could not see all the details I was seeing since he was on other side of car driving. My three little boys in the back seat started to get scared, so my enthusiasm was kept at a minimum. This object was so clear and beautiful to see. Very fine lines and circular lights very clean. Did not hear any noise as we drove beneath object. After we passed object, it moved slowly south west direction towards Mission Valley. It didn&apos;t look anything like an airplane which my husband had suggested it was. Wish I knew what it was!((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no personal data or contact information.

After reading many of the reports on your sight specifically where lights in the sky are concerned, I thought you might be intrested in hearing about the Watersmeet Mystery Light. Though not considered a UFO this occurance is considered a Ghost Light that seems very simmilar to many of your reported UFO lights. The Mystery Light is located 11 miles north of Watersmeet Michigan on an abandonded railroad grade, in the middle of the National Forest. First reported in the 1940&apos;s this strange light appears on a nightly basis From sundown till dawn.This light comes and goes as if to have a mind of its own. The light has been seen above and within the tree line, I have seen the light change from white to red numerous times. I live in the Chicago area and have visited this sight on many summer trips to the upper penninsula of Michigan.There are other areas in the U.S. where similar sightings are observed Marfa,Texas / Gurdon Arkansas / The White Mountains in North Carolina. I am entering this information as a possible explanation for some of reported sightings of strange lights in your files. There is one problem: These Mystery Lights ( though easy to witness ) are also unexplained.", "One light emits multiple identical lights above ManhattanI saw a light crossing the night sky that split into two, then three, then four, and maybe more, separate lights. All of the lights continued moving in the same direction as the original light; none appeared to fall, which I assume they would have had they been flares dropped from the original light (well, airplane, in that instance). Also, each of the lights--the original, as well as those that came &quot;out&quot; of it--were identical in apparent size--they were point sources--as well as color, luminosity, etc. They were identical, so far as I could tell. The original object was traveling much too slowly to have been a meteor or other bolide breaking up in the atmosphere--or so I would judge. I distinctly remember that I had the impression that it was not a natural object of that sort, but rather an object--objects--under intelligent control. I wish I had written down precisely what happened right after I saw it, because the details are now a little fuzzy. For instance, I cannot recall now if all of the subsequent lights &quot;merged out&quot; of the original light, or if each new light then split into another one; it may well have been the latter. In any case I remember being very perplexed by it. It was certainly out of the ordinary. I am an amateur astronomer, and this was something I had never seen before. I don&apos;t know what it was--I&apos;m not prepared to say it was an alien spacecraft or anthing of the sort--but it was definitely something I could not identify. I am a skeptic, but I&apos;ll admit I&apos;m interested in the topic of UFOs. One point that may interest some: one often hears from (other) skeptics and debunkers that astronomers--i.e., people accustomed to observing the night sky and familiar with its various phenomena, from eclipses to apparitions of the planets to meteors, etc.--never report seeing unusual objects in the sky.

The report stated: &quot;Morehead-Rowan Co. Rescue Sq.had a call from Morehead Police Dept. of a female crying for help three times  From 2 witness then they was a bright light in the sky for about 1 min. RESCUE SQ.arrived on scene and started searching the area 1st &amp; 2nd witness reported seeing this. The fire dept. was ask to begin searching with the thermal imaging camera with no results found. Res.of Morehead was one of the witnesses.Unless there is a confirmed report of a missing person,the search will not be continued.&quot;   INVESTIGATION  This morning I contacted the Morehead Police Dept at (606-784-7511) and talked to two very nice officers that were in the department (located at 105 E Main St Morehead, KY). I asked the first dispatcher if he could provide any information about an unusual report I had concerning mysterious lights seen near Morehead. &quot;I think that was from the Rockfork area,&quot; he said, &quot;and it was the northern lights, what they call an aurora. We had some calls on it. We had a report of the northern lights in the area.&quot;  The dispatcher also informed that no officers reported the lights. &quot;There were some calls on it, one female caller reporting something in the sky, but it was the aurora borealis.&quot;  I asked if the calls were related to the report of &quot;screaming sounds&quot; and the dispatcher said he did not think so. I asked if there was a search conducted and he did not know for sure and began checking the logs. There was some confusion as to the date of event but found from his logbook he informed that a search was undertaken near Adams Lane on Sunday evening, November 23. &quot;There was some type of search because of a woman screaming, I think,&quot; he said, and also checked with another gentleman who was in the office, the captain of the fire department. I could overhear the gentleman talking (his name may have been Randy) who was knowledgeable about the situation. I then asked if I could speak directly with this person. The Captain of the Fire Department came to the phone and said that on Sunday night, November 23, persons near Adams Lane began hearing a woman screaming three times around 10:00 p.m. &quot;We had a report of a woman screaming and then they didn&apos;t hear it no more,&quot; said the Morehead, KY fire official, &quot;they called and the local rescue squad went out there, the fire department and the police went out and a search was conducted. The search used a thermal imaging device and lasted for about an hour and a half when it was called off.&quot;  &quot;We thought it might have been two kids who got scared,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe one scared another and they were frightened.&quot;  I asked the fire official if he had any knowledge about the bright light in the sky seen for one minute and he said: &quot;I got there at the tail end of things so don&apos;t know anything about it. I didn&apos;t see anything myself.&quot;  I asked if he heard anyone else talking or rumors of a bright light in the sky during the time frame of the search and he said &quot;no.&quot;  COMMENT  The two officers at the Morehead Police Department were kind and helpful. They were able to validate the report of &apos;mysterious screams&apos; that appeared on N.U.F.O.R.C.but did not have any information to link the 3 mysterious screams directly to a ighting of a &apos;bright light&apos; in the sky. The first officer said the bright light, seen a couple of days earlier, was caused by the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis, yet it seems unusual to think that several residents, as described, would see a pretty sunset and interpreted the situation in such a manner as to contact local police authorities. Further, the initial report to N.U.F.O.R.C. sought to link the sighting of the bright light in the sky directly to the scream/search event and seemed to suggest that a &quot;Res.&quot; of Morehead was one of the witnesses. &quot;Res.&quot; might mean &apos;resident&apos; or &apos;rescue&apos; as in rescue worker. The poorly worded report also does not indicate what this &apos;Res&apos; was a witness to, exactly. Also, there may be some issue as to the time listed on the N.U.F.O.R.C. report as the claimant logs the event as occurring on 11/21/2003 when the dispatcher said the search took place Sunday evening, 11/23/2003 (and also noted that the northern lights were seen &quot;a couple of days earlier&quot;). Northern Lights have been prominent lately due to increased solar eruptions and flares from the sun.

After the conversation I had to call a &apos;time out&apos; and take some time to contemplate over this development as the report is terribly interesting. It is one of the best reports I have ever taken as I am impressed with the witness  and extreme strangeness of the case. I will prepare the details of this case shortly and have a report put together in the next hour or so. The witness did not report this except to the police and has no idea how it ended up at NUFORC (Peter, can you help if you retain a source for the original report?).As stated earlier, the Morehead police department was dismissive of this incident, when I contacted them they acknowledged a search party and report of screaming sounds but said that &apos;northern lights&apos; were seen in the area. From my conversation with this very credible witness, northern lights can be positively ruled out.This is a real mystery. Full report is pending.... KENNY YOUNG  ((END))  ((NOVEMBER 30, 2003, POSTING TO CURRENT-ENCOUNTERS LIST BY KENNY YOUNG))  SUBJECT: Screaming sounds firmly linked to UFO sighting LOCATION: Morehead, Kentucky (Rowan County) DATE: Friday, November 21, 2003 TIME: Between 9 and 10:00 p.m. SUMMARY  In effort to further explore the report of &apos;unidentified lights&apos; and screaming sounds alleged in Morehead, Kentucky, an internet search was conducted to retrieve the address and phone numbers of residents of ((deleted)) (law officer earlier contacted had advised of the search taking place near this location). After a &quot;reverse lookup&quot; was conducted at the internet resource Http://www.theultimates.com one residency was identified on ((deleted)) Lane in Morehead, Kentucky. That number was called around 6:30 p.m. this evening (Sunday, November 30, 2003) and I inquired if anyone could help me with information about the report of screaming sounds heard around one week earlier. The call was received by Dr. ((name deleted)), a ((deleted)) college professor. &quot;I was here when the screams were heard,&quot; he said.  &quot;There were some loud, blood-curdling screams but nobody could find out anything more.&quot;  I then asked if Dr. ((name deleted)) knew anything about any UFO sighting and he said: &quot;Yes, I saw it.&quot;  Dr. ((name deleted)) said that he was driving toward his home on Friday, November 21 between 9 and 10:00 p.m. with his 2 sons, 15 and 18-years old (He recalls the specific date, knowing that one son is in college and would not have been home any day except Friday). While driving, they all spotted a soundless aerial object over a nearby open field that was described as an oval-shaped, white-colored light source as big as a pea held at arms length which moved &apos;like a hummingbird would move.&apos;  The object, seen in the dark and clear night skies, was relatively high when first seen and was &quot;coming down, moving in increments as if an elevator would drop and stay there awhile, then drop and stay there awhile,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) said. After the first 3 or 4 minutes of visual observation, the object began moving around to different parts of the sky. They got out of car to see if they could identify this object and verified to their satisfaction that the object was not a plane, helicopter or aurora borealis. &quot;My first inclination was to rationalize what this object could have been,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) said. &quot;rather than jumping to conclusions. After we ruled out the various possible explanations we assumed that this was a UFO.&quot;  &quot;I know for a fact that there was no explanation for this object and I&apos;m just glad I had my two sons with me to see it,&quot; he said. After observing this object for a few minutes, Dr. ((name deleted)) and his 2 sons got back in the car and drove on to their home under a certain sense of apprehension. &quot;I would say that our feeling was more a sense of apprehension than fear,&quot; he said, &quot;I did not know what it was we were looking at and had some concern that it might or could have spotted us.&quot;  After driving the short distance to their house, they went to a second floor bedroom and looked out the window to the northwest where they continued to watch the object. It descended lower toward the ground and seemed to be settling in a nearby field where its color had shifted from a white to an orange. As the object got lower and lower to the ground, it became bigger and its color changed to a reddish light. He said that the size of the object increased from a pea at arms length to a dime at arms length, stressing that its size, from his perspective, was &quot;not quite as drastic as a nickel at arms length.&quot;  &quot;There was like a vacuum of silence while we watched this,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) said, &quot;it was like everything was real quiet, at a standstill and then when it became a red color, everything went crazy.&quot;  Dr. ((name deleted)) said that animals in the area suddenly erupted in a frenzy. His neighbors dog was barking crazily and his German Shepherd dog tried to break its chain. From his perspective, the object descended to the ground but was not certain that it touched or made contact with the ground as trees prevented him from seeing this with certainty. &quot;At that point, after this object got red, it just &quot;shot off&quot; like a dart, some kind of acceleration and it just took off to the west. We just stood there dumbfounded.&quot;  He said the sighting lasted for an estimated 10 to 15 minute duration. &quot;I was very reluctant to call the police about a UFO sighting,&quot; he said, &quot;at that point, we were not going to report this.&quot;  &quot;Right after that my 2-sons went back outside and heard the screaming. It was a female voice. They got in the car and within minutes had called from their cell phone to say that they had been hearing screaming sounds in the field where this thing came down,&quot; he said. &quot;Approximately 20-minutes after the UFO sighting the police were at my door, there were about 20 officers and a rescue squad over in the field where I spotted the UFO. They were combing the area and had asked me what I knew about someone screaming.&quot;  &quot;Apparently, others had heard the screaming sounds.&quot;  I asked Dr. ((name deleted)) if he could explain what was heard and he emphasized that he did not hear the screaming sounds himself, that his 2 sons heard the disturbing commotion, along with other residents in the area that notified law enforcement. Dr. ((name deleted)) paused from our conversation to check with one of his sons, asking if he could recount the nature of the screaming sounds. He said it was a desperate, blood curdling scream of a female voice that kept saying: &quot;Help me, oh my God, help me!&quot;  &quot;Apparently several people had heard the screaming, I don&apos;t know how long it lasted,&quot; he said. When the police arrived at his doorstep knocking on his door (an estimated 15 minutes after the UFO departed), Dr. ((name deleted)) volunteered information about the UFO sighting. &quot;I took the officer to the side and explained to him that this is going to sound crazy, but I need to tell you what I saw tonight.&quot;  &quot;I told the police about the UFO after they came to the door, I don&apos;t know if anyone else saw the UFO but the officer taking my report took me seriously. He didn&apos;t write anything down while I talked with him,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) said. When asked if the police officer indicated that anyone else had also witnessed the UFO, Dr. ((deleted)) said that the police officer said he had seen a UFO also, but was uncertain if he was referring to the same object or a separate, unrelated sighting. Dr. ((name deleted)) said that aside from reporting this to the police officer who knocked on his door, he had not reported this sighting to any other person and that he was not the source for the report which was submitted to The National UFO Reporting Center. He was puzzled how the report made it to NUFORC and said that neither he, nor his sons, reported the sighting to anyone. &quot;I&apos;m still trying to figure out who reported this,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) said after our conversation. He went on to say how he got &quot;freaked out&quot; when the cops came to the door asking about the screaming sounds. He described the area of his residence as isolated and surrounded by fields and woodland. His road is paved. He emphasized that the screaming sounds came from the immediate area where the unidentified object had came to the ground. &quot;The screaming sounds came from the field, and I have no explanation for it.&quot;  Dr. ((name deleted)), who teaches ((deleted)) for the ((deleted)), also said that he had previously seen a UFO when he was in his Freshman year in college at ((deleted)) in 1976. He said the object was similar to what he saw on Friday, November 21, 2003. COMMENT  I am deeply impressed by Dr. ((deleted)) and his efforts to remain objective and rationalize various explanations about the sighting. Based on his observation, the object in question is nothing to do with Aurora Borealis or &apos;northern lights.&apos;  Dr. ((deleted)) allowed permission to use his name and employment in this report, having no objection to it attached with the UFO sighting and situation involving a search party near his home. Information furnished by Dr. ((deleted)) sheds new light on this case. Comments from him directly contradict the dismissive approach taken by law officers in remarks made during earlier inquiries (who also incorrectly advised that the event was on Sunday, November 23) regarding a UFO situation that corresponds with the screams. When informed that a Morehead policeman and a fire rescue officer told me that &quot;someone had seen the northern lights,&quot; Dr. ((name deleted)) scoffed at the suggestion and was in disbelief. &quot;I can&apos;t believe they said that, this was definitely not the northern lights.&quot;  He said that tomorrow he will inspect the 50-acre field where the object descended. The report to N.U.F.O.R.C. suggests that the UFO was also sighted by witnesses with the rescue squad responding to the scene. This might suggest that the screaming sound was heard simultaneous to the visual sighting of the UFO. Peter Davenport of N.U.F.O.R.C. states: &quot;The person who submitted the sighting report for Morehead, KY, provided no personal or contact information, to include no e-address.  It &quot;reads&quot; as if it was submitted by a member of the team that was dispatched, i.e. it reads as if someone just copied a written record of the dispatch.  I would have responded to the report, save for the absence of any means of contacting the source.&quot;  That report states: &quot;Morehead-Rowan Co. Rescue Sq.had a call from MPD of a female crying for help x3. From 2 witness then there was a bright light in the sky for about 1 min. RESCUE SQ.arrived on scene and started searching the area 1st &amp; 2nd witness reported seeing this .The fire dept.was ask to begin searching with the thermal imaging camera with no results found. Res. of Morehead was one of the witnesses. Unless there is a confirmed report of a missing person, the search will not be continued.&quot;  The report of desperate, blood curdling screams from a woman crying &quot;Help me, Oh God, Help me&quot; mar this case with a disturbing sense of unusual dread. Clearly, there was a problem taking place and this report raises the specter of reported UFO/human abduction or interaction. Morehead, Kentucky is an estimated 45-miles south of Flemingsburg, Kentucky, where a crop formation appeared in a Rye Field in the spring of this year. A flap of crop formations and UFO sightings also bewildered Southern Ohio in the summer of 2003, and during this flap one strange account of a woman found in a Southern Ohio soybean field is under investigative consideration.  There is no certainty that this situation can be linked to the UFO or crop circle flap aside from the chronological and regional closeness, but the woman - who was hospitalized for a week after being found by a farmer - reportedly experienced amnesia and did not know how she got in the field. This matter is also held under close consideration by researcher Donnie Blessing and will be pursued further. This present case of &apos;screaming sounds&apos; from a female voice is linked firmly to the UFO sighting as per the same location in one specific field near Adams Lane in Morehead, Kentucky and the &apos;20 minute time frame&apos; of the conclusion of the UFO sighting to the arrival of officers involved in the search and rescue operation.

My first though was helicopters serching for something between New Haven, and Long Island.  But after hearing the report on the Rense Show I felt that I must of been seeing something rather different.  Being that the lights were so far away I could not make out very much except they would loose and gain altitude, and seemed to have a light (similar to a search light)aiming downward.  Over 30 min period the whole show seemed to move in a NE to SW direction. At times the lights were bright orange, and at other times soft white.  The orange lights would of been very intense of one was close to that area. Thats about it, sorry I was not closer. Ha.", "A witness called and reported seeing more bright green lights in the area. This witness tells me that the light was very low in the sky and traveling in a straight line for a short distance then made a slight change in direction heading to the north. The object appeared in the sky for approx: 8 seconds before the witness lost sight of it. He told me due to how low it was flying and so very bright he thought it was very odd looking. He told a friend, and his friend told him to contact me to file a report. Thank you to the witness for the report.

They were climbing a small hill on Highway #16 just before Babine Forest Products when they both noticed a red ball of light a head of them, dropping on a slight angle from low in the sky. The witnesses said, the object, what ever it was seem to come down just on the other side of the hill they were climbing. Also what they found to be strange was just after they lost sight of the red ball of light behind the hill, all of a sudden at the crest of the grade, on the highway , the whole area was glowing a bright reddish color. They reported that the tops of the tress were also bathed in a reddish glow. From their vantage point they could not see anything as they had not arrived at the top of the hill. They were only a few hundred yards away from reaching the top and from this location they should have been able to see what was causing this reddish glow. Just before they reached the top the light went out. The couple slowed down and kept their eyes open to maybe catch sight of it again somewhere just off the highway. But nothing could be observed. No vehicles were seen driving along the highway a head of them. Thank you to the witnesses for their report.

We then saw a large object lift off and explode into lightI am a life-long experiencer of ufo, sleep paralysis, psychic phenomenon. My most incredible sighting happened in 1993, while I was walking with my aunt. We were walking at night in her neighborhood, when a black van pulled up beside us. A man, who I could not clearly see, asked us if we &quot;wanted a ride&quot;. We quickly said no. As we walked on abit, and rounded a corner. We walked in front of her apartment complex, Greentree Apts. Now, across the street, there is a radio station, and a large field behind it where, often is used as a small fairground. My aunt and I were speaking about nothing in particular, when all off a sudden she said, &quot;what is that light over there?&quot; I looked out of the corner of my eye, at somethingt that seemed to be coming up from the field. I said, &quot;oh, that is a helicopter.&quot; &quot;But,&quot; she replied, &quot;it isn&apos;t making any noise.&quot; I quickly realised she was right, and we both suddenly stopped and watched as a dark object with very bright lights at both ends and an occasional lightening flash on top rose, silently, from the field behind the radio station. It went quickly, at a sixty degree angle or arc, until we could almost see under it. Then it exploded into a red flash, and was gone quicker than anything I had ever seen. We were aghast for several minutes. Now, that is the most incredible thing I have ever seen in the night sky. Since then, I have had many more experiences, discovered spiritualism, and began writing and channeling an entity I call Zem. Recently, i had a sighting on a country road with a member of the psychic development group that I had in college, and, again, there was a BLACK VAN driving toward the object down the road (it seemed to have come out of nowhere), as we drove away from the object (which was a cery bright, flickering object). What I suppose I am most curious about is, actually, what the black van has to do with these objects, and has anyone ever reported it? If so, I would like to know about it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was moving very slowly in a steep upward direction. There was no sound whatsoever.  It was rectangular in shape, and had two rows of three bright lights.   Very high intensity.   I got up and ran outside, which could have only take a minute, but by that time it was gone.", "Egg shaped light spotted, over an hour of time lost?During a routine return trip from Mesa Az, to Safford Az late Sunday night my wife spotted what she described as an &quot;odd light&quot; in her rear view mirror.  She said it was too high off the road to be headlights and too low to be an aircraft.  As I was the passenger I took a look behind the van and observed this egg shaped light that wasn&apos;t bright like headlights and not glowing either.  The object appeared about a mile behind our van and hovering something like 40&apos; (?) above the roadway.We watched it behind us for what seemed like a couple of minutes.  I cannot report what happend next.  The trip seemed to simply &quot;resume&quot; and neither of us spoke about the object again.  Upon our return home we noticed the clock - we were about an hour and 15 to 20 minutes later than we should have been - having made the trip many times, we know exactly how long it takes.  We wondered about the object and its relationship to the missing time, but dismissed the entire event and went to bed. We&apos;re reporting this now because we&apos;d like to simply forget that night; but you can&apos;t forget something you can&apos;t remember?  What we do know is that since that evening, when we pass that exact area late on a Sunday night conversation ends and we both get quiet.

He claimed to watch a light for 45 minutes with it moving very little.  Military jets followed behind.

I travel east from HWY 41 down Lynch Rd toward I-64. 3 blocks from work there is very little artifical light and open fields so I have a clear view of the night sky for miles and miles.  There is an Airport (evansville regional) north less than 10 miles. Starting in October I&apos;ve noticed a bright light in the direction I&apos;m traveling  just a degree or so south of Lynch Road. I note this cause like the other man I see it a long time and it only seems to move left and right slightly.  I spectulated as to what it was ..something traveling toward me?  A balloon? Mars?  A Star?  Lynch road was built up to the I-64 bypass and there it ends uphill into farmland.  If Lynch was 12o&apos;clock then the light was at 1:30am.  It glowed and shimmered like heat on blacktop. From 2 miles away it was just smaller than a dime. (I held one up) Seeing it as I traveled it seemed not natural or right. There was only one big light as if it were a tiny star hovering over a field I could see a silo slightly North of it.  I watched it more than I watch the road. I was driving straight toward it trying to see it but I couldnt actually focus on it. I thought I could make out a shape in the glow cause I was kinda making a joke about it to myself ..here&apos;s my c2c call! I was thinking how could I descibe it to Art Bell. &quot;Round bright slightly shimmering light seeming to cover something not quite circular.&quot; I entered the I-64 ramp but I stopped trying to see it better it never moved.  I couldnt focus good on it beyond the light so I continued on I-64 traveling south toward Indiana 66...looking left at the light it suddenly blinks out. well I thought whatever it is it&apos;s gone.  At that moment  large heavy duty helicopters flew over there were 3 of them in formation traveling Southeast in a straight line toward where ALCOA sits on the Ohio River. Of course I&apos;m thinking wow..this was an Art Bell moment.  I had that same moment for the next 5 weeks either on wens or thursday nights.  Big light...Military choppers. I know that Indiana has military bases and Kentucky has them too.  It&apos;s not heard of but not too common for those big choppers to travel over us.

As we drove from Globe into Superior on saturday afternoon we noticed dozens of cars pulled off the road with people outside looking up....we drove through Superior, and a few miles later decided to pull over because of the number of cars still pulled over and looking upwards. We got out, asked some questions, and looked up as well. Very high up there was a bright silver spherical object (the size to the eye as a BB held at hands distance.) We obseved this for about 10 minutes, durig which the object would move in any direction almost instantaneously by the distance of about 1 to 2 hand-widths at arms length. Several people had large cameras observing the object. during this time some commercial jets crossed across the sky, as the object stayed in roughly the same area of sky moving from pace to place. I would have to guess altitude of 60,000+ feet considering we travelled 20 miles of highway where hundreds of behicals were pulled over looking up. We never figured out why anyone ever noticed it at first, but whatever the reason it eventially spaked hindreds of vehicals to pull over and look up for at least 1/2 to 1 hr (the time I estimate it took for that much trafic to decide to pull over). There obviuosly was no noise, and it definitely was not a balloon, as a balloon would drift in a common direction with the wind, and would not be visible for a stretch of highway 20 miles in length. It was not a common jet or airplane. I just dont undersand why it wasnt on the news or in the newspaper...I have never seen anything like this before. I cant emphasize enough how many cars were pulled over...it was truely amazing.", "A ball of light trvelling very fast, in a straight path, in a SSE direction. Reoccurance on 26th.  Same path and direction but seemed higher as the ball of light was smaller. Om both occasions there was no sound.", "30 Minute Encounter with Hovering Saucer 300 Yards AwayIn 1969, I was 5 years old and my family lived on a farm in rural Minnesota approximately 2 miles Northwest from New York Mills (population 750). My Family (Father, Mother, Older Brother 12, Myself 5, and my younger brother 2) was driving home on a rural dirt road to our farm house near dusk (i.e. somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00 at night in July). We were heading west down the dirt road that passes by our house when we saw a strange light emanating from behind our nearest neighbors house. The light was brilliant. As we drove nearer we asked each other &quot;when did our neighbor install a spot light in their yard?&quot;  We approached our neighbors house for about a mile and kept looking at the light, but did not understand why they had installed such a bright light in their yard. The road turns North directly in front of their house. As we headed North, my brother, mother, and I kept our eyes focused on the light and we determined the light was not coming from their yard, but instead was coming from a craft/UFO hovering behind their house. After traveling North for 200 yards North, we turned west again and all of us including my father could now see the saucer shaped craft hovering about 100 feet off the ground 100 yards behind the neighbors house.  The craft was a brilliant orange, metallic color and was 30-40 tall and 100-150 feet wide and it was the classical saucer shaped craft. We then turned into our driveway (North) and parked the car about 100 yards from the main road which left the craft hovering about 300 yards south from where we were parked.  We all got out of the car and focused our attention on the craft. It continued to hover there 100 feet above the hill in the neighbor&apos;s farm field. There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. The color was a brilliant fiery orange and it looked like there were windows on the upper half of the craft. The light from the craft appeared to have similar characteristics to heat rising from a hot road. We watched the craft from outside our house for about a minute and then went in the house because I believe our parents were worried for our safety. We went in the house and watched the craft hover above that hill for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes it descended and landed behind that hill. We could no longer see the craft , but there was a brilliant halo of light coming up from behind the hill. We watched the area for another 5 minutes and the craft ascended to about 100 feet above the hill again. It continued to hover there (300 yards south of our house) for another 15 minutes, but then flew away to the south and disappeared in the forest in a swampy area south of our farm. The encounter lasted for over 30 minutes and I still remember it vividly even though I was only 5 years old. After the craft left, my parents put us to bed and went to sleep themselves. My dad slept with loaded hunting rifle on their bed. My parents never reported the incident because they thought people would think they were nuts. There were other sightings in the area around that time and the people that made reports were labeled as ODD.  My parents never even talked with the neighbors about the encounter to see if they saw the craft which landed about 100 yards in back of their house.  My parents still live in that same town, so even 30 years later when we visit Minnesota, we talk about the event and drive past the site.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Normally I would cut across at AR 14 or take US 412 east to I-55, but decided to go north on Rt 67.  At 6:30 pm with the sun being down and with no &quot;light pollution&quot;, I decided that the drive might yield a look at the solar flare via the Northern Lights even at this southerly latitude.  I believe I did see the northern lights or some reflection of the solar flare off of the ice cap.  However I saw some very bright white clouds that appeared to change shape and brightness, unlike the northen lights which danced around these clouds did not change shape or move as rapidly as the northern lights.   The clouds whiteness intensified several times and could be easily masked by the lights in a town or a yard light on the farm.  I had observed several times a changing light(s) colored red, then green, then blue then an intense whitish-blue color.  This light and several others were very slow moving, but nonetheless moved and always disappeared when reaching the large Fertilzer barn facilities.", "Very bright object along busy highwayWe were traveling east on US 90 around New Iberia,LA Craft looked like a blump, bright yellow with white square lights along the side.I first spotted the craft very low along a tree line as it semmed to move out of sight behind the tree line. At that time I did not say anything about it thinking it was a very low flying plane/blump?. We traveled about five miles and the wife said why is that yellow plane flying so low as I turned to look I saw it again and then it was gone from sight as if it went behind the tree line again. I told her I had saw it a few miles backs and stopped on the road to get a better look but did not see it again.", "Six bright, white lights in apparent formation approached at high speed with military aircraft in vicinityWalking up the hill back to the house from our barn at 7:05 pm EST, Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2003, I was looking down at my feet in the deep snow (so I wouldn&apos;t trip), when I noticed a flash of light fill the sky, seeming to come from behind me.   When I whirled around, I was startled by the appearance of six bright light whites in two apparently separate triangular groups.  Each triagular group of three lights appeared to be the size of a folded postcard held at arms&apos; length. The lights appeared to be quite close to me in terms of distance - maybe 250 yards - and it was immediately apparent that they were moving toward me at high speed descending from an initial altitude of a couple of hundred feet.   There were only the six bright lights, quite small in size, with no structure discernable around them or between them.  The lights were not flashing, and were a constant white colour.  One other witness feels that there were some pink tinges associated with the lights.  Nevertheless the relative spacing between the lights remained absolutely constant in the 10-15 seconds that I observed them, as though they were rigidly connected.   The two triangular groups moved together, with no change in the spacing between them other than an apparent increase in size as the object(s) approached.  There was no sound either preceding or during the appearance of the lights. At the same moment that I first saw the lights, I noticed two aircraft flying one in front of the other well behind the lights and at a higher altitude.  I believe that the aircraft were military aircraft.   We do not live near a commercial airport, but we do see military planes (A-10&apos;s; F-16&apos;s) from time to time as we border military area Y-2 in New Hampshire. I noted the navigation lights and strobes on the two aircraft.  The planes were travelling from right to left of my field of visions, perpendicular to the apparent direction of travel of the lights which was more or less directy towards me.  The lights were not near the aircraft and it did not appear possible that the planes were the source of the light phenomenon.  The lights were much closer, at a lower altitude and moving in an entirely different direction than the planes.  The relative positions and movements of the planes and the lights, and the exact simultaneous extinguishing of the lights (see below) in my mind precludes flares as being the identification of the lights. As the lights approached from the southwest, and after 10-15 seconds of observing them all six lights disappeared at exactly the same moment, with no change in direction, no residue, nor sound of any kind.  They simply vanished at once while in motion towards me, as though someone turned off a light switch. The two aircraft made a wide, sweeping turn around our property and at some point about one minute later another two aircraft joined the &quot;pattern&quot; circling our property.   The planes remained circling overhead in a fairly tight turning pattern for well-over one hour (approximately 1 hour 20 minutes) at which time they flew off. This event was witnessed by three people who agree on the details of the event.", "Bright round yellow UFO spotted on 3 different occasionsThis is actually the third time I&apos;ve seen this UFO. I&apos;ve seen it twice before in the past couple months.  It was a bright, glowing, yellow, rounded shape (either circular or a sphere) travelling very quickly.  It was very large, way too big to be a plane.  If it weren&apos;t moving, you&apos;d think it was the moon at first.  The first two times I saw it, I was outside and it just appeared in the sky then quickly zoomed away out of sight.  The third time, I was inside looking out the window and saw it flying a little slower.  Also in this last sighting, the sky seemed to flash about 20 minutes later as though there was lightning (which there wasn&apos;t) but I could no longer see the UFO from my window. I don&apos;t know if the flash had anything to do with it or if it was the result of something else.  In all cases, it was always travelling a lot faster than any planes would.  The first time it happened, it was around 2am, the second time I think it was 11pm, and this last time it was 5am.", "FireballAt approx. 5 a.m. I got up to take the dogs out, while I was waiting on them I looked up in the sky to look at the stars. It was clear directly above and nearby my neighborhood. I could see the stars very clearly, and I happened to look west out over the ocean, which is approx 15 miles to the shoreline from where I live. I noticed an unusual bright light, that was different in appearance to the other stars in the sky. From the naked eye you could see a flickering to it around the center of the light source, which was very bright. I took the dogs in, and got my spotting telescope to get a better look at it. What I could see was a center mass, round, illuminated, very bright, white light. Around the center mass which appeared to be considerable in size, there was a radiating, almost slight flickering of reddish-orange light source going all the way around the center mass. I watched it for about 5 mins., then decided to call my wife out to take a look, and maybe give her opinion of what she thought it might be. I asked her to give her honest opinion, and she said she never seen anything like it. We watched it for awhile, and had to follow it just slightly with the telescope, as it had lateral movement to it. But basically it just hovered out over the ocean, above a fog bank. Now what was interesting was a plane (possibly private) was heading in it&apos;s direction only at an angle, like it was on its own flight path, with nothing to do with this light source. It seemed to be just heading out over the ocean, and didn&apos;t appear to be heading to this object. My wife noticed the object retreat further back over the ocean as if to avoid this plane. As the plane continued on it&apos;s way, the light source came back to it&apos;s original location and 5 minutes later just dissapeared. Gone in an instant. We discussed it about a half hour later, and both of us noticed, that when this plane was heading in the objects direction, only at an angle, the object retreated in such a manner, as to not bring attention to i! tself. It was very quick, very smooth and fluid (maybe 5-10 miles)in a blink of an eye. It was so smooth, almost like it was blending in with the sky, at the same time it dimmed it&apos;s lights ever so slight, that if you were&apos;nt paying attention, it wouldn&apos;t have even been noticed. Now I did witness this object two nights ago, however about 7 p.m in the eve. Same basic location, although a bit closer to shore. I went to my neighbors house and had him look at the object through the telescope, and asked him what he thought. He also was perplexed, and has never seen anything like it. All three of us went through all the logical explanations of what it could be, and all three of us came up with the same answer, this object was totally unique, and we could not explain what it might be. Now being a logical person, I called three news station to see if there we&apos;re any reports, and they did not receive any calls. I called Camp Pendelton Marine base which is just North of this sighting, they did not have any aircraft, or manuvers out on the ocean. I called Miramar Marine Corp airbase, located about 25 miles south and to the east of this sighting, they also had no aircraft, or manuvers going on in this area. Typically, this would&apos;nt have me reporting this to your agency, however This object was unlike anything I have seen in my life, I also have two other witnesses that feel the same way. Now, it very well could be explained away, as an aircraft, a star, a helicopter, or balloon by those who chosing to do so. All I know is this object was capable of very, very quick movement with angular flight paths. It also was unlike any light source I have ever seen, it was incredibly bright, and the radiating reddish-orange light that surrounded the object almost appeared to be on fire. Anyway, I saw what I saw, and if it appears to be something explainable that would be fine by me. I am concerned tho&apos; with Camp Pendelton to the north, and just north of that is San Onofre Nuclear power plant. I suppose this would be just coincid! ental, but it just seems odd. One last thing, Miramar said if something we&apos;re out there, they would&apos;ve picked it up on radar, however it was out there and they didn&apos;t catch it on radar.

Asked him what the black object that was not moving was and he said he did not know.  Had no binochulars to look at it with so we continued west on I-10.  Observed for another 10 miles or so when it became to dark to see it any longer, since I was looking over my shoulder to the east.  Object seemed large, around 500-1000 feet across and up &amp; down.  Had no shape to it, just looked like a blob.  I would estimate altitude between 5000-10000 feet.  It was probobly about 5-20 miles south of interstate.  It did go behind a mountain as was driving west but reimerged once I got past mountain, object never moved.

It was either the night of Nov. 18, 1978 or Nov. 27, 1978...the 18th was the day of the Jim Jones People&apos;s Temple killings and the 27th the day of the Mayor Moscone/Harvey Milk killings in SF. I had been listing to news of Jim Jones on the radio all week, then of the Moscone/Milk murders, so I am a little mixed up as to which night it was, but am pretty sure it was the 27th, because it was the 2nd huge event in a week. (The sighting was reported in the Ukiah Daily Journal on the front page the next day, after being reported by others). I was driving south on Hwy. 101 just south of town...1/2 mile, after dark listening to the radio. Then I noticed that the top of my windshield was lit up a little. I looked up and there was a cloud which seemed to glow. I pulled over to get a better look at it and noticed a hitchhiker up the road from me about 300&apos;. He was looking up too. I got out of the car and this huge cloud looked as if the moon was behind it, but the moon was behind the mountains to the south east and hadn&apos;t risen over them yet. As I watched, a sphere began to show inside the cloud. There was no sound at all. Then beams of light came out from it like a Star of David over Bethlehem. At first it seemed more like a religious experience. I felt this overwhelming feeling of awe. Then I looked into my car at my camera on the seat thinking that I should take pictures. But, amazingly i didn&apos;t. I have no idea why i didn&apos;t and after I thought to get the camera, I have no recollection of thinking about the camera again. The cloud seemed to clear and I could see this ball of light. Then the beams went back inside the sphere and the clouds went around it again and it moved west and back around the mountains. I was so amazed and jumped in the car to go home. I was thinking, &quot;Wait till I tell ((name deleted)) (my sister) about this. I also thought I would pick up the hitch hiker and ask him about what he saw. I don&apos;t remember driving past him or seeing him, or don&apos;t remember anything about the 5 minute drive home until I pulled up to my mailbox. I went into the house with NO memory of the saucer!!! I never called my sister about it. I didn&apos;t think of it or remember anything about it. I just turned on TV and that was that!  But, the next day when I got the paper, here was the story. Other people had seen the same thing. Then, when I saw that story I though, &quot;What? I saw something too, why didn&apos;t I remember that?&quot; I was dumbfounded! It took about an hour for me to get the details to come back to me. At first I just knew I saw the cloud with some shape and it took the hour for it all to come back. Then I couldn&apos;t believe I had forgot it and didn&apos;t pick up the hitchhikier, didn&apos;t take a photo and didn&apos;t call my sister and didn&apos;t even remember this...one of th emost amazing experiences of my life! So, they must have done something to block my memory. I have no idea if I lost any time either. I also saw a UFO when I was a little boy north of Buffalo in Niagara County, at night. Then my sister and neighbor saw it again over the woods the next day. But, the article may still be on file on microfilm at the Ukiah library or at the daily journal. I have seen photos of the same thing from Mexico City and Montreal.", "saucer seen with many witnessesi seriously saw a ufo or something. i was on my way home and there was something sitting in the air not moving about 15 minutes from my house. it had a green and red light on each side and two huge spotlights in the middle. it didn`t move it just sat in one place and it wasn`t really high up. there were people pulling off to the side of the road to stop and look, i just kept going. it looked like a saucer shape it was hard to make out. i have no clue what the hell it was. and about 10 minutes later i saw two helicopters headed back towards where i was at. i don`t know what it was but it wasn`t a plane or helicopter.", "We saw a large fireball in the sky below a ceiling of clouds.  We watched it move at a steady speed in a straight path across the sky,We saw a large fireball in the sky below a ceiling of clouds.  We were in a campground in the hills of Dansville.  At first we thought it was the fire from a hot air balloon as there was a Balloon festival that weekend.  However, the ball of fire was much larger than a balloons would be at the close distance, it was moving much faster than a balloon but not fast enough to be an aircraft; that was also a consideration beacuse there is also a small airport in the area.  We watched it move at a steady speed in a straight path across the sky, right to left,(Mars being on the right)and then it looked like it shrunk and dissapeared. We took 2 or three pictures on a disposable camera but as of yet have not had it developed.  I figure it won&apos;t look like much.  The next morning I called that area airport to make sure that any aircraft in the air at night should have the blinking lights (which he said yes) and to see if hot air balloons were allowed up at night (which he said no).  I then asked him if he had any reports of anyone seeing anything in the sky last night (which he said no).

I was giving him a ride home down Walton Ferry Rd heading due east. Walton Ferry runs down one side of a huge peninsula that ends at the lake. His home was at the end on a road going across to Sanders Ferry Rd. which runs parallel to Walton Ferry. We were roughly one mile from the end at the lake when he spoke up and said &#x5C;&quot;hey, do you see that?&#x5C;&quot;. I looked up and over the lake were five or six strange looking lights about half way to three quarters up in the horizon. They were in a straight line with the front light rotating to the end of the line about every 3 to 5 seconds. They were very bright and seemed to be hovering over the lake. I don&#x5C;&apos;t recall any colors, just white lights. Very bright white lights. Brighter than any aircraft we had ever seen. I slowly pulled the car over to the side of the road as did a couple of cars behind us who evidently saw what we did. The speed limit along this road is 45 and is heavily traveled. Neighborhoods all the way to the end. After about 30 seconds or so, the front light rotated to the rear and the then lead light literally shot up into the sky/space and the others followed. They moved at a speed that was literally unbelievable. We looked at each other, looked back at the people behind us, and all were like us with their mouths wide open and looks on their faces like what the heck was that?! We slowly pulled away from the side of the road and I proceeded on to his house. We must have been quite pale upon our arrival because his wife at the time even commented to the effect of &#x5C;&quot;what have ya&#x5C;&apos;ll been up to?&#x5C;&quot;.

However, all the other has to say is, &#x5C;&quot;do you remember&#x5C;&quot; and the other instantly knows what is meant. As a matter of refe! rence, I was watching the Rendleshon show on SciFi earlier, which prompted me to write this. The lights on the show, when over the farmers field bears a great resemblance to what we saw that night. The thing that amazes me the most is the fact that the time frame fits when we had our siteing. I can only imagine what was going on back 23 or so years ago. I can honestly say, this incident made us both believers. The speed would be the main deciding factor. There is nothing man-made on this planet that can manuever or go that fast.

It was a white light, though it may have flickered red, travelling in a straight line at a downward angle of 10&deg;.  I observed it for approximately 2-3 seconds, at which time it faded out. At 7:18 the same day I observed two more.  The first was heading straight down toward the horizon, and I observed it for several minutes.  It was similar in appearence as the one I sighted earlier, except that it did not fade out and definitely flickered beween white, green and red.  The second I saw for approximately 3 seconds, and was similar to the earlier sighting except that it faded out, then faded in, travelling on the same trajectory before finally disappearing.&quot;  My first instinct (when I saw the first object) was that it was a bit of space debris burning up in the atmosphere.  But the two objects I observed later did not quite fit : the one object faded out then in, and the other changed only in it&apos;s color, and I only lost sight of it as it went beneath the horizon. These objects were little more then points of lights - nothing spectacular, but as I say, it was out of the ordinary. (I object to the use of the word craft on this form - it should say object.  To call it a craft is to make the assumption that it is a manned transport of some kind, instead of being regarded as an Unknown, which is what it is.)", "They made no sound and were moving very fast, it seemed like they were chasing each other or playing a game...We were sitting in the hottub, my wife ,myself and her girlfriend.It was a perfectly clear winter night.

At that moment i was thinking &quot;wow ,cool a jet plane&quot;  Then the balls of light broke formation and started circling each other as they were streaking across the sky. Bam they were gone as fast as they came. Then a split second later 4 more right behind them , Bam gone. This all happened in a matter of 1 to 3 seconds.They made no sound and were moving very fast, it seemed like they were chasing each other or playing a game.

The video footage of this event of Jan 21,04 is astounding.  In freeze framing the video by way of milli seconds I have been able to see things which I could not see that night by my naked eyes. The computer enables me to not only freeze a milli second but to blow it up much larger to see just what it is or might be. There is a series of photos that I can only describe as the  fireball spliting up into many smaller balls of light all attached in a long rod like formation of 11 balls of various pastel colors of light and then it goes into a progression of from 11 balls of light to 10 to 8 to 4 to 2 to one the fireball shape. It does this a few times where it goes from a long rod of attached balls of light to a single fireball of light.  This is incredible and it happens so fast it could not be seen until the video was freeze framed.  In other photos is is obvious that the solid white interior of the fireball is moving very fast because it changes it position and angle continually. There is another unexplainable part of this footage that puzzels me. In the bottom of the screen there is a very small dancing ball of light that at first I dismissed because it was so small in comparison to the main fireball . This tiny ball of light moves from side to side and and then at the end of the video the main fireball seems to disappear and reappear at the bottom of the screen very small with the other very small ball of light. It seems to be communicating with that tiny ball of light. We could not see this tiny ball of light with the naked eye that night of the sighting.", "3 Black ovals in the sky and a floating movie cameraThis is NOT a UFO report.

After about two minutes it slowly took off east into the sky and then turned south. I couldn&apos;t see any supporting cables. Thats what made it really weird! And the black ovals were REALLY BLACK! The sharpest, clearest, brightest BLACK you have ever seen! The street it was hovering over was Vally Blvd and Garfield in Alhambra CA 91801. Of course there are no such things as UFO&apos;s.

It wasn&apos;t 1 minute later that he stated he definately saw this star moving around like I had.  I took the binoculars to have a better look and I noticed a hexigon formation of these stars right above our heads (high up but close enough to see fairly clearly) and although they looked like bright stars, they were moving around too.

On approximately August 17, 1971, I was attending a Union meeting at a local motel and was asked by the Union rep. if I and another worker would go across the river to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico and pick up a couple of bottles of liqour for the group. My friend and I left, crossed the border and approached a place where he said we could get the best prices. As we were pulling up to park, I noticed people on the street (women and children) looking up at the sky. When we alit from the car we both looked toward the West where everyone was looking and was startled to see 4 large round red circles hovering just above the horizon. It was approximately 18:30 hours and the sun was just starting to set, so there was still plenty of daylight. As we watched, I started looking in other directions and discovered another 5 of the same objects coming from the North (from the direction of Laredo, TX). They approached the other 4 slowly and then grouped together and then started to get smaller. They kept getting smaller until they completely diappeared. I don&apos;t know if they were moving away from us or if they just got smaller until they disappeared. Laredo Air Force Base was still there at the time and I thought of calling the base when we returned to Laredo, but then decided not to because I figured the lines would be jammed with calls.

She asked if they were birds, and when I saw them, my immediate reaction was &quot;Hell No!&quot; The two seperate lights caught up to each other, in a leap frog fashion, each crossing and catching up to the first. Both were evenly lit from below, and in the area we were in, could not have been lit from below. I listened as well, given the low cloud cover, and could not hear any sign of aircraft noise.

I have seen and videotaped everything from A-10&apos;s to F-14 and F-16 aircraft, as well as Stealth aircraft at near and far range. With the cloud cover, the noise should have been obvious as the sound would have been reflected by the clouds. There was no perceivble sound. Both points of light disappeared into a cloud bank and we saw nothing more after that.  I immediately started running through things in my head to make sure I had time and distance and direction. My girlfriend was freaked out that I was so freaked by the situation.  I also have experience in visually tracking satellites and other space based objects, and nothing I have experience with could explain what I saw. As mentioned, the two objects converged on each other and diverged at a fairly high rate of speed, and remained consistently lit.

I saw many buzzards flying about but what caught my attention was a cluster of bright circular objects much higher in the sky than the birds.These objects were circling each other in a whirlwind/tower pattern. Each followed its own course, but they all were circling and, as I was to soon find out, going upward.My wife came out of the house to talk with us and I asked her to take a look at them. She watched them with me until they slowly vanished in the atmosphere. The objects at the top of the &quot;tower&quot; began to disappear first followed by those at the bottom.They appeared to be bright white with a haze around them. I also noticed a refraction of some sort on the outside of that. Like bending light.At first I wanted to shrug them off as birds and leave it at that. But my wife urged me to look closer and really observe them. It was then that I knew they could not be birds. They were circling much to fast and I&apos;ve never seen birds shaped like orbs that disappeared into the atmosphere.Another thing we both noticed was that when they circled around on our side of the loop they were brighter and seemed to reflect the sun. When they were on the opposite side of the loop they were dull and faint. That would be the result of astetic distance because they were blued by the atmosphere.Several buzzards flew between us and the objects and it was even more obvious how high they were. Later, a jet flew by in the same area where the objects had been. The jet was very far away by the time it appeared to be the same size as the objects had appeared.These objects obviously traveled upward and not horizontal.We haven&apos;t seen them since.Unfortunately I was debating with myself as to what these objects were before I thought to retrieve the video camera. By then they had all vanished.I could draw a picture of how they appeared and email it to you, if you&apos;d like. Thank you.

The object seemed to be corrected in course by the beam, or some other unseen power source. (There was no visible beam of light or energy). This object descended at a 90 degree perpendicular angle over Granite Mountain in eastern San Diego County, and then made a slow calculated inclination to the west between North Peak Mountain and Pine Hills, and then disappeared into an early summer cloud bank.

I am an Air Force veteran, and have never seen or experienced anything like this. I and the other witness are both ex CDF fire fighters and know eastern San Diego County very well.

We was driveing down the road heading west went Accross ST RD 5 ,still heading west just before we got to a pond on the right side of the road, and just east of the next rd, whitch was N. 1000 E. There was a set of head lights in the distance ahead of us with what appeard to be brights on a car . that was when I turned my brights on ,well then I saw it had four sets of lights,I stopped the car as iot got closer I could see the side of the craft, the lights turned downward as it approched I then shut off the car ,no sound.at all from craft,as it stopped I could see every detail under the craft. I had on glasses that get dark in bright sun light they got dark, and I could see it all, THE craft was big , biger than 1 football field and at least 300 ft wide or more. The under side was a hazey green all the way up , there was a red round object in the middle that was going from red to dark red like a heart beat ,and the color was swirlling around in it. just above this there was lares of windows ,pipes, running to the front and to the back , and the hole lenght of the craft, there was what looked like people moveing in the windows of the craft. The rest of it was like a star wars movie, the thing had buildings all over the underside of the craft,there was on markings on underside that I could make out anywhere.My children,my wife was along they was horifided and was screaming to get out of hear. the craft started to move slow to the east side of the road ,then south , the craft had four red holes longgated at the back , and the craft was black , it was reflecting the stars on the side as well as lights from a ploe light by the pond .

I could not see anything defined and they looked as if they were 100-200 yards off my back deck (which is about 100 yards above the lake) and a couple of hundred yards above the lake (Soda Bay). They would continue to circle each other (approximately 40 yards apart) in a diametrical fashion (opposite each other). After approximately 15 minutes, one of the sphere&apos;s would start to advance closer to the other one (while still circling) until it met up with it. At that point, it appeared to join the other light and continue to make the same circle as one light. After approximately 10-15 minutes, one of the lights started to move away from the other one until it was opposite again. They would circle each other in this fashion for approximately 15 minutes and repeat this same process again. The whole incident lasted for over an hour. It should be noted that there was absolutely no sound during this observation and no indication they were search lights (no trail lights to the ground).((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the report is not inconsistent with a sighting of advertising lights, circling one another.

PD))", "Silent &quot;Airplanes&quot; at Low AltitudeTo set the background, Richmond is the city I grew up in, and I was familiar with the usual patterns of air traffic.  At the estimated date of the event (mid 1997), I was past 34.  Any oddities in air traffic would be apparent to me.  Though some would say that what I saw were conventional aircraft, and I admit that they may have been - though with some strange twists - I felt I&apos;d post this notice to benefit the doubt.  Having heard anecdotal accounts of apparent ET craft disguising themselves as conventional craft, I think thoroughness is appropriate. Earlier in the daylight hours, I&apos;d taken note of one or two large aircraft northbound over what I estimated to be western Richmond at unusually low altitude.  My vantage point was the vicinity of I-80 and the San Pablo Dam Road.  The aircraft resembled airliners or cargo transports...possibly C-17-like, but not grey as I recall.  It was my sense that there were more aircraft in general that day.  I e-mailed a friend in Monterey, Calif. to ask if he&apos;d seen any strange air traffic in his area, and he said he had increased activity as well. In the dark evening of what I recall to be the same day, from home (approx. 1 mile north of the previous vantage point and south of Hilltop Mall) I witnessed what visually appeared to be conventional airliners yet they were *absolutely silent*.  The aircraft came in a succession of three within a short period which I estimate at five minutes.  The aircraft appeared to descend from the west, and they moved eastward overhead at low altitude which I estimate at only two thousand feet.  At least one turned southward over the El Sobrante area and disappeared from view over the East Bay Hills (without a lot of clearance below).  In the many previous years I&apos;d seen only such craft as Cessnas and helicopters in this low airspace.  Never had I seen an airliner that low that far from the airport (Oakland is the nearest for things that size). As I mentioned above, the aircraft were silent.  I could hear the occasional car drive past the house, and I could hear the subtle distant rush of freeway traffic, yet no sound emanated from any of the aircraft which were closer than the freeway.  I was flabbergasted and listened intently as they approached and departed.  I was sure that even at low RPMs during a descent, I&apos;d hear something, but these things were as quiet as gliders!  I also should note that they had what appeared to be navigation lights, and the night sky was quite clear. I now live in Seattle, and air traffic southbound into Sea-Tac often merges over my part of the city.  They all make sound, some louder, some quieter, but none silent. What I saw in Richmond still mystifies me.((NUFORC Note:  We have received many reports of low-flying military transport a/c.  However, we do not know what the witness observed.

The object was a bright blue color and am not sure if the color was from the object or a rereflection off of the object.

Before I start my stories, I have to let you know that I haven&rsquo;t any even a bit of interest in astronomy when I was still a pupil, but before I recognized what I have seen, I began to pay attention to the dark sky for nearly 10 years. During these years, the curiousness to the universe was energy supporting my work. Well, you may have been out of patient. And I&rsquo;ll start my own stories about UFO . And there are graphs to illustrate what I say, if you are interested in them, please send Email to me and I&apos;ll send them to you. ((e-address deleted)))  1.When I was a child, about 8 years old (around 1988). It happened in an summer evening when my parents and me were outdoor for cool wind. I noticed that there was a &quot;argent balloon&quot; standing still in the high sky just above our boarding house. It was in the round shape and its side which toward the sun was argent. My parents and some neighbors noticed too. Then, we asked the man living in the top floor to have a look at what to the earth it was, but the man said that it was too high to see clearly.When it was dark, the &quot;balloon&quot; still standing here but changed into a very bright star-the brightest star in the sky that day.2.A unclouded morning in the winter when I was a pupil (around 1990). I got up as usual and when to the bath room to wash my face, then I detected through the windows there was a bright star in the sky. Contrasted against a tree outside the window and between the star and me, it was about waist of the tree. Because, in my memory, I haven&rsquo;t seen such bright star before, so I kept my eyes on it. About 15 minutes later (The sun shine was just available that moment), it has been moved up to the top of the tree. And in the next minute, all for a sudden, the bright light disappeared and there was a ball (at least I think it like a ball, because of the distance) floating in the sky (a little big than I saw in story 1, maybe it because of the different distance). And in the second minutes, there were something like glinting lights looked like the lights beneath airplane began glinting on the bottom of the ball. At first, one white light, than, one blue light, and two white lights, two blue lights. More and more lights glinted alternate, meanwhile, the ball began to movie faster and faster toward the East-directed to the Sun. Until it was out of my sight, there were approximate 3 seconds, then the ball reached a astonishing speed that was much more faster than any plane I have ever seen before.3.Years later(I&rsquo;m a student in junior high school ), one morning I got up at 6:00 and sat down on my desk to prepare for my final examination. A familiar scene-the brightest star standing around the moon. For it I haven been prepared a pair of telescope, but I can&rsquo;t see anything else but a bright ball. But I took notice of the distance of the star and the moon: fortunately, there was a smaller star beside the moon, and through the telescope the moon and the smaller star just like a background picture of the bright star-caused by distance. Obviously, the bright one was in the atmosphere. I kept observing it for about 5 minutes, during the time, it was quiescent. But 2 minutes later when I return to the window, it has been disappeared. I realized something and look toward the East-the Sun just rose up.4.Maybe the UFO will visit me in every certain years. I met it again when I was a senior high school student. Morning, after I got my school, I found every one in the school was looking in the sky. Then I discovered there was a huge &quot;earthen plate&quot; floating in the sky! I can&rsquo;t believe what I saw! It looked like a plate and there was a small circle on the central of the plate. Slowly, I move toward the shining Sun in the East, and in the end was covered by the Sun light. It was reported in the newspaper and some astronomer explain that it was formed by the ash from collision of two minor planets in the atmosphere. I&rsquo;m 21 and is an academician now. These usual experiences gave me spiritual energy to study science. And now, I want to share my stories with you. ((name deleted)) 2003.12.30  (wee hours)  2:20((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The other doul sets of lights appeared to be playing one set would dim out and another would dim on like someone turning up a dimmer switch. most of the lights were stationary there were a few moving around slowly.I even called McCarren airport trying to se if they were seeing anything i felt like a wacco after that call,I think they sure thought i was.It was around 4:30 when i first started watching them and they stayed for about an hour and ten minutes.it was lightly overcast and they light up the clouds above them.Than about 50 minutes into it a flight of jets comming out of Nellis were heading in there direction and turned slightly and headed into the bombing range.At about an hour and ten the lights started decending below the mountains.I could still see ! the glow over the mountains from their lights,and one by one like someone turning off light switches from left to right the went out.I waited around for about another 20 minutes or so and nothing more happened,so i headed on to Vegas.As I was coming over the hill into vegas i counted 19 ore fighters comming out of Nellis with their afterburners full throtle heading northwest.This seemed a little odd because Nellis doesnt do alot of night manouvers and even during the day you dont usually see as many as 19 jets taking off at the same time.", "comet in sky?looked almost like part of the moon at first, but in wrong part of sky.  then looked like a comet--with a bright light, followed by a tail.  disappeared.

They appeared to be farther away than the island, but I cant tell for sure because I never saw them go behind the island. They were barely above the water, and they frequently disappeared behind the swells, then reappeared a few seconds later. They only moved in one steady direction, and appeared to be going quite fast, if I had to estimate I would say around 60-70 mhp, although it was impossible to tell for sure because the distance from me was impossible to tell. They looked a lot like the type of like reflected by shiny metal. It was not putting out its own light, rather reflecting the sunlight. I couldnt tell the shape of the crafts because they were entirely covered by the bright reflection. If I was to estimate a size or shape, I would say not more than 3 feet across, apparantly as a sphere. As they traveled, the distance between the two lights appeared to remain EXACTLY the same, they didnt spread out or come closer together.

(Rancho Cordova is a suberb of Sac) he called to tell me he &amp; his wife &amp; two kids were watching a UFO as he spoke to me. I told him to go &amp; get his video camera and film it. He had his wife (Maria) go and get it and they began filming it. It was north of Sacramento area over the city of Auburn, Ca. It was simply hovering not moving and was a good mile or so above the Auburn foothills. During the time they watched it two smaller UFOs came &amp; docked with it and then left again. He was able to get the second smaller UFO on film as it left at a speed of hugh magnatute. It shot away so fast you almost miss it if you do not watch the film carefully. It turned colors at will but the camera did not capture the colors for some reason? After it had been there for approx 25 min or so it began shoting a beem of light or perhaps a lazer? down at my brothers home! the beam hit his neighbors roof then started torwards my brother and his two kids, when he told me that I told him to get them all inside and close the door and the curtains asap! Later that evening both my brother &amp; I began making calls to the TV stations etc. This was what was so amazing--- nobody had reported it or called anywhere to report it! It was as if it were able to match their demesions or brain waves in such a way so that only they four saw it! The city of Sacramento is hugh as well as dozens of surounding suberbs and smaller towns all around and yet no-one saw this ufo or reported it! My brother mailed me the VHS tape of it and after watching it three or four times I looked online for a ufo center to send it to. It was Peter Gershwens (sic--Gersten)) UFO site. He emailed me after receiving the tape and viewing it to say it was a lousy filming job that only showed two dots one leaving the other. No thanks for sending it in no other questions nothing! Just a complaint that my brother did a lousy job of filming t! he sight ing. I was so angry that I ignored Peters email and told my brother if he ever saw another to just ignor it and don&apos;t even bother filming it since nobody seems to care. I am only sending this email because of something that I noticed when listening to a couple of sightings you had on Art Bells program this evening. That is-- the fact that in some sightings only a handful of people can see the UFOs! The hugh sighting over Phonix AZ. only a few saw why? I belive they have a way of aligning the dimesionial area they are in with the areas or perhaps brain rythims of those who are allowed to watch? You may be able to contact the other Peters UFO sight and get a copy of this sighting as I sent the original to him.

Please-- Simply note my information rather then erasing it because if it does occur it will serve as a witness of the fact that the Lords word in the Holy Bible is real and accurite. There are two other prophecys to note between now &amp; 2006 first on July 5th of either 2004 or 2005 Terror such as the terror that occured on 911 will occur again, only it will be any type of terror attack on the US. And second the phophecy states &quot;missle 2004 N.Y.&quot; It does not say if the missle blows up or not only that New York state or City will have some sort of nuclear missle or perhaps dirty bomb missle attack attempted.

The fireball was falling at angle of approximately 5 degrees.  The object covered an arch of about 45 degrees from the first moment I saw the fireball to the last moment before it exploded. The object was not moving as fast as the typical meteor, because I had time to say look at that three times and then a moment to watch the last stages of its destruction.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

In 1970 right after I had graduated from high school I went to Carrolton Georgia to attend West Georgia Colledge.  I believe the name has changed to The University of West Georgia.  I entered at the end of 1970 and left in 1973.  The best I can remember was this event happened in 1971. At the time the student center had a small valley that seperated it from the gymnasium.  At the bottom of the small valley beside the student center was a small pond.  Almost every night that was nice there were always people sitting around the pond and the general area.  This night was a moonless night and the sky was very dark as it was somewhere around 9 to 11 PM.  Me and a friend were walking from my dorm room to go to the gym to lift weights and had just walked past the front of the student center when we noticed people looking up into the night sky. We were looking over the pond about half way up into the sky. As we looked up we saw 4 or 5 round objects each one had a different solid color.  I can&apos;t remember all the colors but one was solid blue and one was red.  They were close to each other and in a perfect horizontal line.  Although they appeared to be far away they were still about as big as the end of an eraser on a pencil.  All of a sudden they would jump out of line and do these eratic maneuvers and then get back in line.  The angles in which they moved were nothing a aircraft could do and they were doing these maneuvers as fast as the eyes could keep up with them.  We watched for what I estimate was about 30 minutes and left.  When we left the lights were still there and many people were still watching them. I would estimate 30 or more people were there.  The solid colors never changed and there were no blinking lights.  They didn&apos;t appear blurry at all but just circles with a particular solid color. I have no ideal what they were but I expected to hear something about it but the only thing I ever heard was another student there say it was swamp gas.  Well I just never bought that as this was a rural area and the night sky was as clear as you could ever expect.  Not one cloud was in the sky.  My dad had retired from the Navy and was in what they called MATS, which stood for Military Air Transports.  I grew up on Navel air stations in Norfolk Virginia Port Lyauty Morroco and Rota Spain and went to sleep with planes taking off all night long. I knew what planes in the sky looked like and had seen all kinds of conditions observing the sky.  In the 60&apos;s we had no TV over seas so we spent a lot of time outside at night. I can only imagine that at the time most colledge kids were considered dope smoking hippies and the relationship with this rural town was strained.  Maybe no one felt like reporting this to the police as they would not be taken serious, who knows?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I woke up at 3:45 am to go to work and went out side to retrive my sneakers and a funny feeling came over me to look up at the sky so I did and when I did I seen the strangest thing that I have ever seen in my life. It was a giant sphere object that was blue in color and had these whiteish transparent humanoid things swarming inside the object. I just froze with a chill though out my body. After snapping out of it I went inside to wake my friend she came outside looked up and froze because their was a two more objects the first one was the same the other and the third was white with a rainbow of diffrent colors. We were both trans fixed on them. Also had time loss. l lived near the ocean . Checked out the objects no projections or clouds or gases called the radio station and had another report of the same sighting from another person was going to report it to the police but they would not belive us. As far as calling the Air Force they would tell us it was some sort of weather ballon. So thats why we called the Radio station. Who do you go to for help in knowing what these are.

So I told two coworkers about the objects that I have seen. they told me they have seen the same objects but from a far distance accelerating at very high speed going up ward. To this day I&apos;ll never forget what I have seen I remember it like it happen yesterday and I now know we are not alone in the universe . You have to ask yourself what you belive in like what is god is god human?  Or is god of extraerrestrial origin. Are we the only life forms in the whole galaxies because we don&apos;t know where the universe begins or where it ends.

No outside lights other than farm security lights were in the area and none were very bright. There was a full moon. For about one hour prior to this observation we had been watching a red light in the sky SE of our location go up and down in an acrobatic fashion, diving and climbing rapidly and performing turning motions. That light was in the general direction of Connersville, Indiana. The diamond shaped craft approached from the SW. Our conclusion as to the shape was based on lights on four &quot;corners&quot; of the craft. There were several lights and they appeared to be on the ends of the &quot;wings&quot; but they were not bright enough to illuminate the craft or  the &quot;wings&quot; Most were white but none were flashing strobe lights. The craft flew almost directly over our location at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet. What struck us was the lack of any engine noise. It was absolutely silent.We did not hear its approach and it made no noise as it passed over us. It flew to the NE generally in the direction of Richmond, Indiana or slightly to the west of that city. It was visible for about one minute. Our conclusion was that it was a military aircraft because of our relative proximity to Dayton, Ohio and Wright Patterson Air Force base.Our host told us that he had seen similar objects in the night sky many times before.

For some reason, I happened to look up slightly when I looked left and saw a triangular shape in the sky slightly above the tree top and maybe a one block distance from where I was.  The object was dark grey in color, no lights at all and was hovering motionless in the sky tilted slightly so that one point was lower than the other two, as if it were looking at something on the ground. It was the size of a private plane if the plane was in the same spot. I was sitting in my car so I rolled down the drivers side window because I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing.  The object never moved or made a sound the 5 plus minutes I sat there looking at it.  It&apos;s like my eyes were seeing this object but my brain wasn&apos;t registering what I was seeing.  I went down to gas up the car and on my way back I was searching the same part of the sky that I had seen the object.  I was only gone for 5 or 6 minutes but the thing was gone.  I sat in my car at the end of my street searching the sky in that area and did not see it anymore.  I drove down my street, parked the car and stood out in front of my house and didn&apos;t see anything else.  I was terrified because I usually go out in the very early morning hours and if I didn&apos;t look in that particular part of the sky that early morning I would not have seen it.  The color difference between the night sky and the craft was slight, and you would have had to look directly at it to see it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I noticed the stars were out (it was cloudy earlier) and very visible- Among them I could clearly see a spherical shape- not just a starlike point of light, maybe at most three times bigger than the stars around it- softly glowing a honey color. It was almost at the zenith, but just in front of us. It seemed to hover, but it was moving amongst the constellations, so that ruled out it being a star or planet.After about 10 or so minutes (it felt like a very long time) during which the object had drifted off to the side (I watched it) the road became more winding and trees obscured my view.I was wearing glasses, so my vision was 20/20. My roommate was driving, so she couldn&apos;t have seen it (looked up).", "I was shopping in the Crossroads Shopping Center in Fairlax County on Route 7 (between Alexandria and Falls Church). I saw an object with flashing green and red lights and white strobe lights hovering and then circling over the intersection of Columbia Pike and Route 7. I retrieved my 10 X 50 binoculars from the trunk of my car and tried to discern what the shape of the object was. All I could see was a string of red and green flashing lights and 3-4 white strobe lights. This object gradually moved to the SW and I saw a number of flashing &quot;fireflies&quot; that were green in color detach from the object and fly in various directions. After the object disappeared to the SW I saw several lights from some light aircraft flying in the vicinity of where the object had been hovering. The object emittted a sound like a radial aircraft engine. I saw and heard a similar object flying in circles over my home immediately after September 11, 2001.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "People followed and watched by objects in Niles, OhioI spoke with 38 year old Jamie M.(name withheld on file) from Niles, Ohio.  Niles is a subburb of Youngstown, Ohio. Jamie is a legal secretary by profession and single. On Novemeber 14th, 2003 between 5:30-6:45 pm Jamie took one of her dogs for a walk.  This is rountine for her every day after work.  She has two dogs and walks one at a time.  She takes a path down from her home to Lincoln Elementary School.  There is a small wooded area in a field that is off to the side of the school.  Its about a 10 minute walk.On this day she happened to notice two lights in the sky above the trees.  She described the lights as grayish-blue in color.  One was round and one was more oblong in shape.  When asked if she thought these were just lights or if they could be solid objects, Jamie expressed she felt these were &quot;objects&quot; rather then lights.  She first thought they may be search lights or spot lights or even planes but then noticed they did not have a beam from which light could radiate nor were there any sounds of engines.  The shape of these objects could be seen though the thin clouds.At first Jamie stopped and watched as these objects would come close together and then move away from each other.  She felt as if they may of been playing tag. At one point she thought they were going to crash into each other.  I asked if there were military planes in the area on a regular basisthat  did maneuvers?  She said that,yes, there were but she knew what they looked like and could hear the sounds of the engines.  The color of the plane lights were also totally different from what she saw.  She said that she finally stopped watching the objects and began to walk her dog.She immediately noticed that the objects began to slowly follow along about 30 feet away and about 50 feet above the tree line and behind the clouds.  As she walked they kept pace.  She got to the end of her walk and came back with the objects still keeping up with her.  She did not mention how the objects turned to follow her back.When Jamie got to the house the objects seemed to &quot;park&quot; themselves above a weeping willow tree in the side of her yard.  This tree is about 40 feet from the house and about 60 feet tall. The objects hovered about 50 feet above the tree.  Jamie said she ran into the house and began crying.  When she explained to her family what had just taken place, all 5 members of her family went out and looked up at the objects still hovering above the willow.  Jamie explained these objects were there before she went out and was gone by 8 pm so she speculates they had to to be there for at least two and half hours.Jamie went on to state that she and her parents decided to walk the second dog to see what would happen.  As soon as they stepped out the objects took up postion above the tree line once more and began to follow along.  The pattern was repeated.Note: There was no adverse reaction from the dogs.Once back to the house the lights again took up &quot;sentry&quot; watch over the willow tree.  By now the parents were also frightened and they called the Niles City Police to report what was going on.  The dispatcher said they would send an officer out to investigate but no one ever showed up. Jamie said her father did ask if spot lights were being used in the area where they lived and the repsonse was &quot;not to our knowledge.&quot; Family members would ocasionally check to see if lights were still over the willow. At this point Jamie says she went to the National UFO Reporting Center website and began to send in the report while the objects still hovered over the tree.  No one saw the objects leave the area.Five days later on Novemever 19th around 7:30 pm, Jamie was getting ready to walk her dogs.  When she went outside the one round grayish-blue object was back.  Jamie and her mother walked the dog.  They took the same path but this time went to the left side of the school and back around to see if the object would follow. The object kept pace even going around the building with them.  By now there was no tree line so the object stayed behind the clouds.  Jamie stated the object would jump from one cloud to the next without coming into open space in the sky as if it wanted to stay concealed.This time Jamie called the news room of the Tribune Chronicle in Warren, Ohio. The gentleman who answered asked about the object in ths sky and said he would check witht he weatherman to see if anything unusual was going on with the weather.  He did not call back. Comments: Jamie sounded to be a credible witness and while speaking to me by phone she would ask her parents who were in the background several questions.  I could hear their respones to the questions.  We have multible witnesses to these sightings.  No one could supply an answer to what the objects/lights could have been.  The dispatcher stated no spot lights were being used at the time.  Military aircarft exercises could be ruled out for the fact that these objects stood staionary for long periods of time and seemed to leave their positions over the trees to follow witnesses. Even if it was search lights or spot lights, I do not believe they would have hovered for long periods of time.Additional notes: I called Jamie&apos;s residence again on December 20th to find out if the relative at the airport would speak to me.This time Jamie&apos;s mother answered the phone.  She said that her brother who works at the airport did not have addtional information pertinent to the case.  She also expressed how frighted her and the family were during the time the objects were present.  She stated that she and Jamie both felt that they were being &quot;watched&quot; by these objects.  She went on to say that Jamie stated to her that the hair on the back of her neck stood up as they walked the dogs as if someone was staring at them from behind. Jamie&apos;s mother also stated that Jamie had forgot to tell me that when Jamie went to the bathroom window to look out, one of the objects seemed to sense her presence and moved quickly to an evergreen tree about 20 feet from the bathroom window and hovered there about 50 feet above that tree. She says that Jamie got the distinct impression the light was trying to see into the room.I called the Niles City Police Dept. and asked about an incoming call made on the date in question.  I was told that no call was placed to the staion on that date about lights in the area.  I find it strange that the call was not on file.  The officer I spoke to was very dismissive of my call and acted like he did not have time to talk to me.

I was a Security Specialist standing guard at the &quot;Alert Aircraft Re-fueling Area&quot; (referred to as Post 6). I was walking behind the blast shields waiting for a &quot;flight exercise&quot; which is pulled off at least once per shift by the Flight Sgt. or an appointed member of our flight. These are expected as a regular training exercise to keep us on our toes. When  I noticed several fireballs going across the sky from North to South. They came across at farely regular intervals and appeared to be ashing off as they passed, but never faded out they just flew out of sight. I called it out over the radio to the desk, they said they would check it out, and then said they had just heard other reports of the same kind on police scanners and from other posts, but would get back to me. Later that shift the Armed Response Team came out to my post with the Flight Sgt. They told me that a notation would be made in the &quot;Blotter&quot; but as the official word would report, that &quot;I did not see anything...&quot; Well I let it go at that because I was a good soldier that didn&apos;t know how I might be treated if I carried it out any futher.

Suddenly, the radio signal was reduced to an annoying &quot;buzzing/humming&quot; noise.  I tried cranking the dial up and down on both AM and FM but to no avail.  While I was trying to acquire a signal, I began hearing a &quot;whirring&quot; noise in the ambient background.  Unable to find a radio station after several minutes, I gave up and turned my radio off--strangely enough, the digital numbers on my clock still worked and the minutes seemed to pass in a normal time-frame.  Once I had turned the radio off, the &quot;whirring&quot; sound became more prevelant.  As soon as I consciously thought about the &quot;whirring&quot; sound, I suffered migraine-like pain in my head.As I lay there massaging my temples I suddenly felt a sensation of absolute and total primal fear.  I wish I could describe it better but essentially, the part of my brain that warned my ancestors that they were about to be eaten by a saber-toothed cat fired off at full strength!  I knew that if I moved or turned on my lamp that something &quot;bad&quot; was going to happen to me--I&apos;ve never been that afraid in my life.Maybe three minutes after the migraine ensued, I heard high-performance (military) turbines speeding through the sky at what I estimate to be less than 1,000 feet ASL.  As soon as the jets - I distinctly heard two aircraft - came over the town, the noise, the feeling of dread and the pain ceased immediately.  For the next few minutes, I heard the jets perform a hard climb and then all was silent.I am new to the area I live in and I don&apos;t know my neighbors, so I was reluctant to ask strangers about any experiences they may have had that night.

We saw an object that at first looked like a plane.  But, the lights on this object were NOT blinking on and off.  Instead, they were pulsating in different colors of green, red, and yellow.  There were three or four solid round color patterns of green, red, and yellow that seemed to pulsate as they traveled around the craft in a circle while it flew from south to north.

I should note here, before I discuss the details of the sighting, that there are several important contextual factors that should not go unmentioned. First of all, I am an amateur astonomer. Several thousand hours spent watching the sky have yieled but a single event, an anomoly if you will. The implications of this are open to debate; however, I think these particular noctunal habits strongly suggest the presence of a logical way of observing natural and unnatural (artificial) phenomena. Secondly, I have had cognitive testing performed by a praticing psychologist, and the test results indicated a very high perceptual score. Apparently this psychologist has not seen such a score over the years, save for a &quot;few&quot; other examples. With these factors in mind, hopefully my report will be given serious consideration. As indicated above, this event took place sometime around 1992 or &apos;93. The month was probably July, but it may have been late June or early August as well. I recall it was a clear, moonless (new moon, moon set early, or late rising) night, well after midnight, but not yet near twilight. A light breeze could  be heard in the pine and spruce trees. I was alone but with one other person, and we were sitting so that we faced, by chance, westward. My gaze, at one crucial moment, happened to be fixed on the cloudless sky some twenty degrees above the horizion. Very abruptly, as if someone had flipped on a switch, a luminous orange half-disk appeared directly in my line of sight. The half-disk moved parrallel to the horizion, from my right to my left, silent (as far as I could discern) all the while. After but a few seconds, it faded out, and I was to never see it again. I can recall other specifics related to this &quot;object&quot;: it was of a luminous, dull orange color (my impression then ,as now, is that it was self-luminous); it displayed sharp borders all around and seemed quite solid in its makeup ; the flat section was actually slightly concave, thus it wasn&apos;t quite a half-disk; it appeared to travel with the aformentioned side in front; it left no trail or train that I could observe; it&apos;s apparent size was about 150% of the moon near first-quarter. It is interesting to note that orange half-moons as well as disks are not unknown in UFO literature, however the precise characteristics seem to vary from sighting to sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

Needless to say I was a crazy Lady running up the walk and so was my poodle! My dog was whimpering pretty loudly she too was very frightened. When I ran in the house very scared I was telling my parents what I had saw needless to say by the time they looked out the window it was gone. For many years I have thought about this incident and thought maybe I was seeing things but then I said &quot;I really did see something and it was something that I will NEVER FORGET. I am now 42 years old and still will not sleep by myself or sleep in the dark ever again. I found it very hard to believe that none of the neighbors saw this UFO because it was so huge. I thought was it only meant for me to see and if so why? Discovering this website was the conclusion to what I saw was real. I recently discovered that someone else from Whitman Ma. also saw something just like I did. I just read about his sighting on 12/28/03. I have been waiting for this moment for a long time. I wish I had his email address or phone number so that we could compare what we each saw.

The city of Marion has about the population described, and the largest city nearby, Cedar Rapids, is actually not as far away as described and as small. Cedar Rapids borders Marion and the whole metro area of Cedar Rapids/Marion/Hiawatha has around 200,000 people. The aerospace center mentioned is Rockwell Collins, which builds radio and other equipment for military and civilian aviation is in Cedar Rapids, within 2 miles of the Marion border. The nuclear power plant mentioned is Duane Arnold Energy Center is in Palo, within 6 miles of Cedar Rapids northwestern border. So it is not as nearly far away as described by the person who posted about the flashing lights, and by the way is the only nuclear power plant in Iowa and does carry a lot of importance because of this.", "I was 13 at the time and had a great interest in aviation,and still do with 32 yrs under my belt with USAirways.I was walking home and saw two bright orbs in the sky behind the house over the trees. This is looking in the southeast direction.The orbs were not close and I would say they were at a distance of a few miles. They were very bright and stationary in the sky seperated but close. I called my mother and also our neighbor who was a high school science teacher.We all saw these bright orbs and the science teacher had no clue as to what they were.After awhile they started to move away from each other in opposite directions. One moved very slowly while the other was gone in a few secs. The teacher could not explaine what we had seen. He had 5 yrs of college under his belt in many sciences to be a teacher and had no clue. I might add at this point that the orbs were in the direction of the location of a US Navy Atomic Sub training site at West Milton NY. It was run by G.E.and had atomic ractors on this site to train navy crews for the subs. G.E. also tested ractors their. Admiral Richover father of our Nuclear Navy was always their. The site is still used today for the same purpose and is a secret base. I can`t be sure the orbs were over the site but it came to mind and was in the gereral direction. What was strange is what happened latter. I was in our home when we heard jets flying very low over our area. I ran outside and thier were jets flying low in sort of a search pattern. They flew over the house and i could see that they had streight wings not swept back wings. It was very odd and no orbs were seen at this time. The next few nights the same thing happened the. Low flying jets flying like they were looking for something. Again we saw no more orbs just the jets. As I said I have had a very strong passion for aircraft and this whole thing got me thinking and wondering. I was taken to an air force base open house at Griffiss AFB in Rome NY a while latter. It was about 65 miles Sout! hwest of Broadalbin.While their I saw RB-57`s which were based at the R&amp;D center at the base to do research in radars and electronic equipment. they have streight wings. Also there were T-33`s and F-89 Scorpians. All straight winged jets. I started thinking that some of these aircraft were the ones i saw those nights,but what they were doing or looking for is a mystary. They were not the orbs because jets don`t hang in the air motionless for ten mins. The orbs were not helos either because back then in the early 60`s there were none to be seen in upstate NY. Now we see them everyday but in the early 60`s helocopters were just not seen in the Albany Saratoga region.Ever since that sighting I have had not just a love for aircraft but started my interest in UFO`s.I know aircraft and those orbs were not aircraft as we know them and I think the Air Force was chaseing them those nights. I soloed in only 7 hrs back in 69 and as I said worked around all types of aircraft. When something strange landed at ALB people would ask me what the aircraft was.I always knew.I also worked on the flight line for 20 yrs on the night shift so I know what aircraft lites look like at night. Those orbs again were no aircraft. I have done aerobatics recently in WW-II AT-6`s and I bring up this point only because scientist like Seth Shostac saw there is no evidence. I say people like myself that have been in aviation know more about what is seen in the air to be an aircraft or an unknown. A pilot flying a 747 that sees something odd is not crasy.They don`t put crasy people in charge of airliners. When they speak up its to be heard not to be passed off. I have an example that will prove my point. I told this to Seth in an E-mail to prove that pilots say what they see as the truth. This is a true story and you might wantto bring this up on C.to C.  Its a true story. Back at Murak Dry Lake know Edward AFB in the 40`s the air force was testing the P-39 AeroComet. Our first jet aircraft. Above top secret. the plane had a fake prop put o! n it while on the ground so everyone would think that it was a propeller driven aircraft. The test pilot of the Bell AeroComet loved to play jokes so he would put a Gorilla Head on and a Top hat on this head and he would be flying this aircraft. He was seen close up in the air by other pilots flying the P-51 Mustang which was the top of the line fighter at that time. when they landed they would tell of seeing a aircraft with no propeller and being flown by a Gorilla in a Top Hat. The pilots discribed exactly what thet had seen but were not believed and sent to sick bay. This happened time and again with the same results. Its sort of proves a point that what a pilot sees and is brave enough to tell about should be taken as evidence and proof.They are up in the sky everyday and know when they see a flying object if its real or not. Just like myself. I know a star from a landing light on a plane. ((name deleted)) in Halfmoon NY   e-mail  ((e-mail address deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was close to 9:00 pm and the sky was dark.  There had been no cars on the road as it was a cold winter night.  There were two lights ahead of us.  At first I thought they belonged to an oncoming car.  They were bright white-yellow and looked like car headlights.  What was unusual was that they did not appear to be moving, and the closer we got to them I realized they were not on the ground, but in the sky, not high in the sky.  They just hung there.  We talked about them, trying to figure out what they were.  They didn&rsquo;t look like airplane lights; they were too close together, too big, and too low.  We tried to make them be helicopter lights (because they hovered in the air), but there was no tail light and nothing to indicate propellers anywhere around them.  All we could see were the lights.  As the road curved around to the right, the hovering lights were now closer on our right, and  I could see a third light under the brighter &quot;headlights,&quot; it was dimmer in intensity, but also white-yellow.  They hovered just about the tree tops, and we seemed quite close to them, but it was harder to see them clearly because tree branches were in the way.  I asked my husband to roll down his window to see if we could hear any noise.  He was trying to drive and look at the same time, and couldn&rsquo;t get the window down fast enough for me - I rolled down my window, but I was on the wrong side of the car to get a clear view.  He stopped the car in the road, and I jumped out, and then I could really see.  There was no noise at all, which seemed very strange, no motor noise at all.  My husband pulled the car into a nearby driveway, leaving me in the road.  The area is rather rural and there were no street lights, no neighborhood house lights.  These lights hung in the air just above the tree tops.  I could see the underbelly of the craft as it was reflecting the lights.  It was metal colored and seamless with no  rivet spots where two sheets of metal were joined.  It appeared to be curved, but where the light reflection stopped, I couldn&rsquo;t make out any overall shape.  I couldn&rsquo;t see any wing tips or top or end.  I had the impressi! on it wa s bigger than our car.  As I was watching, it slowly began to move off to the left, above the tree tops.  I ran back to the car and got in, but the lights had moved away and then became hidden in the tree branches and I couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore.  I thought the lights may have been on the front and the rest of the body was  obscuring our view as it moved away from us.", "it was about 8:30 9pm or so I was catfishing at LakedownyPark off high way 50 and Dean road just east of downtown orlando.I had a feeling something was watching me for about 5 mins I kept looking around me and saw nothing.On the dock I was on itwas very very dark and the full moon made things ok seeing wize.I heard foot steps in the woods/marsh on the side of lake near the dock i was fishing from when I saw a ripple in water near the shore from were the sound was comeing from.Then i saw 2 stork like leggs and head watching me it looked right at me.I then was like...um very scared then when I yelled &apos;HEY&quot; It stood up like a man my size or so and stared me dead in eyes I went to run but when I did so off dock it walked with head still pointing towerds mine it walked with a slow pace towerd end of dock to trap me....it dident wana hurt me now i know becouse if so it could have.Dureing this time i was on the phone with 911 and they told me to stay put and the police were comeing.....From that  night witch was last i cant sleep that face and sit.

At about 2 hours into the trip, we were driving eastbound along Interstate Hwy 40 through Ludlow... just above the Twenty-Nine Palms Marine Base.  Around 03:06am, Our attention was drawn to a &quot;VERY BRIGHT, single amber colored Object&quot; (Pic#1)off to our left. I was amazed on the Brightness of this object, It was about a half a mile away at about 2 to 3 thousand feet. I quickly snapped a digital photo with a Sony 3.5mp digital cam but the flash went off, so my wife appears on the photo as a negative refection off the passenger window. What is surprising is even with the flash going off... you can still see the Brightness it had. So after that mistake, I quickly turned off the flash and took another about 10 to 13 seconds later... and what was once one object... appears to have split into two separate objects... (pic#2) What I had seen soon after was it disappearing at a 35 degree angle towards the north. We were not alone on the hwy... there was a truck who I KNOW saw it because he swerved like I did when the object appeared.

No parachute, no smoke trail... and I never seen anything take off at a 35 degree angle at a speed from a dead stop.  So I have enclosed five Pics for evidence and my word as it Happened!

They thought it was a remote control airplane at first, then it got closer and was an oval/diamond shape.  They tried to &quot;catch&quot; it and it began to change shape and size. It was at times less than 8 inches in diameter and grew to be larger than a car before it instantaneously took off.  On 1-25-04, last Friday morning, it reappeared with two other craft. One was what they called &quot;christmas tree shaped&quot; and it had a bright yellow/white light beam the others did not have.The other was cigar shaped like a plane and had a tail like a plane, but no wings. The three crafts seemed to play with the children and were circling each other.  The children got on the school bus and while discussing it, they said another child overheard and began describing the same thing saying he saw it a few streets over. I have had experiences myself, so has my mother and I kept this from the children.  Until they described the &quot;mini ufos&quot;  I had never heard of this, however my research on the internet backs up what they have told me. These are smart girls that are not prone to making things up. The younger had also had a dream that Thursday night about an &quot;alien&quot; in a ship and that it had a &quot;tube&quot; connecting to her for what she says is &quot;reading her mind&quot;.  But she says that was just a dream and is very clear in making that distinction.  I have heard strange sounds around the house lately and the dogs have been very disturbed.

My first sighting was as I was entering the outskirts of Circleville, OH. I noticed three fire colored (bright orange)lights, in a straight line, that went out back to front. My first thought was it was some tower or plane going through cloud cover. As I watched the area the lights came back on in a different place, stayed on for 5 to 6 seconds, and then went back out. I couldn&apos;t tell how many there were after the first three. I estimate 3-6. They continued this routine, come on, go out, change places, come back on, for approximately 7 to 8 minutes. I don&apos;t know if they stopped the routine, I watched until I couldn&apos;t see them anymore. Another thing, I don&apos;t know if this has anything to do with the lights, but there were also three small points of light that I thought were airplanes at a distance, but they made a triangle around the orange lights. From debth perception, I know the two aren&apos;t physically connected though.

I am desperately seeking a logical explanation for what my husband and I saw, so I am trying all avenues. My husband and I were sitting on the lanai around 7:00pm Hawaiian time on Monday, January 5, 2004. On our visits to Maui we spend a good amount of time out there watching whales, sunrises, sunsets, stars, planes etc. It was our last hour before we had to go to the airport for our trip back to the East Coast of the US. The sun had been down for a good amount of time and venus shone very brightly. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright light that I initially assumed was a plane....but it was glowing bright orange. I am horrified of flying, so I thought that maybe the plane was on fire or had exploded, but we hadn&apos;t heard any noise. I pointed it out to my husband whose reaction was &quot;that&apos;s not right.&quot;  We continued to watch it for about ten minutes, I even had time to go into the condo, unpack my camera, change lenses, come back out and take a couple pictures. Unfortunately, I had had my camera set for a long exposure, so the pictures aren&apos;t any good....convenient, I know. So anyway, it continued a path directly in front of our condo, it didn&apos;t seem to be at a very high altitude. Here is why I am having trouble finding a logical explanation:  It travelled very slowly, it was a constant glowing orange color in an orb shape, it maintained altitude and eventually made a slight ascent, and it made absolutely no noise. I cannot wrap my brain around it. It could not have been something on fire like a plane or something burning up upon reentering the atmosphere because wouldn&apos;t that have moved in a downward motion, moved faster, had a comet-like tail, had debris breaking off, changed in color or made some type of noise? I also do not believe that it could have been wind shear and sun reflection. The sun had been down for too long, the object was not that high in the sky, there was no slight variations in ! color li ke a reflection, and the angle of the reflection would be impossible. Any other expanation, I would welcome with open arms!", "Large Rectangular Craft  with lights on its corners. VERY loud, VERY slow.My dad, my friend, and I were fishing on the beach late at night. For almost an hour, I had noticed a large, dull orb of light across the lake at approximately tree-top level from the perspective of where we were standing. It had the brightness of a street lamp, but just looked strange to me.To my surprise, the object rose straight up, appeared to pause, then slowly started to move toward us, across the lake. As it approached, we could hear a distant whistling sound, followed by a whirring engine sound, then a faint low rumble.As it came even closer, we noticed that it was actually a dark rectangle with a  colored light at each corner. I recall seeing at least one red light, and a green light.It moved VERY slowly, and was not more than 100-150 ft overhead. It was VERY loud, also. There were many houses just behind us, but we didn&apos;t see anyone come out to look, which has always baffled us.My dad had previously been in the Air Force, and he noticed what he called &quot;super-structure&quot; underneath the craft. He described seeing &apos;girders&apos; underneath the craft, as well. He said that it was moving too slowly to make that much noise.The craft moved directly over our heads, and disappeared behind some trees. As a strange addendum, when we got back to the cottage, we told my mom, and she came outside. We immediately saw the same craft (I assume) in the sky, much higher up, with no sound audible this time.Even stranger, the very next year, we stayed at a different cottage on the same lake, and I was half-expecting to see the object again. I had a different friend with me this time, and early in the AM of July 4th (Exactly one year later), we were sleeping, and I was awakened by my dog&apos;s whining. I heard the same faint whistling and whirring sounds outside, woke everyone up, and I was actually shouting &quot;It&apos;s here!!&quot; We went outside to find the same type of craft moving overhead, a bit higher up than the previous year.

At first I thought it was Mars, but quickly realized it was much to far East.  As I watched the object, it began moving slowly north.  I asked my wife for our binoculars (7x35).  When she returned, I steadied myself on our van to get as good a look as possible. Through the binoculars the object still seemed planet (Mars) sized and a very bright orange.

I looked at them briefly and assumed they were weather balloons and turned away.  A split second later my friend screamed at me and said   &quot;oh my god, one of them just exploded&quot;, to which I turned back and saw that the second cigar shaped object hovering at the lower altitude had turned bright red and began to fall from the sky towards the mountain range.  About half way through the fall object number two disappeared.  After that I saw object number 1 which was also white/gray in color turn a bright red and lower itself in altitude so it was only slightly hovering over the mountain range.  At this point I determined this was neither an airplane or a weather balloon. By this time we were back in the car driving east on the I40.  I then saw object number one fly lateral with the mountain range across an incredible amount of distance at an amazing speed.  I estimate that it moved across 75 degrees of mountain range in roughly 5-10 seconds.  The cigar shaped object appeared to be approximately 1/10-1/20 the diameter of the moon.  It then disappeared when it hit the end of the mountain range and we were all in shock in the car.  We then drove for about 5 more minutes when we looked back at the end of mountain range and saw 6 bright red cigar shaped objects appear in a circular fashion for about 3-5 seconds and then disappear.  We never saw anything after that.  It was an extemely desolate area and I believe we were the only ones on the road.  We took pictures hanging out from the car but I am not sure if they came out.  They are currently being developed.", "Bright light followed our car in fog; happened near Hadrian&apos;s wall in England, Christmas of 98&apos;.During some time off during Christmas, two friends of mine and I rented a car to drive to Edinburgh.  We are Americans, and decided to see Scotland before our tour was up.  I enjoy History and decided to include a visit to Hadrian&apos;s wall during the trip.  We saw the wall in the last bit of daylight and left as the sky got dark.  We headed east on the B6318 to get back to the A68.  We descended into a heavy fog as the road declined, this is common in England.  While between the Vercovicium Roman Fort and Walwick a very bright light shined on us.  I was driving and at first thought it was a truck with it&apos;s brights on.  My friends and I realized the light was about 40 degrees high in the air behind us.  I slowed the vehicle to 25 mph or so, and rolled the windows down.  Their was no sound.  My friends panicked, but I kept calm and started to look for details, it was difficult as I was driving in the fog.  The light was beaming through the sunroof of the little italian car we had.

I have no idea what it was that followed us for at least 3 miles.", "Beam of light comes from the sky.A fellow called me on the toll free line to tell me that he and 7 other witnesses observed a beam of light which came down from the night sky. The light was seen from the witnesses location which was in the southwest part of Airdrie, the beam of light was in the northwest part of the sky. Due to homes being in the witnesses line of sight, they were not able to see if the beam actual hit the ground. I asked the witness a few questions about what this beam of light looked like. He said it came straight down, not on any angles nor were there bends in the light. The fellow told me that it had an orange glow to it. The amazing thing is that this beam of light sat in one place for approx: 20 minutes, enough time that some of the witnesses ran in to telephone other friends and family members so they could go out to see this strange event. I also asked if the beam of light lit up any of the area, the witness said no, due to obstacles in their way. No sound was heard, plus the beam was rather wide, not just a thin beam of light. He said it was moderately cloudy as I wanted to know if any type of object was seen in the area where the light originated from.  No object was noted. No aircraft were visible at the time of the sighting flying through this airspace. I wondered if this may have been a helicopter, but again not a sound was heard coming from the area and I am sure the witnesses, and the others you went out to watch this would have heard the sound if it had been some type of normal aircraft.

If you use the lights as a guide to the top of the tower. They were all uneven and very bright. They were not blinking and they way lower then planes. The lights did not move at all.

The cloud formation was folowing the object that was captured on camera. The clouds, at first, were in a circular motion and dropped into the clouds which then came up through the clouds and headed right behind the object.

At first I thought it was a local helicopter, but then as I drove closer to it I realized it was not anything like a plane.  I stopped in the middle of the road to take a good glance at it. It was a triangle figure with three bright lights at each corner of it with a strobe effect red light in the middle.  It was going very fast but gliding very smoothly and it was relativley proportioned low in the sky for a flying device.  I freaked out and speed the half of a mile home.  My house is surronded by fields mind you...so when I got home I was really freaked out.  I started to get out of my car and I heard noises like someone/something was tapping my car and someone/something was dragging their feet on my driveway (which consists of rocks)  So I heard the noise of feet scraping against rocks.  I called my mother and woke her up and had her come open the side door and start to walk outside so whatever was making noises in my driveway would disappear.  I went into my house safley, and began to look out the window and saw the same triangle figure except it was going in the opposite direction than I origianlly saw it.   I then glanced outside a couple mintues later and saw another triangle figure with a blue light, and a couple mintues later another figure with a green light.  So i dont know if it was the same triangle figure and it changed it&apos;s middle light? Or if theyre were three triangle figures in the sky.  I was really freaked out by the situation and I still am.  I get scared driving down my street in the dark, I am afraid I will see it again.

In 1973 I would have been 10 years old. To give some idea of my ability as a witness, I point out that as a child I was very well informed of then-current and past aircraft, both military and civilian, and kept my eyes to the skies eagerly watching the planes flying out of Hamilton Field using Richmond as a flight corridor.  My dad took me to airshows and airports, and we even had a private tour of Moffett Field at one point. During the course of two evenings, probably within a year or so of each other, I saw a total of three UFOs.  All three were shaped differently, and one event included two of them close together.  Unfortunately I cannot recall which two of the three described below were paired. Both sitings were at dusk with enough light to illuminate the craft for visual observation.  All aircraft were northbound and on the same path used by airliners northbound out of Oakland Airport.  It is my impression that these may have been lower in altitude than the airliners typically flew, and that they may have had approximately the same maximum dimensions as airliners.  None displayed lights in my recollection, and none were audible.  In the case of the two which were paired, one UFO trailed the other rather closely - within a few craft lengths.  Velocity of all three was similar to that of the airliners I often watched going the same direction. UFO #1 was shaped like a hockey puck and reminded me of one of the circular ice cream sandwiches I used to eat as a kid.  The outer edge exhibited some sort of framework or other features.  Come to think of it, for those who may be familiar, it looked a bit like the Oakland Coliseum (the covered structure, not the adjacent ballfield stadium). UFO #2 appeared simply as a pair of swept wings and was devoid of visible equipment or detail.  I don&apos;t believe either of the prior &quot;flying wing&quot; bombers operated by the USAF was still active, and the B-2 was still a gleam in some engineer&apos;s eye. UFO #3 gave the impression of a cigar or banana with an aft dorsal appendage.  My thought, then and now, is that it was much like the fuselage of a conventional airliner - missing the wings and horizontal stabilizers.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I noticed one appear from a black area and proceed moving southeast. Then it suddenly turned sharply and moved to the west. Then it disappeared the same way it entered, like it suddenly turned its light out. I watched and saw more of these. I saw 5 of them do this over a period of 15 minutes. Then a half hr. went by and no more sightings. Then they started again and I counted 4 more before going back in the house. They moved around very high, much higher than the airplanes, and much faster, but slower than a satellite. They would either turn in a right angle, or like a boomerang angle. They all remained in my &quot;directly overhead&quot; area when their light would appear, or go out. I am not a weird person.

Then the object &apos;blipped&apos; and took off east and I saw no more of it after that. I was going to write this incident off as just another incident (I&apos;ve seen and reported objects before), until a friend of mine, 14 miles south and one half-hour later, reported to me the SAME EXACT INCIDENT. The same with 3 witnesses present and again, the one female present COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT.

It was first seen in Souther sky as a light with same luminescence as Venus. It approached and to the North and began descending at a 45 degree angle when it was approximately a mile away. We stood up when the disc was roughly 300 years away. The disc hovered over our home, directly over head, and we got out from under it in order to see it.

Then, the object seemed to &apos;draw a line of light&apos; from its point on the horizon to the stars, at a 45 degree angle; the line of light caught up with the point of origin and it looked like a star in the Western sky, and then the light went out.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

He said, &quot;Get up and go look up into the sky.&quot;  My roommate, who was laying on a futon stretched out in the living with his head facing the window, sounded calm but I heard a sense of urgency in his voice. It scared me. I stumbled towards the third floor window of my downtown Seattle apartment overlooking the Westin Hotel.  For some reason, I was unable to stand up, so I kneeled at the windowsill, and looked up into the sky.  I immediately saw 3 shiny, round white blobs of light darting around in very erratic patterns above Elliott Bay.  As I was watching, my roommate said in an equally sickly calm voice, &quot;I have been in the military for over 20 years, and nothing, nothing we have can make those moves.&quot;  Then he rolled slightly on his side, smiled, closed his eyes and started snoring. Within about 4 minutes of his passing out, I remember stumbling about 3 feet towards the couch and nothing after that. The objects were shiny, white, and flying slightly lower than cloud level.  I had some difficulty focusing on them. In the distance they looked to be about the size of a Volkswagen beetle.  The most remarkable aspect of these objects was their flying patterns, which defied gravity.  Each of the three objects I observed were moving in straight lines and then quickly shooting off at right angles very, very fast. Much faster than I have ever seen anything mechanical move. I don&rsquo;t see how a human body could take that kind of movement.  They also moved in close proximity to each other, which appeared equally as dangerous. Their flying pattern reminded me of fireflies, and it looked they were playing in the clouds.  I can only say this is not something I have ever witnessed before.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Due to the hurried nature of filing my online report I omitted a few items. On December 28, 2003 at approximately 20:25 hours local, I took our dogs outside before going to bed for the evening. While coming out our door I noticed a tight cluster of lights with a strobe in the western sky. I went inside to get my 8x35 binoculars to have a closer look because this didn&rsquo;t look like normal aircraft running lights. While looking at the object I realized it was actually two tight clusters of light; a larger one on the left and a smaller one immediately to the right. The one on the right had the strobe. Initially I thought it was a military aircraft with a chase plane, but after watching it move, it appeared to be he same object, just illuminated on two different areas of the object. The general direction of flight was north to south from my viewing position at approximately 20 - 30 degrees above the western horizon. There was very light haze outside, but not enough to obscure the stars and the moon. The object made no sound. Because this aircraft was flying, it changed its position relative to my viewing position, therefore what I saw also changed. As it flew, the configuration of two clusters of lights changed to a triangular configuration, then to a straight line of three lights. A few minutes later it appeared to fly to the southwest and I am assuming directly away from me. The view of the lights at this time was 4 or 5 white to yellow-white lights forming a low angle arc. The lights strobed [flashed] from left to right. There was a haze or aura around it, but I dismissed this haze due to the general haze in the area. Still no sound was heard. No vapor trails were left. I observed it until the tree lined obscured viewing. The entire duration was ca.10 minutes. The temperature was 32 F, the barometer was 29.783, and the winds were ENE at 3 mph. Our location is directly under the path for commercial aircraft flying to and from European destinations, These commercial flights are generally directly overhead flying at altitude. Most of these aircraft can be heard and most leave vapor trails. Occasionally we have helicopter traffic performing border patrol duty. The US/Canadian border is one mile away.

I would email my copy but it was saved on a hard disk that no longer workd. Ed Dames said it was theatrical lazers on a rooftop in south Phoenix that were invisible to the eye until they crossed in the air. Since the sighting, somebody fed the press a picture they took of parachute flares being droped far to the west-south-west, that were clearly parachute flares on another date completely. By the way, I&apos;m a retired Air Force Pilot with a million miles of flying, and another million miles of driving trucks and taxi cabs, and I&apos;ve never seen aliens in the sky. Yes there are UFO&apos;s - for example when I see a 747 I try to count the upper floor windows to see what series 747 it is. The 747-100 was glued together and they&apos;re not flying anymore - it had fewer than 7 upper deck windows. The current 747-400 has two rows of upper deck windows. It&apos;s an unidentified 747 until I can get a look at how many windows the upper deck has, but it&apos;s not an alien ship, just a Unidentified 747. There are no flying saucers, sorry. I&apos;ve never seen one. I&apos;ve seen thousands of unidentified flying objects but none of them were alien spaceships. Goodness. Get your act organized.

Ed Dames, appearing on the Coast to Coast radio program with Art Bell, its host, declared that through a process of &quot;technical remote viewing,&quot;  he had determined that the entire event over Arizona had been caused by &quot;two, blue-green, one-half, split-beam lasers,&quot; which allegedly had been mounted on the tops of buildings in downtown Phoenix, and had projected the images into the night sky above Phoenix.  The proposition is so absurd, in our opinion, that we won&apos;t bother to address the issue here, but rather leave it up to the reader to make up his own mind.  We will comment to the extent, however, that the &quot;lasers&quot; would have to have been able to project their beams through clouds, dust, and even mountain ranges (!!) in order to have been able to do what is claimed by Dames.

We had stopped at a lake and camped then my ex husband, and son (he was about 2 years old), did some fishing.  We left around 10 am heading towards San Louis Obispo.  We both saw the craft; it was the typical &quot;saucer&quot; shape, aluminum color.  I had always thought for about 2 hours.  Recently I underwent hypnosis, and it seems the time frame was probably around 4-5 hours.  Our final destination was Salinas to visit relatives.  We had planned on taking an inland scenic route on the way up (from the Los Angeles area), then come home the coastal route.  Shortly after leaving the campsite we started seeing the craft, it was like it was magnetized to the car.

Well, for anyone out there who wants to know, one night, years ago I had been on the computer surfing the net with both my sister and brother. At the time, we were all adults- 20&apos;s and 30&apos;s.  I had been coming down the stairs from the second floor and looked out the big paladian window that faced south west.  I had been going slowly down and just gazing out that window when suddenly a reddish orangy light caught my eye.  I had seen it flash - disappear and reappear suddenly elsewhere but nearby. I thought I was seeing things so I stopped still and looked.  As I had been looking, my sister and brother came down and I told them to look outside.  We all looked and were silent, we saw more of these lights reappear then disappear at different points sort of like zig-zagging but disappearing. They were low down in the sky just above some treetops of the rouge river south.  I was amazed because I thought it might have been an airplane at first but no airplane could do these maneuvers all over the sky so quickly and randomly.  I don&apos;t know what it was to this day and neither do my sister and brother.  I know that there was someone who posted a message here in 2003 that sounds like what we saw.

I stopped to take a better look. Then it started to move very slowly. The strange thing about it was that it didnt look that high but it was a little light. It moved north. I followed it. It spead up and then slowed down real fast. I was in a main street when I started to follow and ended up in a lonely road. I flashed my high lights to see if it would see me. It flew over me and stoped. I was frightened. I stuck my head out the window to see it clear. It was weird hard to explain. Then the light became a tiny dot. It seemed like it was trying to hide.

The only thing I could think of was 2 blimps but they were not shaped at all like blimps. Or possibly helecopters that are as big as buildings. They were highly structural, but not simple shaped.

I was smoking a cigarette outside the building I work at, a radio station with numerous antennas on the roof and a couple of large satellite dishes in the backyard. I was halfway under the roof overhang and halfway under the morning sky, which was still dark and very cloudy. I heard a noise on the ground that sounded similar to the crackling a dry leaf makes being dragged across the ground. It surprised me since it was very calm at that time. After hearing the noise I looked down at the ground and noticed a strange light...similar to someone from above with a flashlight beam moving in a space about a foot in diameter. It startled me and I backed up under the overhang and proceeded back into the building. After catching my breath I went back outside where I saw nothing. After the sun came out I went back to the spot where I saw the light, and noticed a patch of green on the concrete in the exact same spot where the light had been. The astroturf carpet under the overhang is green, and there is moss coming from the cracks in the cement. However, after inspecting the green spot I came to the conclusion that it was neither the carpet or the moss. The shade is different, and I had never noticed it before. It is still there. It was a very stressful experience, as I had no idea what had happened to me. And after thinking about it, I started wondering if it was an abduction that went awry as I ducked back into the building before &apos;they&apos; managed to pull me in.

I saw a bright light coming from the south, very low to the horizon, at quite a distance.  I thought it was just a low plane.  After about a minute, it seemed to be much closer, but still very low.  I kept sky watching, looking at planes, Jupiter, Saturn, and Orion.  Then, this object was very close, still low.  I thought it was a plane, but that something might be wrong with it.  I focused it in the binoculars and saw nothing but the light and total blackness. This object, other than the light on the bottom, could not be seen except for it displacing the stars in the sky.  As it came closer, it was triangular shaped with one white light in the very middle.  There were no corner lights as often described.  This thing headed right for me.  I practically buried myself into the back door of the GMC Jimmy I had at the time.  The object flew right over my head and it was HUGE!  If it had landed, it would have filled 6 to 8 acres.  As it went over, there was no sound other than the air moving around it.  It flew over me so slowly that I have no idea what held it in the air.  I have never seen anything go this slowly and not fall out of the sky.  The light in the center was extremely bright but did not hurt my eyes at all.  The light was constant, no flashes, strobes or pulses.  The object flew off to the north and out of view.  It was very low, seemingly just above the tall trees around my home. The very night before, I saw a similar craft, but much higher in the sky, going quite fast.  It had the same white light in the middle.  I would have thought this object was just the white light, but in looking through the binoculars, I could see the triangular shape displacing the stars.  It also traveled south to north.  It was earlier in the evening, ~2100 EST. On both nights, a few minutes after the object had left my view; military planes were every where and flew around in my visible sky for about 15 minutes.

I thought this was strange because it was not holiday, fireworks are illegal in this area. None-the-less, people do shoot off fireworks sometimes but I had only see people shooting them off on New Years and Forth of July so I was curious what was going on in my back yard.  My house is on the bay and I got out of my truck and went around the house to the back yard and walked out on my dock to see what was going on.  The dock is pretty long and extends about 300 feet into the bay.  When I got to the end, I didn&apos;t see anyone and and started walking back to shore and to my house.  I was looking up in the air for the source of the lights I had seen earlier and at the exact second my I was looking in its direction, bright color lights came on.  The object was just above tree level and very close. It was not moving and I am positive it was reacting with me.  Several different color lights flashed on in sequence in a horizontial band around what I could best describe as an oval shape.  I was well aware of the hundreds of reports in this area from the late 1980s but generally thought they were fakes. At that split second, I questioned my belief and quite frankly got a little scared. The object was between me an land and I wasn&apos;t sure what to do.  It was dark and after the light display, I think my eyes dialated because I lost some of my night vision and I didn&apos;t see anything else in the sky.  I paused for a moment and walked, with a little fear, back to my house and went into the back door of my house.  I never told anyone but my wife about it. Some of the things that were striking about it was that it was so close, it was a relatively small object (maybe two automobiles in size), it was low, just above the trees, perfectly quiet and what was most rememerable was the crisp, clear color lights. They were very bright! but wha t I most recall was thinking how clear and pure the color looked.  I am an engineer, a general skeptic (read The Skeptical Inquirer regularly), professional and well known in the community. People around here don&apos;t talk much about UFOs because of the bad publicity we received in the late 80s and early 90s and I worry about my professional reputation by telling people. I can say for certain this was no airplane, helicopter, firework, ballon, star, swamp gas or anything else my rational trained mind can explain. It is by all accounts an unidentified flying object.

One evening before sunset during warm weather (I do not remember the month, day, or year) I had an encounter with a UFO while Fritz and I were walking up the school driveway on our way home. Three young boys on bicycles were approaching me across a grassy path to the school.  They were pointing over my head and shouting loudly. I looked up and saw hovering directly over my head at about two story roof height three lights in a triangular pattern. Even though it was still daylight, I could only see the lights.  I could not see a craft even though it was directly over my head. When the three boys reached me,  the lights bobbed a bit, hesitated, and then rose very slowly, crossed slowly over the trees and houses,  and slowly descended into a clearing three streets away where a new junior high school was under construction.  The boys shouted: &quot;It&rsquo;s gone over to the junior high! Let&apos;s go!&quot; They sped off on their bicycles and headed for the clearing.  I just stood there watching the spot where the lights had descended.  About the time it would have taken for the boys to have reached the spot, the lights slowly rose from the clearing, slowly traveled over the three streets and again hovered silently over my head.  My dog regarded me impatiently, wondering why we did not go home, but even though he was off the leash he did not react or run away. Then I heard the boys returning, shouting &quot;there it is!&quot;   When the boys reached me again, the lights moved, hesitated, and then flew at incredible speed toward the late afternoon sun until it quickly disappeared as a star into the sky. There had been no sound and no turbulence.  Moreover, as I think back, the most amazing aspect of this experience was that I accepted it. ! I muttered, &quot;imagine that,&quot; to myself and walked the dog home.  I made no effort to talk to the boys about it, nor did they say anything to me.

The underneath side had strobe-like lights flashing at at regular intervals, lastly dark rectangular bands are seen at diffent lenghts on the bottom side of the craft with a circular light in the middle of the underside((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "The light was white with a hint of orange in it in the east. Then, another light flashed right next to it and the were burning at the same time. The two lights were very close together. Then the right one would flash off and then the left one would flash and then the right would flash after. The flashing alternated for 30 minutes sometimes seeing both and other times just seeing one of them. There was no pattern I could notice except when the two flashed together they seemed to get very bright. Towards the end of the 30 minutes, the right light looked kind of redish purple and the left light looked yellow-green. The flash kinda looked like a lightning flash because I saw a little trace of light streak. It was not a plane or star. I wantched it for 30 minutes doing this.", "Abduction from bed in 1968.I was alone in a room, lying on the bed listening to music and heard someone talking.  The voices slowly got louder and the music began to fade away.  Suddenly, everything went dark (the room was lit) and the next thing I knew I was in a &apos;room&apos; which I knew was a space ship, with two little aliens.  They were very kind.  I felt only love from them.  The air in the space was saffron colored and one wall to my left was filled with small lights and what looked like switches.  It looked a bit like a sound board.  They communicated with me telepathically and said that they wanted to see what effects Earth had on me.  At least that&apos;s what I heard.  Then, my body levitated to a horizontal position and under me there appeared to be a slab like table.  I closed my eyes and the next thing I Knew the music slowly began to come back.  I was not drinking or doing drugs.  :)   By the way Peter, I REALLY enjoyed listening to you tonight with Art Bell.  One of the best conversations I&apos;ve heard.  I apologize if this is not the kind of report you are interested in.  I would love to have a conversation with someone about this.", "Bright light faded to nothingWhile letting the dogs out to use the bathroom.  I observed due south a bright light in the sky.  At first I thought this was Saturn.  But then I looked to the Southwest and saw Saturn.  While watching this light (it was as bright as Saturn) it faded out and disappered.  I called my wife to come out and watch.  Then the light returned got as bright as Saturn again and then faded out.  My wife stated that she thought that it moved away.", "Three bright lights, one sends down beam over my vehicle.At about 9pm on 1-20-04 I was traveling on a rural route near Hopewell Twp, N.J.I first observed two white lights in the southwestern sky.  They were very bright and identical in form and intensity.  They were also positioned next to each other, which appeared to be odd.  They did not seem to be an astronomical body but to be in close proximity of the earth. After I reached my destination I returned in the opposite direction.  The two objects were still positioned in their same location.  I then observed a third object moving slowly in the direction of the other two and approaching directly overhead my vehicle.  As I watched the object through my windshield it sent a beam of light down directly over me.  I then observed a glare off of the hood of my vehicle and the ground surrounding my car.  At this point I became extremely frightened, since I am familiar with UFO literature.  I repeatedly glanced at the clock in my vehicle to note any lapse in time as I drove on.Thankfully there was none.  The object then flew over without any further incident.  I admit that for about one minute I was very scared.  I do not recall hearing any sound from this object.  However, I was in my vehicle with the windows closed since it had been very cold that evening(about 10 degrees).", "We could see human forms in a window like windshield on this air craft that silently hovered!Coming around a country corner that lined around a field my brother and I saw this disk shaped silver air craft that hovered with no sound.  A window, if you will, dome to a flatter verses round shape, seemed to be the front top 1/2 to a 1/4 of craft.  It appeared that two human forms where in this window with like a panel in front of them, like a desk or control board?  I say human forms because they seem to have a round shape for a head, shoulders with arms, a body-trunk.  I could not see faces, clothing, skin, nor hair.  Just the shape of a human form, two I believe, in this window area of the craft.  This craft was that close!  Just above the tree tops.  I&apos;m not sure if it was adrenalin from fear but my lips rolled on my teeth!  Not a drop of saliva was in my mouth.  I slowed for only moments, I&apos;m sure, and drove away very fast with my heart pounding!  My brother and I never uttered a word at the time.  I was 17 years old he was 12 years old.  I lived on my own in a cabin on the Chocolay River that feeds into Lake Superior not far down stream.  This was very close to KI Sawyer Air Force Base, which was active at this time.  I called the air base and reported the sighting.  I&apos;m not sure with whom I spoke but I was told there was nothing on the radar, as if they&apos;d tell me if there was, and that if it was just above the tree tops they wouldn&apos;t see it on radar.  Still so frightened my little brother slept with me that night, one bedroom cabin but he could of slept on the couch.  I had lace curtains on the two pain (one on top of the other) slide up windows. Close to the ground, if you where outside the bottom of the window would be at waist level.  I had no way to totally close the outside form inside.  This craft, I swear, hovered over my cabin about two miles from the incident not long after I had arrived home and called the Air Force Base with report.  My little brother and I just clung to one another with fear, light from this craft shown through the windows of the bedroom.  Now I wa! s use to B-52 flying over constantly and never had this happen before or after this incident.  From that day on until about 4 years ago, I&apos;ve moved out of the area, i.e. state, I had dreams, which is nightmares of UFO&rsquo;s in the sky there down by the Chocolay River and by my home on Silver Creek Road, all in close proximity of incident.  My brother and I didn&apos;t and don&apos;t speak of this incident.  I&apos;m now 42 years old and he&apos;s 37.  We both have families of our own now and have not experienced some thing like this since.  Of course as time has gone on I&apos;m sure he has as well as my self, talked ourselves into believing it didn&apos;t happen.  Yeah know what?  Some thing did happen and we couldn&apos;t explain it and still can&apos;t.  So for what it&apos;s worth this is my UFO story.  Every one doesn&apos;t have one, I do.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "I saw the ufo&apos;s outride my bedroom window which faces the south corner of the house.There appeared to be 3 objects.The next morning we found unexplainable looking foot or track prints in the snow in our yard.I saw something happen to one of the trees there was a slice of it chopped off.", "They all saw what looked like a large round ball or chrome colored marble.A gentleman called me today, December 24, 2003 to report a sighting he had, along with two other witnesses who were in his company at the time. The witness (driver) who called is a ex military man (air defense). The first thing the witness asked, did HBCC UFO receive any reports from around 1:00 p.m. today. I told the fellow that I had not received any other than his call. He was sure that two other vehicles had observed the same object he and his passengers witnessed as the two vehicles in front of him braked the same time he did. He also mentioned that if he had of been by himself he may not have reported seeing this strange object over Airdrie. The two passengers who had an early Christmas at another home received a pair of binoculars as a gift, which I packed away with other gifts in a bag in the vehicle. The witnesses had just come out of their home and were driving down 8th Street heading south. Approximately two minutes the driver said to the passengers, what the heck it that? Approximately one kilometer away from their location they all saw what looked like a large round ball or chrome colored marble as he described it sitting stationary in the sky above a colored shack which is on the opposite side of Big Springs Road. All of the witnesses were very excited, or in his words, freaking out as to what they were seeing. The driver told one of the passengers to grab his new binoculars so they might get a better look at this strange object.After the binoculars were located in the bag filled with gifts they zoomed in on the object. The driver slowed the vehicle down so the ones holding the binoculars could get a better view of it. The sphere did not move, it sat hovering in the one location. From when they first noticed it, they said the whole event may have lasted for approximately 15 or 20 seconds before it disappeared. It &quot;did not shoot off&quot; in any direction. It just vanished !! (blinked out) The driver who said he had worked in air defense for many years and was very familiar with what is flying in our skies, said he has never seen anything like this in his life. Also the witnesses roughly estimated the object may have been hovering at an altitude of 500 to 1000 feet. The driver later on that day ended up driving back to the shack where the object was seen hovering above. He parked his vehicle and got out and had a good look around just in case he might have been able to see it again, or to see if there may have been any physical evidence left around this area. After a short while on location he told me that he felt rather uneasy and got back into his vehicle and left the area. After they witnesses had watched this unusual object they picked up the Airdrie Echo newspaper and spotted a new articles on a few sightings which were recently reported to the newspaper. This is how the fellow found out about myself and knew he should make a report over what they saw. Brian, Director of HBCC UFO Research would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed this strange sighting. I would like to thank the witnesses from their report.

He was looking off into the woods to our right so I stopped in shock to try and see what he was so worked up over. I had to stare almost 2 minutes before I saw it. It was a black teardrop shaped thing weaving out from behind a tree and it seemed like it would look at us and go back behind the tree. I was scared as hell but very curious and being that I had my dog with me for protection I decided to move towards it. My dog wanted to pursue it by this point also so we began stepping off the trail and walking towards it. We had walked maybe 15 feet and it flew out from behind the tree and began moving away from us at a slow speed. I tried to keep up with it but even running it moved just a little bit faster than us. I saw no marks on it, no other parts just a black teardrop shape. Finaly it rose up between some pines after chasing it for about 3 minutes and from what I could see through the tree branches, it took off in a vertical climb faster than Ive ever seen anything move in my life. I just went straight up till I couldnt see it anymore. I was scared and decided to get the hell out of there after seeing it do that. I dont know what I saw today, but believe me when I tell you it frightened me. I never heard a noise either and come to think of it, it never seemed to hit a tree branch or bush or anything. It definetly knew how to fly well whatever it was. My best description of what it was made out of would be like describing the black glass that you see over a security camera in a casino or something. Very black and reflective. Other than that, I saw nothing else and didnt get close enough for any other details. It was about the size Id say of maybe two basketballs together.", "Red, Blue, &amp; White Lights circle Stoney Creek/Rochester Area, Move NorthOn the evening of 12/30/03 approximatly midnight, I looked out my window towards the north, towards Washington Township.  I saw a red, blue, and white flashing lights in the air, circling the area to the north.  The red &amp; blue lights seemed to be flashing like the lights on a police car.  I watched the lights circle the area to the north around Stoney Creek for about 5 minutes, then I got my binoculars to get a better look.  I was able to see three flashing red lights on the object along with an undetermined number of white and blue lights.  I watched as the object flew to the west, towards Rochester.  As it flew to the west, I lost site of the object from my vantage point.  I went to the west side of the house and was able to continue tracking the object as it flew in a circular pattern over Rochester for about 5 minutes.  I then lost site of the object behind some trees for the next 10 minutes.  The object reappeared and flew south turned around and flew to the north, at which point I lost track of it.  The object seemed to be moving about the speed that a helicopter would fly, but made no sound.  The entire event lasted about 30 minutes.

We were both in about the 5th and 6th grades at the time and of course no one ever believed us.there were no visible outlines, just a light that had been in the sky with all the other stars for the 2 or so hours that we lay there watching stars. That also ended our sleeping outside as we moved  indoors for the rest of the night. I have had a hard time sleeping under the stars ever since.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Besides reporting lights for January 4, 2004 he also told me he witnessed bright lights on January 1, 2004. He went on to explain there is no service roads, or roads of any kind up on the mountain. The witness said there also is a large canyon which cuts through the mountain side where some of these lights were being observed. The fellow ruled out any kind of vehicle due to the roughness of the terrain and again the lights were traveling over the tree line. He said there was not a sound coming from the lights, as his home is close enough to where he would have heard if the object was a helicopter or other type of aircraft. Also seeing it was after dark and traveling so very low a pilot would have been crazy to fly an aircraft at such a low altitude in hazardous conditions. The lights were not traveling at a fast clip, but moving slowly. When the man decided to run and grab his binoculars and came back out on his deck, the lights had vanished. As he thought back he thinks that there were more lights on the one bright object. At one point the light traveled down the mountain through the canyon towards his direction which was to the north. As it drew closer to the lower part of the mountain it turned to the west and of course disappeared soon after. Two years earlier the fellow and his girlfriend saw similar lights on the mountain at approx: 10:00 p.m., but this time the lights seem to hug the mountain as they flew slowly along.

Interdimensional Craft - Daylight SightingWhile  a friend and I were sitting on the bank of the Fraser River at Surrey, BC, he looked up and remarked on what he thought, initially, were large seagulls overhead.  They were instead very large craft with globular bellies that reflected sun light -- like a very white/bright metal. There were six to eight of them flying overhead which I estimate to be about a mile above us.  The wings were &quot;flapping&quot; but not like seagulls which flap in unison.  When I remarked about this to my friend, then they changed to flap in unison.  We had seagulls flying in front of us over the river, so it was easy to compare.  These craft at times flew in a loose formation, then aimlessly.  The strangest parts were I had the  impression that our thoughts were being picked from overhead. And they disappeared and REappeared -- against blue sky.  These were solid craft, sharply seen -- but they seemed to disappear and they reappear against blue sky -- as if they were going in and out of another dimension.  We watched them until we got bored -- went into the fish shop for the fish boat had come in and then left. I reported this incident to the Canadian UFO reporting center at Vancouver, B.C. and the then president who called me back told me had a similar sighting, also over the Fraser River some weeks before -- but only one craft -- and no where near as many as we had seen. This was a day time sighting, and one we watched long enough to be clear as to what we saw.", "Fall 1999 sighting of green and gold fireballs in N CaliforniaFrom your records I am sure you will be able to determine the exact date and time after reading my account. The following is from mysent email dated 111401. &ldquo;I have two purposes in writing. First, to describe my own sightings of some of these &lsquo;fireballs&rsquo; in the north central California area in late fall early winter 1999/2000. I did not record the events other than mentally. At that time I was driving truck on a weekly run from Portland OR to southern California. ... The first of my fireball sightings occurred as I was northbound on I5, about half way between the Weed airport and Yreka, in northern CA. It was between mid Oct and mid Nov. It could have been on a Tues or Thur night, but was most likely Wed night. I do not recall the exact time, but did make a mental note of the time. I think it was between 2300 and 0100 Pacific Coast Time (GMT &ndash;8). It was a large green pulsing fireball that was emitting golden sparks. Relative size to me was most likely slightly over two inches in diameter. I used objects in near field vision within and on the truck, and middle field vision along the freeway as references. Horizontal vector distance was most likely much less than 20 miles from me, based on the distance to hills on the western edge of this relatively North/South valley. The golden sparks were associated (possibly not emitted) with it on the sides and backside of its traverse. None of the golden sparks moved downward toward the earth so were most likely not influenced by earth&rsquo;s gravitation or else the sparks extinguished quickly enough so as to appear to not be influenced by earth&rsquo;s gravitational field. I have seen several greenish and other colored meteorite fire trails one of which lit up the sky and exploded over the San Antonio Texas area in 1967 when I was stationed there in the Army. This was definitely not a meteorite. I rolled down my window to listen and observe directly. It was soundless and left no after image of light in the sky or on my retina, nor any light streak, as do most meteor trails. In the &lsquo;tail&rsquo; area, somewhat obscured by the golden sparks, were several (I think I remember counting either three or four) smaller objects. Each of these objects was approximately &frac14; inch relative diameter with one larger than the others. When I first noticed the small objects they appeared to be slightly not in exact formation with the larger object. I observed them to maneuver independently into an exact single line path following in the path of the larger object. For! the res t of my observation, these objects appeared to follow and maintain an exact distance from each other and the larger object. In color, they appeared to vacillate slightly with the predominate frequency being a yellow-gold different from and paler than the golden sparks. The frequency shift ranged between reddish and bluish around the periphery of the entirety of each object with enough transparency to note the predominant central yellow-gold. Because of the pattern, flight path, and general and specific appearance, at that time I believed them to be manufactured objects (this includes manufactured plasma balls) under some kind of either external or internal control. The direction was roughly slightly east of south, but possibly south by southeast. The track seemed to be parallel to an average altitude above the earth. I observed them as they appeared from over the hills to the north of me until I could no longer see them as they passed out of my field of view as limited by my direction of travel and position in the truck. They could have been visible for as long as 30 seconds. Time is relative and subjective and even more so in situations such as this. I think they were at quite low altitude because during part of the observation they appeared between me and the hills to my west. I was listening to the Art Bell radio talk show at the time and tried several times to call in on my cell phone, but never got through. Others were calling in to the Art Bell program with incident reports. The objects were seen from at least as far north as Portland OR. It was reported that jets were scrambled from a National Guard station at Beaverton OR airport, but never caught up to the objects. Observers reported that somewhere over central CA the fireballs made an orderly sharp-angled turn to the east toward Nevada. I vaguely remember hearing another day that they disappeared or &lsquo;exploded&rsquo; somewhere over Nevada. On two or three Sunday evenings or nights sometime between then and early March 2000 I observed similar greenish fireballs coming from relatively west southwest of my position as I was southbound on I5 within 100 miles north of Sacramento and 50 miles south of Sacramento. These incidents each occurred between 2100 and 0200. On one occasion I saw three fireballs on the same relative directional track, each within one to five minutes of each other. I saw no golden sparks or other small objects during any of these observations. Each of them appeared to be relative size approximately half or less of the Oct/Nov object, and much further distant. My observation period was very short as they traveled quickly from the western horizon over my head toward NV. I remember hearing later of one report from a woman someplace in Castro Valley CA reporting a similar observation but do not know if it could have been the same as one of my sightings.   I am certified in NLP and Clinical Hypnotherapy and was in practice for a few years. Part of NLP is about learning to be a good observer and make fine distinctions. I am also a snowboard instructor and used to climb a bit, both of which provide good perspective on outdoor distance and orientation.", "Husband and I were driving on the interstate near the Deyo, OK. Exit sign..saw that sign a few minutes after our UFO incident, made it a point to remember just where we saw the unusual sights we witnessed...we seemed to be the only drivers on the road also..we were heading east. Husband looked out he window to the north and saw this low flying sphere which looked to be made of glass, at least it was shining like the brightest reflection, and then behind it came another one....when I looked over, I just thought how odd, and wondered what kind of artillery was being used, that we should actually be able to see some type of (??) being propelled horizontally across the sky...at a very fast rate of speed...then all of a sudden they veered upward heading almost towards an imaginary two if on a clock face....and there was a black circle in the bottom of the one my husband viewed, with a heavy yellow jet stream of exhaust coming from it....since I was on the other side of the auto, the UFO&apos;s left my line of vision sooner than they did for my husband, who was craning his neck and looking out of our van, to continued viewing them as they sped out of sight...all this happened so quickly, we were puzzled as to what we&apos;d seen. but it was in an airspace which was between Lawton and Ft.

Besides myself, they have been witnessed by my wife, our eight year old boy, and my wife&apos;s non english speaking mother who was living with us at the time. I bring to point that my mother-in law does not speak english because that shows the level of communication that she and I have. When she first saw the lights in the sky, she led us out into the front yard and asked if we(my wife and I) were in some kind of trouble. The frequency at which they had appeared had became so upsetting to her that she assumed that it was some type of law enforcement watching over our subdivision.-My home is located about one mile northeast of Kennesaw mountain, and about five miles due north of Dobbins Air Force Base. a huge cell tower sits close to our house and a railroad train right next door along w/ a man made lake (that serves no purpose in our subdivision due to the lack of up keeping).-The bright white balls of light come up vertically from behind the tree line about a half mile south of my house in direct line of sight with Kennesaw mountain. They come up very slowly in groups of three and post positions equal distance from one another approximately 1500 ft off the ground. They then slowly move one after the other in a single line formation towards and then over my house. I know the height that they are from the ground because I have a cell phone tower IN MY BACKYARD which when they pass over they barely clear. These objects make NO SOUND when moving, and never move faster than approx. 30 knots (the landing speed of a piper cub). From below they look like a triangle shape similar to the stealth F-117 with three lights that would be at the respective nose and two wing landing gear formation. These craft come up in groups of three hover for approx. 5-10 minutes at their posted position then depart with a second group coming up in the same fashion. We have witnessed up to 12 craft in a one hour period on a nightly bases.

It would be unusual, we believe, for &quot;bona fide&quot; UFO&apos;s to make nightly appearances in the same location.

Apperared to be at around, 8000 feet AGL, I had to move very quickly across my back yard, to follow it across the sky traveling South East to Northwest but about halfway across the sky above my house it made a few jerky motions and changed to a more westerly direction and then was out of view. I waited for some sound as it had to be going greater then the speed of sound at that altitude but no sound ever came, it was absolutely silent.

The sky was clear and there was not any other traffic. I was returning him home to our parents as he was 13 or 14 years old. He had been visiting me in the western part of the state. We were talking as I drove along and as if out of a science-fiction movie a large craft just appeared above and to the left of the road about 1-2 miles in front of us. I mean, I was looking ahead when this large craft just appears in the sky. It was descending abd was tilted down at about a 45 degree angle. It then leveled itself over the highway then descended again, tilted down as before, and left my sight as there was a farm building sight with a grove of trees blocking my sight. That&apos;s when I turned to my brother and found him looking at me. At the same time we both said &quot;Did you see that?&quot;. We&apos;re still traveling east and getting closer to where we saw this thing land. I say &apos;land&apos; because we&apos;re in Iowa and we can see the farm place and all around the vicinity for a long way. I mean, we were really wondering what this was going to look like on the ground and close enough to the road to throw a rock and be able to hit it, to make a point. Probably a minute after we lost it from sight we were passing the farm place and there was&apos;nt anything there except a harvested bean field. We arrived at our parents house a couple of hrs. later and told them about what we had seen. Understand, it&apos;s been 33-34 years since this took place, but our oldest sister[17 at the time] it was either 1 or 2weeks later brought my attention to the Des Moines Sunday Register. On the front page the second bold -type heading read&quot; Mysterious burn spots found in soybean fields &quot; and went on to mention Iowa and surrounding states south and west of Iowa. My brother would not talk about this at all for maybe 23-24 years later.

There i saw what first appeared to be 3 stars, with one being red. the Red one was about 3-4 inces away from the moon and the other 2 were about 1-2 inches away..I didn&apos;t think much of it right away, but i looked around and there were no other stars in the sky so that got me curious. The objects were a long way away, almost like they were even with the moon..i scanned the sky again for other stars and still did not see any. The Red one seemed to move ever so slow, the the other two moved just a little, about this time my Son, who is in the Navy and is getting Married Saturday as he is on his way back off the coast of Iraq. he is stationed on board the U.S.S. George Washington an aircraft carrier and he sees jet fighters all the time, they are suppose to leave around Jan 19th headed back off the coast of Iraq to provide air support for the troops he works hands on with the planes as he is an AO, Aviation Ordance man, loading the bombs on planes, he is used to seeing the best we have.. I asked him to take a look at the objects i saw, he first said they were stars, but after he saw them move a little he said , &quot;Dad, those are not stars, they are moving around, by this time the Red one was about 6 inches away in the 8 o&apos;clock position Using the Moon as the 12 O&apos;Clock position, the other 2 were about 3 inches away in the 5 pm and 7 pm position, they would move a little then stop, move a little then stop, about 7 mins into the sitings the red one took off super fast..the other two were now in the 6pm and 9 pm position, there they stopped for what appeared to be a couple of mins, then they moved again but with a little more speed, in about 2 more mins they both took off super fast and that was the last we saw of them. There was nothing else in the sky.I was a former Deputy sheriff, left there and went to work for the local Air Force base as a DOD worker and saw planes all the time at my work, i have never seen anything move in that type fashion and then leave in that speed..This is no joke and i would be interested in talking to any one that may have saw this that same day, this was New Years Eve, 12-31-2003. Others should have seen them as they were very high and appeared to be close to the moon. The time was between 4:45 and 5 pm.

I remember the date clearly as I told myself I would never forget. I have told this story to quite a few friends over the years, but have never made an official report. I have always been afraid of the attention this story might arouse, and of ridicule. I was 19 years old. I was in my front yard in Jacksonville Beach, Fla. looking north. About 5 miles north of where I lived is Mayport Naval Station. I saw a very small red object in the sky that seemed to stay in one position for a long time. Then it would move slowly to another position and stay awhile. I went inside and told my Father about this light. It was too far away to determine what is was. I went back out and watched this light again. It started moving slowly eastward toward the Atlantic Ocean which was only a mile from my house. I went inside and told my Father I was driving down to the beach to see if I could get a better look at this object. I drove down to the beach and parked in a parking lot beside a Holiday Inn in our town. This is right up to the seawall. I looked to the north and believed I spotted the object out over the ocean to the Northeast. But it was tiny, and I could make out no detail at all. I watched this object for maybe 10 minutes. But I could see no detail, and grew tired of watching it. I was standing on the seawall. I turned south to walk back to my car, when I saw a large orange football shaped object coming down our beach. It looked like glowing steel in a furnace. It glowed. It also had a halo or a fog around it that was also orange. It did not appear to be even 200 feet in the air, and was moving slowly northward toward me. We had a pier in our town that was about 1 mile south of my location. This object was closer, because I could see its reflection in the water between me and the pier. There was a car driving up the beach. The object appeared to be almost directly over it. But the car was actually approaching me faster than the object. I would estimate this object was 60 feet long. It appeared about the size of a streetlight maybe 75 feet away. As this object moved slowly toward me, I began to be a little afraid. This was late at night near Midnight, and there were not a lot of people out. There is a stairway on the seawall down to the beach itself. I started to go! down in there, when I saw a man standing in front of the Holiday Inn smoking a cigarette. There was a railing on the seawall. He was leaning against it and looking eastward out at the ocean. He did not seem to be aware of this object that now only appeared to be 3 or 4 blocks south of me. I ran over to the man and said, &quot;Look at that!&quot; pointing. He looked up and said, &quot;Wow, what is that?&quot; I said, &quot;I don&apos;t know, but I think its one of those UFO&apos;s!&quot; The object had stopped now and seemed to just sit still. At times it seemed to glow slightly brighter and then dim. We both just stared. Then the object seemed to flatten out into a long narrow rectangle. Maybe like a cereal box on edge. Even at this shape it seemed to glow brighter and then dim slightly. It stayed like this for maybe 1 minute. Then, it shot eastward at the most amazing speed I have ever seen. It moved so fast that it appeared to stretch like taffy and then turn into a tiny orange ball that shot over the horizon to the east over the ocean. It left a long orange vapor trail that took several minutes to fade away. The man asked, &quot;Do you think that was a rocket?&quot; I said, &quot;No, I&apos;ve seen rockets before, and they don&apos;t move like that&quot; (You could see rockets go up from Cape Kennedy on clear days where I lived. I have seen numerous Apollo launchings and even the Space Shuttle years later). The man asked me if I was going to tell anybody. I said I didn&apos;t know who to tell. We talked for a minute. He told me his name but I can&apos;t remember. I do remember he told me he was from Detroit, Michigan and was down for vacation. I left and drove home. I tried to tell my Father about it when I got home, but I woke him from sleeping, and I don&apos;t think he was quite awake. I told some co-workers the next day, who laughed at me. After that, I didn&apos;t tell anyone for a year or two. But after that, I would tell some friends. I still tell people sometimes, but I have always feared people would think I&apos;m lying or some kind of looney. Just to let you know. I am very familiar with military aircraft. My Father worked for the military as an Aircraft Instumentation Calibrations Technician. I lived by air bases most of my young life, and have seen many odd military vehicles. But I have never seen anything like this object. It was very close. It was not a rocket, plane, helicopter, balloon or whatever. I don&apos;t know what it was.", "unusual lightsI was driving down Telegraph. I got to Telegraph / Sibley. The sky was clear and dark blue. To the right I saw what at first I thought as an airplane.The light was unusally bright. But then the light dimmered down.And after that happened the speed of the light increased a lot. It quickly went left off to the horizon. From what I know commercial planes dont dimmer lights and increase speed dramatically over populated areas.I continue down telegraph and just before I reach telegraph and Eureka I notice another object that had dim lights too.But this one was different because instead of moving into the horizon it just disappeared. None of the lights acted like normal air planes.When I got home I looked up at the sky again and noticed an unusual amount of activity. I could they were airplanes but the amount of them and the higher altitude sky streaks were more than usual.", "Glowing softball-sized orb seen falling out of circular distortion in ceiling and snatched up by long thin green arm.When I was a young girl my dad and I saw a UFO, while we were both awake and outside, in Reseda, CA and ever since over the years I&apos;ve had numerous abduction experiences-This is a reference for what happened to me last night (January 15, 2004-1:00 AM)  I was sitting up in bed watching TV with the lights off and my boyfriend was laying next to me with his eyes closed, almost asleep. Suddenly a swirling circular distortion appeared in the ceiling above me. It was approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter. It looked like the reality of the ceilng was rippling like water. Within a moment of it&apos;s appearance a bright intense shining ball, the size of a softball, glowing like a light bulb with a surface like glass, fell down out of the swirling circular distortion. It fell within about 3 inches from the floor in front of me. All-of-sudden a long thin green arm, glowing light fluorescent green, reached down out of the ceiling and snatched up the ball and jerked back up into the circular rippling distortion. The arm was extremely long to be able to reach out of the ceiling and snatch the ball up (the ceiling is 8 feet from the floor). This all happened within seconds. As the arm was retracting into the ceiling I  aroused my boyfriend but by the time he fully arose and opened his eyes it was all over. He believed me though. He has also had many strange waking abduction experiences over the years. There is also a second strange occurence to this happening. My borfriend&apos;s brother lives in the same house with us. Over the years he has heard his brother moaning in his bed at night and after his brother wakes him up he seems to remember a shadowy presense in the room, some kind of entity, and having long scaly fingers pushed over his mouth, and being frozen in place and being dragged from his bed. He swears he&apos;s been awake when this happens. His brother always finds him awake , shaken, remembering details. Well, later on last night (about 3:00 AM, January 15, 2004) his brother heard my boyfriend (I had finally fallen asleep) start moaning just like all the other times he had abduction experiences. My boyfriend remembered nothing this time though. We are all sane grown people who have not been diagnosed with scitzofrenia and I was wide awake watching TV. I have never told anyone about these things throughout my life for fear of ridicule but this was so strange this time that I had to tell someone. I don&apos;t know if you care about these types of sightings but I thought the glowing, light bulb-looking, softball size orb could be considered as a UFO.", "It was hovering over the trees and had bumps all over it..like it may have had different floors.It had many lights like runner lights at Christmas time.all different colors.It had a beam shinning down on the ground.My friend and I observed it for a while and then ran scared to death and don&apos;t discuss it with anyone((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

PD))", "Four Red lights in a straight lineThis is an experience I would not like to share but since I found this website, I might eventually encourage other people with similar experiences. This phenomenon did not only happen once but twice in a one week interval and both have witnesses. It has been 8years and the memories are still very vivid and unfortunately I am the only witness to publish this material - I do not currently live in the Philippines anymore and the whereabouts of the other witnesses is not of my knowledge. It started in a humid summer night in Cebu,Philippines in Mandaue. As usual, me and my mates(we were of varying ages: 17,16 to 10) hang out in my friend&apos;s topless jeep and share jokes or whatever. Suddenly at around 8PM, my friend alerted us to a red light up in the sky moving(right to left) from east to west, and we(about 8 of us) spotted the single red light and unexpectedly another red light popped out in the east following the first and another until it completed into four red lights trailing each other that moved quite fast from east to westward manner. The distance between these four red lights were very uniform in a straight line(east to west) and suddenly all four halted in mid air(12o&apos;clock in front of us, about 50degrees above our sky view, their height might be around a normal cloud height). After halting, the four red lights &quot;waited&quot; for a few seconds and the fourth red light(from the right) moved clockwise around the other remaining 3 and climbed up to sky about 10o&apos;clock position above the remaining 3 and is about a few miles up the sky(estimated) and stayed there - while the fourth red light was manouvering, the second red light moved counterclockwise around the remaining 2 and moved slowly to the east and &quot;played&quot; around in the sky(easterly) for a few minutes and decided to go &quot;high speed&quot; up the sky into nowhere like the ones you see on starwars. The first red light(from the left) while the fourth and the second red lights were manouvering, just went &quot;high speed&quot; up the sky into nowhere, again. The third red light(which was the brightest of all 3) remained still without any &quot;visible&quot; movement. The fourth red light remained in its position until it was covered with clouds. All this happened in about 30minutes.At that moment, there were 2 adult witnesses which makes it 10, and I called my parents and saw it in disbelief and concluded that it was just a &quot;satellite&quot; - I said to them, &quot;Doing those ridiculous moves, no way&quot; I know how satellites move, I have observed them very well, but not this one.The third light remained until 9:30PM and did that &quot;high speed&quot; thingy up into nowhere. These red lights were quite bright and vivid up, like LED(light emitting diodes) up in the sky, but not so bright or so intense. After that incident, the following week, which was Wednesday(I could still remember) at 8PM as well, me and a friend of mine were having a chat at the back of a pick up truck. I innocently gazed into the patchy cloudy night sky and thought of nothing and the second time I gazed on the exact position I gazed before, there, the intense third red light(which I recognized) was there along with the passing clouds, as if looking at me. I called upon my other friends(about 3) and saw it too. We were excited and both fearing why it showed up again as if it&apos;s intention was only meant for us - I could feel it. A passing cloud covered the red light and by the time the cloud was gone(about 10 seconds past) the red light was in no sight. That was the last of it.We speculated the possibilities of what the red lights might be, and a lot of them have been junked: 1. not an airplane, surely it wasn&apos;t, not even helicopters(no noise) and moves too fast &quot;upwards&quot;.2. not a kite with a very bright red lamp, why: a. the intervals of all four were seemingly uniform moving from left to right, east to west, not to mention how it stopped abruptly in mid air like there is a pause button somewhere.b. the level of brightness in that height would require a huge battery and a reasonably huge lamp, as big as a car&apos;s red lamp, which require at least a 6volt(very heavy battery) - not even a 3metre kite can carry it. An LED can&apos;t produce that level of brightness at that distance.c. a kite in a night sky is not very steady, wind pressure is weak. These red lights were as still as you can imagine.3. not a satellite, too bright, and the movements are very complex. Whatever it was, I only wished I had caught it in video with a steady tripod, it would had astonished the whole world who owns a TV.I might email a sketch of how it moved in the sky and its arrangegments.", "Golf ball sized white light seen moving outside house, about 100 feet in the air.

Height about 100-120 feet up. This is the second viewing for one of the witnesses.  First seen about one month ago and it appeared to be larger than this one.", "at 17;00 on 29/12/03 i was in the back garden of my house smoking a ciggarette,as i was looking up at the sky I saw three round objects.At first i thought it was a plane and a hellicopter flying close together, then they started to move apart and went out of view behind the house facing. I went upstairs to get a better look out of the window, where my partner and daughter joined me. By the time I looked out of the window there were another two or three that had joined them. They then all formed two groups and after a few minutes, one by one they disappeared. Seconds later three returned in a 45 degree angle, travelling upwards. Two more then joined this group and made some kind of triangular formation. The next thing to come into view was a very bright large circle, rising from behind the houses, which is when all of the circles gradually disappeared.", "Strange object sat still in sky for 45 minutes like a star, then very quickly passed over me.When I was out at Trinity Church looking at fireflies after a church event had ended, I noticed a bright yellow (not white, but a deeper yellow) light about the size of five or six stars combined. It was a clear night, so I could compare the object to the many stars that were out. The object remained motionless for about forty minutes. When I went to my bike it started moving in a loop towards me, it looked like it was descending towards earth. No one else was around since church had been out for about half an hour, and I hid in the long marsh grass. It flew directly over me and I could see tiny red, green, and white lights on the bottom of it and larger, more bright, yellow lights in a circle pattern on the bottom of it. There were no lights in the middle, but there was a combination of three figure eight patterns made with yellow light. The three figure eights were connected together and seemed to be coming from the large yellow lights. I have seen many airplanes, jets, satellites, and meteorites fly at all times of day since Ripon is located near Oshkosh. Oshkosh gets all kinds of planes from around the world for the EAA and I can tell the difference between planes and what I saw. I have never seen an aircraft just sit still for about forty minutes, then when you glance at it a second time it moves at a very fast speed towards you. What caused me to wonder what the object was is that I have never seen it before while looking for fireflies, and that the object was brighter, larger, and a different color then a star. As I was leaving I saw an object that looked the same as the first object out towards Oshkosh flying in an odd pattern. The object was raising its height, then lowering it (bobbing up and down). I was just wondering if anyone else in the Ripon area saw this strange object. Note:The objects lights were in a disc shape, but I could not see the outline of the object due to the bright yellow lights. The object seemed to be less than 100 yards above my head, but it was hard to tell because I did not know the exact size of the object. If the object was a little less than 100 yards high, then it had around a 100 foot radius (assuming the lights were on the edge of the object). I compared the objects height to the roof of the church as it passed over it. As I noted before, the yellow lights were extremely bright and they made it impossible to see the outline of the object, only the smaller lights were noticeable with the large yellow ones.((NUFORC Note:  It is unusual, in our opinion, for a UFO to remain motionless for an hour, although not impossible.  If the report that the object moved swiftly across the sky is accurate, then it could not have been a celestial body.  PD))", "Huge ship, with colored lights placed in this diamond-shaped pattern on its underside, one light protruding from the centerIt was around 10 pm one sultry summer night that my mother asked me to come to our screened door to check out something wierd in the sky.  I remember walking to the door and looking out to see this huge brightly lit &quot;ship&quot; slowly moving toward the front of our house.  A best guess at approximate altitude was somewhere between 800 to 1500 ft.  My mother, sister and I stepped out into the yard for a better view.  I immediately noticed the silence;our usual evening serenade of bullfrogs courting, locusts calling, etc was gone.  Our dogs were not barking; extremely eerie! As the ship inched closer to our home, I began to hear this low humming, the sound a refrigerator gives off.  It moved directly over our house, stopped, and hovered, giving us a dynamite view of its underside.  The ship itself had to be the size of several football fields.  There appeared to be a multitude of colored lights strobing its lower perimeter, with four huge lights located in this diamond-like pattern inside the perimeter. A good description would be like that of a baseball field, a blue light at first base, red at second, white? at third, and blue at home.  I distinctly remmeber one &quot;mega-light&quot;, white, and if my memory serves me correctly, it lit the point of a cone-like stem protruding down from the underside&apos;s midpoint.  It was absolutely the most fantastic sight I have ever witnessed.  Though the ship appeared to hover directly overhead, it was most certainly ascending in altitude because the lights began to get smaller and smaller.  It was amazing how clear the night was, and I note this because, from my upper right, came this gray cloudy mist, which eventually intercepted with the ship.  Once the mist had cleared, the ship immediately ascended straight up, and within two seconds vanished from vision. After having the privelege of witnessing this breathtaking phenomenon, I am certain that the human race is not the only intelligent life in the universe.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The object was first seen between tree branches on the lower edge of the horizon.  The object was blinking red and white and moving in an unfamiliar fashion.  Did not move like a plane or helicopter.  It hovered and flitted around in a zig-zag.  After a few minutes of this, the object shot straight up in the sky, and hovered there.  Then the color of the lights changed.

We looked up and saw what appeared to be a something in the shape of what is now termed a &quot;flying saucer&quot;. It was probably as high up as how high single-engine airplanes fly. We didn&apos;t believe what we were looking at so we stopped a male adult who was passing by and pointed it out to him. We asked him what it was. He looked up and was as amazed as we were. He said, &quot;I think it&apos;s a UFO&quot;. As children, my brother and I had no idea what that meant.

I noticed a bright light low in the sky just above the tree line The light seemed to have a flashing red light as well. This really bright light seemed to hover and move around in the same area for 15 mins. I repeatedly looked at this light not believing my eyes. There was no explanation for this thing to be there as I often wake up during the night and look at the stars and usually see planes in the sky with flashing red lights going past but this thing was definately not a plane. I was pretty scared and hid under my doona for a while and had to check this thing out again so I sat up in bed and rubbed my eyes to get a better look at this thing but the light was to bright. I then tried to go to sleep again but decided to have another look at this thing and this time there was another bright light high in the sky but appeared bigger than the one lower to the ground and never had a flashing red light and it was just hovering there in the one spot. I tried to go to sleep again but had to check it out again as I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing and this time they had both gone and there was just the usual distant stars in the sky. I live on a property 30kms from town and there is nothing to explain these lights it definately was not a reflection or a plane. I just hope it don&apos;t come back again.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Spotted 5 or more UFOs in Thunder Bay, ON.  Now, apparently up to 12 or more.We first spotted two main blue disks that were pulsating.  It appears white lights were going towards these two main craft.

It was like a shadowy fog sometimes, but flash red occasionally.((NUFORC Note:  The witness does not indicate a date of the sighting, although we believe a date of January 03, 2004, is implied.

PD))", "Three bright lights in triangle formation hovered ststionary above trees over empty house in complete silence, then slowly moved on.   On January 28th, 2004 my wife and I were driving west on Delaware Turnpike, a main road crossing Albany county from east to west and ending in adjacent Schoharie county, where we live.  We were on our way home from an evening church meeting in Delmar, NY, a western and well to do suburb of the state capital, Albany.  It was about 8:45 PM when we left the church.  Once you pass the high school on the outskirts of Delmar, the drive home quickly becomes rural in nature with only five small villages and a few clusterings of homes encountered for the next 30 miles. Our area had received 5&quot; of snow that morning with flurries still coming down out of a completely overcast sky.   Traffic was unusually sparse because of poor road conditions: slick road surface, drifting snow, etc.  It was dark and it was cold, about 10&ordm; F.   We were between Unionville and Clarksville, the first and second of the hamlets along our way, when we noticed two bright lights in the sky ahead and just a little to the right of us.  I first assumed I was watching the approach of a commercial plane that had just penetrated the cloud layer and whose lights were at each wingtip.  But the lights, very white, were also very bright I thought, and steady, they did not blink.  It really gave me the impression of a car approaching with its high beams on.  We continued to drive a minute or two more and I began to see a third light beneath and between the others.  This light was noticeably dimmer than the others and I could just make out the reflected upward curving underside of whatever it was.  But it obviously wasn&apos;t a commercial airplane if I could see the underbelly.  It was at this point I started working furiously to come up with a rational explanation for what I was seeing.  My next thought was that it must be a small civilian aircraft.  But what were they doing up in weather like this?  Lost?  Scared?  Not confident enough to trust their instrumentation and dropped below cloud cover to feel their way home?  At this point al! so I sta rted wondering when this airplane was going to pass us.  It never did.  New thought, it must be a helicopter.  All three lights now appeared to be the same bright intensity and from my perspective formed a triangle pattern.  I had to pay attention to my driving as well as watch the object and was desperately trying to judge scale and distance but in the near total darkness the effort was futile.  I could not get a handle on it.  All I could see were three white lights without the ability to tell how big the object might be or how far away.   And then things got interesting.  As I continued to drive the object appeared to move till it was directly off my left shoulder.  My mind was reeling with the effort to rationally identify this thing so I stopped the car in the middle of the road.  The object wasn&apos;t moving.  It hung perfectly stationary above the tree line and over a house whose occupants were either away or asleep.  I hadn&apos;t been able to see any structure to the object for a few minutes now, and I made one last stab at rational explanation.  I assumed the home owners must have had a ham radio tower in their backyard and had put up some Christmas lights that hadn&apos;t come down yet.  I also concluded that these lights had never moved at all; that our forward motion on the highway had only caused it to appear as if something was approaching us.  I told my wife this, but she said excitedly &quot;roll the window down!&quot;, which I did.  Our radio was not on in the car and there was no sound from outside the vehicle.  I began to feel comfortable with my last diagnosis.  Then she exclaimed, &quot;I&apos;m getting out&quot; and she abruptly and precipitously exited the vehicle.  I felt concerned for her on a road with traffic that travels 50 mph but no one was coming behind or before, so I made a left hand turn into the dark driveway of the house with the Christmas lights.  I pulled ahead till I could clearly see the lights and just sat and watched for a moment or two.  I must admit, I was totally unnerved when all of a sudden the triangle of white lights suddenly drifted off to the east.  Every normal explanation I could think of vanished in an instant.  My first impressions were solidly confirmed; there was something different, unusual, odd, about this whole experience right from the get go.  The object/lights meandered unhurriedly away, my wife got back in the car, and we continued our drive home.  (Let me add that the area this took place is at least 30 miles from any airport and we have no military installations.  Furthermore we have been making this trip twice a! week fo r 13 years and have never seen any commercial aircraft, helicopters, dirigibles or piper cubs low in the sky over Clarksville or anywhere else along our route, ever.  Albany airport is approached from the south and north along the Hudson river many miles away.)     At no time had I entertained any sense of danger, but rather adventure.  My only regret about this episode is that I didn&apos;t try to follow the object.  In hindsight that was foolish, but my wife and I were still a little scrambled inside, still trying to make sense of what we had seen.   I had long thought that interest in the subject of UFO&apos;s had pretty well died out after it&apos;s popularity in the 1970&apos;s.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind was one of the best movies ever made for the genre, but that&apos;s where UFO&apos;s were supposed to be found and should only be found, the movies.  And maybe California.  UFO&apos;s and earthquakes are both found in abundance in California, so I understand, we certainly don&apos;t have them in New York.  Two days after the incident I felt very strange about contacting your site after doing a search for &quot;ufo sightings&quot; on the internet, but there is such a desire to tell someone.  I was amazed at the sheer volume of sightings your website records, and interested at how many of the anecdotal notes have similarities to ours.   My wife and I are both 50 years of age and at the end of a long, happy process raising two good boys and seeing them graduate from college.  I work as a Supervisor of buildings and grounds for the Schenectady ARC (Association for Retarded Citizens).  My wife is a talented Special Ed elementary school teacher in the village of Schoharie where we live.  Her parents are both teachers as well, her father having taught at the University level for many years.  I don&apos;t wear glasses (except for reading), my wife does. Neither of us are on any medications.  We do not drink or do drugs, we do not read UFO literature and we do not dream of flying saucers.   My wife will write her own account of what transpired independently of mine, and I will not show her what I&apos;ve written above until she does.  However, I need to end this by stating that a wife&apos;s desires are not always to be heeded, and that it&apos;s not always a good idea to pay too much attention to what a woman wants.  On the way to church that night the country roads were in such a snowbound condition she asked if we could take the Thruway home instead, a particularly unusual request for her.  Like most good husbands I would have been happy enough to oblige, it didn&apos;t matter to me either way really.  But after church I began our trip home the usual route, and nothing more was said.  Would you all agree, she owes me?((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and he impressed us with his objectivity and sober-minded demeanor.  We suspect the event occurred as described above.  We are awaiting illustrations from the two witnesses.  PD))", "Matelic cylindrical object sighted from Navy P3 Orion from above, houvering near Lookeed instalation.I was in the Navy reserve from 78 through 85. I was an AE3-Aviation Electrican&apos;s mate third class and was attached to a P3 squadren at NAS Moffett Field in Mountain View CA. I was later, after graduation, selected to attend Aviation Offer&apos;s Candate School, Pensacola FL. I was living in Pasadena at the time, and was utilizing our P3 anti submarine aircraft as an airlift to my duty station once a month from southern CA. At the time I was a student pilot, with about 70 hours on the books and countless hundreds of hours flying &quot;dead head&quot; on board Navy aircraft and general aviation aircraft. I have been around aircraft all of my life. My father was an accomplished pilot, and at times we owned two aircraft when I was a youngster. The sighting occured shortly after takeoff from NAS Moffett Field enroute to Yuma AZ and then over to Burbank CA where I was to disembark. I was not an official part of the flight crew on this flight but I always managed to stay bussy helping the crew, listening to radio transmissions and playing with the inertial nav equipment. We were under condition Five, meaning we were all to be strapped in in spacific places until the skipper called condition two. I was seated on the floor,strapped to the bulkhead, facing backwards on the left side of the airplane. Next to me was the emergency over wing  exit door that had a window in it, offering a great view of anything passing behind the wing, and with almost an unlimited visibility up forward and to the rear. We had taken off to the North and executed a long 180 degree climbing turn to the South. We were climbing through about 6,500 th 8,500 for flight level-2300. (Turboprops do best around that level.) I was curiously looking out my window, and I could see San Jose airport about 10 to 15 miles to the east. Beneith us was Santa Clara I believe, with residential, and commericial type of development. Suddenly, and I do mean suddenly I spotted &quot;what appeared to be&quot; a metallic cylinder houvering just slightly below our altitude off to our left. Now I say houvering for a reason. As someone who flew many hours in both left and right seats, I developed this uncanny ability, as do all pilots to judge distances, proportions speeds-energy states, even direction utilizing visual skills most people never develop. It&apos;s almost like a kinsthetic ability you develop when you fly a lot. Additionally I think I should add here that my eyesight then was better than 20:20 in both eyes, and my color comprehension was off the scale, and my depth perception was flawless. With that, here Is what I preceived. Again the cylender appeared to have no motion, only a relitive motion to us. If it was moving, it was moving very slowly. I guessed its distance from us to be less than one mile and perhaps as close as a quartes mile. Either way, it was way, way too close for confort, especially since he was not in communication with Oakland flight watch nor was he transponding-obviously. I estimated the size of the &quot;craft&quot; to be between 20 and 40 feet high and between 7 and 13 feet in diameter, a ratio of about 3 to 1, heighth to diameter. Again, it was slightly below us, and again depending on the actual distance I am guessing he was only 100 to 300 feet lower, but not more than that. There was no one near me, and we were under condition five so there wasn&apos;t anything I could do to get another whitness. The object dissappeared behind and below the horizontal stablizer after about 15 seconds of observation by me. Not only was this thing matellic, but it looked like chrome, like a merror. Infact I was surprized I spotted it as it blended so well into the suroundings. From below it would be very difficult to see. I should add that Moffett Field was located right next to Lookheeds major instalation, with satelite tracking stations and all sorts of facilities. That compound is like a small city un to itself. May be this was one of thiers, or the Russians, who knows. All I know is that I saw it and for some strange reason I haven&apos;t told very many people. There was one very strange thing that I should report in reference to this sighting, and it is strange. The moment I saw this thing, and once I got a fix on it, ie its size,speed distance and all of that, I got the strongest feeling from deep inside myself that &quot;I was not suposed to be seeing this.&quot; It was almost like a voice in my head had stated that to me.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

North bound on I-5, bright happy sunny day, load of tomatoes behind my 18 wheeler.    Suddenly as I aproach the intersection of 198 and I-5 (Harris Ranch), oh say a few miles south of the air field, I see clearly thru the bug spattered windshield, an airfoil of some kind apparently taking off from the runway at the Texaco station of Harris Ranch Inn.  I say to him &quot;get it up, get it up, get it up&quot; becuase his angle of attack is nearly paralell to the ground to gain sufficient speed for take-off.  The wing-like aeroplan-apparition, white or silver in color then lifted at a very shallow angle and accelerated to an incredible speed directly northbound over I-5, I noticed that his wing-tips grew smaller and smaller, closer and closer together untill it was just a dot that disapeard within 5-6 seconds.  At first I thought it was a Cessna or Beech or duster on the field.  Cant say weather it took off north or south of 198, but is was no jet and thats for sure.

PD))Many objects appearing to be spheres, made up of erratic squiggly lines at various altitudes.2-4-2004 19:00 I am a computer network engineer, and musician. I saw a bright light in the sky to the west at 30 degrees above the horizon which appeared to be over Sagamore Hills which is about two miles from where I was standing in Northfield, Ohio, which was way too brilliant to be a star. When obtaining binoculars, I saw that it appeared to be a sherical shape which was made up of continually changing irregular squiggly lines, looking to be white on the southern most hemisphere, and lime green on the northern hemisphere. This brilliant object was sitting still for about 20 minutes, then slowly moved westward till out of sight at about 30 mph. I took pictures with a digital camera and they revealed a small &quot;horseshoe shaped object&quot; that was moving so fast it created the image that it was a sphere, leaving tracers. I looked around the sky and saw a similar object which was blue and white and had blue lights flashing around the center of the sphere. The blue lights appeared as some light colored blue LED&apos;s moving around as a marquee would. This object was about 75 degrees above the horizon to the east and a little to the south. It hovered there for about the same time. I noticed about 6 or 8 of these object much higher in the sky, but were very similar except they were white and red looking spheres. They remained stationary as well.Around the brightest one (the one I mentioned first) I noticed several smaller red orbs (almost translucent) that weren&apos;t flashing, but consistantly transparent red. There was airline traffic in the vacinity, and could tell very distinctly that these objects did not have the same kind of std. red and white flashing lights like commercial aircraft do.They were moving around the bright object in slow horizontal straight lines north and south and at very slow inclines and descents as to be making passes around the bright sphere, both back and forth. Three hours later I captured some more wierd light patterns which could&apos;ve been mistaken for some type of military craft moving about the sky researching, with no noise. There were plenty of witnesses here, and my son called his friends locally and they saw the lights as well. It was very cold out, and the sky was very clear.

In the sky were to different lights moving around in the sky. The odd things were that they only appeared in the clouds, not in the sky, and they changed direction. After about twenty minutes another one joined them. My mother and two brothers came out to see them. All three were spining in an oval, and would disapear once they left from the clouds into the sky, then they would reapear once they entered there part of orbit that was in the sky. About twenty minutes later a fourth one joined them. Thats when there orbit changed. It spined counterclockwise in a circle, and after completing a few rotations the lights would cross and end up on then continue spinning. Then as the clouds floated away, we lost visual of them. I called the airport to see if they new anything about it, and they didn&apos;t. I took a picture of them when there were four, I could only see two of them in the picture, then I enhanced it, and I counted seventeen.

I was assigned to the 2343rd Air Force Reserve Flying Center (AFRFC) at Portland Oregon . Even though we were regular Air Force , we had to go to Chico, California with the reserve unit for two weeks summer encampment during the first part of August each year .I do not remember the exact time, date or year, of this event, as we went to Chico for 4-5 years. I was in the cockpit of a C-46 in a four plane formation that had been out over the Pacific Ocean for night time navigation training.  (Long before GPS) The navigators used a sextant through the astrodome (glass bubble) on top of the aircraft to determine our location.We had completed the over water training and were headed southeast back toward Chico  which was  35-50 miles distance, when we noticed a bright cherry red fireball coming from the south at a very high rate of speed. It had a vibrating ,quivering motion as it headed north. We were flying at 8,000-9,000 ft. and the fireball passed across in front of us from the 12:00 o&apos;clock to the 9:00  o&apos;clock positions.  It was level to slightly below our altitude. It was about the size of a dime at arms length  at its closest point. As the fireball got in our 10:00 o&apos;clock position it split into 3-4 pieces.These pieces all continued north , more or less parallel to each other. When we landed at the base in Chico most of the ground crew that were waiting to  park and service the aircraft after we landed had seen the fire ball pass at about a 30 degree angle to the west of them.Over the next few days we heard that the fireball was first seen over southern California. After it passed in front of us , the pieces supposedly  joined back together over Klamath Falls, Oregon where it hovered for a short while. Then flew off to the north. About  that time we had a C-46 transporting  another flight engineer ,who had injured his back , to our home base at Portland ,Oregon.  The injured man and the flight engineer of the aircraft were both close friends of mine.   As they were on the final approach to the base , the control tower called them and told them to make a &quot;go-around,&quot; as a UFO was following them in for landing. They applied power, raised the landing gear and the flaps and made a  &quot;go -around&quot;  to the left.  The UFO followed them down across the runway, then it also headed north. From what I remember the UFO was last seen near the Canadian border. Total elapsed time from  Southern California to the Canadian Border was  about 5 minutes. I have tried (to no avail) to go into the archives of  some of the newspapers  in that area to find and record of this incident.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, although we have invited the witness to investigate whether he can determine the date unambiguously, as well as contact other members of the flight and have them submit independent reports about their recollections of the event.  PD", "3 objects with a trail of smoke attached hovered together in the sky over the expresswayWhile on I-495 S. towards Richmond, VA, heading home from work, I sat in very slow traffic and observed what I thought was airplane smoke left behind in a very clear sky, a perfectly straight line. I was in so much traffic that I reached max. speed of approximately 5 mph every minute or so. This is when I noticed that the straight line I thought to be left in the sky by an airplane was instead attached to a light of some type moving slowly across the sky from east to west. This line of smoke remained intact with the craft. I then noticed 2 more traveling together across the sky. I believed them to be normal aircraft until they performed a strange maneuver in sync with one another. The sun was beginning to set and the line of smoke attached to the craft was becoming the color of the pink sky. The first object began to descend in a very slanted motion and the other two followed, one hanging back a bit further than the other. As the objects descended further, the slant they were on began to appear like they were taking a nosedive, then began somewhat of a hovering movement. These objects along with the smoke at their tail, which was now a very bright pink light as the sunset, appeared to stop descending. It&apos;s very difficult to explain, but somehow the trail of smoke that was attached as a tail was now above the objects, almost like the trail was a very bright light being shined out of the top of the craft, but it still resembled smoke of some kind. All 3 objects just sat there in the sky. This went on for the 15 or 20 minutes that I was stuck in traffic in that area. As I began to merge onto I-95 2 more lines of &quot;smoke&quot; began coming from west to east. I can not say what came of these objects, as they were out of my view as I entered I-95. However, this is the first of many observances over the past week since 12/30/03.((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the possibility of contrails would be the first item to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the objects were UFO&apos;s.

I was but twelve years old, my cousin two years older, and as we walked down to the gated community&apos;s (Lake of the Pines) clubhouse, we noticed the dogs that night barked more than what one would consider to be normal.  It was on our return home at 8:30 PM that we both looked up into the night sky, and there passing between the break in clouds directly overhead from west to east ,making no sound, a long oblong shaped craft that would dwarf a conventional 747 aircraft.  Located at the front of the craft on its side, a spectrum of bright colored rings reasembling a bull&apos;s eye. As the craft had passed we noticed that the dogs began to bark again, for all was quiet in that 45 seconds as it passed overhead.  We also became aware after it was over, that neither one of us told the other to look up at the exact same time, at the exact same spot in the sky, we just did. My cousin has put this behind her, regarding it as a strange event.  But my dreams of strange symbols and equations that make no sense to me, has never left my mind from that night forward.  It helps my well-being to speak of this for the first time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

She said there was something in the air. So I went to the door and saw something rising straight up in the air. I could see blinking lights in the shape of a triangle. After a few minutes, it stopped mid-air. After sitting there for a couple seconds, I couldn&apos;t see the blinking lights any more and it began moving straight and then right over my house. The lights that were facing me when it was going straight up were now on the bottom of the UFO, so I believe the UFO was rising with the nose in the air. We watched it until it was out of sight. It was heading North West. Also, my dogs were freaking out the whole time it was near.", "A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY WITH A NARROW LINE GOING DOWN TO THE ROOF ETC. IT &quot;READ&quot; ME AND HID ITSELFWhat my grandma and I saw was unbelievable. The whole experience took anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes. It was late at night, like about 1:30 am, in 1999 (Im not 100% sure of the year, or date, though). We lived (myself and the family still does) in a one-bedroom apartment. The windows are facing the back yard and an abandoned building.But if you look out of the window, to the right, you can see a crack which lets you see the buildings further down the block and a few blocks thereafter. That night my grandma came over so I gave up my living room bed and slept on the couch. Well anyways, granny wanted to go to sleep so I turned off the lights. As I was heading to sleep, I passed the window and noticed a bright, strange-looking white light hovering above one of the apartment buildings further down the block. There wasn&apos;t much room to see it but I noticed it for the sole reason that it was so BRIGHT. At first I figured it was some crazily helicopter but it was absolutely silent, and it was so dark out that I could not see the structure of the object other than its light(s). As I came closer to the window I noticed that the light had a narrow but bright,white line (like a beam) coming down from it to the roof of the building and right on top of the roof, this line was connected to something rotating on the roof in a circular motion. I couldn&apos;t tell what it was, but I could certainly tell that it was rotating extremly fast and voilently. Right about then I was thinking UFO. After about 5 minutes of glaring at the object(s)I went to find my binoculars so I could take a better look but I had no luck as everyone was sleeping; Then I woke up my grandma, who was almost asleep and told her to take a look at this unbelievable thing. Granny wanted to turn on the light so she could see it better but that didn&apos;t help, so I turned the light back off. Right after, the object&apos;s narrow, bright line swooped to our window and shined a light directly at us through our window for about 3-5 seconds. It felt like a helicopter shining its light at somebody on the street except it was at least 1/7th to 1/8th (a guess) of a mile away, much too far. Imagine a giant searchlight on the roof of a 5 story building shining at you directly through your window. I guess that meant that it could probably tell that we were observing it because of the light switching. Well anyways, it felt like the light was &quot;reading&quot; me.

Right after, the narrow line came back to initial p! osition and, along with the rotating object(s)appeared to have moved from the roof and into the bright light on top of them. Suddenly, the light slowly dissappeared behind the building and I never saw it again. By the way, it was very possible for other people in my building to see this, but most of them were probably asleep. And, oh yeah; One of my friends from high school tried to make me promise to never tell this experience to anyone ever again after I told it to him (we are not friends anymore). Who knows why he asked me, but the fact that someone like that seriously told me never to give this info away is crazy. I HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SAY WHATS ON MY MIND.

I think the event lasted less then 5 seconds. The lights had the image/shape of two stars. One stood lower than the other. It made no sound. At that time I was walking on the street with two familymembers. They were looking the other way and didn&apos;t see it. the sky was divided with some low hanging clouds and bright parts. Much higher I also saw and heard many planes (5 or 6). It looked if they were surching. I wonder if they might have noticed it to. 10 o 15 Min. later I still saw the planes flying around further away going east.I have never seen such a thing(s) before.

I live at the elevation of 2400 ft and this was well above that. I was viewing it from a high open unobstrcted ridge. It was not moving and that was the reason I noticed it so much. As I drove my mother home on my way back to my house there it still was ...not moving just hovering over the ridge. At first I thought it might be a helicopter but there was no sound. I stopped and watched it for another ten minutes. Then I went to get my son to have another witness and we then watched it together for ten more minutes. Then it looked like it moved a little to the east and then it just disappeared. I am a 53 year old art teacher. It was a very clear night. I have lived here for 24 years.

I&apos;m including this added report for our siting because today Sat Jan 24 we looked at the video clips that my 14 year old son took the night of the siting and Wow! We put these on our computer and what looked like a fireball is blown up on the screen and you can easily see what is inside of the fireball, a shaped solid craft surrounded by the firery lights of the fireball. These pictures are incredible! The camera had a 460x digital zoom sony brand. This zoom enables us to see inside the fireball just enough to blow our minds!((END #1))((ADDENDUM #2, SUBMITTED 08FE04))video freeze framing reveals fireball turning into a rod of  11 connected smaller light balls and then going back into a fireball shapeThis report is an extention of my other two reports for this date. The video footage of this event of Jan 21,04 is astounding.  In freeze framing the video by way of milli seconds I have been able to see things which I could not see that night by my naked eyes. The computer enables me to not only freeze a milli second but to blow it up much larger to see just what it is or might be. There is a series of photos that I can only describe as the  fireball spliting up into many smaller balls of light all attached in a long rod like formation of 11 balls of various pastel colors of light and then it goes into a progression of from 11 balls of light to 10 to 8 to 4 to 2 to one the fireball shape. It does this a few times where it goes from a long rod of attached balls of light to a single fireball of light.  This is incredible and it happens so fast it could not be seen until the video was freeze framed.  In other photos is is obvious that the solid white interior of the fireball is moving very fast because it changes it position and angle continually. There is another unexplainable part of this footage that puzzels me. In the bottom of the screen there is a very small dancing ball of light that at first I dismissed because it was so small in comparison to the main fireball . This tiny ball of light moves from side to side and and then at the end of the video the main fireball seems to disappear and reappear at the bottom of the screen very small with the other very small ball of light. It seems to be communicating with that tiny ball of light. We could not see this tiny ball of light with the naked eye that night of the sighting.((END #2))", "1985 ufo over Magnolia Public SchoolAppox 10 pm I was sitting watching tv with my parents.when the tv got fuzzy. we heard some people making noise outside a few minutes later. when my dad looked outside to see what was going on he called us all outside. directly across the street from my house is a school yard , aprox. 100 yards away. hovering aprox 200 feet above the school was a huge bright white completely illuminated egglike sphere with a band of changing colored lights along the perimiter of this craft. we are located about 20 miles from phila. inter.airport. we were out side along with all of our neighbors looking up at this object it was about the size of a football feild. when airport traffic paterns came in our direction the object would black out almost invisible but because of our close distance we could still see it. we tried to call the local news stations but all outgoing calls ended busy even to other phones in our house as if it was jamming the phone lines and the cable was messy too.the object hovered silent for apox. 20 - 25 minutes the ramped up i guess is the best way to describe it , (it started speeding up the color changing lights as if it was building power) and it took off straight up in the air at a speed unimaginable, so fast it left a visual trail of light in the air almost like if you span a picture of a moving light it trails.everyone stayed out side for a while and taked about what it might be. we never saw it again.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was dark out so we couldn&apos;t really see anything but the lights at first.  We got a bit freaked out then because it was not moving.  It was just hovering in one spot and that is when we realized that it was not an airplane or a helicopter or anything.  As we kept driving it was directly above us, and it looked light a big circle with lights on it, and from the lights we could see beams of light coming off of them that looked a bit like the Northern Lights.  We kept driving and then in the sky out my right window we could see a circular ball of light that was bluish-green.  The ball of light would divide and split into 4 balls of light and the 4 balls of light went around in a circle and then combined in the middle again to make one ball.  Then it would go all over again.

However, since this happened tonight, I can&apos;t focus on anything else.  First, I noticed what I took to be an exploding star in the east as I was driving home at approximatley 19 hundred hours (7:15pm, Jan. 20th, 2004.  Moments later as I came to the end of one road and make a right I spotted my neighbor&apos;s dog crossing at this intersection, and escorted her safely home. Then I was back in my car, backing out of my neighbor&apos;s driveway.  As I swung my car around and cleared the side of their home, and now crossways in the road, directly in front of me is an access road leading down around the back of my neighbors home to a backyard area (small meadow). Anyhow, about 1/4 of a football field in front of me, and directly straight up, about 1/3 length of a football field was what looked like a light fixture one would see at a football stadium.   It had three or four large lenses, (side by side) each a medium-bright glowing white light.  It did not have a &quot;beam&quot; that blinded me, but just hung there and was bright and glared. I looked beyond the side of the lights to glimpse at what was holding this up there.  What I saw was an outline showing that it curved away and behind the &quot;set of lights&quot;. I pulled my car ahead and to the side of the road trying to keep an eye on it to get a better look through my passenger side window....when it just disappeared.   I was at their home for only a few minutes to deliver their dog to them and it wasn&apos;t there when I took the dog home.  I came home; called my neighbor, and went back to their home to discuss and point out what I had seen.  They, like me, are mystified.", "Long duration sighting, likely at least 10 miles distance, but undoubtedly strange behavior.I was walking my dog West, on Ole Daniel Boone Road, toward I-75. I had been watching the sky quite a bit because Mars had been close to Earth and this is also the first I have lived back out away from city lights in about 10 years. There was what I thought was a star, cradled in a dip in the tree line. It looked large the way Mars had, so I was particulary interested, though Mars at this time of night was SouthEast. I thought it might be a larger planet or something, but when my dog stopped to go to relieve himself, I realized that it was moving. There were powerlines that also ran through the dip in the tree line that gave a point of reference and it was moving in relation to that, most noticeably. I figured that it would be gone shortly, so I stood a and watched it a while. I didn&apos;t think it&apos;s movement was anything a helicopter couldn&apos;t do, but I also knew, from a figure I&apos;d just heard that it costs about $500/hr. to operate a helicopter and that helicopters are typically going somewhere. What point would there be to just bobbing and drifting side, after dark? I was basically white and oval and some times seemed to shade to having a blue-ish halo. The center never changed colors. I kept expecting it to dart off as they supposedly do, but after a while, I decided I wanted to see if I could get some witnesses, so I could talk about it to somebody without them thinking I was making it up. So, we ran back to my fourplex where we have a second floor apartment, where my wife, sister-in-law and nephew were. I breathlessly  (I&apos;m overweight) told them to come out on the balcony, hoping that it would still be there. It was a little harder to see, because there&apos;s a big orange security light behind the building, but it was still there. We stood back there and watched it and talked about it for a long time, and we all were kind of waiting for it to dart off, but it just bobbed and weaved. I actually knelt down and put my chin on the heels of my hands to make sure my head moving wasn&apos;t making it look like some fixed object was moving because the treeline was only about 100 yards away. I saw on FOX that a lot of people watching Area 51 thought they were seeing a UFO weave side to side, but that they were seeing an airliner, bringing people to work there, correcting itself, as it was approaching a runway. So we talked about that for a while and decided that if we were watching a plane from head-on that it would eventually make some progress, but it never seemed to. My nephew didn&apos;t really understand what it was and was starting to get bored and acting up a little bit, so we actually all just finally went inside and the clock showed it was 10:10, but my wife sets it up a few minutes so she won&apos;t be late for work, where there&apos;s a fast clock. When my sister-in-law left, about 30 minutes later, we looked again from the parking lot to see if it was still there and we didn&apos;t see it, but she later told us that as she was driving home she could see it, West of I-75, but South of where she lives in Lexington. If I had to guess, I believe the light was between Richmond and Nicholasville, KY. I would not have reported this, normally, but I have just read the story of what happened in Morehead, KY and the c! rop formation in Flemingsburg. Though this may not be a particularly interesting UFO story, it may be significant that there was a certain level of activity in Central and Eastern Kentucky, within a certain time frame. I am going to e-mail an animated gif I have created in photoshop to demonstrate, in a very simple way, how it behaved, though it didn&apos;t move quite this jerky and had no particular pattern of movement.((NUFORC Note:  We have altered the date above to 2003, which we believe is what the witness intended.

The 134 Freeway then turns into the 101 Freeway going north.  Once I was on the 101, I noticed the the craft was traveling at a very low speed (traffic below was moving at least 65mph) while the craft slowly moved east.  The four lights were very bright and the craft itself was black with no reflection to the solid (metal?) frame. As I came up to the side of the craft (my driver side), I noticed that the craft was in a trianular shape with a smaller triagular shape tail at it&apos;s end (like a whales fin - flat).  Once I passed the craft, from the back, you could barley see the it.  The lights that were bright from the front, where not visible from behind. Some how, the crafts metal frame was absorbing the light that it was giving off (four front lights were bright, but gave no reflection to the craft, unlike the lights on a car, once you get close enough, you can see the detail of the grill). Last night a good friend of mine told me that he saw the same craft on Sunday, Feb. 8th at 8:00pm over the 90 Freeway (Marina Del Rey Freeway). He gave me the same discript of craft and it&apos;s movement.", "Changed shape from a white ball of bright light to a triangle looking object. Only colors were bright white. Unearthly type speed.My mom told me before she left to eventually let my dog out of his inside cage because she new if I didnt he would have an accident in it. At approximately 6:30 PM, I put my dog on his leash and I took hime outside so that he could go to the bathroom. While he was going to the bathroom I glanced around the night sky like usual, except I noticed a bright light that looked like either an extremely bright star or a ufo. At first, I really thought it was a star so I almost didnt bother going to get my binoculars but I was intrigued by it very much, so I decided to go get them out of my room anyway. Before I took my dog inside and myself, I focused on the position of the ufo in the night sky, therefore I would know whether it moved or not when I came back. The ufo/star was above the trees in my woods and to the north. I quickly ran into my room and snatched my binoculars, as fast as I possibly could. Once I arrived again into the garage, I put on my dogs leash and we both ventured back outside to see what I thought, at that point, was a ufo/star. Once outside the door, I noticed that the ufo/star was still to the north but below the trees in my woods. It had definitely moved significantly.Then I decided it was time to look out through the binoculars at the object.I was startled by the objects appearance, it looked to me like a huge white ball in the night sky. Though I wasnt convinced it was a ufo until the object changed shape into a triangle looking object. I noticed this when I wasnt looking through my binoculars, the object went from a very bright plasma looking light, to were it looked like a strange looking dim star in the night sky. I now really realized something strange was up there. I took another peek through my binoculars and the bright ball of illuminated light was now in the form of a triangle type shape.It constantly was shifting from ball of light to the triangle type shape. Another bizarre instance with this object was that I&apos;d be looking at it and all of a sudden you would lose it. I remember taking off my binoculars to see if it disappeared or if it moved. Sure enough the object moved so fast that while I was peering through my binoculars I didnt even notice its quick movement. The object didnt move far when it did this it just moved beyond my ability to see it do so. This object stayed to the north the whole sighting, it just was constantly in different places. After this point, I was almost positive this was a ufo. I stayed out there from approximately 6:30 to 7:28. At 7:28 PM, I went inside because the object suddenly disappeared while I was looking at it through my binoculars. It was absolutely incredible, the object was gone before I could even blink an eye, I almost dropped my binoculars, I was stunned by how fast it disappeared. The object moved faster than anything I&apos;ve ever seen move on Earth. After this experience, I took another quick look out into the night sky to see if it appeared anywhere else, but it was gone. I&apos;m totally positive this was a true ufo sighting.", "Observed object bluish/white in color streaking toward the surface of earth; then change directions instantly heading back into the s.I am now a retired police officer. At the time of the event I was still serving as a police offficer. I was on my way to work, on my motorcycle. At the time the area was very rural area. There were no other vehicles on the road, no street lights and no homes in the area. I observed a very brillant bluish/white light streaking toward the earth. The object was about one mile wsw of the intersection of Hwy. 88 and Kimmerling road and at an elevation of no more than 3,000 feet. I recall thinking to myself, &quot;Wow! this shooting star is going to impact the surface&quot;. Wanting to witness the impact, I stopped to watch and had thought it might be interesting to try and recover some segment of the object. At about that time, the object stopped it&apos;s almost verticle descent and shoot up at a forty-five degree angle in a nnw direction. the object remained brilliantly bright during the entire incident.

It left a long grayish green jet trail. I never saw where it went as there was like an explosion to the south that lit up the forest with a green glow. I compared the explosion to the smoke of a shuttle launch. I heard only 2 other voices on my CB radio(I am a truck driver)who saw this. One was as excited as I was and he also saw the same thing and was amazed that the entire cab of his truck was illuminated too. The other voice had no emotion or excitement in it and all he said was that was a meteorite.", "prior to the football game between Iowa&amp;Florida several aircraft flew over the stadium. four military jets, four doublewinger aircraft, and one single commerical small jet. There was also a military sky jumper involved in the before game activities. I was home at my apartment approximatly less than a mile from the stadium. The aircrafts noise alert me, and I grabbed my Nikon 10X50 6 degree glasses to get a better view of the action. It was during the sky jumper that I notice the UFO. It was triangle shape with sparking flashing lights at each tip. It flew North, and was visible just barely due to heavy clouds in his area of flight only. The other activites aircrafts where performing in perfect VFR condition for viewing.I am 71 years old, retired after 34 years with the Department of the Army. This is my first UFO report, ever.

There were two outer red lights with a white light in the center of each of the objects. The formation then broke into 2 groups of 3. 3 moved to the west, the other 3 moved to the southeast. From our vantage point from a second story apartment balcony, I would estimate that the objects were approximately (at first) 15 -20 miles to the northwest at an altitude of approx. 5 - 10 thousand feet. The objects appeared to travel at a steady pace; somewhat faster than would an airliner. The westward moving objects went out of visual range within about 3 minutes. The three ojbects moving to the southeast passed just to the west of the apartment complex. It also seemed that two of the objects passing over the area where we were were gaining altitude, while the third remained at consistent level. There was no sound that could be heard from the objects. As they were passing above us, I pointed out a high flying airliner to my friend, to compare the difference of the airliner&apos;s running lights as compared to the objects. The original formation&apos;s exact location would most likely have been about 2 -3 miles northwest of downtown Indianapolis.One interesting point is that while I was in route to the apartment complex, I noticed airliners coming in to the airport on their regular flight paths with what looked to me to be extremely - almost excessive - displays of brilliant &quot;collision&quot; lights. They were so bright that when I spotted the first one, I wasn&apos;t sure if I was actually seeing an in-coming aircraft or a brilliant UFO. This would have been about 30 minutes prior to the sighting of the formation from the balcony. On my way home, at about 9 PM, I couldn&apos;t help but noticed that all large in-coming aircraft to Indianapolis International were displaying the same &quot;excessive&quot; brilliance as the ones that I had seen about an hour before. This causes me to wonder if what we saw from the ! balcony was only the final minutes of an episode that had gone on in the skies above the city for some time. I have seeen UFO&apos;s before this incident, and would like to think of myself as a seasoned &quot;sky watcher&quot;. I have become familiar with aircraft standard night time appearnces and proceedures   in the area. From the points mentioned in the above despription, I would have to say that there was nothing &quot;standard&quot; regarding the brilliance of the aircraft or the appearance, movement, and formation of the unknown objects.", "I tried to get on to Art Bell on 1/17/04, but could not. What compelled me to write was that a) I am a journalist, and you talked about why journalists don&apos;t report, and b) I heard a woman from Phoenix talk about how a laser shot down from a craft she observed in 1997.I am not sure of the date I witnessed the craft I saw, although I could do more research if you are really interested, but I think it might have been June, 1995 or possibly, June 1997. I remember that one of the Batman movies was premiering because I thought this triangular shaped black object might be advertisubg that.It was about 4 pm... and I was sitting in the living room of my apartment, which was situated on the thrid floor of a condo adjacent to Beverly Hills. I happened to notice an object in the sky, off to the east, which I realized was not moving. After several minutes of glancing back and forth at this object, I went to get my binoculars. The object was standing practically still and it was a black tiangular shape. When I peered at it through the binoculars, I saw what I recall as orange lights along the bottom side of the craft. I tried to phone the Beverly Hills Police department, but they were not interested. They refered me elsewhere and before it was over, I&apos;d phoned the LAPD, Beverly Hills Police, and a military base, recomended to me by whomever I spoke to at the police station. The amazing thing was no one seemed to believe me. I remember wanting to got get a neighbor to see, but I was afraid that if I left this object, it would dissappear and when I brought someone back, they would think I was nuts. So I stayed put. I had no film in the camera...which I cursed myself for...so all I could do was watch. The amazing thing was that I seemed to be the only one to see it. I remember asking some one from the police department to &apos;just go outside and look!&apos; and they acted as if I were nuts. Towards the end of the experience, I saw a laser type beam come from the craft down... and because I had been in this apartment during the Northridge Earthquake, and saw the power plant expolode and all the lights flash on and off, I felt as if the beam was going down to where the power plant was. That made me wonder if somehow this craft had to gain power from the transformers there.After about 40 minutes, this simply dissapeared. One minuet I saw it, and the next, I did not.

Some of our other co-workers who left in 1 car just before us turned back to tells us there are U.F.O.s in the sky so my friend and i drove towards it but it must have been really far away because we weren&apos;t getting any closer but the light was so bright we thought it was close. It started off as 4 seperate crafts, although like one i had seen months before i couldnt see the actual craft just one bright like to each craft.  The lights started off as 3 in a line then one under the middle light. As we got closer we could only see 3 then one would be really low to the ground then one would be really high.  The formations were always changing but the lights were always where we could see them.

After visiting your site I thought it might be a good opportunity to share it with others who have had experiences with UFO&apos;s. It was during the summer of 1982. My highschool buddy (we were both 17 at the time) and I were just arriving at his father&apos;s home. It was getting pretty late (just after 9:00 pm), but there still was some sunlight in the sky. His father lived in the west side, upper floor of a fourplex. The unit was quite high and you had to take the stairs up to the second level. While walking up the stairs my friend pointed west and said &quot;Look, a ufo!&quot; I looked in that direction and could not see anything. There was a large tree next to the home and between us and the ufo. he pointed at the object again and I still could not see it. I asked him to describe the object. He told me it was a large glowing redish/orange ball and it was moving up, then across the sky. Note that Kelowna is located in a valley which holds a large lake. The main city center is on the east side of the lake. The area that we were located was near the downtown core or only a kilometer east of the lake. My friend indicated that the glowing ball appeared to be over the lake, or at least 1 1/2 km from where we were. The object disappeared and I remember being so disappointed I didn&apos;t get a look at it. Especially because my friend said he had seen it so clearly. From there, we both climbed onto the high roof and began to watch the sky as it darkened. We layed on the roof which faced West for quite awhile (approx - 1/2 - 45 minutes)seeing nothing. Just before we were to head into the house I saw something that I could barely believe. High in the sky, there was a formation of faint triangular shaped objects flying across the sky. (There was very light cloud cover, however they were definitely above the clouds.) They gave off a faint white light and were moving from South West to North East. They weren&apos;t moving very fast at all however all of a sudden you&apos;d see one of the objects leave the formation at an incredible speed and sweep away. It would take angles at such a high speeds that flying aircraft that I have seen could  never make. (not even fighter jets.)  For the next 15 minutes triangular shaped objects joined or left the formation. I was simple astonished by the ease the objects moved at such speeds. When they rejoined the formation they would swoop in and stop in perfect position. I regularily asked my friend what he was seeing and he repeated exactly what I had just saw. Once I got up and contacted a local radio station to see if anyone else was witnessing what we were seeing. Soon the formation moved out of sight. We stayed around for another 1/2 or so. We saw a few more triangular objects moving back and forth through the sky. (Some in formation with each other, say two to four objects.)  After it was all over my friend and I just sat and talked about this experience. We have never seen anything like it since.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to have his friend submit a report, as well.  Very interesting report, we believe.

The objects looked small and far away to the naked eye.

I turned on Schmidt Lane which is that first road that is on the left after Blue Cut Rd and it kept on going slowly toward the southwest. I looked down at the speedometer to see how fast I was going and when I looked up it was gone. I was driving about 10 miles an hour. It wasn&apos;t a blimp and it wasn&apos;t a plane or a helicopter.

I didn&apos;t think this was a meteor because it was to large to be a meteor that burned in the atmospere (unless this meteor didnt burn up much).  This object resembled a flare, but it couldn&apos;t have been that either due to flares having a longer light life.

The event took place on Dell Road in the town of Heath, Mass, approximately halfway up the road. I owned property on the left side of the road at that time and a friend and me were basically just camping out on the properyt and parking alongside the road. The location of the event is fairly close to the Rowe Nuclear Power Plant and sightings at that time were very common around that nuclear power plant, unfortunately at the time there was no way to report such encounters.

It kind of startled us, we thought maybe a police car had pulled up behind us and was wondering what we were doing parked in such an isolated location. At least that was my first thought and my first comment. We were facing uphill and know there was no vehicle in front of us. I thought it had to be behind us, I rolled down my window and looked to the rear of the vehicle and there were no other vehicles on the road. I then looked up and there was a huge, very huge, object just above the treetops covering us and both sides of the road with lights underneath, the only way I can describe the lights are flashing and swirling. The exact size of the object had to be at least 40 feet in diameter and absolutely silent, it made not one bit of noise! At that point, I rolled up my window, started up the vehicle and slammed it into gear and took the uphill road with the pedal to the floor and did not look back. When we got to the top of the hill we parked at Heath Center, just past the town hall. At that point we weren&apos;t quite sure what happened.

The sky was bright and clear. They were flying in a triangle formation.When they were close enough for me to identify them, they looked like three burning, smoking clouds. They were no more than 200 feet high, and they passed almost directly overhead. The bottom of these &quot;clouds&quot; looked like pure flame, violently churning inward toward the middle. The tops of these &quot;clouds&quot; were sort of bubbling, as the smoke did not rise in a column, but stayed with the body of these clouds of flame and smoke. I have never seen clouds like this before, nor have I seen any since. Some might think that the sun was setting, so the bottom of the clouds were reflecting the sun, but very high in the sky, I could see white clouds, and for them not to reflect the same red from the sun should be proof enough that it was not taken at sunset. These three clouds made no sound as they passed overhead at about two hundred feet, and traveling 60 to 80 miles an hour. These three clouds looked totally out of place for the sky above them. As they traveled toward me, a small amount of &quot;smoke&quot; did trail off from them. I remember the feeling of the hairs on my arm standing up, but I attributed this to static electricity. I remember thinking how weird, and unnatural they looked, but my first thought was they were some kind of tempture anomaly. Now all this would be left up to speculation, and disbelief if it wasn&apos;t for the fact that I had a still camera with me, and I took pictures of these three strange clouds as they came toward me. It wasn&apos;t until the movie Independence Day that I ever saw anything like clouds associated with UFOs. Recently I was listening to a program on television, and heard someone talking about UFOs that hid in a cloud or appeared like clouds. This made me look for the photos I have had for so long. I have found two of the three pictures I know I have. Two coming toward me, and one after they passed by and moving away from me. The two I have found should allow for a good investigation since they were taken close together, and you can see how the clouds details have changed in that short period of time.

However it appeared moving at a fairly rapid speed at a low angle along the horizon (the horizon in this case was a mountain ridge behind my home), the size of the object must have been substantial, it was 3/4 mile away or more, was a very bright white and easily visible. About half way through the observation where was a pendant shaped irredescent (light red to blue) expulsion from the object (like a trail or gas explosion) which only lasted a moment, while the object continued on as it had originally appeared then disappeared behind the ridge.It was flying in a straight line at a low angle to the horizon.  My initial thought was space junk or a fireball (bolide) but the size of it (or it may have been highly heated and just looked big?)didn&apos;t seem consistent.  If it was that big there would have been an explosion or hit someplace??  Anyway the strangest thing I have ever seen in the sky. I have a masters degree in the physical/earth sciences.  I have talked to a relative in the Air Force who launches satellites about space junk as a possibility--he says it wasn&apos;t junk.

It concerned a woman who spotted a flying object over the 605 freeway in 1977 or 1978 (she couldn&apos;t remember exact date).  This sighting was actually posted in 2000, since the woman was new to the web.  Well, back in 1978, my neighbor told me of a VERY SIMILAR sighting that she had the night before.  She was driving home travelling south on the 605 Freeway (Southeast Los Angeles County) at 2:30 AM (the woman was driving north on 605 fwy), when she saw a bright light that she first thought to be a helicopter spotlight.  She estimated the object to be a couple of miles away.  As she drove south, the object was slowly flying north towards her.  To this day, it is a desolate stretch of freeway.  My neighbor slowed to a crawl as it approached, since it was hugh and obviously not a helicopted or airplane of any type she had ever seen.  She did not stop as it slowly flew directly over her at what she estimated to be 100 feet or so- VERY LOW.  She said it was dark in color and possibly triangle in shape and looked like some sort of &quot;hugh flying machine with lights.&quot;  She was uncomfortable telling the story and had NO reason to lie and only told me after repeated questioning of the slight sunburn on ONE side of her face- which she admitted she thought was caused by object.  I  am guessing my neighbor probably saw the same object that this woman saw.  I travel the same freeway about a dozen times per week and have never seen anything unusual.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Then it took off and made a bright light it looked like a comet but as bright as the sun with a rainbow effect to it. I watched to see if anything fell to see if it was a comet or crashing satilite or something. Then I saw the black dot get smaller and smaller untill I couldn&apos;t see it any more it compleatly disapeared. The object was heading East.", "circular craft hovered emitting green and red.About 10 years ago. I was inside my house with my mother and five siblings. When all of a sudden a loud humming started to vibrate the house. My older sister was the first to go outside to see what it was. She said she saw a disc shaped object over the top of the trees. The object was NOT emitting any light at the time. All you can see was the outline of the object over the night sky. After a quick glance my sister runs inside with the news. My mother then lets us all go to see it. We head out the back door to notice that it moved to the side of the house. This time it was emitting a green and red color. It just hovered there at the same altitude for about 5 minutes. (this is where the classic thing happens) my mother goes inside to find the video camera but couldn&apos;t find it. And was to afraid to take to long and that she would miss the object.) After the five minutes past of just hovering there it headed off over the house to exit going 20 to 25 miles an hour immediately followed by three jet fighters aligned in a v formation. When we went inside my mother called the police. Before my mom could finish her description of what happened the officer on the line said, &quot;that the lines were flooding but everythings alright the Air Force called and said that they were doing a test.&quot; At the time my mother and all of us completely bought the reason the officer gave us. Ten years later all of a sudden the memory of the event flooded back. what came back to me was that i saw a object above the tree line emitting colors for about five minutes. That is all I remember. After gaining this memory back i asked my mother and sisters about this event. and thats how i got the whole story together and the first time the shape of the object was put into play. My two sisters rememeber a circlular object while my mother remembers a circlular object with a sort of square piece at the back. When I first heard them tell me the shape since it faded from my memory i was surprised that they didn&apos;t think it was wierd ! sounding. They replied that it was the Air Force doing a test. When i told them that no U.S plane was circular and could not hover they just said really. At first I thought they were just trying to pull my leg. But after a few questions I realized that they really had no idea how planes work and the great importance of basic aerospace dynamics. They really thought a plane could be any shape. Thats why they sucked up the Airforce&apos;s Reason.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Lights in the skyI had just woke up. I looked out my window of my back door.

It sat there for a moment then started to move. I heard no sound. It was red, green and amber lights. As it moved away like a plane would. I saw a airplane fly close by to the lights.

The high intensity light appeared bluish, similar to that of light emitted from a halogen car headlight or lamp. The light was witnessed by persons from Kaiserslautern to Wiesbaden to Koln (Cologne), Germany. The total incident lasted no more than two seconds. A friend related German media had reported the light was caused by a meteor reentering the earth&apos;s atmosphere however, I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s been verified at this time.((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports in the press of this event shortly after it had occurred.

Strange orange balls in a triangle pattern, in march of 1997.I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time of course, but this sighting was on the same night as the famous Phoenix lights in 1997.  I heard the mention of them on Coast to Coast AM on Saturday and it got me re-excited.  I live aprox 30 miles west of Tucson Az, between Tucson and the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range.  I do not live close enough to the range to ever see flares or ordinance dropped, however.  Between 19:30 and 21:00 I was driving a friend of mine home on my ATV, when he spotted 9 orange balls in the sky in a triangle pattern.  When my friend hit me on the shoulder and made me look six of them had gone out and I only saw 3 orange balls in a triangle pattern.  They way they went out was strange.  It seemed like they turned, or maybe like a larger black circle had covered them, almost like an eclipse over them. I stared at them for aprox. 5 seconds and then 2 of them went out at the same time, then the last one about 1 second later.  The Impression I got was that they were about 10 miles away, and very large.  When I returned home, 2 of my neighbors called me over and told me they had seen weird lights in the sky out towards Kitt Peak (which is a observatory in the same direction I saw my lights).  Because they were towards the Barry Goldwater Range, I dismissed them as flares, even though they appeared to be well outside the boundaries of the range. &quot;What else could they be?&quot; I thought.  A few weeks later I heard about the Phoenix lights from my neighbor who also saw my lights, and told me she wondered if the ones we had seen and the Phoenix lights were related.  Since this sighting, I spent 4 years in the Marine Corps, and became familiar with aerial and ground fired flares and I have never seen anything that looked like this.  When I heard On Coast to Coast AM that there were sightings west of Tucson on that night as well, I wanted to report mine, even though it is late.", "Occurred : 9/20/2003 18:00 Reported: 12/4/2003 2:55:02 PM 14:55 Posted: 12/9/2003 Location: Fraser, MI Shape: Duration:25-30 minutes  ----begin amended report per our conversation---------  This report is in response to the following sighting as it appears on the NUFORC website. It is a &apos;comment&apos; report on a follow-up investigation done by a Michigan MUFON Field Investigator. Occurred : 9/20/2003 18:00 (Entered as : 09/20/2003 18:00) Reported: 9/21/2003 6:45:44 PM 18:45 Posted: 9/24/2003 Location: Fraser, MI Shape: Light Duration:25-30 minutes star-like lights in the form of triangles and diamonds dancing in the late afternoon sky My Brother was out in the yard and called to us to hurry and come look at &quot;this&quot;. In the sky directly above us were what we at first thought were hot air balloons that ascended so high they appeared to look like stars in the clear blue sky. There were 3 in a formation of a perfect triangle to the left and 4 to the right in the shape of a diamond. Then they began to dance in the sky with each other returning to their positions. Coming very close to each other but never colliding. There were 3 sets of these formations. One had a stream of light coming from it leading me to believe it was a hot air balloon but when it ascended up and disappeared I dismissed that idea. Nearing the 20 minutes of watching these star-like objects dancing in the sky others started to appear as dim stars and became brighter up to 50 were in the sky at one time dancing, but never colliding. They ascended and just disappeared. There was no sound, no aircraft in the area, no tails on the craft above us.

Comments on - WUFOD Case 2-826 - Fraser, MI Multiple Witness Daylight Sighting I received FI (I.e. Field Investigator) David Twichell&rsquo;s photocopied forms and report on Sunday November 9, 2003. My initial impression of this case was that it was a solid case that would produce quite an extensive report due to it being a daylight sighting. The investigator originally included with his report a copy of the original WUFOD report in context of an email I sent him, Form 1 (2 pages), with an extra page for the spillover of the reporting witness&rsquo;s personal account, a 2 page hand-written description of the object by the witness, Form 2 (3 pages), Form 4 (1 page), Form 5 (1 page) with an added handwritten page describing the psychological and physiological effects as reported by the witness, a 3 page typed report by FI Twichell, a 2 page printout of the weather conditions for Mt. Clemens, MI on September 20, 2003, a one page small printout of a map of the sighting location and two cassette tapes of the phone interviews of all witnesses involved. There were 8 witnesses in total however after all was said and done only 1 witness&rsquo;s signature and form are on file with Michigan MUFON. The 1-hour onsite interview was done on November 3, 2003 with R G and her mother S at R&rsquo;s home. The attention of the investigator has been drawn towards R G, who appears to be the dominant witness and whom initially filed the report. I will summarize my thoughts on the other witnesses accounts first, then R G&rsquo; account, and finally on the case as a whole. MA D, wife of L D, described the event in a very straightforward serious manner, with excellent detail. The time of the event as noted by M A was around 4:00 pm (2 hour discrepancy here compared to other witnesses T.L.) or a bit thereafter. She mentions that one of the objects could&rsquo;ve been a &lsquo;party balloon&rsquo; floating upward with a spiral tail attached to the balloon. She mentions that L, her husband, in fact said it was a party balloon. M is in agreement with most of the other witness&rsquo;s in the fact that she stated she was facing south and the objects were moving from west to east. She suggested that she thought it may have been a &lsquo;weather gadget&rsquo; as appears in the movie &lsquo;Twister&rsquo;, and may have had something to do with weather testing. She mentions a 45-minute duration to the sighting. She described the movements of the clusters of objects as being &lsquo;like a butterfly&rsquo;, no jerky movements. She also didn&rsquo;t report any physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting. L D, the witness who was first to see the objects mentions them catching his eye while he was walking up the back steps, to go in the house, around 3:55 pm. He was looking towards the west at about 40o up from the horizon. He stated the sighting duration was approximately 47 minutes. He too reported no physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting. He mentioned initially seeing 7 shiny &lsquo;dots&rsquo;&hellip;. 3 being in a &lsquo;straight line&rsquo;, and 4 being shaped in a &lsquo;straight edged arch&rsquo;. He mentions some of the objects rotating around in a circle very slowly. Most of his account matches closely with that of his wife M A and that leaves me with the question of, &ldquo;Was there significant collaboration between the two witnesses resulting in some level of contamination in these two accounts? This seems most evident in the time at which they estimated the sighting began. S D - L&rsquo;s Mother - The initial part of this taped conversation has only the voice of FI David Twichell due to the fact that his speakerphone was not turned on. After David asks her about what time [the sighting began - T.L.] there is some silence and then David mentions a time of 6:30 pm during the early part of their conversation. I&rsquo;m making what I believe is a valid assumption, based on the taped conversation, that they are speaking of the onset of the sighting event. She mentions her friends present at the sighting location counting about 8 -10 lights. She stated they were moving around one another and darting back and forth. She also mentions a sighting duration of 15-20 minutes. Here we see a large discrepancy in the time of the event onset and the sighting duration as compared to L and M A&rsquo;s account. S states the objects were seen &lsquo;overhead&rsquo; in the southeast initially and then darted to the west for a short distance further stating that she didn&rsquo;t have to move her head very much to follow them. She mentions also that the sun had set approximately 1 hour after the objects disappeared. The sunset, as listed at the bottom of the weather data, was at 7:30 pm so her approximation of the onset of the event being at 6:30 pm could very well be correct. She too mentions the possibility of the objects being helium balloons. She also stated she was emotionally excited and had &lsquo;chills&rsquo; up and down her arms. This witness has had a previous sighting of a cigar-shaped object, which she experienced in Canada but no specific information was given about this sighting. AM G - She initially states the time of the sighting started at 5:30 pm. She states she was initially facing south, which is in agreement with most of the other witnesses. She mentions the objects slowly moving, or drifting across the sky and that she watched them for approximately 2 hours (a notable discrepancy in the sighing duration here - T.L.). For the most part the description of the objects is in agreement with the others. She states she suffered from no physiological or psychological effects, however she does mention one interesting effect and that was she saw &ldquo;little white specks&rdquo; like TV static in her eyes due to her head being craned up towards the sky. She had to repeatedly look down to relieve this effect and readjust her eyes. She believes this may have been due to her looking up in the sky for long periods of time. She said the objects were at an elevation of approximately 80o to directly overhead. (Here too is a discrepancy in what was said to be a 40o elevation for the objects mentioned by the initial witness L. - T.L.) J G had very little to add to this investigation. His interview was extremely short. He was in the house watching a football game and showed very little interest in determining what the others were viewing. He states the sighting onset was approximately 6:00 pm. He stated he didn&rsquo;t look at the objects long enough to discern much detail. He stated what he saw was a bunch of cluster type star shapes and then went right back in to watch the football game, not looking at them long enough to even determine if they were moving. He stated that the other witnesses stayed outside for 15-20 minutes watching the objects. M Z stated onset of sighting event was about 5:30 pm. She stated she saw white &lsquo;balls&rsquo; like a balloon but it wasn&rsquo;t a balloon. She states there was about 15-20 of them and the sighting duration was a good 45 minutes. She stated that the objects were in different areas and not in one spot. The witness says they [her and the other witnesses] were all kind of nervous. M stated that R called [reported them to MUFON] because her and her mother thought these were some kind of thing from outer space. She states the objects were moving in different directions, yet says that it could&rsquo;ve been the wind blowing them. She said at no time did they change color. No physiological or psychological effects noted by this witness. Witness, in my opinion, seemed very hesitant to give out her address, and left only her phone number with FI Twichell. Her husband M was interviewed later. MZ stated he saw 10 whitish things that could&rsquo;ve been balloons. He didn&rsquo;t watch them too long and didn&rsquo;t think anything of it. Stated it didn&rsquo;t interest him so he went back in the house. Onset of event he says was 5:30 - 5:45 pm. To him it looked like balloons. He stated they were kind of drifting not going any certain way. Objects were at a high altitude. He watched the objects for approximately 5 minutes. Nothing unusual noticed, as they were too far away to tell. No color changes noticed. Very short interview&hellip;approximately 3 minutes. R G, the witness who reported this incident, was affected quite differently by this event. She states the onset of the event was around 6:00 pm with a total duration of 25-30 minutes, which fits in well with most of the other witness&rsquo;s accounts, except for those of L and MA D. She first thought these were hot air balloons. She went on to describe their movements using the word &lsquo;dancing&rsquo; meaning they would move towards and away from, and around each other. She initially saw 7 objects in two different groups. She describes the color as being dim blue then turning brighter. She goes on to describe in detail, as evidenced in the taped interview, many perceptions that weren&rsquo;t described by the other 7 witnesses. R&rsquo;s size estimation being that of an aspirin, as suggested by the FI is quite in opposition to the starlike description given by the other witnesses. She relates her account in a very excited way with a lot of emotion in her voice. The other witnesses sounded much calmer when relating their accounts. R mentions another sighting she witnessed about 17 years ago in which she called Selfridge ANG at that time as well, with no response from her message left on the automated answering system at the base. 20 minutes into her phone interview R adamantly mentions there was not a plane anywhere in the sky. She then mentions, about 27 minutes into the interview that &ldquo;after, a jetliner was by and it was higher than that&rdquo;. This point being unclear as to whether or not the objects were in the sky during the time the plane was seen. I asked FI Twichell to clarify this if he could. He states, &ldquo;As to the plane involved in the sighting of Sept. 20th, I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m not making myself clear on this. I didn&rsquo;t make a copy of the recorded interviews so I can&rsquo;t check them for clarity but the witnesses agree that they did not see any conventional aircraft in the sky until the very end of the sighting episode. While the objects were still above them, a jet, coming from the direction of Selfridge, came into view and headed in the direction of the objects. At this time, the objects ascended and were gone from view. MA stated that the plane was visible while the objects were still visible. R goes on to mention her husband&rsquo;s flu-like illness previous to the sighting and it&rsquo;s complete reversal during the sighting, and then a subsequent relapse afterwards. She feels this may be relevant. Her husband did not mention this during his interview. R also noticed a definite difference in local animal activity whereas the others did not, and also mentioned an eerie silence during the event. She goes on to describe the remainder of the sighting as mentioned within David&rsquo;s report. On Form 2, first page, under &lsquo;Shape&rsquo; I noticed that &lsquo;disk&rsquo; was checked off but I hadn&rsquo;t heard any witness mention anything about a &lsquo;disk&rsquo; shape to these objects. I queried David about this and he replied, &ldquo;The one object that appeared to be larger than the others, with the curly-Q tail, was described by R G as being more disk-shaped than star like. She was the only witness that made this observation. I&rsquo;m not aware of where this statement appears in the context of the material that has been made available to me (T.L.). I completed forms 4 &amp; 5 as indicated on the forms. These were sent by the FI, via postal mail, to the witness to be completed and signed. Once she returned them he felt they shouldn&rsquo;t be altered after her signature was placed on the form. I added the necessary data in order to complete the forms. WUFOD, NUFORC and Filer&rsquo;s Files were checked for sighting reports that may be relevant to this report but nothing of any significance was discovered. This sighting was also reported on September 21, a day previous to it being reported to WUFOD, to Peter Davenport&rsquo;s NUFORC website. See http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31702.html I&rsquo;m not aware of any other communications between R and Mr. Davenport. Mr. Davenport has made the original report available to me. Due south of the sighting location is Victor Airway 221- 464 which is on an 85o (E-W) heading. Wind direction from ground level (329 ft. at DTX weather station at Pontiac White Lake) to ~35,000 ft. ranged from 240o - 270o (blowing from the west to east approximately) at speeds ranging from to 6 - 50 mph respectively. From 35,000 ft. to 97,000 ft. the wind direction was a bit more sporadic, ranging from 20o - 240o at speeds ranging from 58 - 3.5 mph respectively. These figures were taken from radiosonde data from the above-mentioned Nexrad weather station located approximately 30 miles northwest of the sighting location near Waterford, Michigan. Archived NOTAM&rsquo;s (Notice to Airmen) were also checked for the date in question but nothing of note was listed. In my opinion it is evident that helium balloons tied together could account for some of the movements described by the majority of the witnesses. As far as the event time and sighting duration discrepancies are concerned I would tend to think the 6:00 pm time range is correct due to the fact that the party was completed and the cleanup had begun. The football game (Michigan vs. Oregon) was televised at 3:30 pm with the postgame show starting at 6:30 pm. The sighting duration discrepancies are wide ranging but all estimates are, as far as typical UFO sightings are concerned, rather long in duration. This would make me lean even further towards the &lsquo;balloon&rsquo; hypothesis as a possible explanation due to the objects slow and drifting movements. There are some aspects such as the color change and &lsquo;beam of light&rsquo; or &lsquo;light bar&rsquo; noted by a few of the witnesses that would be difficult to explain via the balloon hypothesis, other than it being some type of reflective string used to tie the balloons together. Overall, I would have to evaluate this sighting as BORDERLINE IFO due to the distance between the witnesses and the objects, the object&rsquo;s &lsquo;point like&rsquo; appearance yielding no notable surface characteristics or structure, and their slow drifting movements.

On New Years Eve I was sitting in my kitchen looking west/left towards S.A. Mts. Both my girlfriend and I saw 4-5 objects huvering just over the mtn top, they would all (one by one or 1-2 at a time) &quot;shoot&quot; straight up several thousand feet, huver for a while dissappear for a while, re-appear sometimes much higher approx 15k ft., other times just over the mtn. top. they all had strange light formations mostly bright, but dimming periodocaly or lights sudenly tuning off. I was able to keep a pretty good eye on them with my binnoculars. was unable to see much of a formation do to it being at night, their lights gave too much of a glare. when lights off they looked like the eagle on the back of a silver dollar with a string out the bottom. almost like a kite string.the next day New Years day at approx. 2-4 pm the same objects appeared and when I looked with my binnoculars they defineately looked like the eagle. the color they gave off was like that of an old motor cycle tail pipe, goldish blues, then grey, and almost incadescent at times. the string on the bottom appeared to be a jet stream or exhaust about the same length as the craft. They (3-4) flew the same way as the night before. huvering, &quot;shooting straight up, floating side to side while perpindicular (slow 360&apos;s) then turning the other way. this lasted for approx. 1 hour, somewhere between  2pm &amp; 4pm. since then i have seen similar objects several times usually late at night. I have also noticed a sincere increase in military aircraft for approx 2 months now. prior to last Oct-Nov. there were rarely any aircrafts flying over head.(El Toro air base happens to be directly behind the sightings) If it is closed? aprox 2 weeks ago in he middle of the week around 2pm an aircraft traveling approx 4-5K mph,(based on fighter jets that go overhead at 1.5k mph?) went overhead it looked similar to the space shuttle without any wings and was white or silverish. since 1-1-04 i leave my binnoculars out, this is reason i was able to see this aircraft. after it passed overhead, the turbulnce caused the middle of the lake to raise up in a circular fashion as like a round wave approx 10&apos; diameter, then it became a wall type wave approx. 20&apos;-30&apos;long for a brief moment and turned into a whirlpool about 10 diameter. it was by far the fastest aircraft i have ever seen. 2-3 days after that for two consecutive days there were at least 20 rocket trails in the evening. the first night they were from the south towards Mira Mar? the second evening north/west towards LA. the day i saw the super fast object no trails were in the sky.

The street i was on was executive boulevard when i first saw a strange object. In El Paso there are big mountains around the area. I was at a stop light and looked up to the mountain area and thought i was wondering why the radio tower i saw looked slightly big. Now remember it was dark around this time. Then i realized that  it wasnt the radio tower that i usually see up on the mountain. It seemed like a triangular object floating. Ive had a great interest in UFO&apos;s for the past few years but i always knew that if i was ever to report an UFO to anyone that i wanted to make it under the most objective standards. I realized that it couldnt have been a helicopter since there wasnt a sound at all and the outlining shape seemed to be triangular. I do live around a military base called fort bliss and they sometimes fly helicopters but you will always hear them. There was no way it could have been a plane since the flight pattern taken by this object seemed to be straight for a little bit, seemed to have stayed a little stationary and then sort of zig-zagged. Iam not an expert on planes or helicopters but i usually see these things fly a straight path. I thought that this object could have been a blimp but it seemed too low for a blimp. I always have this notion that blimps are flown during day time. Anaways the lights emanating from this object werent too bright. I dont remember the number of lights but they were definiteley blinking. I had another eyewitness who was in a car next to my car. I rolled down my window to ask him if he saw what  i saw. He was perplexed. He said he couldnt believe what he saw and he said he didnt know what it was. I wish i could have stopped to him and maybe talked to him for a little while aobut this experience but there was too much traffic.

My son asked that I go outside to see &quot;something&quot;. On leaving the building I saw my two other sons&apos; and my oldest son&apos;s girlfriend looking skyward. The place we were at is near the airport and I expected to see some type of aircraft or such. Instead, as I looked up at about a 45 degree angle, I saw a group of lights, reddish yellow in color, moving east to west at what appeared to be high altitude and fairly high speed. The apparent &quot;flight&quot; path was east to west (after closer thought, more southeast to northwest), with the majority of the objects moving in random directions within the &quot;flow&quot; of the group, while others followed a more orderly flight formation of two parallel &quot;lines&quot; appearing at arms length to start at about 18 inches wide and maybe an inch separation expanding to maybe 3 feet wide and two inches deep at the end of the sighting (approximately 5- 7 minutes for myself).The random flying objects demonstrated high speed arcing turns, high speed right angle turns, circles and &quot;wiggling&quot; flight. After watching for a couple minutes or so, I grabbed a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars from my vehicle and found that I could not see any detail, just star sized lights moving. Again, the objects were reddish-yellow, perhaps no brighter than other stars and visible due to their movement.  They did not display navigation lights nor leave a contrail. As such, there were no contrails visible in this area of the sky during the time these objects were visible, however, quite a distance south near the southern visible horizon aircraft navigation lights could be clearly seen.  The area of town we were in is a commercial district near the local airport and well lighted, however stars are easily visible during the night  After watching for a few more minutes I returned inside the business and asked my fianc&eacute;e to step outside on the other side of the building to see if she saw the same thing. Joining her was a co-worker of mine and three other patrons, who immediately saw the same series of objects. The general consensus was&rsquo; &quot;this is weird, I wonder what they are?&quot; My interest was much higher as I am familiar with high performance military aircraft flight characteristics. These objects definitely outperformed any aircraft that I have seen or can imagine. After spending about two minutes viewing the objects from this vantage point the group moved back indoors as the outside temperature was around 8 &deg;F. The sky was clear with some ice crystals visible in the glare of the street lights. I then walked back to the location where my sons were.  We continued to watch for maybe a minute at which time an aircraft departed the airport and the objects looked as though they were forming one large, tight group. We watched the plane for a few moments and noticed that the objects were no longer visible. I do not believe that we saw reflections, birds, ice crystals, weather balloons or conventional aircraft. My family and I have viewed satellites many times and are familiar with satellite flight characteristics. The apparent coordination of the 28+ objects astounded all observers around me. Any information related to these objects would interest me greatly.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we believed his story to be sincere.

I looked into the clear sky to the north over towards the Rogue Valley VOR (navigation facility)and saw an aircraft, estimated at 10,000 feet, manuvering at very different angles of turns, circles, and other zig-zag patterns.  The aircraft had a red/orange tint with no flashing lights or strobe lights.  This seemed very odd.  I thought for sure it was an F-16 from the K.Falls base doing some fooling around.  I looked for another plane in trail(most travel in pairs), but their was nothing else. All of the sudden, the aircraft started climbing straight up and disappeared into the night sky.  I watched it as long as my eyes could see it.  It never returned as I stood on the ramp looking for about an additional ten minutes. There was no noise.  I have never seen an aircraft move as quickly as this one. I departed the airport and contacted Seattle Center for my clearance.

LOCATION:  13 miles north of EPHRATA (pronounced E - frA - ta) WASHINGTON on Sagebrush Flats Road.  (Sagebrush flats road goes at a North by Northwest track from the town of Ephrata to the south.)  TIME:  about 7 pm PST (Dark outside), November 1999  SETTING ONE: About 13 miles northwest of Ephrata, Sagebrush flats road comes out of a small canyon (gentle rolling hills on either side of the road) onto a 2 mile wide (north to south) and 5 mile long flat area with wheat farms and high power transmission lines.  The lines are suspended upon the very tall erector-set towers such lines are usually found on.  The high power lines cut across the flats coming from the Northeast (Grand Coulee Dam) and going to the Southwest. As I was traveling north and approaching the high power lines, I noticed a very bright light traveling very slowly (maybe 10 miles an hour) an estimated 20-50 feet above the lines.  It was to the northeast and coming towards me &ndash; as the road intersects under the lines at a 90 degree angle. The single light was very bright; such that I couldn&rsquo;t see the craft behind it. Not wanting to be directly under the craft when it got to my location, I went maybe 1/8th mile north on the road &ndash; all the while watching the light. I stopped the car and got out to watch.  There was absolutely NO sound from the craft holding the light.  I watched as the light came to the road and made a 90 degree turn to its left and slowly followed Sagebrush road south.  As it slowly, and at a very low altitude, approached the small canyon, the canyon and adjacent rolling hills were illuminated as if it was a bright summer day.  Since the craft/light was now going away from me, I could not see the light, just the effects of the lights illumination.  I still could not see nor hear the craft holding the light. I watched for maybe 10-15 minutes. SETTING TWO: My home is about three miles northwest (as a crow flies) of where I saw the light. When I got home to my wife, I said to her, &ldquo;You will not believe what I just saw.&rdquo;  My wife excitedly interrupted with, &ldquo;You will not believe what I just saw.&rdquo;  She went on to tell me that 15-20 minutes before I got home (the same timeframe of my sighting) she had stepped outside and looked up to the east.  Hovering, maybe 50 feet above her was a very large (an estimated 150 feet to each side) black triangular shaped craft.  It made no sound.  At each corner were several small bright orange/red lights.  These corner lights gave enough definition of the craft for her to tell it was triangular.  She watched for maybe two minutes and then, out of fear, stepped back into the building. There isn&rsquo;t any way these two craft (my light carrier and my wife&rsquo;s black triangular craft) could be the same craft.  It seems too much of a coincidence that these two craft were in the same general area at the same time.  I&rsquo;ve always wondered if the light bearing craft was looking for the triangular craft.  That possibly, the triangular craft was hugging the ground for stealth reasons.  NOTE:  I should mention that this remote farming country has frequent daily (and nightly) over flights by military craft coming from the airbase in Spokane, Whidbey Island Naval Air Base north of Seattle, McCord Air Force base outside of Tacoma, and from Canada.  None of the usual military over flights are of strange craft.  Some are large but quiet (not silent) craft.  I felt my sighting was probably of a manmade craft &ndash; just silent and for some reason closely navigating the high-power transmission lines.

I was driving over a bridge and in the distance I saw something with a green and red light. I noticed it and told my friend I thought it was the balloon that transmits Radio Marti to Cuba. (Many people may not know-the US government has a large balloon loacted at Cudjoe Key, FL that transmits Radio Marti to Cuba). I have seen the balloon in the daytime and assumed that&apos;s what I was seeing last night.Right away I noticed we were still far away from Cudjoe Key. At first I thought maybe they put another balloon up. Anyway, as we got closer to whatever it was, I noticed the lights were very noticeable. I saw a red light and a green light. I was concentrating on seeing if it was a balloon, so I was looking mostly below the lights. I noticed it was not attached to anything and there was no tower below the lights. It was also too low to be a plane. My friend was looking out the passenger window and said he saw a white light and a red light. He did not see the green light that I originally saw.When we got closer to the lights, they moved from my side of the truck because the road hadn&apos;t curved but I couldn&apos;t see them anymore. My friend said whatever it was moved, and he saw it more over the road. He saw a red and white light 100 to 250 feet hovering directly over the highway. He also saw a black mass between the lights in what looked like a triangle but didn&apos;t totally point at the top. From his account the white light was on the top and he saw a red light on the corner of one of the bottom of the points. There was never any sound it made. We opened the windows of the truck when we were close to it, and it was just quiet.I kept driving looking for a place to turn around because there was a car right behind me. I had to go about 1000 feet before I saw a driveway to turn around. When we went back, there was nothing there. No lights, and we looked to see if there was anything in the air it could have been, and again nothing. It was as if it just disappeared.We had not had anything to drink last night or anything like that. We shared a pack of cheese crackers but I don&apos;t think that would give us any hallucinations.

I observed the craft while driving northbound on I35 at or just north of the 119th street exit. I could make out a dark triangle shape, with a number of bright white lights in the middle and on the corners and a group of 2 or 4 at the rear.  Did not see any red/green strobes or anything that looked like normal aircraft ligthting.  It was about the size of a nickel at arms length when it was overhead.  I watched it as it came from my left and in front of me and followed it through the glass moonroof as it flew overhead.  If you drew horizontal lines across my windsheild to divide it into thirds, when I first saw it, the object would have been about on the top-most line in my field of view.  Speed remained constant and rather slow, did not do any manuevering. While I was alone in my car when I saw it, there was plenty of traffic at the time moving in both directions so I would think lots of other people would have seen it. I&apos;m not sure anyone else would have thought it more than a regular airplane, but whenever I see any aircraft it gets my attention and I try to at least guess what type it may be.  The non-standard arrangement of lights and the fact that it was large craft flying low on a route that I drive every day without normally seeing airplanes got my immediate attention.  It struck me right away as strange enough that I was excited to be seeing it in a &quot;wow, look at that!&quot; kind of way.  Comparing it to military aircraft I am familiar with, it was too large and wide of a triangle to be an F-117, but too narrow of a triangle to be a B-2.  I have seen both of those aircraft in flight more than once at airshows. I also remember being suprised at not hearing any sound, while you don&apos;t normally hear airplanes when you are driving, being as large and low as the craft was I remember thinking it was odd not to hear it or feel any vibrations.  I did have my windows closed radio on a moderate volume so I cannot say for sure there was no noise.I consider myself an aviation enthusiast and able to identify most military and civilian aircraft. When I got home I searched on the internet for something similar looking and surprisingly found some pictures that I think looks just like what I saw: http://bcornet.homestead.com/files/litbeam/main2b.htm  In comparison what I saw did not have discernable &quot;beams&quot; of light, just bright lights at both sides.  Also where there are a group of 4 lights in the picture, I could only make out what looked like 2 lights that were enlongated and one in front of the other.  They were placed similarly to the 4 lights but looked like those would if you connected them with a line parallel to the line you would get if you connected the two brightest lights on each &quot;wingtip&quot;  The following is just my opinion on what I saw:  I would not consider this a &quot;UFO&quot; in the sense of space aliens in flying saucers, just something flying that I could not identify.  I would surmise this is a rather &quot;normal&quot; and unspectacular sighting as far as UFOs go, and is probably something military as clearly other people have documented the same or very similar crafts.", "3-4 UFO&apos;s forming a pyramid formation in a Mesa Arizona Desert.We were driving through a main road by the desert out in Mesa, AZ and we noticed some lights out in the desert, on the desert floor.

There was still one UFO on the desert ground.  Then the one on the ground followed the other two up in the desert sky.  The 3 (or 4 couldn&apos;t really tell) formed a pyramid formation and were each a different color.  One was green, one was yellow and the other was red (or orange couldnt really tell).  Then about 1-2 minutes later they all formed 1 UFO and the colors changed from all those colors to just a spectacular white color.  Right after that they took off really, really fast.

My 11 year-old brother and I were going to a local restaurant to pick up my husband, who worked as the manager.  As we reached the bottom of the driveway, we noticed a large disc-shaped object hovering over our neighbor&apos;s home.  It was covering the circumfrence of the house.  It had two large red, and two large white lights along the center of the craft.  No sound emitted from it.  Normally we are both easily scared, but we were both calm, as though it had something to do with how calm we were.  I turned the car off and rolled down the windows so we could be sure to hear for any noise from the craft.  It was so close, any occupants had to be aware of us.  We parked at the bottom of the driveway, just watching it, wondering what it was doing over our neighbors home.  After about seven minutes, it glided up the hill following the road.

I was concerned that it was going to land at a small airport we had to pass to get to the Old Mill Inn in Basking Ridge, NJ.  It was the only time I experienced an encounter such as that, but it was so close that it is still vivid in my mind.  The unusal thing is both my brother and I were almost wishing while it was across the street, that we could see who was inside the craft.

FIRST sighting - reported directly to MUFON was in SE Iowa at farm fishpond near tiny town of Belknap in the Unionville area.  SECOND (reported to NUFORC as follows: 10/8/2003 12:50:21 AM 00:50) was the Fairfield sighting some 30 miles from Belknap/Unionville area.  THIRD  sighting (reported to NUFORC as follows: 10/17/2003 10:36:26 PM 22:36) was in Urbandale (Des Moines Metro area).  All witnesses report grouping of several lights (at least 5 or 6) with Belknap and Fairfield reporting the silent lights at somewhere between 10,000 - 25,000 feet altitude, and moving fast.  The Fairfield sighting, with considerable surrounding vegetation, lasted only about 25 seconds.  The Belknap sighting (2 men in open country at a farm fishpond) lasted perhaps 1 minute.  The one reporting Urbandale witness, reported 6 lights moving very very slowly at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet, with total sighting duration of somewhere around 5-6 minutes until surrounding vegetation obscured his view and that of a man in the neighboring yard watching the silent lights with him.  Investigators assess all these witnesses from all 3 sightings as serious, thoughtful, observant persons simply trying to relate as accurately as possible what they perceived.  Although there were 5 witnesses among the three sightings, in the Urbandale case only one witness was available for interview, and in the Belknap case, only one witness was availble for interview by investigators.MUFON Investigators among the 3 reports:  Beverly Trout, Glen Singley, Pam Brackenbury, and Clair Canfield.((NUFORC NOTE:  We express our gratitude to Beverly Trout, State Director for MUFON/IOWA, and to her co-investigators, for following up on this case, and for reporting the results here.

Between the towns of Springbrook and Preston we noticed a strange light off to the left of our vehicle in a field. The light was an odd blue oval shape. The light appeared to have no source, and looked transparent. The light also seemed to have a smoky quality, but there was no smoke moving. I noticed a small red light flash near the road (which was much closer to the car than the blue light). We also saw identical lights in and around the blue light. The red lights were very dimm, except for the one next to the road. We circled around a 3 times and it was in the same place and we saw the same red lights.

My wife is an administrator, my mother is a retired nursing supervisor, my four children range in age from 20 to fourteen. We witnessed first one light in the sky, from our perspective, to the right of the moon, high over the ocean horizon. It started as a small light and continued to increase in intensity until it appeared as a very bright, directional light. Yet it had know strobe or movement. The lumination continued for approximately 10 sec. and then slowly faded at the same point in the sky. It was a clear night. Almost immediately, another light, in another point of the sky to our east slowly came on and increased in intensity in the exact same manner without movement. Then, two lights, simultainously came on in different parts of the sky, then, together, they went out after approximately 10 sec. Then six lights came on in a pattern, one after another, again, no strobe, no movement, all over the ocean horizon, high enough to be considered air born. They all stayed on for approximatlely 10 sec. and then together, slowly faded out. This continue for one and a half hours and was witnessed by the entire family. I did not report the experience to officials. Others walking on the beach were noted to stop and point. The exact same thing happened again the following night, at the same time and in the same manner. One more very odd thing, I took my three sons kyaking on Friday of that week. We went out in the intercoastal waterway and made our way out to the ocean. We headed north, across the inlet from Cherry Grove, SC. The island we were alongside is deserted. We were going to explore the island. We saw a large group of people approximately 1/2 mile up the beach, walking around as if to be looking for beach treasures. An odd note, from our perspective, they were all wearing long sleeve dark shirts and long pants. Strange for that time of year. We decided we would continue toward them to see what they were looking for. As we continued to approach, we witnessed the large group form a circle, as if they were looking at something that had washed up on the beach. We continued to paddle against the surf to reach them. We looked at each other long enough to consider what the group must be doing. When we looked back in the direction of the group on the beach, they were gone. No sign of anyone. We continued to paddle until we reached the supposed area of the beach combers. We beached our kyaks and began looking for evidence of the group. There were no footprints or trace of anyone, much less a group of fifty. We checked the dunes and looked for boats on the other side, which we could see from the dunes. Everyone was gone. Then, I saw one man walking toward us from the north. He was aproximately 2/10 mile away. I walked toward him to ask if he had seen anyone. He approached and was an old man wearing only underwear. He was carrying a metal bucket which I did not look in. I asked if he had seen anyone else. He said he thought we were with the group. He said he they were part of a group of people that own the private island and that they were doing scientific expiriments. Now answering any more or my questions, he continued to walk south and we never saw him again.

While heading to the on ramp to I-5 south at the Chamber Way ramp at 18:47 I noticed a bright light in the sky just to the east of the freeway.  It was high enough up in the sky to later be obliterated from sight by some low rain clouds.  It was just getting dark outside.  I asked my daughter [in the back seat directly behind me] to look at the light.  She did and we talked about what it could be because we often see planes flying high on their way to SeaTac. This was different because the entire time we watched it [13 minutes] we never saw one of the usual blinking red or blue lights.  The light did not move hardly at all.  It never seemed to get closer, nor further away.  At one point the light was visible to my husband [driving], and our son sitting directly behind him.  We all were stumped as to what it could be.  The light was much brighter than any light I have ever seen in the sky, with the exception of a helicopter spotlighting the ground.  This did not appear to be directing light anywhere.  We all agreed the light was a different kind of light. A &apos;glittery&apos; king of light.  When compared to the moon it was like comparing regular car headlights to the new bright halogens.  Seeing as it was east of I-5 my daughter and I both watched it until it was blotted out by dark rain clouds.  We all watched it for a moment at a traffic light before entering the freeway and it was not moving.  My husband believes it was quite high.  I think it was much lower as it was about a minimum of 5X larger than the lights we commonly see on commercial planes.  There is a small plane airport east of the freeway, but this light was not moving.  It appeared to me to be about 6-8 miles east of the freeway and much lower altitude than commercial planes fly at.  I never took my eyes off it while on the freeway, hoping to see a familar blinking light to explain it away, but I have no idea what it was, or where it went.

It was covered by clouds at 19:00.((ADDENDUM))correction to prior reportI already filed a report on this sighting.  I think I mistakenly told you it was on the east side of the freeway.

I ran downstairs and out to the front porch to see if I could continue to see the craft. The craft was visible for about 15 seconds more before it flew behind some trees. I was flying a northwest direction towards downtown Seattle. It was over Lake Washington for the time I witnessed it. It was partly cloudy, but the sun was bright in the west about 30 minutes before setting, so it was very bright. The craft was oval as I could tell and silver in color. What cought my eye was the very bright white lights on the bottom of the craft. Ther were two lights on the bottom pulsing left to right and back again. I have never seen a light so bright on any craft except a large airliner that is coming straight at you, but this craft was flying diagnally away from me. After the craft went behind some trees, I saw a sesna flying about the same elevation and distance in the western sky. I think there is a great chance that pilot saw the object I saw. I think that plane was going to land at Boeing field. I hope some other people saw this because it was so bright that time of day and the lights on the craft were so bright.

A more accurate report was filed with the Ventura/Santa Barbara MUFON chapter. I was sitting in the car parking lot of Albertsons in Camarillo. It was the early evening and the sun had just set.

There were about 12 to 20 whight lights, about the magnitude of polaris, falling down in a ring formation. Suddenly these &quot;firework&quot; embers did something rather unusual. They stopped dead in the sky. This ring was suspended at what I estimate to be an altitude of maybe 1500 feet though I am not good at estimating altitude and they maye have been much higher. After about 1.5 second pause, these lights suddenly started swarming around eachother erradically. If I recall correctly some were &quot;glittering&quot;. This swarm moved almost right overhead me and some of the lights left the swarm and flew around the sky while others appeared to join the swarm from higher altitudes. Two of the lights in this swarm started to become brighter and most of the lights in the swarm merged with these two brighter lights while the remaining ones flew out of the swarm and faded from few. These two bright lights now moved closer to eachother and then started blinking on and off in sequence. One would blink on while the other would blink off. At this point in the event, the object(s) would easly pass for a cessna. The blinking lights slowly began to move NW, parallel with the hill that runs behind Camarillo where I eventually lost sight of them behind the houses on the horizon.

It&apos;s speed was very rapid, as it crossed my 8 foot sliding glass doors in approximately 5 seconds, in a very horizontal path, very slightly nose down.It appeared to be so large that at first I thought that the Space Station had fallen out of orbit, then I realized that this object was not bulky enough for the Station,and therefore was a missle, I looked for news announcements that day and on Jan.22,04, a TV broadcast said something had fallen in Argentina, on Jan.21, &apos;04, that had caused a fire, with writting on the debrie that said &quot;made in Italy&quot;.  The local police and FBI, nor the FAA have any knowledge of the above event.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual, a medical professional, and we regard him to be of exceptionally high reliability.  His description of the object was unusually precise, and very objectively described.  This event, we suspect, occurred as described above.

PD))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Mr. Davenport, I have been mulling over what I said to you yesterday, trying to make sense of what I SAW. I know what I saw, but you pointd out a valid fact, since I saw the missil against a bright blue cloudless sky, I couldn&apos;t really estimate the distance correctly, however I am quit sure of it&apos;s size. I therefore feel that this missil was in fact very close to me, in addition to that the closer it was the faster it&apos;s flight would appear to me,as it crossed my window. As far as no sound, the missil must have been subsonic when I saw it.Bradley Field, which is 35-40 miles northwest of me didn&apos;t see this missil, visually or on Radar as it was below there line of sight, Pilot&apos;s didn&apos;t see it either because it would have been obscured by ground clutter.Lastly the missil&apos;s flight path was more similar to a Cruise missil than a Ballistic missil, as it had a flat trajectory.Sincerely yours, ((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM))", "3-D ufo sighted in 1973 and finally someone to share it with.I have never known of a site to tell my sighting to and just heard of your site tonite.

My computer room has a large window through which I first saw the object. At 17:10 I was distracted by flashing lights outside.  It was already dark, pretty much full-on night.  I glanced through the window to my right and saw what I first thought was a hellicoper making a slow progress above the trees.  The object was unusual though, because it was arrayed with a row or two of flashing white lights that were remniscent of emergency lights -- the kind that police vehicals use.  The difference being that these were white, and seemed to be all over  the &quot;helicoptor&quot;.  There was no spotlight and the object made no sound. The object had come from the northwest and was moving south. It slowed to a stop and started going in reverse, northward.  That was when I pointed it out to my girlfriend who was sitting to my right.  It then tilted one of its points towards us and started a lazy circle, revealing a triangular shape.  At two apexes were were alternating red lights, with the flashing white lights on the bottom.  In the center of the tirangle was one slowly flashing larger red light.  I could not discern a light at the third corner, but sometimes thought I saw a bright white light flashing there as well.  It seemed that the pattern of flashing lights changed as the craft moved in different ways.  The lights often changed between white and red. at 17:11 the craft had completed its circle and was hovering over an area about four blocks away to the southwest of my location It was about the size of a silver dollar at arms length and seemed to be hovering,  I would estimate at between 200-400 feet up.  It then performed a funny little twist.  While hovering, it rotated so that it now hovered on what I would have called it&apos;s tail.  My girlfriend and I agreed that this did not look like any kind of helicoptor we had heard of.  She said it could have been some form of super-light airplane.  I dont know how it would maintain any lift while hold still though.  We both agreed that it seemed to be stationary. It began hovering to the north and rotated so that the &quot;front&quot; point was now level and facing north.  It then picked up a lot of speed and flew out of sight.  It seemed to accellerate very fast and was out of sight within 4 seconds. at 17:13 I picked up my camera and went outside hoping for it to reappear.  It almost immediately came back into view, flying this time from the west.  I listened carefully for any sound.  I could hear the faint sound of a proppeller plane, but it seemed very distant and faint. The object went to and hovered over the same area as before and began moving back and forth.  After a minute of this, it began to move slowly back to the north.  My camera&apos;s bateries were too low, so I could not get a pciture of it. Some neighbors were walking up the path from the parking lot and looked at what I was trying to photograph.  It was a man a woman and a small boy (named Andy).  The man immediately commented that it looked like a UFO to him.  (But he said UMB because his english isn&apos;t that great.)  I asked if he meant UFO, and he said yes.  I told him it was probably jsut a weird plane, and they went inside.  I didn&apos;t want to look like a crazy person taking pictures of ufo&apos;s. Soon it picked up speed at an alarming rate and was gone again within seconds.  I could still hear the distant propeller plane sound, which seemed to be coming from the south. I went inside to look for camera bateries.  I went back out to watched the sky for a while and it did not return, so I went back inside. I could not keep myself from glancing out the window every few seconds hoping to see it again. Then at 20:09 I saw a triangular arrangement of yellowish-white lights, much farther away, moving in from the north to the south.  I was about to go outside to take a pciture, and the object disappeared before my eyes. About two hours later I decided that the most obvious explanation was that the object went into an unseen cloud.  It is possible, but it truly just winked out instantly. This could have been some type of silent helicopter festooned with about a dozen flashing lights and having really awesome manuverability. I will email you a map of my area showing the path that the object seemed to be going in, with my location marked on it.  I&apos;ll also send you some photos of my view, with overlaid drawings of what I saw (as soon as I can get my camera working).", "the object seemed to use cloud cover to hide behindI was driving on the main road in Juneau Alaska going to work and looked across the channel to Douglas Island when I saw the ufo descending behind the mountains to land.It was like a silver sphere with a pinkish neon colored line going through bottom third of craft.

Up, left, down, right, and quite quickly. We became exited and nervous, trying to decide what it was. It was undoubtably moving towards us, but not directly (moving irratically). The object was making no noise. We all jumped off the car as it got closer. At this point it was probably still at least a mile or two away. Suddenly, we each noticed that it was changing shape. The upper light moved down towards the others, which spread themselves, and it was now moving in a linear motion, with the lights blinking, and it now undeniably resembled an airplane, sound and all. We were shocked and amazed at this transformation. None of us could deny its behavior before the change, nor expain it, before or after.

Then the really amazing part was when it changed directions twice without slowing down and zipped away just as fast as it arrived. My Father didn&apos;t see it and my Brother said He did but I don&apos;t remember exactly what He said at the time. There was no dout that thing was not from this planet.

The speed of the thing was what you would expect a meteor to be travaling at. The size was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. With the altitude it was at it must have been very large if it were at ground level. It was just an outline of a triangle really, I don&apos;t know if it had its own light source or it was glowing due to the speed and the atmosphere itself, but all three sides were very distinct as it changed directions both times.

Due to the hurried nature of filing my online report I omitted a few items. On December 28, 2003 at approximately 20:25 hours local, I took our dogs outside before going to bed for the evening. While coming out our door I noticed a tight cluster of lights with a strobe in the western sky. I went inside to get my 8x35 binoculars to have a closer look because this didn&rsquo;t look like normal aircraft running lights. While looking at the object I realized it was actually two tight clusters of light; a larger one on the left and a smaller one immediately to the right. The one on the right had the strobe. Initially I thought it was a military aircraft with a chase plane, but after watching it move, it appeared to be he same object, just illuminated on two different areas of the object. The general direction of flight was north to south from my viewing position at approximately 20 - 30 degrees above the western horizon. There was very light haze outside, but not enough to obscure the stars and the moon. The object made no sound. Because this aircraft was flying, it changed its position relative to my viewing position, therefore what I saw also changed. As it flew, the configuration of two clusters of lights changed to a triangular configuration, then to a straight line of three lights. A few minutes later it appeared to fly to the southwest and I am assuming directly away from me. The view of the lights at this time was 4 or 5 white to yellow-white lights forming a low angle arc. The lights strobed [flashed] from left to right. There was a haze or aura around it, but I dismissed this haze due to the general haze in the area. Still no sound was heard. No vapor trails were left. I observed it until the tree lined obscured viewing. The entire duration was ca.10 minutes. The temperature was 32 F, the barometer was 29.783, and the winds were ENE at 3 mph. Our location is directly under the path for commercial aircraft flying to and from European destinations, These commercial flights are generally directly overhead flying at altitude.

They insisted that I go outside and that maybe it was still there. To my amazement it was there. From here I will discribe what I saw: It was a large clear sphere about fifteen feet in diameter and about four stories high. I remember the childern were crying with fear but all I could do was stand there with my mouth wide open starring at it. It must have remained ther for at least 20 minutes, I could see right through it and the stars behind it. It did have a thin cloud like substance on the bottom. The object made no sound and when if finnally took off it still made no sound but move extremly fast upward and over, faster and further than anything I&apos;ve ever seen. I immediately went in the apartment and called called the police to report and ask if any one else had seen anything like I discribe. He said no and that was that. The next day I read that somewhere in the south a carousel shaped object was seen.

Eight years later when I did speak to her about it she said it was the first for her too. She also mentioned that the kids remember the clouds on the bottom of it where she had not but I had.

This is when I noticed that the straight line I thought to be left in the sky by an airplane was instead attached to a light of some type moving slowly across the sky from east to west. This line of smoke remained intact with the craft. I then noticed 2 more traveling together across the sky.

As he got closer he rolled down his car window and to his surprise the craft did not have any type of engine noise to it and it was just sitting up in the air not moving at all.

A lot of fresh snow had fallen and it&apos;s surface had a crisp crust to it under a bright winter moon.We lived on a long country road about 30 minutes from Moncton and it&apos;s airport.  This road is due North and lines up with the airport where in the distance it&apos;s beacon can be seen at night.My mother had asked if I would go to the store a few houses away and get something needed for the home.  I called my friend and cousin from across the street to go with me.  We could see across the valley for miles.  No clouds in the sky, the moon was out and the stars were crisp.  As we neared the store, my cousin and I remarked how in the North in the direction of the airport, a bright red light could be seen and it must be a plane or something.  Both our fathers worked at the airport and we both had a facination with aircrafts and flying.We entered the store and within a few minutes we were outside on our way home but we soon noticed that now above the house with the store and behind us was a large red half-ball and it was folowing us.  It was about 30 feet high, silent, about the size of a small car and it was flashing similarly to a police light.If you took a red glass ball, painted the top black, and then painted a wide black band dividing the base into two red wedges, and then placed a rotating light within it.  Mind you, we could clearly see the two base of the half-orb but I did not see anything above it.A moment of fear came over us and we wanted to go back into the store but it meant going towards this and since it was not making any noise and slowly moving towards us, we turned and walked South towards our two homes.  I remember vividly walking home all the while being accompanied by this flashing light.  We were scared as we walked but it kept the same distance from us on our way home.From this point to us getting in front of our houses, I have a feeling of dis-jointed time.  As if something happened or that of missing time.  I don&apos;t know.All of a sudden, my cousin and I are standing on the road directly between our two houses.  We were scared and didn&apos;t want to seperate but wanted to get inside quickly.  We decided to split and run at the same time and both of us ran into our respective homes.When I got in, my mother and several of my siblings (big family with 12 kids) could see that something had scared me.  Several of my sisters saw it through the back windows as the object just passed over our house and went towards the river about a mile away and then turn North again.This has been etched in my mind for over 35 years and I still can&apos;t figure what it was or what happenned to us between the store and us getting home.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The objects seemed to be moving... so, stuck in the back seat of a civic in the middle of the desert, I had little else to pay attention to. Within minutes, one of the objects (which was first a bright light, then a cigar shape) turned red very suddenly, and it appeared to have exploded. Excited, I yelled to my friend (who had first dismissed the objects as weather balloons), who then, nervouse, watched intently with me as the first object began to fall, while the second object, still white light untill this point, turned a bright red and appeard to hover about the mountain range adjacent to interstate 40 south bound. The object started to do several other bizarre things, like break out into a lateral acceleration that must have covered 50 miles within seconds, stop, turn colors, lift into the sky and return to it&apos;s low altitude, go in reverse immidiatly with rapid speed, then rocket off again. After reaching the near-end of the mountain range, the view opened up, after which we were all shocked to see the object we had observed &quot;meet up&quot; with 5-6 more just like it, but each one was a varying intensity of red light (kind of how closer stars are brighter vs. farther stars at night time).All of these objects demonstrated thier agility and handling just as the first. One by one, the objects were either dissappearing behind trees/hills/poles or literally vanishing into thin air. We saw several other objects that were clearly airplanes and helicopters during the rest of our drive that evening, but absolutly nothing like the red lights on the mountains.

The flashing got much brighter. There was absolutely no sound of any sort. The sky was clear and the milky way could be seen clearly, with no light interference from any near-by city.The lights eventually stopped flashing. These lights were white and appeared stationary overhead.Another flashing white light appeared and then moved very quickly north wards through the night sky.Approximately 1 hour after this sighting, what appeared to be a star in the western sky, simply got brighter and brighter, then as quick as a flash, just disappeared.All six of us are absolutely convinced that what we saw was in the very least unusual and would definitely not be attributed to any type of aircraft that we are aware of.

He said he was.  When they came back together the object was one again. It began to slowly move in one direction and then picked up speed quickly and within a second was gone.  I continued to look for a while, but it was over.  I turned to my dad and asked him what he thought it was.  He said he was not sure.  I said could that have been a UFO and again playing it safe he said he was not sure.  But I know what I saw, and my dad verified the fact that I was not seeing things.

He replied it still there but its turning, It looks like a giant wing.&quot;  as it passed near the house we still could not hear anything no noise like a jet or copter.  as it made it way over the mountain we could see the light come back on and it moved out slowly.  After words we talked about and though it might be a B2 but I had a B2 fly over the house earlier that summer on its way to and airshow and said that even that made a noise.  To this day I still dont know what it was.", "ufo 29 years agonational forest in puerto rico I only got to see it.

The light moved in a tight, wobbling fasion then would straighten out its path for a distance and stop.  It would then fade from view.  The location of the object was straight up.  There was no moon to be seen.  After a few seconds, the light would gradually re-appear in a different location then where it had disappeared and move across the sky in it&apos;s illregular fasion.  Occasionally it would do perfect 90 degree turns without stopping.  The lights of an aircraft flying at commercial jet height was spoted by us and at that time the light did another 90 degree turn and excellerated at an amazing rate and seemed to be intercepting the aircraft we spotted.  It stopped short of the aircraft and again faded from view.Watching the actions of this object gave us all the impression it was coming into our atmosphere too hot and had to exit.  That might explain the difference in location of appearence when it would fade out.  No one on this camping trip really had an active interest in U.F.O.&apos;s or had seen anything they believed to be one.  During the event, one member became pretty disturbed as he didn&apos;t believe in such things before that night but the actions of this object seemed to defy common laws of flight so he couldn&apos;t explain it away.  I, personally, had never seen anything before or anything like that since.  It was really interesting and even now, I look when the thought hits me but... no repeat performances.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Object was moving west to east when first sightedSaw a large disk shaped craft which on edge looked dumbell shaped. Silver in color, 50 feet across,300 feet in altitude. Location was 5 miles southwest of Rosemond,CA.Saw craft south of Palmdale on the same day but looked dumbell shaped. May be more than one object.", "BRIGHT LIGHTS FAST MOVING IN THE SKYI was driving down a gravel road near our home and out of nowhere I saw 2 bright white lights in the sky ahead of me. One was to my right and one to my left.The lights were similar to a large aircraft you would see flying very low, but the speed and agility could only be described as similar to a helicopter. They both moved at the exact speed coming towards each other meeting directly in front of me but still at a distance from me and then immediately with the exact speed started descending down. At that point I stopped my truck and said to myself, What are they going to do? Land on the highway? I was a little nervous to see what &quot;they&quot; were, but again started moving forward and soon realized that they were gone. I didn&apos;t see any lights to my right or my left. There should have been lights trailing off in some direction somewhere, but nothing. They were gone just as fast as they appeared.", "Silance and Very Very Slow and A Rather Large ObjectUpon finishing evening meal, I told my wife that I were going outside to look for UFO&apos;s.  Outside and not of full moon lighted sky. my wife came out and asked what were an UFO. Living near an airport I in course of her question felt aan plain might serve* her needs of explination. Looking upwards, about of our houses&apos; roof, suddenly an object did occur. My wife and yself watched as this seemingly rectangled object, pitch black,  no sounds, crept by over us, it were going so slow that one would of thought gravity should of caused something to come down. // This soundless object has 3 white lights + 3 red. Of terms of width, when further in view forward &gt;&gt;&gt; my left hands little finger and forefinger, while as pulled together while hand exstended, measured its rear two red lights. These lights were formed in an double triangle formation: below the object.       W    R     W                              R  The craft never did host lights upon ground nor add other speeds. If less than 5 miles per hour seems certain, very very very slow forward motion.  Roadway Highway 27 had no traffic, sky were clear. Wife later asked me, how did I cause that to occur. For I said I were going out to watch for UFO and in no time an strange object appears over our house. Address were ((address deleted)) Street.

So, now what!!!/???((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS))Silance and Very Very Slow and Rather Large ObjectYour print out repot gave W R W R W R to describe how triangled lights on bottom looked.  How to say how lights were; Two white lights of bottows front  and two red lights from behind Objects bottom. And at the center of bottom were white light of front, followed by an red light. forming 2 triangles upon the bottom.  No other light activity. Lights from its front and rear, gave the impression that it was rectangular.  Being not certain of actual shape. // Hope this helped address triangle matter.

Saw first hand object and passengers inside.The reason I remember it so vividly was our son was a small baby three weeks old.  I was up watching TV after having fed the baby and put him back down.  I got up to get a drink of water in the kitchen.  I did not turn any lights on in the rest of the house just the light from the TV set.  The drapes in the family room were closed so it was hard to see just the light from the TV screen.  I got to the kitchen sink and looked up and there it was right over our back yard.  It was just a few feet from our kitchen window over the back yard.  I was just paralyzed for a shor time and stood in awe of it.  It was pulsating light and I could see figures inside but couldn&apos;t tell what they quite liiked like.  I finally made my body move and I ran in the bedroom to get my husband up.  By the time he got going and we got back out to the kitchen it was gone but not completely.  It hovered around out about a half mile.  I watched as it dove and spun and glided so gracefully.  My husband never did see what I was pointing out to him and to this day I think he thinks I lost my mind but I know what I saw and I know how close it was to me and I know how frightened I was at the time.  Now I wish I had called the police to report it but my husband said no way he didn&apos;t want anyone to think his wife was a fruit cake, but I know what I saw and I know I watched the thing fly around for almost 15 minutes.  We are directly across from the Greater Peoria Airport and I wanted to call the tower and ask them if they saw it but I didn&apos;t do it and now I regret that decision also.  I have talked with several other people who have also had an experience that was of an out of this world kind and I want to record it so that others know they are not alone when they say they saw a U.F.O.  I did see it very clearly and I did watch it for quite some time before it finally glided out of my line of sight.  I went to bed but I did not sleep well for several weeks after that strange occurence.  I am not a nut case I can assure you t! hat this is what really happened.   I would be glad to talk with you by phone if you wish.  Thanks for letting me record this event.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Erractic pinpoint of light observed in  the night skies of greater Phoenix.At approximately 10:00 PM, I was relaxing in the outdoor spa of my apartment complex when I noticed a star-sized point of light in the eastern sky.  The point of light moved erratically to the right, then downward and to the left and then roughly northeast and out of my field of vision behind the apartment building, all the time very wobbly and erratic. There is a lot of air traffic in the area and, being a private pilot myself, I am familiar with most aircraft lighting configurations.  What&apos;s more, there was an airliner visible several miles behind the luminous object heading nearly due west while the object moved in the foreground.  I had no way of estimating its size or range. I can&apos;t say for sure what the luminous object was, but I can say with some confidence what the object was not.  It wasn&apos;t a meteor because it stopped and reversed direction.  It was not a model airplane because it moved too rapidly, and it was not a balloon because it was a windless evening and again, it moved too quickly.  It was almost certainly not a firework or flare --- it moved silently. This is the first unusual sighting I&apos;ve observed in the night sky.  I was not dreaming or intoxicated.  In fact, the event happened so quickly that I didn&apos;t have a chance to be surprised.", "I was sitting in a vehicle, in my driveway, talking to a friend, when I noticed a very unusual red light in the sky.It was 8:50 01/26/04. I saw a slowly pulsating (and very odd) vivid red light.My first impression was that I was seeing a conventional aircraft in a very tight turn or maneuver. Quite soon it became apparent that the light was actually standing still.At this point I alerted my friend, and we exited the vehicle for a better look.The light continued to pulsate very slowly, completely disappearing, and then turning back on.We stood there watching this extremely odd stationary object, when my friend suggested I fetch my binoculars. Did so, but it was all over by the time I returned.This was a very unusual event.The object/light was approximately 60 degrees above the southern horizon, bearing 220 degrees.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports of the same phenomenon for the same date.  PD))", "On my way to work at 0410, I witnessed a pulsating, green orb descend diagonally in front of me.As I was going to work at 0410, I observed a green, pulsating orb descending diagonally downward. The orb had a large bright center with its edge brightness kind of looking misty or foggy. The green orb pulsated slowly but it descended very rapidly. It disappeared before it touched the ground.", "Working out on the veranda, late AM, I was bent over a small landscape planter which is perpendicular to my home at the veranda end. I was pulling some weeds when I then felt like someone was watching me and turned my head ~90 degrees and notice an object hovering quietly behind my left shoulder in my periheral vision. Somewhat startled, I stood up and took closer look, turning toward due South noting its odd shape, distance (300~500ft and at an altitude of about 300ft above a large hill at the adjoiner property to the rear of my property), color, relative size and movement. I continued to bend back down in amazement, I mentally felt like there was an intelligence scanning me, but I heard no sound. I looked back up in awe to see that the object had vanished.

Except this time the object looked a lot closer because it was a slighty bigger and brighter star like light. There was also a plane I could see in the same veiw when it happened this time. And instead of manuvering, the object  just flew straight down thousands of feet to the ground (past the treeline at least) at a rate of speed no jet or meteor could go. this looked to be more than 100 miles away so I wasnt so tempted to drive over to the possible landing area.

They had 1 dim light on the front and it was green.  They sat in the sky for about approx. 3 minutes. They lowered at around 2 minutes but did not touch the ground and they moved really fast while they did this. I think i heard a noise coming from the objects but i did not know if it was from the objects or from a distance. they were not too far away from us. One object did start to glow red then they disappeared. I think it might have been a signal to leave. it was snowing alot but we know what we saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))"]
