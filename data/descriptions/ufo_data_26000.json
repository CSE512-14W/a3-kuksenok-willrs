["High Flight Speed Star Bright Lit Object Flying Toward Boeing Field Making Sharp TurnsThen South Of It and to Renton FieldAt 11:00 pm on Sunday, 6-20-04, approximately one-half mile before the W. Marginal Way exit, while driving north on highway 509 coming down the hill toward the First Avenue Bridge, I saw a medium size star bright lit object above me, about the altitude of 10K feet, moving from my left to my right as an extreme high rate of speed. It flew in an extreme straight line of flight direction with no slight movement, but with great accuracy in one direction.  It was flying downward at a slant toward the north end of Boeing Field just a tad before it reached that field where it made, in less than 1 second, an approximate 100 degree south-southerly turn, the white star light dropping down, like in a bank turn, to then quickly upward in a steady rise to leveling out going south toward the south end of Boeing Field, it&rsquo;s speed dropping maybe 10-15 percent after that first turn. It then began to drop lower downward and slowing to about 50 percent less speed, going into a soft rounded south-west-westerly bank turn, the light dropping to the right downward then leveling up and out, for a distance of about one-fifth of a mile, then another similar sharp turn but to a sharp north-north-easterly direction for about the same distance, the light moving upward to the left and then leveling out, then another similar turn south-south-westerly for the same distance, the light moving down to the right and then leveling out, and then one more such turn but wider into a north-east-easterly direction, the light moving to the left upward and then leveling out, where it was then flew out of sight past the hill to the west of the Boeing Renton air field. I could not make out the shape of the object the light was attached to, but over the freeway I had the distinct image of it being long and narrow, but after the turns it made then more like a plane, but that could have been my eyes playing tricks with trying to attach some shape to it. It had no other lights on it. At first I thought it was a shooting star but it was ! not moving in a curve. Then I thought it was a comet, but it didn&rsquo;t have a changing tail behind it &ndash; it did have a tail, but very very faint, but I knew it was too close to the earth to be a comet. Then I thought it was a meteorite since one fell near Chehalis recently. Then I thought it might have been a plane coming in for a crash or emergency landing to Boeing Field. And I also thought it might be a cruise missile or test drone craft that Boeing might be testing. I really did expect an explosion so the whole incident was quite scary causing me to quickly cross all the lanes on the freeway from the left to the right emergency lane to stop where I called 911 to report it.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone at length, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.

I noted that I had seen 4 satellites, all traveling north, 2 to the west and 2 to the east. We then observed another light that appeared like a very low, bright satellite traveling from the NW to SE. There was no sound (hot tub was off at the time), no flickering, just a steady, bright white light. The object was traveling beneath a low bank of clouds then it slowed down just before disappearing above the clouds (the same cloud bank it was beneath previously).", "20+ fast moving objects in the span of about an hour, upstate NY, 7/2/04The objects we (mother, two teenaged sons) saw were going from an east to west direction, going at a very fast speed, way more than the average commercial airliner.  They had blinking lights, most of which were 3, white, and circular, and then a red one came on and off, in a diamond pattern(three whites in the front, and red in the back).  There were also 2 constant white lights at the back of the aircraft.  We observed as many as 20-25 of these over the course of about an hour. Very clear night, full moon, all very visible.  They would usually go in parallel lines from east to west, normally in pairs of some distance apart.  One was seen going straight up out of the west sky, rather than toward us and overhead.  It did this at a very rapid speed, more than the others going from west to east. We were under the impression we were possibly watching military aircrafts until we saw the one going in a totally unpredicatable pattern.  No sounds were heard.", "Light landing on runway, traveling past end zone, travelling overland over roadless area then turning to merge into freeway trafficeSitting with friends up on Table Rock overlooking the Boise Valley, our hobby was to scan the sky to spot the then-new satellites, to visit talking about college classes, and to enjoy the lights of our little city. Table Rock stands at an elevation of about 1000 feet above the valley floor and looks out over the city and eastly toward Mtn. Home.  The airport was near the top of the ground horizon, with what was to become freeway I80 running along the rim and out east past the south end of the main runway of Gowen Field.  We could easily spot approaching aircraft, watch it circle before landing and touch down.  We could even see how the aircraft would then taxi from the end of the landing zone back to the terminal.  The end of the landing ztrip is separated by perhaps 4 or 5 miles,  and in those days was simply open desert with very few buildings.  The area roads were well know to us and the headlights of autos followed a well established pattern. Distance across the valley to the rim from Table Rock was perhaps a few miles, and then a few miles further over spaserly settled rural area to the Airport. We could time landings at about every 8-10 minutes at that time of evening. We all were amazed as one of the landing lights, which had a different color spectrum to it--still just a small circular light source, descended from the right of the landing pattern, onto the runway, and at the point all aircraft would slow and turn back to the tower, this light continued across the end of the landing zone, out across the desert, several miles out onto I80.  It turned onto the route of I80 headed east and followed in the same line of travel as the rest of the traffic towards Mtn Home 45 miles east.  This same thing happened a couple of times that night.  We never saw it before or after.", "Tri-lobed object passes cars on interstate, picture takenWitness was travelling north on Interstate 81 North when he saw a metallic glint out of the corner of his eye out his driver side window. As he turned and looked he saw a tri lobed metallic object passing his car. He was doing 75 mph. As the object passed him and crossed the highway, he grabbed his camera from the seat and turned it on. Snapping several photos, he captured one frame with the object in it.He states that the relative size at it&apos;s closest was that of a golfball at arm&apos;s length. Speed was tremendous as it was gone from sight in mere seconds. He stated that the object seemed to be about 1/2 a mile away from him and there were many cars moving with him and he is sure that ohers had to have seen this object.

They all moved in unison. if the front one slightly changed in direction so did all 3. kind of if all 3 were attached to a solid object, they always moved together  and in the same direction and they never changed distance between the lights. This flying thing went west and then turned south-west. The craft was also transparent except for the 3 lights. when it moved you could see the stars as it passed under them. when the craft was south west of us, the thing turned slightly and you could faintly see the sides of it. but you could still see through the middle. then the rear left light turned red and then the craft disappeared.

School was out so this was early in the day. It was a clear day with no clouds in the sky. When a shadow came over us we thought it was a summer thundercloud. We looked up and a large triangular object was just sitting there. It was a matte silver-gray, the tips more rounded instead of sharp, with no lights visible to the eye. There were no seams in the craft, it made no sound at all and there was nothing to indicate there was any type of an entry. It was very close, about 200 feet or so above us. We were only about 10 so the distance is hard to judge. My friend became extremely frightened and went home. I ran to my back door where my mother was coming out.

On Sunday night, August 10th, I went out behind the house and saw what I thought was Mars.  It was a very bright star just to the right of the moon.  Now I am not an astronomer, so I had no real Idea where Mars was supposed to be located that night. But that star was so bright,  It couldn&rsquo;t be anything else.  I went inside,  and about 10 minutes later I came out to show my girlfriend Mars.  It was still there, shining brightly just to the right of the moon.  I went inside for a moment to get a soda, and when I came back out, my girlfriend pointed to the sky and asked &quot;What is that in the sky!&quot;  I looked up.  There was a bright object moving across the sky.  It wasn&rsquo;t a shooting star, It was moving slow.  It wasn&rsquo;t a satellite either, It was much brighter and moving much faster than a satellite would,  most likely in a much lower earth orbit. I have seen many satellites in the night sky and this was not one. And it sure wasn&rsquo;t an airplane. There were no running lights blinking away.  I watched it disappear over the horizon and then turned back to look at Mars.  It was gone.  Where there once was a bright star,  there was nothing.  My Girlfriend then told me that while I was inside,  she saw the object begin to move from its stationary spot in the sky before she pointed it out to me.  A while later, I saw the true Mars rising.  Just where it was supposed to be.With so many people looking to the stars in search of Mars, there have got to be more people who have seen the same thing that we saw.", "The object moved at speed but  low with lights at the back and bright lights along the side.  Not a conventional aircraft.As this sighting was at night the &quot;craft&quot; was very clear.  I immediately noticed it moving at quite a speed but fairly low.

Although I was indoors at the time, I did not notice any aircraft noise.", "bright object bacame 8 separate objects and flew off in separate directionsI noticed a large bright object to the north of my position. I thought that it may be a planet but it was very bright. I watched it and aproximately after 1 minute, the bright object became 7-8 smaller objects which flew in a downward motion then outward and up, in a J fashion and disappeared. The motion resembled an upsidedown open umbrella. All lights moved in a synchonized fashion. My first thought that an aerobatics team such as the Blue Angels or the Snowbirds were rehearsing. The next day at work I checked the NOTAM (notices to airmen) Board. There were no practices in our airspace on that date and no airshows scheduled around that time. I was working in Air Traffic Services at the time.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

About 8:00PM at night he was looking out his window. He noticed a bright neon blue light about two to three times the size of the largest and brightness star in the sky. From about the top of the horizan the object streaked down. It appeared to be some distance away. He said that the object was moving faster than any planes he had ever seen in the sky, but didn&apos;t move so fast to leave a tail or tracer. He is unsure if the object blinked on and off or if it appeared that way because he was seeing it from behind some tree limbs.

I believe that I saw what might be otherwise classified as a UFO, however I do believe that it was a man-made aircraft.  I had a very close encounter with this craft.  At the time, I was driving a Chrysler Reliant, and I was heading home driving up the Niagra Escarpment.  The night was very cloudy and a storm had just precipitated.  There was heavy cloud cover, and on my way up a long stretched road heading towards the mountain, I noticed two lights which at first I figured would be a low - flying passenger jet.  However, as I continued up the road, I was surprised to see that the two white lights were fixed above the mountain, and that the jet was much smaller than that of a passenger jet all together.  I was very amazed as I ventured further and steadily closer to this object which I then discovered was hovering at a fixed position.  It then came to my attention that I was about to witness a craft which no one in the public audience has witnessed before.  This craft was at such a low altitude that I lost sight of it while I rounded a turn and could not discern it through the tree tops.  After I rounded the turn, I could clearly see every contour of the craft...  it had just completed a nearly 180 degree turn in the same position... it had a cockpit, with small airleones at each end below it... it had delta shaped wings which came together at the end with a concave curve at the rear... the white lights were at each end of the wing tips.. I stopped my car directly underneath of the craft.  I opened my door and looked up at this craft which travelled less than 5 k/m per hour over my head without a sound.  As shocked as I was, I watched as the craft continued to move until I could see the rear of the craft once again.  Shocked and scared of being a witness to this craft, I drove away.  I write this email in hopes of some response which might explain what I saw.  I do believe that it was man ! made, be cause the craft had two green lights and two red lights on its undercarriage, similar to what is regulation of man made aircraft.  Its undercarriage seemed to have a carry cargo door which I honestly believed would have opened and lifted me inside as I was directly underneath it.  However, this never happened to my recollection.  I have never seen any plane which could maneuvere as this craft can, or hover without a sound.  Please, tell me what this is.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I could see the blinking navigation lights and just hear the engine noise faintly.Just then a golden sphere moved into my field of vision moving west to east, across the normal flight paths and below the altitude of the light plane that was just disappearing. A lot closer in fact. It moved in total silence for a bit, then executed several high speed zig zags across the sky. Hard to tell how far but way beyond the capabilites of any aircraft I know.It then proceeded at the same slow pace as before briefly before accelerating extremely fast up into the sky while dimming to total black.

We had driven nearly the full 21 mile drive from Kokomo heading south on US 31 to just north of hwy. 28 (appox. 800 yards north). Just across hwy. 28, behind the &quot;Flamingo&quot; motel to the west (about 800 ft. west),and in an open field, an unidentified sphere shaped craft hovered stationary, about 50 foot above the ground. It appeared about the size of a DC-8 or KC-135 jet in size. The craft was britely lit with small orange/yellow lights enveloping its ball shape. It appeared to be searching the ground below it with several intense motorised search beacons that were scanning the ground from its undercarraige.The object remained illuminated for about 15 seconds and then went &quot;lights out&quot;. We saw a small red light depart the same area and pass in front of us (across US 31 and southeast bound), at instant mach +++ speed. Several other motorists ahead of us saw it as well as they applied their brakes as we did, to take in the sight.My brother-inlaw and I decided to turn off on a side road after we turned east on hwy.28, to see if we could see more activity. We turned off our headlights and pulled over on the side road. What we saw when we got out of the truck, was no less amazing. There were 2 huge vapor trails, or what looked more like rocket exhaust plumes, that arced across the sky (about 3 miles in length) from the ground where we first saw the craft hovering. Over the next few minutes we also observed what appeared to be several unlit stealth type flying aircraft, very high up in the thin cirrus clouds. Those craft soon departed, and we got in the truck and went home. I woke my wife when we got there, to show her the rocket/vapor trails and she saw them as well. There was a low pitched hum from the sky above, but not very loud.We are not crazy, we saw what we saw. It was a clear/starry evening, and the craft was solid clearly visable. I&apos;m not saying they were aliens, expermental aircraft, maybe???? Who knows.......

Myself and three other people (2 couples) driving home (apartments in Stone Mountain) from the midnight movie. No booze, no drugs, no traffic at that time of night.  Came around a curve and there was a REALLY bright light shining on the road in front of us.  I was driving and I shut off the headlights in the car.  I remember thinking that we didn&apos;t want to be discovered. The craft was so low that we could see the light reflecting off it.  It had lights of it&apos;s own but I don&apos;t remember the colors.  It seemed to be surveying the road.  The light would follow the left side of the road and then it would cross and follow the right side.  We didn&apos;t say anything to each other.  There was no noise from the craft.  Maybe it saw us but it accelerated away fast.  Somebody said follow it.  We were all excited.  There was no road going the way of the craft. When we got home, we compared notes and we all saw the same thing.  We lost no time  We left the movie at about 1:30 and it was 1 hour drive home.  We called Hartsfield Airport, the police and Dobbins Air Force Base.  Everybody said nothing in the air.  The guy at Dobbins asked me if I wanted to report it.

My  husband said maybe it is some deerhunters. A couple of night later I had walked down to my sons house across my pasture and when I was coming back the mist was rising in the pasture with a large area obstructing the stars.  Out of the mist above me I saw a horizontal beam of light like a laser shining out of it. It scared me and I ran on into the house.On the night of the 19th my son called me to come outside. I can see his home from my front yard and he was standing on the deck. He said &quot;look down at the pond&quot;. The pond is downhill from my house in the middle of my pasture with the tree reserve on the backside of it. A very bright light was shining down into the pond; so bright that I couldn&apos;t see the source. My son said, &quot; I have been watching it for 20 minutes.&quot; In just a few minutes the light went out and triangle shaped caraft was lifting up!!! It turned toward my house and lifted its nose and slowly acclerated upward.  It was making a pumping sound like an old washing machine for a few seconds then became absolutely quiet. It had the white corner lights and orangish light in the center. After reaching an altitude of a couple hundred feet all the lights went out and small red blinking light came on. As it flew off it you could no longer tell what it was. With the linking red light it now looked like any plane that would be crossing the night sky.

The objects were in a straight line and evenly spaced (appeared about 1/2 inch apart).  The objects did not travel with me, as would the moon, but stayed in their place above the lake and very sparcely populated wooded area between mountains.  I kept looking and within one minute the three disappeared, but slowly as though fading out.  The &quot;lights&quot; faded to a ghostly appearence in three seconds, and another three seconds dissappeared completely.  I am a skeptic about these UFOs, but believe that these sightings have to do with a spiritual condition about ready to be unmasked upon the earth prior to the coming of Jesus Christ.", "Looked like it went through the hillsideOur parents sent us outside to feed the animals.

One in the front (lead) and 2-3 lights evenly spaced from one another, down each side. I was smoking a cigarette in the front of my house while watching a bird, for a few seconds, fly towards the east. When I lost sight of the small bird, I was directly facing the eastern horizon. I immediately saw a small patch of red light (similar to a laser pointing pen) piercing through the eastern sky (approx. 3-5 miles away). The patch of red light was at first (5-10 seconds) small in size similar to the front lights of an approaching commercial aircraft at that distance. After about 10 seconds, I was able to make out a perfect &quot;V&quot; shape outline of the craft with 5-7 semi-circles.  I don&apos;t remember the altitude of the lights; my best guess is it was around 2000-3000 feet (?). To make a short story even shorter, the object became larger and larger as it flew closer to where I was standing. It peaked in size about a quarter of a mile away from me (about one-third,maybe one-fourth the size of the belt of Orion). At that point I was able to look directly underneath it. The lights were no longer semi in shape but full, orange-amber in color with a slight white-yellow haze. At that point I could no longer make out the lights original red outline.", "it just seemed to dissapearall i remember is that i was lying in my chair with my glass door open while the dog was outside and heard a noise like a plane.  since we do have an airport nearby i thought it was just a plane so i figured it was nothing. but this sound remained constant so i went out side to check it out.  i looked around in the sky and noticed an oddly shaped figured that seemed to instantly dissapear. then i guess i blacked out because i woke up in my chair like nothing had ever happened.", "Craft hovers over our house in Newark Ohio across from the OSU Newark campus.This event took place when I was 10 and my Grandparents have passed so the date is approximate.

Grandma watched the light for a few minutes and suddenly the light came right at the house.  I remember hearing Grandma scream.  My Grandfather, my Mother and I ran to her room.  She was staring out the window and told us to look.  There was a huge craft hovering over our house.  We were stunned.  Eventually the craft slowly started to drift to the back of the house.  We ran out the back door and watched the craft slowly move over our yard over the tree tops.  This thing was as big as many houses, made no noise, had lights around the edge and it was so close we felt you could have thrown a baseball and hit it.  We are no longer doubters.

It appeared to travel west to east.  Initally, the light was white, then changed to orange.  Based on the brightness I would have judged it to be the hovering height of a search helicopter.For a moment I thought it was a helicopter, but there was no accompanying helicopter noise.  My next thought was a marine flare, but I am not near the water.  Shortly after seeing the intense light, I heard a sound similar to fire-cracker bursts. I then thought it must have been a fire work, such as a roman candle, although it seemed much to bright for that, and described it as such to my room-mate over breakfast.

It appeared to reflect sunlight during the entire sighting and alternated between a metallic silver and a metallic red.  It was quite bright and flew in an erratic manner.  At first I thought that it was just a metallic foil balloon, but after observing it longer and based on my perspective with the Sandia mountains, I estimated the distance to have been 5-6 miles.   Given the estimated distance it was flying much faster than a typical small aircraft or helicopter would.  Best guess at size would be 10&apos;-15&apos; in diameter.

It remained in the same location for the duration of my decent down the hill approx. 1-2 mins.  I performed a u-turn and drove to the top of the hill again to see if it was still there but there was no trace of it.

There was a tall fence along the west side of the decking around the pool and as the object descended several of us climbed up on a bench that was attached to the fence so we could see over it. I soon left the bench for the high diving board to get a prolonged view. The object was probably south-southwest from the pool.

The object appeared to be about one third the diameter of the spherical part of the tank. The object continued it&apos;s decent until it disappeared behind a treeline.

The southern most object did not move at all, watching it was like staring at a photograph.  The northern most object only occasionally yawed from left to right about 60 degrees in each direction.  Its position in relation to the unmoving object never changed.  After about 45 minutes, I turned away to insert more coins in the car wash, and when I turned back, the objects were gone.

Me EX Airforce!Near the graveyard across from dennis the menace park while driving I looked to the left across the graveyard through the tree&apos;s and noticed this object that looked in the shape of a blimp. It was a clear day, the heat was reflecting off the object, no writing on the object and it was not moving it appeared. I was trying to look while I was driving but started to go off the road so I turned right into the dennis the menace park so I could turn around and drive into the grave yard (took about 10 seconds) when I got into the graveyard I could not find anything in the sky (there were no clouds) if it were a blimp it could not have went out of view that quickly. I work for the government and was in the Airforce always lived near airports and never believed about UFO&apos;s but this was definately strange. Well about a year later I was talking to a friend and the subject came up of UFO&apos;s and I mentioned it to him and he told me that another friend of his told him of the day he was working in the baseball field at Dennis the Menace park and thought he saw a UFO. My friend couldn&apos;t believe two simarlar stories from two different people who don&apos;t know each other happening at the same place and probably around the same time. He said he wants me to meet his friend so we can go over our accounts. Someday soon I&apos;m planning on doing that. The sight I saw seems to be burned in my mind. The thing that stood out is how still it was and the heatwaves relecting off. It gave me an eeiry feeling after the sighting. The object looked metallic greyish/silverish, the heat reflecting off really made it stand out to me. It was on my mind so I thought I would report it now. Unfortunately I don&apos;t have a specific date but I know it was about three to three and a half years ago. I should of wrote everything down then. Hey, working for the government I didn&apos;t think I wanted to go around talking about possibly seeing a UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

He had seen the same thing whilst on duty on new years eve 1986. because i got laughed at, i didnt tell anyone else. i have always been into the paranormal and my friends had accepted that, but were not willing to accept a UFO sighting.", "2 cigar shaped objects moving across the early morning sky in an un natural mannor and motion.The 2 UFO&apos;s were seen while i was outside on the back garder with my telescope. The objects were not seen through the LX200 but with eye only. They were orange in colour at a height of a high flying aircraft, between 30,000 and 40,000 feet. They were traveling side by side at an in determinate distance away from each other, (possably 200 to 500 feet. estimated guess only) They did not display any lights but the entire craft exterior glowed in a vibrant, almost luminessant sorange.they moved in a westery direction accross the night sky, originating in the area of Ursa Major, at a relativly slow speed for about 3 minits. then they both stopped and appeared to honer in the same spot for at least 1 more minit + and then appeared to shoot directly up to leave the atmosphere in a approximately 70 degree angle in an in determinate speed... they were amazingly fast...leaving 2 streaks of light accross the sky(1 from each craft). these were the only trails of light left behind and only stayed there for a very short second.Being an astromomer i know the difference between a satellite, aircraft, shooting star, meteor, star, planet etc. These objects what ever they were, were obviously under an inteligent influance as there movements were un natural. They could in no way be a craft, probe or other devic of this world as the speed in which they travelled accross the sky no human could stand in a piloted craft.A passenger plane was in a relative possition to have possably seen it.Shortly after the object left the atmosphere or dissapeared from sight, 2 high powered jets flew over at a high altitude and headed towards the rough area of my last visual sighting of the objecs.If it could have been picked up by radar, then east midlands airport, only 10 miles from my location would have picked it up at some point.", "On the evening of December 30, 1967, shortly after dusk, I observed along with two other witnesses, a circular craft, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, as it floated over the mobile home where I was living at the time.The craft was soundless and completely devoid of any light source except for an amber basketball size mass of swirling energy that seemed to posses electrical properties.The amber ball of swirling energy was located underneath the faintly silver rim of a UFO and was located nearest me along the rim.The craft then emitted a red cone-shaped beam from its underside seemingly searching for a landing site. Moments later, the craft paused and a string of red lights began flashing back and forth in a 5-4-3-2-1, 1-2-3-4-5- pattern around the objects midsection. The first craft was then joined by a second craft that flew in from its right side. The two crafts then dropped below the treeline and out of sight.Minutes later, two jets and a single column of helicopters approached the UFO hotspot from the east.After several minutes the Air Force jets and choppers left the area.At approximately 1:50 am the craft to the left rose up from the exact location that it had disappeared below the tree line nearly seven hours earlier.The object displayed the same pattern of red flashing lights around its middle.Then it shot straight up, paused and then the red flashing lights began to fade as the UFO took on a more luminous appearance and reminded me of a star as it just hung there in the dark, starry sky.Then, the eastern horizon lit up with orange and white colors as a Minute Man 2 missile rose up and within moments began its arc downrange the Eastern Test Range over the Atlantic.The luminous UFO then began zig-zagging across the sky, then performed a falling-leaf pattern, and all in one continuous lightning-swift motion.Then the UFO shot to the left and seemed to draw very near the rapidly climbing missile. Then the UFO darted to the right, paused then shot off to the right again and vanished.I waited until sunrise but I never got to see the second craft leave the location of which it had apparently landed nearly 12 hours or so earlier.The above UFO sighting was the first of numerous other sightings that happened in the same area over the course of the next nine months.", "Object avoids jets contrail, stops and changes directionWhile taking a break at the picture window at the north end of my floor at work today, I watched a passenger jet flying at altitude to the east, leaving a typical contrail. It was several miles away but the outline and wings were still easily visible. As I continued watching, I noticed a white object approaching it from the southeast.  Assuming it was another plane too far away to show any detail, I didn&apos;t think much of it.  However, when it approached the jet, it changed course in a wide arc underneath the jet&apos;s contrail, then continued to the west. Once or twice during it&apos;s flight, a flash of light glinted off it implying it may have been metallic.  At this point I called for 2 women who were in the cubicles closest to the window to see the object.  They came over and watched for a few seconds, and after approximately 1 minute, the object stopped in the middle of the sky and reversed direction back to the east. No arc, or 180&deg; turn or quick bank, just stopped and started travelling back east.  When I saw it stop and change direction I became very excited, though the women with me weren&apos;t impressed even though they also saw it stop and reverse course.  I continued to watch the object fly east till it was lost in a developing cloud formation.  It was roughly 2:00 p.m. (I forgot to look at my watch for the exact time of course), the weather was sunny to the northwest but became cloudy to the east due to a developing thunderstorm system coming over the mountains, and the sky behind the object looking north was blue. I was inside so I could hear no noise, but I assume it was too far away to hear anything at that distance if I was outside. Seeing as it was several miles to the northeast from my vantage point, I estimate the general location of the object would have been high in the sky above the line dividing Larimer and Boulder county in northern Colorado. I will email an edited photo of the view from the window after I send this report.", "I was driving east from Continental Drive onto Farrell Street and I saw an aircraft I thought was a small plane.  I thought, &quot;what kind of a plane is that?&quot; It had one white light at each corner and one red one in the middle. It glided low in the sky, but way above the telephone lines. It went over the train trestle north to south as I went under it. I was thinking what would a small airplane be doing flying at that time and it was so dark and cloudy you couldn&apos;t even see the stars. I was so awed by what I saw, and still couldn&apos;t believe it.  I thought I would wait to see if anyone else reported anything like what I saw.

There is a series of short bridges in this area so I traveled past the bridges (and the object) and pulled off to the right side of the road to get a better look. The object continued to hover approximately 25&apos; above the ground/water  (it was actually right over this fish camp that had boat launches, etc, right at the edge of the water).  The object made no sound whatsoever. It did have lights, but it happened so long ago I can&apos;t accurately recall what colors other than red, which were rotating. I would estimate the size of the disc to be about 30&apos; wide by about 15&apos; high. It seemed to have a metallic finish, if memory serves me correctly. I leaned on the back of my car watching the object for around 20 minutes if not longer. Eventually, it slowly moved off at a slow rate of speed to the southeast toward Pensacola. I watched it till it disappeared. I was very close to the object the whole time, approximately a couple hundred yards. There were no other witnesses that I&apos;m aware of. Actually, that&apos;s how I ended up here. I was curious as to whether anyone else had reported anything similar. I told very few people about it at the time out of fear of being laughed at. Not to mention, I really had trouble accepting it. The moment I got back in my car, my mind started disproving it. It was a very unnerving experience. For the record, I had not been drinking. I have never reported this anywhere else. Just wanted it documented somewhere. Now, maybe I can forget about it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Soon after a large plan (looked like a jumbo jet based on wing profile) coming from north heading in a south direction (probably towards Victoria Airport)  The dot suddenly changed its course so now it was moving infront of the plan heading south as well at a slightly faster pace. The dot continued to move infront of the plan then suddenly made a sharp 90 degree turn so now it was heading west again. It preceded to make several erractic turns, one being another 90 degree turn and second being a wide curve.

After a few seconds of this it started to zig zag back and forth, almost 1 to 2cm from our point of view. It was now heading about south west. It did a couple more small turns but seemed to continue on its new heading. At this point the dot suddenly moved out of view (while the plane being far away is yet still visable) and was gone.

As quickly as I fixed my eyes on it, the object appeared to gain speed and change in color from green to a bright orange. At this point, a tail of what appeared to be fire developed. The tail glowed momentarily in a long strand and then faded out. This object was travelling out of the south, and appeared to be on a course to strike the ground a couple of miles to the east of the Monroe airport.

Four or five flashes lit the entire area like large lighting strikes do and appeared to me to look like magnesium when it burns.  My first, split second  reaction was that it was a large meteor burning up in the atmosphere, but the flashes were too bright.  It totally vanished after the last flash.  A large trail of smoke was left in the sky from a point where the first flash occured to the last.  I am a pilot and I would estimate the smoke trail to be at about 15,000 feet above ground level.

They move at the similar speed to a satelite. They are gold in color. The next event was a globe flying over Vernon the same as the night before from the west. It turned orange and disappeared high over my building. I saw another globe from the same place in the west heading toward the north. My eye was then turned to a bright flaring of super white light high in the sky and this gold globe headed north. My eye caught another flare high in the wnw sky but this one flickered then flared and strobed white light as it headed in a north direction. Another one flared in the nw sky and flew in the direction of the other strobing one. At about 3 am I noticed two satelites on the same trajectory as first sighted.

I was about 12 or 13 years old at the time, and my friend was travelling with me, my mother and her boyfriend back from town.  He was staying over at my house that night celebrating our birthdays and being a warm night, decided to sleep outside in the camper.  Being in a rather darkened area, travelling down route 209 from Parrsboro to Kirkhill, I regularily star gazed. It was an extremely clear night with the sky lit up with stars.  I focused on approximately 8 - 12 objects in the air, about the distance of a plane but no flashing lights.  They were just lit objects in the air.  They travelled in and out of formation quite a bit, travelling much faster than any plane I had ever seen.  We watched them all the way home for approx. 3 miles. Once arriving home, we never really thought about them again and went into the house.  We then shortly went outside to the camper, and with the power connection began playing nintendo.  We were concentrating on the game and talking when we noticed what seemed to be a &quot;silent&quot; engine get louder and louder (I say silent because it got louder so gradually that it was hardly noticable).  We looked outside at one point, towards the north above the &quot;mountain&quot; side.  Being such a clear night, we could see a shape in the sky that blacked out the stars around it, above the trees.  It seems almost surreal as when we were looking, it was as if it sensed us and backed over the trees and mountain.  This happened several times over the next hour.  We weren&apos;t really afraid, more intrigued.  At one point we fell asleep, not knowing if it happened again throughout the night. I just remember it being very large, blocking out starlight, (10-15 meters wide, 75-100 meters long), and having such a strange engine sound to almost not have a sound.

It seemed to be much more of a protective covering much like the turtle shell shape I mentioned earlier.The ships flew right over the north side of Lake Havasu City on a Friday night in the middle of the summer no less, so there had to be more witnesses like the hundreds of people that were probably still on the lake. The ships continued to the direct west and never appeared to be aware of our near presence, although we all experienced about 15-30 minutes of missing time prior to the sighting.

All the same color white. until the end when 4 burned out and one started to burn orange.", "Was walking my dog outside and it was already night time. Looking at the stars as usual I see a star like object moving. Im not sure if it was a satellite but it sure was moving fast and a little hard to see cause it was so high up. It was circling another star and I ran inside to call everyone. When they got outside it was gone so I continued walking the dog and everyone went in. I then saw the same object on almost the other side of the sky &quot;forgive my bad grammar&quot;. I live extremley close to MacDill Air Force base but this was totally different then the average jet or plane we see going by. Im not saying this was a ufo but this was definatley strange and different.", "3 lights travelling across western skyI was facing almost due west.  I looked up to see 3 lights, flying parallel to each other in a line, apparently from SE to NW.  They appeared pretty high.  By the time I saw them, they were about at the center of my view.  I approx. 3 seconds, they traveled about 3 inches(arms length) until my view of them was obstructed by a building.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; satellites, although satellites almost never have a westerly component to their groundtrack.  If, in fact, the objects were moving to the northwest, they were not satellites.

It was clear to the east and became slightly clouded as you looked west. I saw what I can only describe as odd clouds. About eight of them they stood out in a strange way. There were other clouds but this looked like the fall out of fireworks except they pulsated briefly. I heard no explosions. Thet were plain as day, I walked across the parking lot to get out of the parking security lights for a better look. They were faiding very slowly but just fast enough to wonder what the hell the deal was with them. I trecognized that they were dwindling and finially they faded out completely. I noticed that the first cloud to dim out came back for a second with what I thought was a craft like image in the middle causing it to be seen. I certainly have seen strange lights before but this was very strange. It was like I caught the end of something but when the first cloud came back it was too much to accept as weather related, something caused it. I heard nothing the whiole time except a train in the background.", "Objects cross paths.A lady called me from Prince George, B.C. to report a sighting that she and her mother had. The first witness to the sighting had been laying down with her young son when her Mom came into the room and said she could hear what they thought was a kitten crying just outside their home. So the two ladies went outside to have a look for the crying cat when the porch light suddenly went out. One of the ladies looked up into the sky and towards the west and noticed a light traveling through the sky heading in their direction which was towards the east. She thought it may have been a satellite or a airplane. But the light was far to low in altitude for it to be a satellite and there was no sound or any flashing lights so she ruled out a plane of some kind. As the white light approached closer and over top of their home it grew much brighter, extremely bright she said. The object continued it&apos;s flight towards the east and at one point the ladies Mother saw another light coming towards the one they were already watching, but the second light was traveling from the north and heading to the south. As both witnesses watched, the lights met up in the night sky and blinked out as they crossed each other&apos;s path. The woman told me they just disappeared. The first light was observed for approx: three minutes and the second light was observed for approx: 1 1/2 minutes before they both vanished. No tail was following behind any of the lights. It was also a clear night. No aircraft were seen inn the area when the sighting took place. Thank you to the witness for the report.

At roughly 10:40 pm I walked out of my house and looked up at the sky, surprised to see stars after the recent heavy rains.  I saw to the west a large dark mass with about 6-8 lights.  It was traveling rapidly across the horizon heading east.  The mass split into 2 sections of about 3-4 lights each.  The 2 masses then danced together, merging and seperating as they crossed the sky rapidly.  The entire sighting lasted only about 5 or 6 seconds.  My husband thought it was a satelite, since he says he only saw 1 light and it&apos;s speed was so fast, but it appeared very low to me.The lights were white, with a darker mass apparent between them.  The sky was mostly clear with few visible clouds.", "45 of us were  on the Bus, standing  to see the objects, then flash, and everyone was in their seats again15 bright lights flying in v formation from north to south,  and flew over the bus, which was going east, I saw them first and told the other boys from the Job Corps, and we were excited  and standing in the isle to see them clearly, but when the objects were over us, there was a bright light, and I looked around, and all the boys were calmly sitting in their seats again, all in an instant; how is that possible?  then none of the boys would talk about what happened.", "Cambridgeshire, England. The conditions were excellent: blue skies, with a few sizable white clouds making an appearance. At around 11:45am, I noticed a single bright &quot;dot&quot; in the sky, almost as high as a satellite would appear at night. No sound was coming from the object. It was moving very slowly. I decided to fetch a pair of 10-zoom binoculars so that I could get a clearer inspection. Through the binoculars, the object appeared oblong-shaped, with luminous sides that alternately glowed then dimmed as it continued to travel slowly along in a strange tumbling-like motion. All the time it maintained its near-satellite altitude. The middle of the oblong-shaped object appeared translucent, and I could see blue sky through it. At no time was the sun reflecting off the object. The object also wasn&apos;t a balloon, as it appeared to stop for 20 seconds or so before moving on. The object was proceeding in a westerly direction, until two USAF tanker planes appeared close by from the south, at around 20,000 feet. The object then changed direction, gliding slowly about the sky in it&apos;s strange, tumbling motion -- falling end over end -- at the same altitude. I continued to watch the object through binoculars until it was directly overhead. A light aircraft, at around 5,000 feet, passed under the object. I eventually lost sight of the object in a big cloud. I gave up observing due to a stiff neck!  I&apos;ve seen some strange aerial objects in this part of Cambridgeshire (we also get chemtrails around here too), but this one ranks as the most bizarre, due to its odd plasma-like, quasi-organic appearance. I&apos;m not a trained observer, just a normal civilian.", "Bright light with red around center moved towards usAt 0315 hours one of the kids was in need of water, returned child to bed and stayed up for an hour. Upon returning to bed at 0415 June 5, 2004 and looking out large window on second story with unobstructed view to the south from our hillside home, I noticed a strange bright star? I continued into master bedroom and then backed up and walked over to side window for second look. The object was gleaming in the sky with star shape form with red tint around center with an estimated distance of 3,500 south and 500&apos; from ground. I rubbed my eyes and continued to watch for ten (10) minutes prior to waking my wife. We then both continued to observe the star like object for several minutes with object maintaining horizontal and vertical position. After approximately 8 minutes the object started to move towards us, north, and to the west the and rapidly moved up behind homes to the west of our home approximately 500&apos; due west. The object was now heading due north behind homes. As object moved, we ran down stairs and out the front door. The object moved out from behind and directly above neighbors home and shape appeared to be diamond shape with cylinders at each corner extending up 20&apos; high with white light, bright white light! It appeared to be solid light. The object was estimated to be 150&apos; to 185&apos; long. I purposely listened for any type of engine sound similar to aircraft, none detected. As the object gracefully moved past or from behind house accross street, it headed west with out tilting like typical aircraft and settled below ridge west of neighbors home with out noise and with in 150 to 300&apos; of horizontal distance/travel.

We are all in our early twenties.  We were just going to our homes from my mother&rsquo;s home, which we visit every Sunday to play a game of Risk, when we found my sister had left her keys in the car.  So one of my cousins took the key out and put it on the doorstep because the house was locked behind us.Then my other cousin pointed up at the sky and my wife and I saw this transparent triangle shape.  It flew heading North to South.  I could make out the edges because the transparency did not go all the way to the edge.  It was kind of just fuzzy on the edges.  The object made absolutely no sounds.  There seemed to be no emitted light.  The sighting lasted all of about 2 seconds before it disappeared from view behind some trees.  The cousin who was putting the key on the doorstep did not get to see it there was a porch awning in the way.  He ran out after we all said &quot;what the hell is that?&quot;.  He thought we were lying.  After we all described what we saw and speculated what it could have been, we decided to stay there a few minutes to see if it would come back.  The cousin that did not see the triangle went out to the middle of the lawn and started running in circles staring at the Big Dipper.  Then he all of a sudden stopped and pointed up. A smaller triangle had appeared in the sky and was headed from North to more Southeast.  It looked more like 2 shaded triangles that may have been linked by a transparent piece or something else.  This one had more speed and disappeared into the night sky.  At first we thought this one was just ducks or geese, but then realized that they usually make noise when flying and do not fly in such a perfect formation.  The cousin that had not seen the first one, now believed us.  We stood around and speculated on this one too, we all drew some pictures of what we thought both looked like on the hood of my sisters car, in the dust that was all over it, and the pictures turned out pretty much identical.  My younger brother, age 15, heard all the noise we were making and looked out his window.  We motioned for him to come down stairs and he did.  We explained this all to him then went back to watching the sky.  We waited to see if another would appear but after about 20 minutes we decided it is time to go home. All we saw in the 20 minutes was 2 Satellites in the sky righ! t above us. One went north to south the other south to north.None of us have ever seen anything like this.  We all agreed on the shape and transparency of the triangles.  We also all agreed that they appeared to be paper-thin.  They made no noise at all, and also made no apparent air disturbance that we could feel or see.  The night was perfectly clear. Not a cloud in sight or on the horizon.  We also could not see the moon in the sky, it might have not risen over the mountains at that point.  My cousins went home and found this article on this web page http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37316.html which sparked my intrest to post my experience.  I will try to have images posted on my web page that each of us have drawn.  http://www.undergroundvine.net/ufo.", "I watched two dim lit objects in the night sky and one object flew straifgt and the second object zig zaged and stopped in mid flight,ton June 24,2004 I was on my third story Deck looking to the east when i noticed a dim light in the sky comming from the southwest moving to the north east.There were three commercial airliners in the sky at this time and this dim light was miles and miles above the commercial aircraft. The dim object was traveling in a straight line to the north east at a very fast speed compaired to the speed of the commercial aircraft in the sky.I observed the object for approx. 45 seconds to one minute.After that amount of time, the light in the object went out and i could no longer see the object.After seeing this i light up a smoke and was scanning the sky looking for more objects. after a few minutes of scanning the sky, i saw another dim lit object in the northern sky heading striaght to the south.The object appeared to be at about the same altitude as the first object I had seen a few minutes earlier. The object was dimmly lit, and while moving to the south,this object was zig zagging and stopping in mid flight and the moving again. I observed this object for atleast one minute before the light in the object went out and I could no longer see it.The sky was clear and no clouds in site during my observations of these two objects.These two sightings occured between 10:37pm and 10:45pm CST.at Lincoln,Nebraska.", "I saw a cigar shaped craft.It was grey in color,cigar shaped and with many lights on it.It was moving at a really fast pace.

We were leaving.  The sky was clear.  It was about 11 PM.  Several of us were walking down their drive way, we were facing east.  A very bright light, it looked more like a round glob of intense white light streaked from west to east over our heads.  There was no noise.  It went from above us to the horizon in a couple of seconds.  I asked what it was and just started up at the sky.  A few seconds later two objects indentcal to the first streaked overhead going the same direction.  I had spent four years in the Air Force were I had worked on the radar and weapons systems electronics.  Any plane I had seen could not have appeared to move that fast unless it had been on the deck and moving at least a couple hundred miles an hour.

So i ran,but i was bare foot on gravel,and i hurt my foot on a rock. I got to the street(my cousin lives just in town)and i just passed the mailbox,when a pink light fell down over me, into a circle on the black top. I felt so scared,I tried to move but coudn&apos;t.

But i then tried to roll onto my right side, facing my cousin,but i couldn&apos;t move again! All i could do was move my eyes. So i panicked again! I felt a tingle feeling,like your foot is asleep. I felt it at my neck and shoulders,and my feet,it faded away,disapearing at my waiste. I calmed down and was able to move again.I rolled over on my back. Then i sat up andtried to breath normal, Then something caught my eye,i looked out the window, and there it was. All i saw was a blue,purple and pink blur with a white dot Seeming to be on top,soaring in a zig-zag formation, Then it finally zoomed off! It scared the crape out of me!

And...i had an impression in my foot that hurt where i felt it hurt in my dream!So i ran downstairs and told my mom. But she just told me it was a dream and to go to sleep. I am not sure what exactly happened to me in that time i was asleep,but i KNOW what i have just told you is real! No matter what any one says or thinks! I know!

One of the objects traveled slowly down to hover above one of the other objects, but for the most part, they all stayed in one spot.  Three remained in a triangular formation and one of them remained above the rest of the group.

I decided to get a closer look at it thinking that it was probably some airplane, but when I took a look through my binoculars, it turned out to be some sort of diamond shaped craft.. I can&apos;t be to sure of this, but it had turned around in circles, and its lights where in the middle of this blinking light.. I then noticed that one of the lights got bigger and as it got bigger, the craft kept turning around.

I got closer as I drove and noticed it wasn&apos;t moving, or it was moving towards me and I couldn&apos;t tell.

As we drove, one of us noticed the object in the sky. It was impossible to determine the size of the craft as we had no way of telling how high above us it was. It was possible to clearly see its shape (a jet black triangle) against the night sky. There were no lights of any kind that we could see, so we assumed it was not a plane. We stopped the car and watched the object fly slowly over us and behind a hillside, making further observation impossible. Judging by its speed, it seemed unlikely that it was a standard aircraft (and also judging by its shape and the lack of lights - the area is part of a flight path to Manchester Airport so we&apos;re well used to planes flying over, and know what they look for), and having seen a number of military planes fly over, it was moving too slowly to be one of those. There was also the fact that we could hear no sound from it. It&apos;s true that there are people who own private gliders and motor-powered gliders in the area, but having seen those fly over my house before I know that we would have heard an engine. There&apos;s also the fact that anyone flying a glider at that hour in the dark would have to be suicidal. It&apos;s possible that it was a stealth plane, although that seems highly unlikely in West Yorkshire, and I would have assumed that such a craft would have flown faster. We ultimately observed the object for a period of no more than ten minutes, and we all agreed that not only had we never seen anything like it before, but that we had no idea what it was. At the time we didn&apos;t report it as we felt foolish claiming to have seen a UFO. There was no report in the local newspaper at the time either, so clearly no one else reported it! I only tell you now as I found your website this evening. (Incidentally, the only reason I remember the date is because I keep a record of all the films I see.)  I would be interested to know if any other such sightings have been made in the area.

At that point 2 other objects which also appeared to be black spheres approached the first sphere from different points and took a triangle formation.

There was no sound or contrails present.", "I saw a Huey heliocopter  trailing a very large non light emiiting object at night at low elevation and low speed.A Huey heliocopter was making passes from SW to NE and NE to SW back and forth and trending in a southerly direction as a farmer would spray or plough a field. the direction between the parrallel rows I estimated to be about one and one quarter mile.The heliocopter caught my attention when he made an easterly pass to the north of my position, because he was flying way too low to be in compliance with FAA rules and he was moving very slowly. About 15 minutes later the helicopter returned on its return pass with a southwesterly heading. It was hard to make a visual sighting of the heliocopter at first because of his extremely low flight elevation.  I could hear the helicopter for a couple of minutes before I could see him.  Now keep in mind that at the time I was busy unloading my van at my business partners/friends house and I wasn&apos;t really focusing all of my attention on the heliocopter.  I have seen many helicopters many times and they are no big deal to me. The reason I was paying attention to this one was because I was curious about the incredibly low elevation it was flying at and I wanted to see if it was private or military.  When it finally came into view at a distance of about 950-1100 yards, something caught my eye in front of it.  I blinked because I didn&apos;t really see anything other than the heliocopter at first glance but as it got closer, maybe 800 yards away, I suddenly realized what had caught my attention. The sky was very bright that night and as I looked to the north towards the town of Ceres at low angles you could easily see the outlines of utility poles because they were very dark against a light sky that was glowing orange.  What had caught my attention was the light of stars being blocked out by an object that was proceeding immediately in front of the Heliocopter.  I was awestruck as the object and the helicopter passed overhead about 200 yards to my north and at an elevation of no more than 100 yards, probably lower.  At the closeest approach I could easily see that outline of this craft or object as it was completely and totally black.  It was immense in size it must have been 8 to ten times as long as the Huey helicopter that was following it.  I would estimate that the speed was no more than 35 miles per hours.  The shape  of the craft was clean and aerodynamic at the leading edge, perhaps like the front of a jet but fatter or I should say it widened at a greater angle than any aircraft I had ever seen.  About 100 feet or more back from the leading edge the objects shape got very complicated.  There was a tremnedous appendage that was somewhat akin to a giant irregular keel that hung down towards the ground and was probably no more than 150 feet above the ground.  The sides and top of the rear half of the object had a large number of what appeard to be angular protuberances of many different shapes sticking out from the craft.  I must reiterate that the craft emitted absolutely no light whatsoever and I could only see it by its outline against a lighter sky.  Needless to say I was rather excited and I yelled loudly several times for my friend Tom Copeland to come out of his house quickly.  By the time he did it was too late for him see much of anything except for the departing helicopter.  The object seemed to either adsorb light or it had an albedo of zero.  This was brought home by the fact that the Huey was shining a tremendously bright light at the object.  Either the heliocopter was making small side to side movements or they were moving the light from side to side.  When the light didn&apos;t intercept the object, you could see its beam for over a half mile in the air.  When the light did intercept the object it was extinguished at the point of contact.  You could see nothing on the surface of the object nor was any light reflected.  There was a sound I heard that I don&apos;t know the source of that can be described as something like the ping sound that a sonar unit makes on a submarine.  I don&apos;t know if it emanated from the object or the Huey.  I have thought about the way the heliocopter was acting and I have come up with a couple of ideas.  Maybe the flight crew was moving the spotlight back and forth because they couldn&apos;t really see the object either and this helped them to &quot;see&quot; it by watching the beam of light extinguis! h just as I was watching it.  I don&apos;t know if they were picking it up on their onboard radar or not and perhaps they were afraid of running into it.  This constitutes the bulk of my sighting information.", "20:30 06/22/04To bright objects just above and north of the moon that disappered within about five mintues of each other.above and to the right of the crescent moon were what appreared to be two stars about as bright as veins, I&apos;m no pro, but I know they did&apos;t belong there. I got out my 4-1/2 reflector telescope, but I could not find them in my spotter scope, so I ran in the house for my binoculars, the objects were still there but appred to have moved apart just a little. They did not twenkle like stars,just solid steady lights. I tried again to find them with my telescope (my spotter is durty and out of focus) I looked up with my naked eye to see how close I was and one of them was gone, that was about 20:40, it was only then that I noticed Jupiter was visable, I had no problem finding it with my telescope, then turned back to the last object looked at it then into the spotter scope again, still couldn&apos;t see, then look again with my naked eye and it was gone too, at aprox 20:45.", "I was listening to Peter&apos;s interview with George Noory on June 4th.  I thought I would mention this.  My companion at the time also saw this as you&apos;ll read below, but he has refrained from speaking about it.  But this is my story. I was flying right seat in a Cessna 172 from Flint &quot;Bishop&quot; MI going to Toledo &quot;Express&quot; Ohio.  I was flying with another broadcast engineer as we were returning from work in Lapeer MI. Note the map attached to an E-mail I&apos;m going to send. Our flight path is in blue heading south.  The dots on Monroe County show where we deviated from our path, almost landing at Lambertville &quot;Suburban&quot; MI.  The red is the path of the objects. It was dusk and we heading South around Milan MI, just talking about a directional antenna that we were working on.  I turned to the left to speak to my companion, &quot;Tom&quot;, and saw (5) white lights in the distance.  I made mention to Tom, and he saw them too, about 315 degrees from our direction of travel (South). We watched them for about 30 seconds, and could tell that their travel was to the west.  We called the control tower for Toledo Express and asked if he had travel ((traffic??)) in the area.  Toledo said no.  Another 30 seconds later we called again, and Toledo responded by saying, &quot;sir, we have no traffic and nothing on radar&quot;. By this time they were about 340 degrees and growing larger, which to me indicated that we were closing on the object. Just then another pilot who was in Fulton County (Ohio) came on the radio and said, &quot;I see those lights too.  I&apos;m heading toward Metcalf (SE of Toledo), and they are 10-O&apos;Clock to me.&quot;  Toledo Express then came back on the air and said, &quot;Gentlemen, we don&apos;t have any traffic in the area.&quot;  Tom and looked at each other, and he said, &quot;let&apos;s chase it.&quot;   I suggested that it would not be wise not knowing what it was, or if it was military, and deviated from our flight plan to waste some time and put some distance between each other.  See the dots. After we landed we talked about it, but felt that any pursuit of the story could lead to jeopardy of our pilots license. The five lights were in a formation, and it was a clear night and at it&apos;s closest I could see clouds between the objects which appeared to be about 2,000 higher than we were.  We were around 5,000 feet.  At our closest they were probably between 4 to 6 miles off our right wing.  The formation was not in any pattern that would resemble lights on an aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, although the pilot should be able to reconstruct the exact time and date from his flight logs.  The witness elects to remain totally anonymous, so we are unable to communicate with him.  We would like to invite the party who submitted the report to confirm the date with the pilot, and report back to us.  PD))", "I worked at a west coast AFB. We had a project called Deep Space Probe. It is a powerfull  telescope that would track satillites. On one day we watched an object flying around one. We called the Penitgon and reported what we saw. Five minutes later they called back and told us never to look at that part ofthe sky again.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I ran to get a second witness, the second person looked through the telescope and also saw the large shadow.  After about 15 minutes passed I noticed the shadow to be moving across the surface of the moon.  As it moved across the surface it also began getting smaller, as if the object casting the shadow was moving further from the surface of the moon.  When the shadow reached the far end of the moon, it moved into dark space and I was able to see the shape of an object moving through space, but could not make out detail.  It definitely appeared to be moving under it&apos;s own power!", "It was one solid light.I was at the intersection FM1787 &amp; FM1788 when I noticed a light going from south to north not blinking a the jets do. This is what made me pull over and stop. I drive a crude oil truck. I work one week of days and one week of nights. I&apos;ve done this for 20 years. When it was going across the sky it was about 4 inches below jupiter. When it reached jupiter it went straight up out of sight and i had turned all the lights off of my 18 wheeler to watch it. After it went straight up you could&apos;nt see it no more.At first I thought it was a jet when i saw it but there was no blinking lights.", "sphere of white light follows plane, then disappears into the night skyI&apos;m typing this 2 hours after the sighting. At 10:15PM, my neighbor, his wife, and I observed an airplane being followed by a sphere of white light. What caught my eye were two lights in the sky, traveling close together. Upon further inspection, I saw that the lead craft was an airplane, as there were flashing beacons on the wing tips. It was flying towards us. We do live close to the RDU airport. There was a craft behind it, following closely. However, there were no beacon lights on it. It was a completely round, spherical white light. The airplane turned left and the sphere followed it. Now going to our right, approximately 10 seconds since the plane turned, the sphere of white light disappeared. We watched the plane for about 3 minutes until it hit the horizon, where we could not see it anymore. There were no clouds. It was a clear night. The Big Dipper was right above us. We did not see the sphere after that. This was really weird.", "Saw the craft flying horizontally, it then climbed and disapeared.I was walking to school when I saw a disc that seemed to have two wings on the sides.  it flew at a constant speed about 250&apos; altitude in a hprizonal direction.  It then climbed at about a 40 degree angle and then disapeared.  I know what a plane looks like, but this craft gave me chills.", "Satellite looking object making right angle turnThe light I saw looked like a satellite tracking from north to south. I have observed several of them over the years but this one was different somehow. The light seemed to pulsate. I can&rsquo;t really say but it did capture my attention. As I watched it crossing the night sky it suddenly made a right angle turn on a dime and accelerated to an incredible speed and streaked off to the west. As it did this what looked like a small streak of light shot passed right where the object had been moments before. It seemed as if this streak of light came from the ground up.", "Blue, star sized, lights that zigzag across the sky from horizon to horizon their jerky motions could not be natural.We were up at the lake fishing for most of the day. When it got dark we drove around the park and found some other people staying late and parked by them so that we would feel safer and to watch the stars. The other people there were partying but we, my ex and I, had no alcohol or drugs. We laid in the bed of the pick up truck to look for shooting stars and I started to notice what looked like a Satellite or a NASA Shuttle dot of light slowly going across the sky. I have been watching these kind of lights for years and didn&apos;t really think anything about it. But right as it was heading towards the horizon I started to notice little BLUE pin pricks of light zipping past the slow moving, white, satellite. At first I thought I was just moving my head and it was just a star or something reflecting off the lenses of my glasses but after the first one I began to see more of them and they were not following the same path as the other. The first one went straight along the same direction as the Satellite but the next one was zigzagging back and forth across the sky! They were about the size of the average, mid sized, star in the night sky but a bright aqua blue. They appeared to be extremely high in the atmosphere. Over the next hour or so I saw one maneuvering across the sky jerky Zigzag, Smooth and straight, and S-Shaped curves. From the position of laying in the bed of the pick up truck looking straight up it took about 4 seconds from spotting it to disappearing below the horizon. It was an amazing experience that I will never forget and I still look for them when I am driving across the southwestern states and have a good clear view of the sky!  I was a believer just on the facts but having an experience where I could actually see something this extraordinary myself has truly crystallized my belief that we are truly not alone!!", "Four balls of red light dashed across the sky from the south, stopped, then made right angled turns to the east.I was star-gazing with my boyfriend in his back yard -- I&apos;m a pharmacy tech and he&apos;s currenty changing careers from computers to truck driving. It was a very clear night and a lot of stars were visible. Just before our u.f.o. sighting we saw what my boyfirend says were satelites moving across the sky. I also saw a shooting star (only one) in between our satelite viewings.We were starring in the section of the sky where the Northern Cross lies when all of a sudden four balls of red light dashed across the sky in front of us. I saw four lights, my boyfriend saw three -- the fourth was somewhat behind the others and farther up in the sky). The objects came from the south and were spred across the sky, they were not flying close together. They dashed in front of us, then slowed down to a stop before they darted off in a right angled turn towards the east and disappeared. I started laughing when they came to a stop because all I could think of was &quot;Oh my God, they are flying in &quot;military V&quot; formation!!&quot; Well..it wasn&apos;t a complete V shape but it was close. It might sound strange, but the lights seemed to me to be....translucent.", "My wife and myself were traveling to a friends house for a new years party. We started from Coffeville Missisippi on State Road 32 via Charleston to Webb. It was a very cold and extremely clear night. While riding we observed a large object traveling parallel to us at a speed slightly faster than we were going (approx 55 mph). This object was more turtle shaped than a saucer and large (maybe 4 or 5 times larger than our car). It was at a low altidude maybe 40 or 50 ft. It&apos;s color was a orange greenish glow. There were no windows or ports that we could determine. We observed it for approximately 5 minutes as it maintained a level path on our right side before decending into a swampy wooded area just outside of the town of Webb. We decided to tell no one and didn&apos;t for years. Later on we told this to our friends who we visited and they told us that there was another lady who also saw this object but was ridiculed when reporting it to friends.", "Ball of Light Buzzes Burbank AirportI was outside on break having a cigarette. I&apos;ve always looked up to the sky when outside as I am the child of a Air Force Lifer. I looked up and a bright white ball of light flew right over the top of my head at about 3000 miles an hours. It was about 500 feet in the air, and simply massive. Not only did I see it blow by me clearly, but I also heard a whoosh of air as it blasted past. It was headed east and blew right across the burbank airport. This thing flew across the San Fernando Valley in clear sight. It brought goose bumps all the way down my back. I remember thinking how advanced the craft was. Like nothing we have in our Air Force or NASA. I also remember thinking as it scared the hell out of me, &quot;What the hell are they doing here?&quot; I mean, this thing was so far ahead of us, we&apos;re like, not even ants to whoever has technology like that. The vessel was silent. The only noise was the whoosh of air. Another guy was sitting there at the table outside, and I said, &quot;Did you SEE that?&quot; He said, &quot;See what?&quot; You wouldn&apos;t have even needed to be looking at the sky for it to catch your eye it was so bright. Okay, it looked like it was made of white glass. It was I estimate, at least 100 feet around. It glowed from inside the white glass walls. Like a flourescent bulb in an office ceiling, only a huge ball instead of a cylinder. Now, as I was out there every night taking my breaks, I used to watch the 707&apos;s and DC-8&apos;s coming in for their landings at burbank airport. I saw hundreds of planes come down from there. I know how fast they glide along the sky on their descent to the runway. This Ball of Light crossed the sky, at least, 10 times faster than those planes come in. I should also note that the very next night, I was listening to Mr. KABC on the radio, and some guy called into the show and reported seeing something buzz the Santa Monica airport. His discription was quite different than mine, not even close really, but two airports buzzed on two nights in LA, with two different types of U! FO&apos;s?

I thought the light was coming from outside because there are a lot of cars and cross signs around here.  The light lasted for about 3 seconds.  The object looked round, kind of like a disk.  The light was so bright that it was beaming below the craft making the object look bigger than it actually was, kind of like a jellyfish with it&apos;s body hanging below it.  Since it happened so quick I didn&apos;t really pay as much mind to it.  About 2 minutes later I saw a clearer craft.  It was the same shape and the lights were even brighter red.  Both objects seemed far away but very visible.  The second craft kind of floated around like it didn&apos;t know where to go and then it just disappeared so fast.  It was like one minute it was there so clearly and the next it was gone.  I couldn&apos;t even follow it.  It didn&apos;t fly straight either.

It was a warm, clear, moonless night, with a few clouds on the horizon opposite our direction of movement. We were steaming at a steady rate of approximately 5-7 knots; seas were calm, visibility approximately 12-15 nautical miles. A group of us was standing on the &quot;flight deck&quot; just forward of the fantail. Although it was quite dark, our eyes had become accustomed to the night from the light of the stars. We were facing aft, watching the wake of the ship slip toward the horizon, making small talk, when suddenly, out of nowhere, a very bright light appeared just above the wake, and looked to be approximately half-way between the ship and the horizon. There were clouds on that horizon so we knew it was between the clouds and the ship, but we couldn&rsquo;t determine much more about it. Because of the conditions, it was virtually impossible to tell how big it was or how far away it was. (If I had to make a guess as to its size, maybe a pea held at arm&rsquo;s length.) We couldn&apos;t discern any shape due to its brightness. It was brighter than Venus ever appears, almost brilliant but not blinding, and at first it seemed to be stationary. It was silent, as far as we could tell. But as we watched, it began to move slowly across the ship&apos;s wake from our right to our left. When it had crossed the wake, it stopped and then proceeded to move back the other way, from our left to our right. It did this a few times and, during this time, we were shouting to each other the excitement we felt as we were trying to analyze this object and its movements. &quot;Was it moving closer to us as it traversed the ship&apos;s wake?&quot; &quot;Was it a solid object or just a ball of light?&quot; &quot;Where did it come from?&quot; &quot;How did it get to where it first appeared without anyone seeing it?&quot; &quot;Did the ship&apos;s RADAR pick it up?&quot;  We watched in amazement for about three or four minutes, no longer. Abruptly, it stopped its movement altogether and appeared to just &quot;hover&quot; in place. Then, without warning or any change in its appearance (or sound) it shot directly straight up into the sky and within four or five seconds had apparently traveled out of sight, or it had dimmed out. But the general consensus at that time was that it appeared to diminish in brightness because it had traveled far enough away that it simply got too far for us to continue to observe it. The following day we asked some of the guys in the RADAR room and they all said nothing peculiar was picked up on RADAR that evening.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I then became aware of 5 self-illuminated triangular (maybe diamond-shaped) craft flying in a &quot;V&quot; formation to the east of the north star. There was a sixth craft of the same shape and size flying outside the formation but moving at the same speed and direction. This sixth craft seemed to be leading the others as it moved its position relative to the others occasionally (maybe to signal a change in course). The formation of crafts were traveling west and moved quite rapidly. Although I heard no sound the crafts were fairly high in the sky. The color of the illumination was transluscent yellow-orange.", "What looked at first like the average satellite made some abrupt turns before resuming its course northward.Firstly, sorry, I&apos;m not only guessing the date, I&apos;m also guessing the time - it could have been 22:00 or 24:00, I simply can&apos;t remember exactly. I happened to be taking a break from household chores and stood outside the back door to my home. I glanced upwards at the stars and, directly above me, I saw what I thought must be a satellite moving in a northerly direction, but much faster than any satellite I&apos;ve seen previously, perhaps three or four times as fast as I would normally expect. It had the appearance of a star, in magnitude about halfway between the brightness of Venus and the dimmest naked eye star. I continued to watch it and, to my surprise, after about five seconds the object made an abrupt wide turn to the left, turning enough to reverse its course momentarily and then turned back again. The turns weren&apos;t particularly smooth and there seemed to be a variation in speed, although I&apos;m no longer sure about that. The object resumed a straight course at an even speed (same speed as at first sighting taking greater distance into account) about ten degrees to the right of its original course. When it reached about forty five degrees above the horizon I lost it in the city haze. Had I seen it at that point I again would have assumed that it was a satellite. I know what high flying aircraft look like. I&apos;ve seen high altitude weather balloons during the day. I&apos;ve seen birds flying high with city lights reflecting off their wings. I see meteors periodically. This looked like a satellite, other than the movement and the speed.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I found a few long strands of the grass, and the part near the root is green.  The part at the very end is also green.  The middle of the strand that crossed the dead zone is brown.I took a lab-quality ferrous/non-ferrous metal detector to the entire portion of the yard and found nothing unusual in or out of the circle (my first thought was maybe a really old septic tank started seeping through cracks due to the extensive rain).There are no tread marks at all.  This happened immediately after a big rain, so the dirt spots would easily accept tire tracks.There are no bent or broken strands of grass, and nothing else seems unusual except for the dead spots.  The geometry is too perfect to be natural.  I know there are lawn diseases that cause brown circles, but the lines are too thin, too much diameter, and too perfect.  There is too much live grass between the circles.On the outer circle, there are two equally geometric &quot;dashes&quot; as thick as the circle&apos;s line, pointing outward.I have lots of pictures I will send if you like.

Later at 8pm, they both re-appeared in the West, moving back and forth and up and down.

Then it came back and hovered again over our heads and took off in the other direction, again, out of our vision.

It scared me half to death and I vowed to always remember this experience.  I had just come home from saxophone lessons and while getting out of my fathers truck I noticed that the night sky was very dark. Noticing it and thinking nothing of it, I rushed inside and upstairs into my bedroom to put my sax away.  I closed my bedroom door almost all the way, flipped the wall switch on, and the lamp on top of my dresser came on.  As I emptied my pockets onto the dresser, some sort of movement outside my bedroom window caught my eye enough that made me look directly out the window.  I looked for just a moment and thought that my eyes were playing tricks.  At the very instant that I turned away, I got intense goosebumps all over my body, and the lamp on my dresser went out.  At this point I was startled by something out of the corner of my eye and turned and looked out the window to my left which i was standing less than 15 feet away from.  Outside the window there was a pulsating spherish orb of blue light about 1 foot in diameter.  It was such a luminescent blue light that I was captivated by it&apos;s beauty and scared to death at the same time.  I was so scared that I don&apos;t think I even tried to move, I was frozen in place by fear.  Shortly after I had noticed this Blue orb of light, it moved toward the window, and somehow moved through the window into my room.  Once this sphere had completely moved through the window, it dissappeared.  Now the sphere dissappeared, however instantly a band of light of exactly the same color about 1 foot wide appeard on the floor, walls, and ceiling forming a tube around the room, up the walls and across the floors and ceiling, accompanied by a loud electric hum.  It started at the window side of the room and moved across the room at about 2 or 3 feet per second with the hum.  The light travelled across the entire room much like the bar of light on a photocopy machine, and dissappeared when it hit the opposite end of the room.  The soun! d was gone too, and there was nothing to see at the window.  I was so scared that when the light and hum were gone I was still frozen in place for a few seconds.  Then I rushed to the switch, flipped it twice, and it did not come on.  Then I ran to the stairs, slid down them on my behind, and ran into the livingroom hysterically crying to my mother and explained what I saw after she said that she did not see anything or see anything.  She told me it may have been ball lightning.  I don&apos;t know what it was, but I know that it was there because I saw it with my own two eyes.  The lightbulb in the lamp on my dresser was burnt out.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This is a remote area and at 10:45 pm there is no ambient light. I stepped out on to my porch and looked up at the night sky.  There was a huge cloud bank covering half the sky.  In front of the cloud bank were 5 maybe six very large luminiscent sheets of light.  These translucent forms danced and darted around the night sky and then all of them came together.  After a couple seconds of being together, they would shoot out of the center and dance around the sky again, then back to the center. Each explosion from the center started a new direction for each light. This lasted for about an hour.  It slowly diminished, to 4, then 3, 2,1 and then gone. And so was the large cloud bank.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length via telephone, and found her to be quite sincere, and quite lucid and objective in her description of the events she addresses above.  We do not know what it was she witnessed.  PD))", "Strange Hovering ObjectMe and my friend T were driving from his house to my brothers house. On the way, T (riding in the passanger seat)noticed a bright light and it appeared to be dropping into the atmosphere. He said &quot;Oh my God, a bomb is dropping!&quot;. By the time I directed my attention to the object (only a split moment later), we were just coming to the top of a small hill, and at first, I thought it was a street light (it was the same color as a streetlight). I told T to stop pulling my leg, and then he said &quot;look!&quot; and the object was moving off to the right.As we continued down the road, we seemed to be gaining on the object. We continued forward into a Publix parking lot(It was relatively empty, because it had just closed). At that point, the object was hovering right over the treeline (however many feet up is impossible to tell), and, if I were to guess, I&apos;d say it was close enough to see us. We were behind the grocery store looking at the object in amazement. We both stepped out of the car to get a better look, and the object seemed to be slowly getting closer. Me and my friend got a good look at the object: It was surrounded by a series of maybe 10 or 12 smaller lights (from what I remember, they were neon bluish), and in the middle of the circle there was a significantly bigger orangeish/red light.The object got closer and closer to us, untill there was no doubt in our minds that it wasn&apos;t hovering there by coincidence, it must have known we were almost right under it! After a few minutes of hovering, it took off in a blur. T and I were confused as to which direction it went in. Neither of us could agree as to which way it went, therefore, we had no clue as to which road to take to follow it. The craft made no noticeable noise. There was a series of strange occurances that took place for a couple of weeks after the sighting, the first one being later that night/next morning:  I fell asleep at T&apos;s house that night. When I awoke (~5am) I jumped up in fright from the bean bag chair I fell asleep in, and quickly woke my friend. I didn&apos;t know why I was so worked up. I didn&apos;t recall any particularly scary dreams, in fact, I didn&apos;t recall any dreams at all. A few days later, I awoke to my door slamming shut (~11am). There was nobody home at the time, nor had there been for hours. While I was undressing to take a shower, I looked at my back in the mirror and there were 2 sets 3 horizontal red lines on the back of my shoulders. One set for each side. I attempted to feel them, but couldn&apos;t. They were as smooth as my skin. There were no scabs or anything. I thought they may have been stretch marks, but from my experience with stretch marks, I have always been able to feel their indentation. they were evenly spaced and about 4 inches long. T&apos;s father awoke to a slamming door at around 3am a few days after that. He didn&apos;t tell me about it untill I mentioned that it happened to me first. About 5 months later, me and T were playing videogames. We heard a very strange noise outside his window, and the only way I could describe it was that it sounded painfull and somewhat like a bird and a human scream combined, but not overly loud. We both paused for a few moments, commented on the strangeness of the sound, and continued playing games. I soon went home, but before leaving, Me and T investigated his backyard to see if we could find what made the noise. We found nothing, and I went home that night. The next day T said he had the same marks I had. His brother M said that he awoke to something scurrying around the room when his 1 year old was crying. M thought it was a ghost. I never saw T&apos;s marks, cause they healed in like 2 days, where mine took over a weak, so I never got to compare the marks.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

A few moments later, Debi, trying so look at the jet through binoculars, accidentally spotted an object following it.  It looked like a sphere made up of oval lobes.  For a few minutes it followed the jet, then it changed to an easterly course.  She followed it into the east, when she lost sight of it. The next day, ((name deleted)) contacted the nearby Medford International Airport, to see if they had noticed anything following the jet.  They took her name and number, saying they would get back to her, which they never did.  Later we called and left a phone message for MUFON, but we never heard anything back from them. A few months prior to witnessing this orb, our 12 year old granddaughter, who was living with us at the time, sold us she had a dream that she was taken out through the  cieling of her room.  She thought it was just a dream, but the nest day we saw a group of perfectly round bruises on the area of her  back near her coccx. She did not remember any play or other activity which could have caused such uniform, round bruises. We took her to her doctor, but he was unable to identify any possible cause. He and his colleagues had never seen anyhting like them. A few weeks later, my wife had a similar dream.  I think she needs to share it with someone.  She was taken through the ceiling into a bright, oval room.  She was on a metallic table, and a device emerged from the ceiling.  Three bright beams of light came from it, focussing on her stomach.  Then, she awoke back in our home, on her bed.  After she shared her dream with me, I noticed a large deep bruise on the right side of her naval, with three hole-marks in a triangular shape. This made us wonder if it was a dream, or did it really happen?  I am a psychologist and I do testing for the State of Oregon, and my wife is an intelligent, mature woman.  We are not given to wild imagination or conspiracy theories. We have reason to believe that aliens have been abducting other members of her family, including her mother, a sister and at least one brother (who won&apos;t speak about it).

I was only out there about 3 minutes or so when I noticed a white, round light in the sky with what had appeared to be smoke by it, I couldn&apos;t give a size but it was smaller than half of the sun a perfect circle it was. It did not move. Not knowing what it was I ran in the house and yelled to my brother and my husband to come and look but by the time they reached the window facing that direction they could see the smoke that was still there, and no light object, and just to note the smoke seen was not coming from the ground or from any direction if was just around the object. I know what I saw was a light not a plane or anything like that it just sat in the same place. I know it was not there when I first stepped outside because it was just that noticeable. I then called non-emergency police department in Fairmont to see if maybe any one had reported seeing anything in sky she told me no and I replied I don&apos;t want to tell you what I saw because I think you would think I was crazy.

The lights would blink on and off and also moving in same direction and suddenly wenI was among a number of people that witnessed two red lights blinking off and on in the eastern sky near San Diego.  They would move apart and then get close to each other, never merging into one.  They also moved towards our direction as if it was one craft.  They were probably 2500 to 3000 ft. high directly over us.  There were probably more than a thousand people on the side of this hill to view the 4th of July fireworks in the valley below.  This is the third time I have seen these lights in the past three years.  The other times were ironically both on New Years Eve.

On event duration I put in 15 seconds but I left and ran home (through trees) before the craft, which moving and turning slowly, left view. This triangle was not a sharp arrowhead type but just the opposite: a wing-like triangle much shorter than its width. Its appearence was wider than the moon, maybe two and a half moons. It was bright gold colored and there was no variation that would give a clue as to any curvature or depth to it. It could have been a flying flat two dimensional object for all I could tell. It was turning slowly without banking and there was no sound nor exhaust. The turning was gradual and I assumed it was a small directional correction rather than a complete change but I didn&apos;t observe the final direction.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The light was reddish white, apparent size was that of a pea at arm&apos;s length, magnitude about three/ four times Venus. I began taping because I did not hear any noise associated with aircraft. As the object passed to my west, I could see that it was two large spherical lights, one behind the other. There were no &quot;nav&quot; lights, no noise, no change in intensity as these lights went off to the NE.  I also checked the position of the ISS, which was mid Pacific, heading southeast.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Kim Shaffer, MUFON State Director from Tennessee, for submitting the report.

My family and I would go to Bay Springs Cemetary Road, park on the side of the road looking west towards an area we called Sunk Hill. There we would observe several balls of fire streaking across the sky. Sometimes the lights would follow one another, they would combine to make one seemingly larger object, the lights would sometimes seem to hover and then take off into many different directions. The lights were not bound to any certain direction or mode of flight. They would move across the sky in a vertical, horizontal and diagonal direction. The objects were bright orange resembling a fire ball and that is what we called them. The light show usually lasted for approximately 30 to 90 minutes.

It was about the size of a house from where I stood and could not have been more than 200 feet off the ground, traveling at about 50 mph. I shouted at my friends and they caught a glimpse of it as it headed over the trees and disappeared. There were no clouds and it was a completly clear night. We were speculating about what it could have been for about 10 mins when we saw another smaller object heading in about the same direction. It was made up of two smaller white triangles and one dark. It was about the same altitude as the first but one third the size. It was traveling more than double the speed of the first and both objects were completly silent.

We were commenting on how nice the weather is and looking up at some very high, light clouds and someone pointed to a normal high-flying plane in the sky, which is common since we are close to O&apos;Hare Airport. As all of our attention was on this plane, we all spotted another object, much higher in the sky, which was in the same line of sight.  It looked about the same size as the high altitude plane, despite apparently being much much higher.  It looked white and moved about 1/20 the speed of the normal looking plane (very slow).  Our impression was that it was so high, it might have been the International Space Station.  However, upon looking up the current location of satellites and the station on NASA&apos;s public J-Track website, the station was actually over Africa and no satellites were overhead at this time at all. The object moved so slowly in the sky that I was able to run inside and grab some low power field glasses I keep in my office.  As the object moved slowly in the sky in north by northwest direction we were able to watch it for about 5 minutes. Under the field glasses it looked like two large globes with a large metallic connector.   The size must have been enormous considering the extremely high altitude we observed it to be. Wind speed and direction at the time as reported by the O&rsquo;Hare weather station was due West 8mph.  Although I know wind speed and direction at very high altitudes can differ dramatically, this is clearly at odds with speed and somewhat at odds with the direction of the object we observed. The soft, wispy clouds I referred to had the dispersed chem-trail look to them familiar to us in IL.  Depending on the object&rsquo;s size, it may have been at or just above that altitude.  Can anyone offer an explanation? Perhaps chem.-trail related? Perhaps a secret DoD blimp of enormous size as has been reported to exist?", "I was driving home from work early in the morning, when about two hundred yards to the northwest of me, aproximately 200 feet in the air, I noticed something silverish. As I drove closer going northbound I could see it clearly. It was saucer in shape, silverish in color. The main reason it caught my attention before I drove closer to it, was that it was hovering and turning in a circular motion. I saw it for approximately 2 minutes, than it just completely vanished with no trace!

I however have been half skeptical because of all the time I&apos;ve spent looking at the stars.. Well .. tonight things changed.  My GF saw a light which I could not crossing the sky.  I figured she was seeing a satellite.  since my eyesight is not too great I figured she was telling the truth but I ribbed her saying she was nuts.  It was the first nice clear night for a major city where the magnitude is pretty horrible.  We went into the backyard, she sat on my lap and we spent some romantic moments looking at the stars.  I told her jokingly &quot;ask the star to come back&quot;. Within 3 mins another star started moving across the sky.. I had my binoculars ready and watched it .. thought wow! A satellite but it disapeared too early.  Thought that it was odd but probably fell out of the sunlight&apos;s reflection..  It had moved both from South to North across the Northern Cross.  Then again we saw a bright light move, compared to other stars a short distance.  it was like a star that was there.. then started moving slowly,  then moved fast then dissapeared again. I told her to send another wish up the aliens to confirm we saw something wierd as a joke to her again.  This time something beyond my wildest dreams happened.  I am still in shock at this moment.  So far I thought it was just satellites moving in a straight line.. I only saw 3.. she saw 4.. in the same area.. about 2 mins after she silently sent a message as I asked for a sign.. 3 lights reddish came out of nowhere right out of the southern side of the northern cross int eh same area we were seeing activity.. move across from the right (south) to the north at VERY high speed. 2 of the lights were converging .. it was like they were in formation getting closer.. then abrubtly turned at a 90 degree angle to the east and disapeared again..

Why? becuase it happened in 1986 and I dont think the flying triangle was seen or reported at that time.. That didnt happen until 1989 over Belguim.. Similiar cases after 1989 have detailed wavy air or something seen coming out of the object.  In other words, this is one of the first.

What the two fisherman claimed to have seen around 10:30 that clear night was a giant spacecraft about the size of Wings Stadium Long said . The object had a bright light in front and three red lights blinking on each side. The craft moved slowly from the southeast toward the northwest about 200 to 300 ft over the lake, the white light in front suddenly flashed brilliantly and went out. There were several other fisherman on the lake, apparently none of them saw the UFO because it moved with absolute silence. The flash of light ws beamed toward the front of the craft, so it did not reflect off the water. Jandura heard a young boy on the shore yelling &quot;What is it?&quot; What is it?&quot; as the UFO traveled slowly across the lake for about 15 minutes. To the person who was yelling what is it? please feel free to contact me with what you saw, if you are out there. As the craft moved off in the direction of South Haven the two fisherman saw a wavy pattern in the air behind it, as though somekind of exhaust. The Kalamazoo county airport was contacted and nothing unusual was reported on radar. It should be noted that 30 minutes prior to this event a similiar objects was seen over Jamestown Ohio.

I live in Trail B.C. It is Wednesday, May 19th, 2004. I was driving home alone from our local theatre along Highway 3B going south. I was not too far from home and I noticed that a bright light was coming through my passenger window. I looked out the window to the sky and saw the most amazing &quot;craft&quot;. There were no vehicles directly behind me so I drove very slowly. What I saw was a huge craft in the shape of a V hovering very low in the sky. There were three lights on each &quot;wing&quot; of the V rotating rapidly in circles and creating bright white lights. There were no colours at all in these lights. There was also a very bright light on the &quot;nose&quot; of this craft. This thing was absolutely huge. My heart was racing as I tried to explain to myself a scientific reason why it was there. I could not pull my car over so I decided to get home as quickly as possible as I was almost home. I watched in the rear view mirror but could not see anything. I pulled into my driveway and ran to my deck as quickly as possible. This &quot;thing&quot; should have still been in the sky but was nowhere to be seen. It was incredible. Has anyone else in this area seen anything like this?  Update:  Hi Brian. I am a (deleted by HBCC UFO). We had a storm so bad the power went out at approx. 4:45. We had to stay a little late in hopes that the power would come back on. We had an incredible downpour of rain and in the southeast towards the Wash. border a fire started. We had power on the West side of Trail but not on the East (divided by a river) I decided to go see the local movie because there was power on that side of the river. I&apos;m not sure about the moon as it was very overcast. I drove my friend home after the movie and...... On my way home travelling alone East on Highway 3B, my car &quot;lit up&quot;. I looked out the passenger window to the south and saw a &quot;huge craft&quot; in the shape of a V. There were three bright white lights on each &quot;wing&quot; of this craft. There seemed to be rotating extremely fast lights within the lights. (like the chasing lights you would see on a Christmas tree) There did not seem to be a body to this craft like a plane with passengers would have but rather just a V. The &quot;nose&quot; of the craft also had a bright light and the lights were beaming upward but the glow so intense that this is why the light shone in my car. It was not a beam of light but rather a brightness. This thing was hovering very low and very slowly. I am not good with distance but my husband says the way I described it, he would guess approx 100 metres high. Keep in mind I was driving. the speed limit was 50 km but I could slow almost to a stop as I had time to look in my rear view mirror and there were no cars behind me. I wanted to pull the car over and take a closer look but this is a main highway and there was a guard rail to my right. I had time to turn my music off - I heard no sound although I did not think to roll my windows down. The size was that of a large plane and it appeared to be grey or silver in colour. I am not sure because the white lights were so intense. There was no colour to any of the lights. I remember telling myself to pay attention to detail. This is very hard to do when the mind is confused and trying to reason with what the eyes are witnessing. Because I couldn&apos;t stop I decided to go a bit above the speed limit and get home as quickly as possible. This sighting was VERY close to where I live so it was a matter of travelling up the road a bit and turning south (right) into my neighbourhood. I got out of my car ran to our deck and looked in the direction of the sighting but saw nothing. We do live by and the sighting was by our Canadian Armoury site. I did not have any &quot;missing time event&quot; I was so amazed by this sighting though and so confused by it that I had to take a sleeping pill to calm me down to be able to sleep. I had some dreams in regard to what I saw but nothing I would consider out of the ordinary. I can&apos;t think of anything else to tell you. Today I am still rather shaken and trying to apply logic but this thing was so large and hovering so low. I don&apos;t know what is capable of doing this. Yes you can speak about it with Wayne on KBS. I am curious to find out if there is anyone else who may have seen this. It was hovering above an area where there are quite a few homes so you would think somebody should have. By the way, (deleted) e-mailed me and said he must have just missed it. I think he was also at the movie and I know he would have travelled home in the same direction as I did. Hopefully I&apos;ve answered all of your questions. I am now a true believer that &quot;something is going on out there.&quot;  I realized I missed answering a couple of your questions. We live near two airports. The main Castlegar airport approx 30 km north. We also have a local airfield approx 8 km southeast. I didn&apos;t see any other planes or aircraft in our area. Take care Brian. Thank you for listening. Thank you to the person for the report.

I was outside observing the moon with my brand new 2 day old telescope. I was observing the moon which was located SW then I decided to take a look at jupiter which was west. When I got my telescope to turn it west I saw 2 stars SW. They were really bright stars. THey acually looked like very close bright planets. I then started to aim my telescope at the objects and when I looked back up one of the objects started to fade away. Then thats when i knew I was looking at something out of this world. The first UFO faded away, I wanted to take a look at them with the telescope but I hesitated and ran and banged on the window to call my sister out but instead I startled her. I was still looking at the last UFO then it started to fade away also. By the time my sister came out it was already gone. All this happend probly within 30-60 seconds. My heart was pounding because iv never seen anything like that in my life before. The objects were really bright. Kind of like a planet but 10 times brighter. My telescope was still aiming where the objects were located so i took a look in the telescope. I then saw a dark Circle with a really really thin line of light from the moon. Whatever the thing was it was still there but I was guessing it was stealthed. If there were any other reports similer to mine please contact me please. And if you have anymore questions Please contact me at ((personal information deleted))", "V-shaped light being focus towards sky which would last for 5to 10 sec .yesterday night i &amp; my friend saw a bright flash in the sky when we went over the terres we could see nothing  we came down after some time but again after 15 min we saw same kind of flash so we went over the terres and we saw that if there were any clouds in the sky,but there were no clouds in sky.BY This time the power was cutoff and dogs were  barking.We decided to wait and see what it was  after about 15to20 min we saw a V-shaped bright light which was being focussed toward the sky from ground .I couldn&apos;t exactly see weather the objects had landed on ground or not becase of the distance factor and the building around my home.In the flash i could notice a black beam moving from right to left in that V- shaped white light flash .I saw this flash comming from 7  different places .In these 7  flashes , first one was the brightest one ,but it  could last for only about 5sec . After that I saw same kind of flashes at 2 deifferent places which were being focused towards sky at regular intervel and each time it would last upto 5to10 sec this contnewd for about 4&amp;half hours in this period i saw these beams 7 diffrent places i have made rough map and located the postion of objectes and noted down the time they appered.", "one definite orb, standing still in the sky, and a huge craft with an immense wing span slowly flying above phoenixi was driving home with my girlfriend early thursday at about 4:15 am when i noticed what looked like an incredibly bright star or planet. i noticed it because i had also seen it in the same spot at about the same time on the previous morning, while i was riding my mountain bike. on the first night i immediately thought, it was possibly a plane coming in for a landing, that just happened to have it&apos;s headlight shining directly at me, cause sometimes if it is dead on, it can be incredibly bright. anyways, i kept pedalling, watching it almost the entire time. incidently, i was heading north/northwest, and the object, (the only one i saw the first night),which was east northeast, never moved, or at least not enough for me to be sure about it. well actually it moved, but it was very gradual, almost as if it was just traveling through the sky like the stars do. but i watched it right up to sunrise, and then i reached my destination, and sort of wrote it off as an incredibly bright planet. although i was sure that it was much brighter than mars, even when mars was at its brightest. i mean to say that there really was no comparison between the two. finally as the sun was approaching the horizon, there were just a few little clouds traveling due north, and i made sure to see if they passed behind, or in front of the object. it was so bright that i really doubted that they would pass between me and the object, but they definately did, so at this point i had no clue as to the actual distance. also by this time the object seemed to have gradually risen in the sky considerably. so i didn&apos;t dare mention it to anybody, for fear of ridicule etc...so when i saw it on the next morning while driving southbound on 47th ave. almost to my apartment complex, i just happened to look left, past my girlfriend in the passenger seat, and notice the same object. only, this time there were two, and both equally bright. however the second, southernmost, and lower elevation of the two, definately seemed to be moving, not far or fast, by any means, but definately moving!! so at this point i mentioned it to my girlfriend, and explained my sighting of the previous night. we both agreed that this could not possibly conventional aircraft.since we were less than 1/4 mile from my apt. complex i decided to haul butt home, and get my telescope, and my digital camera. when we got back, only the northward object was visible so i set up the telescope and tried to getit in my sight. first with the spotting scope. through the spotting scope it looked like an incredibly brilliant star, with all colors of the spectrum beaming from it, then when i finally located it with the high mag lense, i was fascinated to see that it was actually an orb, with about 1/3 of it (the southern third) intensely bright, as though it were an eclipse i was seeing. i decided that the most likely cause was actually sunlight reflecting off the surface. after a couple of minutes, the second object became visible again, and seemed even brighter than the first, and it seemed to be maneuvering slightly, as the light seemed almost to slowly wave back and forth like when somebody waves a flashlight across your vision. and it kept getting brighter. and it was clearly heading in our general direction. i caught it in the spotting scope, and it looked just like the first object, with all the colors and such. but i was having a hell of a time trying to get it with the big scope, cause at this point it was moving a little faster. then it seemed to be heading straight for us, and angled slightly downward. at this point i seemed to notice that, while still many many miles away, the beam was so bright that i could see it lighting the tops of trees between us and it. i would guess it to be about 20-30 times brighter than a regular plane heading straight it kept coming until it was barely a few miles away. i then was able to get my scope on it , though only for a couple of seconds, but it was so fast that i couldn&apos;t hardlysee it or make out the shape. i hate to do this, but i&apos;m falling asleep, trying to type this report, so i must finish it tomorrow. but if anyone would like they can feel free to contact me, for more detail, and specifics.", "is that natural miracal ?hi everybody i m male 33 india watching some objects from last 8-9 years i m not able to find whats that. so anybody earth come down mine city n study, research whats that exactly evrybody welcome i seen same object moves forward in ziczac way  in verious direction everytime in the sky i shown to mine brother n family but no body find out whats that i m just curious about whats it? i didnt get enough time to watch evryday but its there in between two hours . the object is like a normal star n it moves forward but when it moves its not goes stright it moves some left n right like ziczac way n forward i didnt seen any aircraft moves like this . i dont have any equipment to make closer view so anybody interested to research about such object i will show them how they appers n dissappers inbetween two hours evrybody welcome . this is just information what i seen number of time sometime with brother ...u can mail me or call me ((deleted)) or call ((deleted))", "Wierd moving lights in the skyI was driving home and noticed some lights in the sky, I see alot of planes near my house and these lights caught my attention because i never say so many on a plane before.  At first I thought it was because it was turning and I was able to see all the lights at once, but it still seemed very different.  It also was just sitting there and was not moving, so I just keeped looking and wondering what it was. Then it moves vertically very fast like nothing i have ever seen, then it slowed down and went under the tree line, and I know a plane could not go that low so i dont know what happened.  After I just keeped thinking about it and I could not explaine what i just saw.", "A very close encounter near North Bay, Ontario. It was totally silent and so close I could have hit it with a rock.I cannot remember the exact date, it was late August or early September around 1985. The date can be correlated to a day when a Russian satellite fell from orbit and crashed in Lake Superior. That was the explanation that was given by the radio station in North Bay the next morning, as the reason for the lights that were seen and reported by multiple people from the previous night. My brother-in-law and I had a much closer encounter with this craft. Hunting season had begun and in deference to the hunter&apos;s, we would go riding our ATV&apos;s late at night.We had been riding about three hours this night on trails in the Almaguin Highlands, about 20 miles south of North Bay, Ontario. This is Crown land and as such there are no buildings of any kind for many miles.We stopped on a ridge and shut off our machines (altitude 1400&apos; - we checked on a topographical map on our return) for a &quot;pee&quot; break. It was a beautiful, clear starry night with not a whisper of wind. We could see from the ridge the darkness that represented Lake Nippising and the lights of North Bay, some twenty miles distant. While taking our break I could hear a dog barking, perhaps five miles away in the valley below. I only mention that to emphasize how incredibly quiet it was where we stood.My brother-in-law asks me, &quot;Did you see that flash of light?&quot; I replied that it must be the red flashing light from the radio tower in North Bay. Twenty seconds later he asks again, &quot;Did you see that flash of light?&quot; I turned to my left to face him and over the ridge top behind us, about twenty-five feet above the trees, came this craft with glowing lights on it&apos;s edge, the lights going yellow, red, orange, blue, green along the length of the craft. My brother-in-law saw my face and turned to see it as well. It was approximately 100 feet in length. It moved slowly from our left to right, following the ridge line and staying twenty feet above the trees. Suddenly it gave off a flash of light, like a camera flash, only it lit up the entire area around us. I could clearly see every tree, bush and rock, when moments before it had been totally dark. The craft and the flash made absolutely no sound. It was so close I could have easily thrown a rock and hit it. I whispered to Ron, &quot;Do you see it?&quot;, not believing my eyes, but also not wanting to be heard by it. I&apos;m not kidding - it was that quiet, so much so that I was afraid to raise my voice.It kept moving to the right and let off another flash. The brightness was ruining my ability to distinguish any features other than the glowing lights and general shape, much the same way a flashbulb causes you to see spots before your eyes.It started to drop away, following the contours of the land, staying the same distance above the trees. As it passed us to the right, the 30 - 40 foot pine trees in front of us, started blowing about madly, buffeted by the strong winds generated as the craft passed, much the same as the wake of a boat hits the shoreline. As it dropped out of view, the winds calmed and everything returned to the stillness of before.In my mind I thought, &quot;You can&apos;t fool mother nature!&quot; What I mean by that is, I may not believe what I&apos;m seeing, but the violent wind proved that something huge had just passed by, causing the disturbance.We took compass headings for the next ten minutes, as we watched the craft move down the valley. It flashed the bright light approx. every twenty seconds, lighting up acres of land below it.I was in the Canadian Air Force for two years, working around jets and helicopters and there is nothing, other than a glider, that can fly without making a sound. Even then you would probably hear the wind pass over the wings.I would like to say I was brave and unmoved by this event, but the truth is, it was so unearthly that my first instinct was to want to hide under a rock. I was terrified and it took me twenty minutes to calm down enough to get back on the ATV and ride.The next morning there were multiple reports to the local radio station, from people claiming to have seen a UFO. The explanation was that it was the Soviet satellite crashing into Lake Superior.The craft we saw was flying, not crashing and Lake Superior was approx. 600 miles west of where we were.I&apos;ve told this story to many people over the years, mostly met with skepticism. After reading many of the sightings on your site, I felt compelled to contribute my story.", "OBJECTS WHITE, BOOMERRANG SHAPED FLYING VERY FAST AND VANISHED  OR FLEW OUT OF SIGHTDRIVING FROM PHOENIX AZ TO CHINO CA--30 MIN EAST OF INDIO CA--SAW BRIGHT WHITE BOOMERRANG SHAPED OBJECT OUT OF THE UPPER LEFTHAND SIDE OF MY FRONT WINDSHEILD--AT FIRST SEEMED STATIONARY AND VERY HIGH UP, MAYBE HIGHER THAN COMMERCIAL JETS FLY--IT STARTED TO MOVE ACROSS THE SKY AT APPROX TEN TIMES THE SPEED OF COMM JET--AS I FOLLOWED IT, I SAW ANOTHER OBJECT ON THE UPPER RIGTHSIDE OF MY FRONT WINDSHEILD MOVING TOWARDS THE FIRST OBJECT, IT WAS SIMILAR TO THE FIRST AND THEY WERE BOTH ZIG- ZAGING TOWARD EACH OTHER AND THEN AWAY FROM EACH OTHER--AT ONE POINT THE FIRST OBJECT SEEM TO FLY AWAY FROM ME AND IT&apos;S LEADING EDGE STARTED TO TURN TRANSPARENT AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO VANISH BUT IT FLEW TO THE LEFT AGAIN AND I COULD AGAIN SEE IT&apos;S COMPLETE SHAPE--MY WIFE WAS FOLLOWING THE ONE ON OUR RIGHT AND I COULD ONLY FOLLOW THE FIEST OBJECT ON OUR LEFT.

Then took off very very fast into space. No doubt there is other life out there, none at allI have never told my story to anyone but a few friends in recent years. Myself (witness #1--name deleted) and a friend of mine at the time ((witness #2--name deleted)), which were 15 and 16 years old at the time had gone out on the side of town to a small wheat field that was ready to be harvested on a beautiful clear warm Friday evening and parked in a circle in the middle of the wheat field that had been made by the farmer from turning around in, I assume, (his barn and tractor were behind us off the side of circle. To be honest my friend had bought a six pack of Michelob beer and we were going to drink a couple beers though at the time of this incident we had not yet opened one beer and were completely sober and straight. Anyway, it was just getting dark but still a little bit of light. We were talking and I was sitting in passenger seat anf ((witness #2)) in drivers seat and I was staring at this red flashing light blinking like a heart beat up in the sky directly in front of me. I thought it was a radio tower with its red warning lights so a plane does not fly into it but after a short bit it started moving to my right very slowly. At that time I asked my friend &quot;hey what is that?&quot; and we both thought it was a small cessna airplane flying extremely low. It kept getting lower and lower and swung around to the far side of the wheat field and came right over the top of the wheat, still with its light blinking. It started coming right towards us and it came so close that our skin and face and car and the wheat around us was glowing red when it blinked. We both kept saying to each other &quot;What is it?, what is it?&quot;. I had my head stuck out the window trying to get a look at what it was but even with it that close I could not make out a shape nor could I hear any sound what so ever. It kept coming towards us then my friend paniced and started his car to take off because I guess he was more frightened than I was. When he started his car the light stopped for a few seconds then started going back the way it had been coming accro! ss field but then took off at an incredible speed up into the sky. We drove as fast as we could to the dirt road and went in the direction it was and by then it was higher than commercial jets fly and kept going higher into the atmosphere until it could no longer be seen. There is no possible way that anyone on earth had anything that could go that fast, I mean it was fast. The human body could not handle that kind of &apos;G&apos; Force as far as I know. Then it was gone.  The following Monday in the newspaper someone else had seen the same light/craft (UFO) but they saw it on the west side of town we were on the North side of town and by the time they quoted seeing it they had to of seen it about 30 minutes before us. We never reported seeing anything to anyone thinking people would think we were nuts plus because we were out there to drink a few beers and were only 15 and 16 years old and that would get us in trouble with the parents. Now that I am 40 it is of no concern to me anymore. ** There is no doubt in my mind that that UFO was from some other life form and planet or where ever, no doubt what so ever. There is no way what I saw could of been from Earth, none what so ever! I am 100% convinced that we are being visited by beings from another planet or where ever here on earth and that the government has to know about it and is keeping what they know from us. They must tell us everything that they know which I&apos;m sure is a lot. When they finally are forced to do so then everyone is really going to be upset with the government for keeping it from them for so long. Us mere earthlings can handle the truth. I already know the truth, somewhat, I know they do exist with out a doubt and so do many other people who have had encounters with them. The aliens I&apos;m sure think that every human being has been informed of their presence, but this is far from the truth. I think it is stupid for the government not to tell what they know, if they would then everyone could come together with their info they have and maybe we c! ould become a bit more savy on their ways and maybe what to expect in the future. They could be sizing us up to take over our planet and with their technology that would not be very hard at all, probably with a snap of the fingers or whatever they snap. I often wondor what would of happened if my friend would not of started the car. We could of had it land right next to us and met the aliens or then we could of been abducted also! Yikes, maybe it was good he did start the car, I&apos;ll never know I guess. As far as the date goes I only remember it was 1978 because I was 15 but I really not sure what month and what day, but there was a story that following Monday in the paper and it happoened the Friday before that. The wheat was ready for harvest because I went back out there next time I had someone with a car to check out and see if wheat was singed or burnt or partly harvested or anything strange but when I got there it had already been harvested. What about radio activity on a geiger counter? Would that possibly pick up something? It has been 26 years ago this happened, I thought I should document it somewhere, do you not agree. I live in Hawaii now and Jeff still lives in Pampa, Texas. Also, the final assembly point for all nuclear weapons is 45 miles from where this happened which is like a baby step to these aliens I&apos;m sure. Pantex is the name of the place. I know they have interest in our nuclear sights, weapons and such so I thought I would throw that in. That is possibly why they were by this little hick town of Pampa Texas either that or needed some wheat to make some bread with. My tele.# is ((two numbers deleted)). ((witness #2)) is probably listed in the phone book in Pampa Texas if anyone ever wants to talk about this sighting. I always wodered if I were to get hipnotized if I would remember anything more. Maybe I was abducted  and don&apos;t even know it. You never know! Well that is about it I guess. Thank You for your time reding this. Any questions feel free to call.((personal data deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Three lighted objects flying in formation.I was sitting in the hot tub around 11:00 at night with my boyfriend in the resort that my grandparent&apos;s live in a little south of Orlando, Fl. I was looking up into the sky when I noticed a very small circular speck up above the clouds.  It seemed to be above the path of normal airplane traffic.  It emitted a bright white light, different from a star though.  there were maybe two or three of them.  They seemed to be moving in logical order and much quicker than the clouds below and the stars.  one would move away from the other two then they would move away also then they would all reconvene in the same location.  When I say the same location I mean that the exact same spot  that they left from.  this continued for around 15-30 minutes.  When we got on the golf cart to go home we were able to amintain visual contact with them until they faded from our sight.  they were very small shaped circles almost more like little dots than spheres.", "Yellow orange red blinking lights on a sphere moving East rapidly.It started as a yellow orange and red blinking light. The lights were moving up and down and side to side, but not making much movement until all of the sudden it started to move up very quickly. It then started moving east still blinking until it was almost right over us. The shape could be made out as a sphere with blinking rotating lights on the sides. The rate at which it moved across the sky was incredibly fast. It soon became out of sight as it had moved right.", "5 lights in a saucer shape hovering and disappearing over phoenix metro areaSlightly earlier in the evening, myself and at least five others were observing a row of five white lights due north of our position at rocking rodeo at Priest and Elliot rd in Tempe, AZ. It appeared to be very large and many miles north of us, about 10-15 degrees above the horizon.. the lights did not appear to be moving at all, and overall had a slightly saucer shaped silhouette. After viewing for about 15 minutes, object dissappeared instantly, only to appear 45 minutes later in the same position but not as bright, as only a saucer shaped white light.(The individual lights were not distinguishable.) Again, after a few minutes of viewing, the object instantly disappeared again. No &quot;twinkling&quot; as most aircraft lights appear through the valley smog, and it appeared and reappeared in the same position over too long a span of time to be commercial aircraft on approach to Sky Harbour airport. If it was a jet, it must have been enormous, and I can&apos;t explain its spontaneous disappearance and reappearance ... Commercial traffic to sky harbor usually clearly changes course and the lights of normal craft get dimmer but are still visible as the planes course turns away from an observer....not just disappearing. This anomaly was quite bright and visible for quite some time, 5-10 people at rocking rodeo(graham central station) viewed this.. I would have to assume elsewhere in the Phoenix metro area others witnessed it as well.", "Lights on skyMy friend looked at sky and he saw something like a fireworks but on the sky was 7 or 9 light balls that didn`t move I tried to take a photo with my phone but when I looked at the sky there was nothing my friend told me that when I wanted to take a photo light balls desapierd one by one. Color of balls was red or orange", "2 possible crafts seen over Puyallup,WAboth of the &quot;craft&quot; seemed to be white, and round, and very high up.  A Southwest airplane flew by while we were watching the &quot;crafts&quot; and the &quot;Crafts&quot; seemed to be alot higher then the commercial airliner.  It was a very creepy thing to watch.  The &quot;crafs&quot; were just staying in one spot, not moving at all, jus holding thier spot.  they kept almost exactly the same distance away from eachother the whole time .  We watched them untill they seemed to disapear into thin air.", "Absolutely Unreal.  What looked like a star , proved to something much more interesting!!!!!Me my girlfriend and roomate went down to the beach after sunset. We were watching the stars, when what appeared to just be a star hanging low right on the horixon, burst into a huge ball of yellow-orange light. The glow lasted approx 5 seconds and then dissolved right back to a star on the horizon. All three of us saw the same thing. Then the object shot across the horizon at an unreal speed.  It seemed to almost teleport all the way across the horizon. It sat for a second and then shot about halfway back. It then abruptly stopped and began moving slow and smooth like a plane. At this point we were all absolutely speechless!  As we began to discuss what might have just happened, I noticed the object looked like it might have been coming off the horizon.  It made its way directly towards us. In under 45 sec. the object that was a dot on the horizon had so smoothly approached us within 1000 yds. off shore and was hovering at approx. 1000 ft.  It was never possible to get a good visual of the object though, it was extremely errie that it was that close and we never were able to tell what it was.  The light on it was a wide bright white glow, the glow was the only thing we could see.  The object approached so gracefully, making just a slight hum, it was not a prop enging plane, it was not a jet engine plane, it was not a helecopter! After the object hovered over us for approx. 50 sec. it turned its light away from us and slowly headed back off to the horizon, yet still even from behind we were never able to get a visual on the object.  All three of us were in complete shock, when the object began approaching, no one said a damn word untill it left!  we all saw the same thing, and we all are convinced it was absolutely out of this world. My uncle was an F15 pilot for 25 years, growing up I was facinated will all aviation, I can tell you almost any jet that flys over the beach either en route to Mac Dill, Tampa or Clear/St.Pt.  This experience leads me to believe that there is definetely some! thing somewhere with far better technology than ours.  A brand new F22 went over a few days ago, he hit the after burners while going over and it shook the whole neighborhood, this new superjets speed was probably 1/1000th of the objects!! Anyway, This experience was unreal, I am a firm believer now that something else is out There.  And then two days later, I see in the St Pete Times the Incident in Iran. An entire village observed an object in braod daylight.  And now the March 5th video of the Mexican Air force, it was explained as balls of lightning, are you kidding they surrounded the jet!!!

I recognized it off the bat, I had seen the same formation a couple nights before off my balcony in Downtown vancouver at approx 11pm. (although that time, there was 2 triangles, one was much larger and felt it was very low, hovering above the building in front of me) It was weird, I felt some sort of &quot;prescence&quot; that made me look up.The triangle was a deep-gray black, slightly different black than the rest of the night sky, and the stars (or lights) were all whitish hue, 2 the same size with one brighter at the tip. (for both triangles)   As we were still waiting for may grandmother to arrive I kept staring at it and it seems to float a bit to the side, but passed it off as my eyes playing tricks on me. (it was really light out at that hour, still blueish sky) I thought it was weird to see the lights when there was no stars out yet. My aunt escorted my grandma to the car, I pointed out the &quot;stars&quot; to them and my aunt looked stunned and uncomfortable, she even mentioned how she thought it was odd and that it seemed to be moving.

It was not a plane because it was moving much too slow and no planes had flown over the coast during our entire visit.

It then turned again and climbed through light cloud cover and eventually disappeared from view.It was a clear day and we manged to capture the object on film , circa 5 shots, with a digital camera.Background of observers - 1, System Migration Manager (Engineering) 2, Assistant to a Marketung Director", "We may have been an experamentOn or about the above date a friend and I were bass fishing in the Aunts Creek area of Table Rock Lake.  As was our habit, we had been fishing from sundown and intended to fish until dawn.  At around 2330 hrs. we both noticed what appeared to be a single bright light in the area of Kimberling City which at that time was about 2 miles south and east of us.  We both assumed it was a medical helicopter based out of Springfield, Mo.  We had seen the helicopter on other nights and went about our fishing.  During the next few minutes we noticed the light didn&rsquo;t move from the area we originally spotted it. In an effort to get a better view we motored up the James River Arm which would allow us to see a lower altitude in the area of the light.  After moving 2 miles upstream (away from Kimberling City) we stopped, turned and noted that there was actually more than one light.  We actually counted at this time 4 lights in what appeared close proximity with each other.  The lights were moving slowly in our direction (north-northwest) at a slow rate of speed.  Occasionally 3 of the 4 lights would hold position as one light went forward.  The separation appeared to be as much as 500-750 yards.  It would &quot;hover&quot; as the other 3 lights caught-up.  Then the same light would again scout forward, as if scouting for something. At that time I owned a new Ranger Bass Boar equipped with a 200 HP outboard engine.  It had a top speed of around 75-MPH.  As we continued watching and noticing the way the formation was progressing we figured it might be time to vacate the area.  I tried to start the engine and while it would crank, it failed to fire.  I used the electric trolling motor to move toward an adjacent boat dock in an attempt avoid a direct overflight of the boat by the formation. After moving about 35 yards the trolling motor began to slow.  Then it also stopped working.  There is no reasonable explanation as both the electric motor and the afore mentioned 200 HP motor later started without effort or adjustment by my friend or myself.  By now the formation was 500 or so yards away from our location and what I was referring as the Scout Craft was no more than 60 yards away.  What was really remakabke was the total lack of any noise from any helicopter rotors. The next thing I know it was almost daylight and my friend and I were in my bass boat 15 miles        up river in the area of Galena, MO.  That time of year the sun rises at around 0625 hrs.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))", "Daylight disk near Alcalde, NMThe following report was originally reported to MUFON on the day of the sighting.------------------------------------  I was traveling back to Taos at around 11:40am MT, going north on NM 68 after having been in Santa Fe to get my cell phone serviced.   It was raining on and off and there were large patches of storm clouds intermixed with clearings and breaks in the clouds.  Sometimes everything was soft and greyish and sometimes parts of the landscape and sky were in full light. Somewhere between Espanola and Velarde, NM and just north of Alcalde, NM, I noticed a very steady solid white shape moving swiftly and smoothly in a southerly direction (parallel to the highway in the opposite direction of my travel).  Its altitude and speed at this time did not fluctuate.  It made its way from my northwest at roughly 20 degrees to slighty south of my due west (perpendicular to the highway) in a fairly short period of time.  If I had to guess I&apos;d say it covered between 1/2 and 1 mile in no more than 10 seconds.  I traded between watching the object and watching the road, trying to determine a shape and wether it would be worth stopping the car.   I was looking for the tell-tale signs of a small engine plane or large bird and could distinguish no features, other than an ellipse seen at a subtle angle.    Then it slowed dramatically, almost to a stop, and started dropping in altitude,  It was at this time that my curiosity was high enough to stop the car.  This is only the second time I have ever done something like this.  The first time I was able to quickly determine that what I was seeing was a large shaped balloon on a tether.  This sighting lasted almost an hour with no satisfying explaination. I crossed the 4-lane highway (2 lanes in each direction separated by a land divider somewhat excitedly because its shape was still elusive, and now its movement quickly ruled out a lot of possibilities. It was about 11:45am when I started watching it. It stayed in the same general area for a very very long time, changing altitude in a range as high as 20 degrees (no higher than the high mountain line in this area) and as low as possibly landing.In fact, I never saw it leave.   I left only when I became convinced that it was not going to come close enough to me to get a good photo. During the 55 minutes I observed it, it exhibited the following behaviors: First it behaved like a bee hovering over flowers, except with less erratic motion and a bit slower.  It would dip down low enough to make the mountains and hills behind it a backdrop, making the white ellipsoidal shape pop out pretty clear in spite of the light raininess.  It moved smoothly, but not perfectly smooth.  Accellerations to the left, right, higher or lower, and to and fro, were not always at the same rate, but within a range that suggested it was not at the mercy of the wind.   It was also clear that its angle would change.  There would be &quot;flashes&quot; of white as its &quot;top&quot; surface area either reflected light or simply showed more of its white coloration. At one point, it came VERY low.  In fact, it dipped between an earthy slope and some trees in the relative foreground that couldn&apos;t have been more than 1/4 mile from the highway. When it was behind the trees, it seemed to make its closest approach to me.  I could see its white peeking out from spaces within the trees and it appeared relatively much larger.  Then I didn&apos;t see it for a while.  But my eyes were locked on to the spot I last saw it, hoping for it to show again.  Then after some time I saw it move horizontally south as if it were a white van driving on a road behind the trees, only it lifted and appeared to move back away toward the mountains again.It made this low approach twice, and when it did, it reappeared from the very same location some time later.  I suspect it could have actually landed, or just hovered lower than I could see.  When it rose it often stayed along the very edge where the mountain met the sky, and was just a few shades lighter than the clouds there, and about as bright as the brightest point in the sky where the sun threatened to break through. I was very excited.  I have never stopped to look at something like this for such an extended period of time with such focus.  I didn&apos;t try waving down any cars nor did I care to fetch my camera right away for fear this would be short-lived.   Once I got a sense it was restricting its range and was going to stick around, I went to fetch my Canon digital Elph.  I wasn&apos;t expecting to get anything more compelling than the movement I just described, but thought it was sort of obligitory to try.  At the very least the photo gives place and possible distances. I am still perplexed.  I am considering going back down tomorrow to see if anyone from any of the local farms saw it (or was somehow responsible for it). All of my theories failed under at least one of the observed behaviors.  I considered that it could be:  A prop plane - prop planes can&apos;t hover A model plane - can&apos;t hover A helicopter - no sound or discernable movement of vegetation as it neared the trees.  rises in altitide too abrupt at times.A model helicopter - if so, it was very fast, very large, very quiet, and had a range approaching 1 mile at first A large bird - It would have had to be very very large for a bird, and then again it&apos;s general shape never changed, and it&apos;s movement was not very birdlike A piece of detritus - it was windy out, and things stay up a long time in the wind, but it&apos;s initial movement was steady as a rock in altitude and shape.  Highly unlikey that the wind was controlling this thing. Right before I gave up, it went to a dark tone, as if it had gone from reflecting light to silhouette.  It&apos;s behavior and general flight range remained the same though. This is the first &quot;daylight disk&quot; I have ever seen. I am a 37 year old graphic designer and web developer by trade.  I telecommute from Taos for a NYC-based company.  I consider myself an excellent observer, which was developed in the practice of art-making for the better part of 26 years.", "I saw a golden orange diamond shaped object traveling south in the sky in mid october 1974 near Fulton MOI was on my paper route and I stopped my bike because i had just ridden up a hill and was tired.  I looked out over what was a large field at that time in the direction of the Fulton water tower.  It is a very large and distinctive tower and was about a quarter mile from my location.  It was still daytime, but clear and cold.  I saw a diamond shaped light in the sky off to the east.  I saw it go behind ther water tower, and slowly travel in a southerly direction.  It oscillated in a golden orange color.  I have never forgoten that incident.  I have told some close friends, but never my parents.", "Third sighting this week:  Saw two orange orbs (non-moving and silent) in sky over southwest Phoenix.I guess I&apos;m more likely to see a UFO considering I&apos;ve seen them three times this week and cannot quit looking at the sky at night now!  :)  Better odds, I&apos;m going to have a car accident if I don&apos;t watch it.  Back to what I saw:  I was on my way home from a movie at Desert Ridge in Phoenix with three of my friends.  We had talked about my sightings from earlier in the week and even had a good laugh about them.  I couldn&apos;t help looking at the sky when I noticed the lights were there again.  This time there were two orbs.  My friend who was driving exited 101 at Scottsdale Road and proceeded south.  We made a right turn at the first street (Mayo) and headed west and stopped 1/4 mile down to watch the lights.  They were blinking on and off just as they had done two nights previous.  There was also another car pulled over just a little further down the street and the driver was standing outside of his car watching them too.  I noted the time immediately when I saw the lights (10:00 p.m.).  The show lasted for about 10 minutes.  This time I took a picture with my cell phone.  The resolution is terrible but it did capture the objects as well as some planes that were in the area.  Interestingly though the color of the objects is not orange in the photo.  One is brown and the other is green.  During the 10 minutes, the planes appear to fly above, below and all around them, going about their business as if it&apos;s nothing unusual.  I just don&apos;t understand why the pilots don&apos;t report these lights.  Are they not seeing them?  In reading the reports in the database, there appear to be a high number in the southwest sky that are very similar over Phoenix.  With all the cameras around recording our every move these days, why do we not have one focused on the sky to capture this phenomenon in Phoenix?  I&apos;m really curious now as to the origin of these lights.  I&apos;ve purchased a compass that I&apos;m keeping in my car to provide better details.  At least my friends saw it this time.  I will see if I can get them to submit their report as well.", "PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO NUFORC: 1/13/2004 3:25:05 AM 03:25.  Investigated by Iowa MUFON,Beverly Trout and Pam Brackenbury.  Described as &quot;rounded&quot; triangle, (hovering when first seen)  on west side of I-35 southbound lanes,near the Truro, Iowa Exit, with no flashing lights, no sound, and close enough that witnesses were viewing the underside of the object, estimated at 50-300 feet in altitutde. (Altitude was estimated based on a nearby radio tower. [NOTE:  There were 3 white triangular-shaped lights (and this is the second case we&apos;ve investigated recently where lights on a triangle are described as triangular in shape instead of circular)with the longer leg of each triangular light following the &quot;outline&quot; of the side of the object (where the light is positioned) rather than being positioned at the apices.] One circular red light is reported between two of the triangular white lights. Witnesses stopped the car as soon as they had passed the object, got out seemingly for perhaps 10 seconds, and were astounded when they got back in the car to discover the car clock now read 10:57 p.m.  [NOTE: This is a time scenario which seems to contradict the 10:13 p.m.time-stamped sales ticket from a Walmart store just before they left to drive the 26 miles to the Truro exit...i.e. it should have taken no more than (at most) 25 minutes to reach the Truro exit, and there is a 44 minute time-span to consider]  When the 2 witnesses got out of their car, in a few seconds the hovering object sped away to the north and &quot;almost instanteously&quot; approached an airliner on approach to the Des Moines Airport, then turned and headed away.  Only one of the 2 witnesses was interviewed, the other witness was out of town and has not contacted investigators to set up an interview - and this is often the case where one witness is willing to talk, but a second witness may be somewhat hesitant.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Beverly Trout and Pam Brackenbury, of MUFON/IOWA, for following up on the case, and for their follow-up report.

It was barely visible and I  thought at first it was a sky search light but it had two distinct leading edges and did not travel in an arc as most search lights do. There was also no clouds for lights to reflect off of and I could see the stars.  The shape traveled South to North rapidly and covered an arc of 90 degrees in about two seconds so that I turned around to  watch it disappear in the opposite direction. There was no sound.   The size was about the size of a small plane if you were to witness a plane take off at the end of a runway.((NUFORC Note:  We know this witness well, and she telephone NUFORC just minutes after her sighting.  We suspect she is an excellent witness.  The fact that the object had no lights on it makes it a very unusual event, we believe.  PD))", "I briefly saw a formation of lights over norht Orange County, California late Sunday night, July 20, 2004.I was driving West on Imperial Highway in Brea, California, after having turned left from going northbound on Kraemer Boulevard.  There are a lot of shopping center lights and traffic lights around there, but as I was looking up and towards the west at either of the first two upcoming traffic lights - I don&apos;t remember precisely where I was along this stretch of Imperial Highway - I was startled to see a formation of lights gently angling from the southeast to the northwest, and from there, symmetrically back to the northeast.  There were about seven lights making up the south-lying line, and one or two making up the north-lying line.  There seemed to be one light at the tip, but it may have been my mind filling that spot in with a light.  It was like seeing a marqueed side and tip of a triangle pointing and possibly also moving in the sky in the same direction in which I was moving in my car.  I would estimate that the lights were located above Brea, La Habra, or Whittier.  The color of the lights was uniform - a pinkish gold, similar to street or parking lot lights.  The size of each light was not impressive - about the size of a light from an airplane or jet.  It was the formation of these lights that was startling.  The lights moved completely uniformly, causing me to think that they formed the perimeter of a dark triangular or arrow-shaped object in the sky.  The formation disappeared in a couple seconds, and did not reappear.  I called my brother on my cell phone as I arrived home because he &quot;believes in UFOs&quot; and I &quot;don&apos;t&quot;.  I decided to go back to the intersection where I turned left to see if I could reproduce the optical illusion, and he agreed, asking me to be careful driving.  I retraced my path, but the second time I saw no such formation in the sky, nor could I see how any reflections or glare from Kraemer Boulevard to Placentia Avenue, looked anything like the formation I undoubtedly saw earlier.", "Number of witnesses: 2 Number of objects: 3 Shape of objects: Star-like lights in triangular formation  Full Description of event/sighting: Went outside May 19, about 10:30 with telescope to observe Comet Neat. At about 10:40 pm, in a small field, I was busy at the telescope when my boyfriend said, &quot;Look at that&quot; as he pointed nearly above us. At first I believed it was a shooting star. but then I noticed that there were 3 star like lights in a tight triangular formation. After a couple of seconds they vanished. My boyfriend said when he first saw them, he too thought it was a shooting star but then realized that there were 3 star-like lights traveling in a straight line. He said they suddenly fell into the triangular formation, then spun and one of the side lights took lead of the triangle. A few seconds later they were gone. The lights were nearly directly above, traveling from the south and headed north. They zipped right past Polaris before fading away. They emitted no noise, had no flashing lights, had no tails or left no jet streams. The entire event only lasted about 5 or 6 seconds. Thank you to the witness for the report.

We are accustomed to seeing falling stars and other night-time sky activity (i.e. planes, military aircraft, etc.), especially since we have a deck that has 100% unobstructed sky views.   Suddenly, we became aware of a bright, round sphere which appeared to fall very rapidly towards the earth and we thought it was just the hugest, roundest, brightest falling star we had ever seen...perhaps even some type of meteor.  But then, as the light came closer to the horizon it moved sideways - truly one of the oddest sights either of us have ever seen.

MIRVs? What was that UFO?I was outside with my father enjoying our bonfire, when I noticed in  a clear sky, an object I first thought was a shooting star travelling at a high speed.  I pointed it out, and noticed 4 other objects.  The objects were at a very high altitude, they were north of us, probably above Pontiac Michigan, travelling east.  Within approximatly 30 seconds, they had travelled from my first sighting, on a west-east track and out of sight.  Approximatly 40 to 60 nm in distance.  The objects were in a formation with 2 objects above and to the left of 2 other objects  with one object in the centre, but at a lower altitude.  The lower object was the brightest and most defined.  They looked like a shooting star, with a defined, and bright white tail.  However, unlike a shooting star they didn&apos;t burn out, and were at an amazing speed.  No sound at all was apparant. For these objects to cover this distance in this time period, they would have to be travelling in excess of Mach 7. I have a high knowlege of aviation, and this defies any conventional explanation except for: space junk re-entering the atmosphere, MIRVs, but it is definatly a UFO.", "Strange  unidentified light detected on digital camera.My wife and I were camping out on our farmland in Eastern Kentucky approximately 10 miles from Salyersville,Ky on the night of May 29 around 11 or 12 PM.

After taking some pictures of our campfire I decided to try and take a picture a star that stood out almost directly above our campsite.  I stepped away from the fire where it was fairly dark and took two pictures about 30 seconds apart.  I did not see any other light or star near the one that I was taking the picture of.  We went to bed at close to 1:30am.  I first noticed the light object when I downloaded the picture to my computer on Tuesday the 1st of June.

I yelled for my family to come see, &quot;Quick&quot; and my husband ran in the room, finally, and just as he did, the lights disappeared, but only momentarily.  They had bent, with angular shafts, behind clouds (?) and then reappeared.  I was so glad he could see what I saw!  We watched in awe and then we saw this tiny, blue helicoptor drop lower and lower from the sky where the beams were.  I thought, how funny, I&apos;ve never seen a helicopter so small before! It came down to tree level and started moving around the trees and bushes next door, outside the window we were watching from.  Then it landed and wheels appeared.  it looked just like one of those sleds in the Olympics... 2 man bob-sleding.

It was a bright night out-almost a full moon and the stars were very bright. Very clear. We were coming up a hill and at the top of the hill on the other side of a row of trees was a bright blue light. I was driving slow because the area is known for alot of deer. The light was nothing I had seen before and I asked my friend to look at it. I slowed down to almost a stop and observed it for a short time. We were talking about it being a strobe light like on a police car or something, but it was solid blue and wasn&apos;t emitting light in a fixed manner. It was almost throwing light like a laser but like ribbons of light. It didn&apos;t light up the field it was in so you couldn&apos;t see what it was attached to. We discussed it being a tractor but the light was so weird I had never seen anything like it before. Then the light started coming  straight towards us at a fast rate and I freaked. I hit the gas and started down the road. I told her to keep watching it and tell me what it does. We came upon another hill so we lost sight of it for a second then she said that it must have been an airplane because it&apos;s in the sky now. I asked her what it looked like(I couldn&apos;t see it-we had an old Rambler car and I&apos;m missing the side mirror). She said she wasn&apos;t sure what kind of plane or what it was. Then I told her I would stop and take a look. We slowed down and I rolled my window down and I looked out and I knew immediately it wasn&apos;t an airplane or helicopter. It had two panels of light on it and they were changing colors randomly from left to right. They would be green, yellow, red, white, orange and blue. At this point I had no doubt in my mind what it was we were observing. We were a ways from the next town and no cars on the road so I drove the old Rambler as fast as it would allow. The thing in the sky followed us at a distance of maybe a mile. When we came to the next intersection and I had to turn it turned wi! th us and kept following us out the right side. It stayed a mile away from us at all times until we got to the next town. There is a lake there and it was hovering over the lake and that is the closest it got to us. We got to a major highway 4 miles down the road. I figured we would wait for a car and follow it. We waited at the stop sign but nobody came so we sat and watched for it and it appeared north of us again. I sped out for home-15 miles. My friend saw it only once in the next 4 miles. It stopped dead in the sky and headed due east and a high rate of speed. We had to go through another small town to get home yet and nobody was in sight so we kept speeding home. We never saw it again until we got home and it was coming at us about 1-2 miles out over town. The lights were doing the same thing on it the whole time it followed us. We were so freaked out we headed home and ran in the house and thought about what to do next. We went into the yard after our blood pressure came down to look for it but nothing but stars and the moon.

There is a large cliff to the West of the cabin, near the back of the lake. During WW2 this cliff was the backdrop to flyovers by airplanes that drug banners to train arial gunners. Earlier that day I had made a comment that wanted to see a UFO. Around 9:30 pm, I went out to his truck to get something and I looked over the top of the cliff and saw a flashing light that was blinking red, white, and bluish-green. I stood there for a few minutes and watched to see where it would go and it just hung in the sky. I went in the cabin to get my friend and he came out to the truck too. We sat there and watched this thing through the back window and saw it move up and down, then zoom to the side and back to it&apos;s original spot. Then another craft moved in to the North of it, it was blinking in the same colors as the first one, then two more crafts moved into the same area and formed a triangle. They hung in a triangle formation for approximately 5 minutes and then took off one at a time. During their time in the triangle formation, they were blinking red and white. The original craft that we saw then flew off over our heads blinking red and white at a very rapid pace with no sound. At that time, we could hear airplane engines when they flew over, so we knew this was a different type of craft. As it got darker out, we moved into the main cabin where there are bay windows that look out upon the lake and the cliff and watched as many other similar crafts flew into triangle formations and hung in the sky. They would form triangles of all different sizes, but always triangles. We watched them for about an hour and a half to two hours before we got tired and went to bed, but there were still many of them in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

Appeared as a bright star.On Thursday, June 03, 2004, around 12:23pm EDT (16:23 UTC), I spotted  what I consider a UFO. I was traveling north on I-77/I-64.  The sky was overcast with cirrus  type clouds at various levels.  The temperature was probably in the  70&apos;s.  At about 12 o&apos;clock in front of me I saw a bright round object  that resembled a large star.  It was approximately 45 degrees  (altitude) from the horizon.  Travel was from east to west.  Velocity  is unknown, but it traveled about 90 degress from in front of me to the  west in about a minute.  It was slow, as much so as a prop plane. The most curious thing is that I was wearing sunglasses.  They are  probably somewhat polarized.  I looked over the glasses to try to see a  contrail.  The object just seemed to &quot;disappear.&quot;  When I looked  through them again, I could see the bright object again.  I looked over  my glasses for the second time and could see only sky.  Sun was behind  me.  I could only see the object through my glasses!  Cloaking?  ET?  Terrestrial?  As far as I know, I am the only one to see it. I have seen planes in the evening look somewhat like a bright star, but  not around noon.  And I could see them with my       eye.", "Flying Saucer seen in Covington / Kent, Washington 1978I was sitting on the front lawn with my brother, we were teenagers. I saw a light in the Southern sky that looked like Venus to me and, as a joke, I told my brother &quot;Hey, look! There&apos;s a flying saucer!&quot; and I looked at him, waiting for him to call me a dork or something so I could tell him &quot;I made you look!&quot; But he didn&apos;t look back and his jaw dropped and I thought he was putting ME on so I looked and it looked like there was a black spot in the sky, about the size of a quarter at an arm&apos;s length. It became quickly obvious that the object wasn&apos;t flying _over_ us but rather was coming _toward_ us, so we stood up. In a matter of 30 seconds from my first sighting the object (and maybe a minute or two from when I first pointed it out) the object was directly overhead. We instinctively got out from under it as it descended, walking about 50 feet so we could take in the entire sight of it. I thought it might just land on the lawn and squish the house, and us with it! I&apos;d guess it was about 100-125 ft wide - it was wider than the house - and roughly six or eight feet thick. It hovered just a few feet over our parent&apos;s single story home, around 25 feet off the ground. It had a small steady red light at the N by NE side of the ship and was aspirin-shaped, cobalt blue in color - like gun metal. It had what looked like an observation deck on top of it with what appeared to be smoked-glass panes, set at 15 degree angles, just slightly tilted. I tried to see inside but I couldn&apos;t. Well, we stood there for a few minutes and I turned to my brother and asked him &quot;Is that a flying saucer?&quot; and he said &quot;what else could it be?&quot; and we both laughed. Then a white light started flashing on us. That happened for roughly 20-30 seconds. I looked for a bulb after it stopped but I couldn&apos;t see one. I looked at the underside of the disc and didn&apos;t see any markings or rivets, welds, etc. My Father was a welder. After a few minutes, the saucer started to hum like an electric motor and when the hum reached its peak or became in phase or whatever the whole disc sort of clicked visably - it moved just an inch or so and then started flying over the cow pasture next door. It was moving at a pace where anyone could walk along with it, 3-5 mph. After it flew over a few of the neighbor&apos;s houses it took off like a bat out of hell! It turned into a blur at a straight line toward the sea, to the West. After a couple seconds, it looked like someone drew a line of light from where it was on the horizon to the stars, roughly at a 45 degree angle and the end of the line eventually caught up with the point of origin and then it looked like a star for a second, and then the light went out. It was silent except for the humming before it took off and it didn&apos;t glow or anything. I wonder if anyone else in the area saw this.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They appeared to her &quot;like angels or ghosts in the sky, but they were not.&quot; She noticed them for about 5 to 10 minutes. They seemed to be zig zaging and figure eighting around in the sky. Strangely enough there was a wind storm passing by at the same time. The lights were just white. My wife and I are Nurses by trade. My wife Heidi is a very concrete thinker and hates anything sci-fi. So when she told me about what she saw, she beleived them to only be helicopters. She asked if I had seen them. I did not see the lights or hear any noises loud enough to be a helicopter. According to my wife there was no special features or haze or beams emmitting from the lights. They were just lights to her. I asked if the lights looked like they were comming from the ground. She said no.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It moved horizontally, slowly, occasionally making quick (1/2 second) vertical adjustments of 3-5 feet while maintaining a slow, steady northerly horizontal course, parallel to the ground. The quick vertical adjustments were not consistent with the wind nor with the dynamics of a balloon. The object drifted behind a tree, where it was lost to view. The object made no sound, and didn&apos;t appear to frighten birds that were plentiful in the area.

I was just looking up at the blue sky and noticed a very small point of light flickering.It was a tiny point of light like seeing a satelite at night. It was moving slowly towards the east.I thought it was strange my wife looked for it and saw it as well as my 6 year old and 9 year old. We then noticed another one further east sitting there flickering too. We noticed a smaller light sort of circling the first light, back and forth around the top of it as it got closer to the second light. The first light seemed to become stationary. Another smaller/dimmer light emerged from the second light and began to move away further east.I then began to fantically look for binoculars etc. No such luck. I got the video camera and tried to film this but I do not think I recorded it as it was difficult to se in the viewer.They were very high altitude. Once you took your eyes off of them it was hard to find them again, but we did and this lasted about an hour. We eventually lost track of them.", "3/2003 UFO in NE Ohio ~A low-flying craft gliding at night that was silent until it was out of sight and about a half mile awayMy friend and I were driving home from work on a Thursday night and I have driven on this road(Medina Line) many times before.  We crossed over a railroad crossing and I noticed a bright light that I had never seen before shining through the trees.  We came to a clearing and saw an aircraft gliding through the sky very quickly.  I stopped the car to watch.  The craft was at the height of a low flying helicopter and didn&apos;t make a sound.  At one point it was hovering almost directly ontop of us, as if it was watching us as we were watching it.  We continued to watch the craft for approximately 3-5 minutes.  A car was coming behind us so we decided to leave as the UFO began to glide out of sight.We continued south on the same road for about 30 seconds when we saw another one.  It was so far away that it looked like a bright star but it gradually came closer to where it glided directly ontop of us again.  I parked the car one last time to watch.  We stayed for about two minutes because we were freaked out and because it seemed that the craft lowered in the trees behind us.We stopped at a stop light about a half mile away from the incident.  At the same time my friend and I heard a noise that I can&apos;t describe in writing.  All I can say is that it sounded like sound a UFO made on the cartoon Scooby-Doo.  Trust me it wasn&apos;t the stop light either.  We heard the sound one more time about another half mile away.It was really dark out that night so it was hard to say what the exact shape of the craft was.  A disk or saucer shape is the closest comparision I can make.  There were white lights around the outside and about three blue lights in the center.  I would say that both crafts had the same description.  We had a better view with the first.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The Jet just went over the brow of the nearest mountain.  There was zero noise.  We thought it was an asteroid - size of a crater, shaped more like a rocket, with a long Comet-like tail.  The rocket like objects had a red/dark orange-like round tail end, and the end was dragging like a firework coming down from the sky.

They were equally illuminated and approximately the color of stars but larger.  They were stationary in the sky. They seemed to be further away than what an airliner would be but not like a distant planet or star.  We watched then for 5 or 6 seconds then they disappeared one at a time from west to east.

So taking advantage of the clear skies over the weekend. We sat in lawnchairs in the driveway next to the side door of our house. Our house is about 6 to 8 houses from the lake, which gives us clearer skies away from city light. These things we see show up very often. They enter the sky or into view like a slow meteor getting brighter from yellow-brown to white-yellow. It got no larger or brighter than venus. It becomes visable directly over head going north. It also fades slowly in and out of brightness. From dim to bright to dim again, it takes about 10 seconds. It does this 4 times, while traveling a little slower than a satalite, until it goes out completely at an 45 degre angle from the horizon. I seem to see many of these things lately with different paths going north most of the time. When they come from the north, and become visable aroung the same angle to the horizon, they always stop when dim for about 10 to 20 minutes and go back north while doing their pulsing til they go out at the usual angle some where over the lake. Fiance and saw 4 of them last weekend at 1:00 to 1:45. I saw an intensly bright one on 5/5/2003 at 23:30 doing the same things exept for how bright it became visable.

Wayne Indiana and in Dayton Ohio on the same night in 1987I was working on a master&apos;s degree in music ((deleted)) at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  I was going home to Dayton, Ohio for the week-end so it was probably a Friday. I am not sure of the date-it was cold outside and I think in late fall when this occurred.  I wish I had written down the date. I had traveled the same route at least 50 times since I was married and tried to get back to Dayton every other week-end.  I was coming out of Ft. Wayne around midnight on Rt. 30 (33?).  There is a long stretch there where there is a McDonalds.  Up ahead of me I saw a huge bright white light that was about the height of lights at a football stadium.  I wondered what it could be since I had never seen it before traveling this route.  It came closer and closer moving slowly.  I pulled off of the road into the McDonald&apos;s parking lot and got out of my van and stood watching it.  It appeared to be very large with the white light on the front and it had a green, a red and a purple light on the body of it.  It was large and flew slow and silently.  I know this sounds weird but I could not make out the shape of the craft even as close as I was to it.  I could only see the lights and from the spacing of the lights I knew it was very large.  It flew slowly towards Ft. Wayne and then disappeared out of sight.  I looked all the way back to Dayton that night hoping to see another but did not.My husband and I owned a Book Store in Dayton called Aragon Bookshop.  I went with my husband the next day to work in the store.  Around noon a woman came into the bookstore and asked excitedly if we had a UFO section of books.  I said yes and got up to show her where the books were.  I asked her if she was interested in UFOs and she said &quot;not until last night.&quot;  I asked her what had sparked her interested the night before.  She said that her and a friend had seen a lot of UFO&apos;s late at night.  She said that they were driving near Wright State University when they saw them.  When I asked where she said they were near where all the construction was going on near Colonel Glenn Highway.  She said her and her friend observed them for several hours.  She said that they were afraid to leave to go tell someone as they thoug ht they might not be there when they came back.  She said they had a bright white light on the front and that they had a green, a red and a purple light on them.  She said they would hover and move slowly and then they would zoom off and disappear out of sight traveling at a high rate of speed.  She said there were a lot of them.  She said that the next day she called her relative who was a Colonel at Wright Patterson Air Force Base which is close by where she saw the UFOs&apos;  She described the crafts and he said that there was nothing that the military had that could do what these UFOs did as she described it to him. I relayed my sighting to her of the night before in Ft. Wayne, Indiana.  We marveled at the coincidence of seeing the same type of craft in 2 distant locations on the same night. She bought some UFO books and left.  I often wished I had gotten her name and address so that I could contact her again.One other little tidbit of information: When I was 19 years old in 1967 and attending Wright State University I lived off of Linden Ave. with a nice lady who let me stay there in exchange for taking care of her children from time to time.  There was a little store on Linden Ave. that I frequented to buy food, stamps and etc.  There was a young man who worked there who I became friendly with.  One time he asked me if I would like to go see the aliens that were at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  He said that his father was a higher up in the military there(I think he said a Colonel) and that his father had taken him to see them before since he had a security clearance to where they were being kept.  he said he could get me in if I wanted to see them.  I was scared to go and declined his offer.  I have regretted that many times since then.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This night we were sitting on our deck star gazing and tracking satellites.  We are only able to see a small portion of the west and northwest sky above and between the trees in our yard from this vantagepoint.   It was a partially clear night with a sporadic cirrus partial overcast.  We observed many planes and satellites.  The satellites were very visible when the sun reflection was prominent and would fade as they tracked across the sky.   Additionally, these lights would fade and reappear as they past through the wispy clouds.  Pretty typical sky watching fair.

Perpendicular to the bottom of the cup of this constellation and at a distance near equal to twice the length of Big Dipper is a bright star (planet?)

It was tracking toward us just to the left of it.  I called my wife&rsquo;s attention to it and we watched it move.  Perhaps it was the viewing angle, but it seemed to slow in the sky.  Then there was an appearance of a momentary horizontal flash that emanated outward from opposite sides of this light.  The total length of this flash was perhaps a centimeter at arms length. The light then returned to its original size and brightness and changed direction.  As it traveled to the right, it got smaller and smaller, then turned orange or dim red and faded from view.  Interestingly, right after the flair manifestation, a shooting star was observed behind and to the left of the light.  (It was quite distant, only travelling an inch or so at arms length.)

It was our second and final night camping in the Guadalupe National Park near Pine Springs, Texas with part of our Boy Scout Troop from Midland, Texas. I was an Assistant Scout Master at the time and I worked as a News Reporter/Anchor at a radio station in Midland. There were 4 adults and approximately 15 scouts camping out under the open sky on cots and open pick-up truck beds. Two Scouts, about to become Eagle rank, and myself had settled in the back of a pick-up truck bed staring at the clear Eastern sky full of stars. Best as I recall it was on August 16th close to 23:30 hours. I suddenly saw what appeared to be a &quot;Falling Star&quot; drop down in the Northeast. It came in at a fairly moderate speed and I thought how great it was to see such a bright falling meteorite approximately two to three miles away and guessed its circumference at 100 feet. This size of the ball of light seemed too large for a meteorite.  I was a little alarmed that there was not a trailing light tail and its brightness was not decreasing which would indicate burn out. I was even more alarmed when it dead stopped approximately a thousand feet above the horizon. It then begin to move South, stopping then moving North a little then moving South as well as changing some in elevation. This jerking motion occurred over 5 times until it dead stopped for a few seconds approximately 4 to 5 miles South of where its point of entry had been. The light remained the same size whiteness and intensity the entire time. There was no sound heard. It began its same jerking motion back toward the North where it dead stopped a few seconds at the point it had stopped after entry. Suddenly it went straight up at a speed that only recently I can barely compare to the Stealth airplane going straight up at an air show. But this ball of light did this from a dead stop! The white ball of light accelerated straight up at seemingly impossible speed and disappeared out of sight in approximately 4 seconds. During this observation I heard myself say,&rdquo; What the heck,,, is,,, that?&quot; One Boy Scout said, &quot;I dunno?!!&quot; and the other Boy Scout said, I dunno either but lets not tell anyone cause no one will ever believe us!&quot;  The next morning I ask if anyone had seen anything unusual in the sky and not one of the others said they had. When they ask why I ask, I just said, &quot;Oh, just wondering.&quot;  I considered our observation a personal experience and never reported it on the air as news and never told a soul until the past couple of years, this now being 2004.

The coffee shop patio has a panoramic view of the Front Range and continental divide.  The skies were clear with some clouds to the south.   I happened to look up and see a very small spherical, metallic white object to the west about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was very far away but had a uniform color, and spherical shape (i.e. not an airplane, jet or glider shape). Because it was spherical it was difficult to determine the altitude of the object; but I would guess that it was about 10 &ndash; 15 miles to the west, somewhere over the continental divide in West Boulder county.  I would guess the altitude was at 20 &ndash; 50 K feet.  It was not moving which I found to be strange.   I marked the position of the object using a tree in the parking lot.

I noticed that without my polarized sunglasses the object was almost unperceivable in the hazy blue sky. 11:40:   I notice two airliners (DIA is 15 miles to the East).  One was flying West about 5-10 miles North of the object at about 15-25 K feet; the other airliner was flying East about 5-10 miles south of the object at about 15-25K feet.  Both airliners were traveling in regular flight paths into and out of DIA.  I live in the mountains and watch aircraft fly into and out of DIA and Jeffco Airports regularly.  I know the flight paths. 11:45:  The object started to slowly move East toward my position.   It moved too slowly to be an aircraft at any reasonable altitude.   It moved too quickly to be a weather balloon propelled by the wind. 12:00 :  The object had moved almost directly above me, from 30 degrees to 90 degrees from the horizon.  It was still at a very high altitude.  It was still a metallic white spherical object.   It was at this time that I noticed another identical object moving past the first object heading due west both at similar altitudes.   Both moving at similar speeds.  I doubt that both objects were weather balloons, moved by the wind in opposite directions. Clouds had started to form to the west. 12:05:   I watched the first object move slightly to the east of my position towards the sun. As it approached the sun it appeared to shine a red color around the object, like the light was shining thru or around the object.   I soon lost the first object in the sun and clouds.   I tried to find the second object that had moved to the West, but was unable. 12:08  To the west at a very high altitude I spotted a fighter jet moving towards the West at about 45 degrees above the horizon.   It was clearly a fighter jet, not a Lear or Gulfstream, or airliner.   It has wings swooped back at a sharp angle.  It was moving very quickly, even at the high altitude.  I would estimate the jets altitude at 20-30K feet. Conclusions: The objects were too high to clearly discern any features other than the spherical appearance of the object based upon the way that light reflected from them.   I was surprised to see the fighter jet.   The appearance of two objects passing each other did not support my theory that the object were balloons.  They did not appear to be any type of aircraft that I would recognize.  They were not gliders that frequent the Boulder skies.  These objects were very high up.  There were barley visible to the naked eye, but definitely objects.((COMMENT FROM READER))The fighter Jet this person is talking about is most likely a Mig-15.  I am a private pilot and fly out of Jeffco Airport.  There is a private pilot who has restored a Korean War Mig-15 and flies it all the time.  By the flight path and swept back wings and altitude I would guess this is the fighter he saw.  The only fighters in Colorado are Air Guard and those are F-16&apos;s.  And we all know they always have a wingman, they never fly a mission solo.

We watched them some more and then they hovered together for a sec and disappeared...poof!...into thin air.They disappeared very quickly.If they were not UFOs I do not know what else they could be....there was no beam of light going up into the sky ! from the ground.There is no airport close by and there was no carnival.Plus when I was a little girl 8 years old I saw the exact same thing when I lived in a trailer park in Brighton,MI  in 1967 only there were two and they acted in the same exact manner.My brother and 2 friends witnessed this particular show with me.I am writing to you because of your experiences with such sightings.What do you think it was that we saw?Is there a way that I could report this?And maybe see if anything was reported as being sighted in Holly,MI on this day at this time?I know now that I was not dreaming about what I saw when I was 8 years old.", "Ball of light enters van, in Richland county,OhioI am a retired decorate Police Sergeant, I hold an Associate, Bachelor of Science and Masters Degrees in Criminal Justice Administration.

The event occurred as follows. I was driving and my ex-wife asked me the time. I looked at the clock in the dash and told her.The time was about 15 - 10 minutes till 11 PM.At that moment there was a brilliant, white light flash. It was so bright that it filled the entire windshield.I yelled &quot;What the hell was that?!!&quot; My ex-wife immediately started screaming. I looked at her and saw what appeared to be a blue/white ball of light floating in midair between the dash and her seat. The ball of light silently went to the right, and it disolved through the door panel. We were both stunned!! It reappeared in an instant and resummed its same position. As the ex-wife screamed the ball of light reacted to her screams.The ball of light rapidly moved back and forth, as if it were on a track.I stared at the ball of light and saw that it was actually comprised of a large grapefruit size sphere of light. This sphere was orbited at its equator by at least (6) six smaller balls of light. This ball of light, did as the first sphere did, it moved to and through the closed door panel on the passenger&apos;s side of the van.

It was predominantly red with white, maybe yellow intermixed and it changed colors as it moved on.  It appeared suddenly and streaked north diminishing in size as it streaked and left sight within milliseconds after I saw it.  I believe in addition to the change of size due to increasing distance as it moved, that it also got smaller itslef.

The night sky was clear, there was no wind to speak of.  The moon was clearly visible in the southern portion of the sky.  Since the street slants, I saw a flash and the object appear from behind a building as it went northward.  It definitely was above the buildings, it made no sound and did not leave a trail.

We were both 18 yrs old. It was probably around 10 p.m. This area was like a very large open field; today it is probably built over with houses. We drove off the paved road (two lanes) onto a dirt road and maybe an eighth of a mile further on the dirt road went down into a large natural bowl, some 20 feet below the upper part of the land. From where we stopped we couldn&apos;t see any houses and no evidence at all of civilization. It was a typical Sacramento landscape of oaks and scrub brush. I remember that it was a moonless night.I turned off the engine and we sat and began telling ghost stories, scaring ourselves. But after a few minutes my friend said, with great fear, &quot;Let&apos;s get the hell out of here.&quot; I was very scared, too and immediately turned on the engine of my VW bug. As we started forward, looking to my right toward my friend, I saw a light outside the window, at a distance. It was round and I thought it must be a motorcycle or a car with one headlight burned out. It began to move as we did. The light began to come down in a steady swooping motion as if it would intersect the dirt road where we were heading. I practically screamed to my friend &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; She saw it and got even more scared, told me to hurry. I floored it, got to the other side of the &apos;bowl&apos; and drove up the hill to the top. On the top, on the dirt road I drove as fast as I could, maybe 30 mph and when I looked in the mirror this light was chasing us. It looked like it was about ten feet above the road, maybe higher. It was still the size of a headlight. In just a minute or two I was at the paved road. The light disappeared and we sped away. The next day, during daylight, I went back to the scene to try to figure out what had happened. Was it a motorcycle, a car or what? I stopped my car where we had been the night before. Looking toward the hillside where the light had originated I saw a small creek not too far away but the creek basin was loaded with mounds of smooth rocks left over from old dredging operations; these mounds were easily 8 ft tall and extended many feet across to the hill. The hillside itself was covered with scrub oak. No road, no path; nothing that would have made it possible for any motor vehicle to have so smoothly swooped down towards us. I seem to remember that next to the dirtroad where we escaped there were telephone lines, poles. I had wondered if the light had been ball lightning, but the weather was clear, no clouds. Neither my friend nor myself ever had an explanation for this curious and scary event. We were both college students at the time. Neither of us thought at all about UFOs (except for science fiction) or the paranormal.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

It was moving uncharacteristically fast for a conventional aircraft, zipping from left to right in my field of view. I grabbed a digital camera that I keep with me at all times now, and started taking pictures. I took the first pic through my windshield just before I hit the on ramp. As I drove down the ramp going south onto the highway, I took another pic, through the driver&apos;s side window. I just pointed the camera and snapped the picture without looking through the viewfinder, obviously, since I was driving. I had traveled approximately one mile when I took the third pic out the driver&apos;s side window. I lost sight of the object, but did not dare look up too long for fear of running off the road. I took the next two pics through my windshield hoping to catch something even though I could not take my eyes off the road. I did not pull off to the side because I was in the left lane and I did not want to be late for work. The distance traveled from the taking of the first pic to the last is around 2.5 to 3 miles and the time interval around three minutes. The camera is an hp Photosmart 315 digital, a fairly cheap camera. I experienced no electrical disturbances with my vehicle or radio. No one else seemed to notice what I saw, but it was a very busy time of day for traffic. I was too busy negotiating the road to experience any emotional or psychological phenomena. However, I did get a cold chill Sunday morning when I looked at pics and saw what I had captured. In two of the photos I took, there are distinctive disk-shapes.

Apparently, they were making all sorts of strange rapid and sporadic movements in the sky - most were blinking. On May 17th, we had returned from dinner and were outside swimming in the pool looking at the stars when I noticed a strange light that was very high up, moving side to side.  The airport is closed to air traffic at that time, and there were no other planes or moving lights in the sky, so we watched it carefully. It blinked white and red from what we could make out and it would zig zag slightly from side to side.  There was no pattern to the pulsating and there was no pattern to the movement.  We did notice what we thought was a falling star near to it during the course of watching it. For a long time it was stationary, just hanging in the sky, except for the slight back and forth movements.  After about 30 minutes, it started moving away - Northwest and it grew dimmer as it got farther into the distance going toward Punta Mita.  We could still faintly see it, but then it just vanished - totally gone. The next night, we noticed it was back again around the same time - doing the same sort of things, but we only observed it for about 10 minutes before it started moving away and then disappeared.

I remmber thinking  it must be a plane or helicopter possibly because of one place i travel past, i must be careful about how i explain the exact spot in which i got a very good look at this object which blended into the night sky it did have a shape but i cannot really say what it was,The lights which where large but did not give off any beam from them only a soft  white glow.thier is as i mentioned about the location a military base ,this base is considerted top seret it is built into a mountain and is very active,sorry but that is all i can give as far as exact location,the only objects ever seen flying at any given time of the day is a black helicopter which is a partrol chopper. but most of the time only in the daylight hours is it seen.i stopped my car after i determined that this object was indeed moveing  and that it had decended to a height that it was hoovering,or floating over the trees i could still not make out a spacific shape  it was possibly a dark color 3 lights like a triangle i later thought of the triangle shape because that is the shape the lights where in. Since i am very familiar with the area i pulled  off the road onto a small road turned off my car and got out i stood thier looking at this thing for about 5 minutes all that time i had a ringing type sound in my ears it was like a low flat ringing i noticed it right as stopped my vehicle thier was no sound of a motor or propeller noise only this ringing type  noise ,it went away after i pulled back out onto the road i was worried that the military would be comeing this area is very well guarded thier is said to ! have cameras set up everywhere monitoring the base  everyone that goes by this place. I started driveing down the road i looked into my rear door mirror and i could still see the lights it was as if the object was just sitting thier in the sky. I continued to drive i did&apos;nt want to be late for work but i was by then very curiouse as to what it was i observed was it a new type plane? One thing i do know this base does&apos;nt deal with planes or building them . I never told anyone about that night,i wanted to but around here storys of ufo&apos;s aliens  it is looked at as crazy talk,but i know what i saw that night and i wished i had a camera because i would have used it but all i have is a clear memory that i still think of to this day. Allso 2 days after this event i got extremly sick and weak i consulted my doctor which he told me he did&apos;nt know what made me sick all he could do was tell me to drink water,and get rest the following day i felt much better,did i get sick from some type exposer to something that night ? Probably not,but it crossed my mind. Allso 1 week after this event i recieved 6 phone calls only who ever it was would not talk they would stay on long enough for me to say hello then hang up i have never gotten calls  of this type ever and allso my phone number is private that just added more to think about from that particular night. thank you for reading this and allso for giveing me a chance to tell this,it has in a small way released many many years of preasure because i did want to tell someone,but fear of ridicule can be be very strong in makeing a right decision.Ever since that night i have not watched the sky as i use .((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They were motionless at first. At first I thought it was one of those posts of lights simular to those at a ball park or construction site. Then the second thing I thought of was a plane, since this area is not far from Reagan National Airport. The craft, or what I could see of it was motionless. I could not get a closer look because I was stuck at the intersection. It started to move and drifted slowly behind the trees before I could start walking again. I noticed that the planes that are taking off from the airport this morning are no longer lit up since it is now the day time. A plane would not sit motionless like that. Helecopters tend to hover then move, but this was no helecopter, since it had the multiple bright white lights. The area where I saw the craft is also not far from the Pentagon. It could have been something military. I am not sure. I did not see it again. The area where it appeared to be hovering over was Maine Avenue. I was on the corner of 14th street and C street.

At approximately 10:30 pm, an electrical storm began to develop. I was beginning to get sleepy and was considering turning the television off and going to sleep.  When there were two very rare bursts of static on the television about a minute apart (both at 10:42, according to my TiVo clock),  my decision to go to sleep was made since I also feared that it might not be safe to leave the television on any longer.  I pressed the &quot;record&quot; button on my TiVo so that I could finish watching the program at another time, very likely made a quick trip to the bathroom (though I&apos;m not sure), took off my glasses (I&apos;m very near sighted), and got back into bed. I lay down on my left side facing the large panoramic windows in my bedroom.  Even with my very impaired vision, I immediately became aware of some lights moving in the sky in a way I&apos;d never seen before.  I immediately sat up, retrieved my glasses from the night table, and put them on.  Outside my window and over Rock Creek Park and a large residential building across the street, balls of light were moving rapidly and a bit jerkily in an oval-shaped counterclockwise pattern. It&apos;s difficult to say exactly how many there were, but I believe that four individual lights  would be a good estimate.  After watching them for a stunned minute or two, I got out of bed, and went next door to get my sister.  Together we stood at the window and watched this light show for approximately five minutes.  Towards the end, the lights seemed to simply fade away through the heavy cloud cover until there was only one left.  That light eventually faded as well.  I did not look at the clock again until after my sister left.  The time was 10:58. Though I&apos;ve called them &quot;balls&quot; of light, they weren&apos;t perfectly spherical.  There was no hard edge to them, though I do believe there was a brighter intensity at the center of each.  During the entire event, they kept moving in the same circular pattern &ndash; very, very rapidly and very, very erratically,  Though pinpointing precisely where they were is tough, I recall that my sister and I both stooped a bit to get a full view of the &quot;show&quot;.  (I usually have the blinds in my bedroom about 1/3 of the way down.)  I forgot until Saturday evening when I turned on my television and my TiVo that I had recorded during the exact time of the event.  Because I&apos;m very sure that it was the second burst of static that caused me to turn off the television, I can time the start of the event (using the TiVo clock) at precisely 10:42. In retrospect, the static on the television is very interesting.  Our cable service is very reliable here and is not affected by the weather at all.  Neither my sister nor I can ever recall seeing bursts of static since we&apos;ve had this service (more than four years) and they are dramatic.  Both are preserved on my TiVo. I&apos;ll add one other observation.  Living in Washington, DC,  during the months after September 11 we became very used to hearing the jets patrolling our skies.  They were always audible, sometimes even loud enough to awaken you.   Though we no longer (or only rarely) hear those jets anymore, contrails are always visible.  I have watched contrails being formed (almost daily, in fact) and, while you can spot the object making them with the naked eye, it is completely silent. On the morning of January 8th of this year,  I was so startled by a pattern of contrails in the sky outside the same bedroom window that I took digital photos of them.  There were at least 20 (and maybe even more) in a very narrow area and I had a hard time imagining how that many planes could fly so closely together without anyone hearing a thing. Witness Two: On the evening of Friday, 5/21/04 I was in my bedroom reading.  A very powerful thunderstorm had been right over our building for approximately ten minutes when my sister came into my room and asked me to come look at something.  I glanced at the clock and noted that it was 10:46PM.  She asked me to look out the window in her bedroom at the sky over Rock Creek Park.  I saw at different times 1, 2, 3, or 4 blurry, yet distinct white lights moving counterclockwise in an apparent oval shaped orbit.  The cloud cover was heavy, but my perception was that the lights were within or circling one particular cloud.  The lightning was intense and lit up the entire sky several times as we watched the lights. The lights moved constantly in an erratic, jerky fashion, seemingly unaffected by the lightning.  Their movement appeared ghostly to me and I thought of Casper cartoons.  Their shape is harder to describe.  Narrow at the bottom and wider at the top is close &ndash; almost torch-like with indistinct edges.  It was my impression that their blurry, undefined appearance was due to the cloud cover and extremely hazy skies.  After about ten minutes the intensity of brightness dimmed and I realized that only one light was still visible as it gradually disappeared.  The storm raged on for another few minutes.  My sister and I talked for a minute or two and I went back to my room at approximately 11:00PM.", "very bright star that faded quicklyI was walking near my apartment and saw what looked like a bright star high in eastern sky.

I was talking to my wife and daughter when I tilted my head back to stretch, and this triangular shape craft was moving from south to north direction, quietly,without much effort. I witnessed it for about 3 seconds, then it went behind the house and I lost contact. It was triangular in shape with a black leading edge, and lighter gray color inboard, with dim white lights at each corner of the lighter gray surface, I don,t know whats its elavation was, but I could see very good detail, about the size of 3/4 full moon.

I did not see the object as I was in a mini-van in the drivers seat and the object would have been above the roof of the van. I immediately pulled over to the right and got out to see if I could see anything. I thought because of the brightness that it may have been a Nuclear Reactor accident somewhere but the flash only lasted 3 seconds. I also thought it could possibly have been lightning but there were no clouds. The sky was clear and had the glow of the full moon toward SW: South-West. I looked around to see if anyone else saw it and didn&apos;t find anyone that late at night.

Then I realized that it was a clear night with no haze and the flickering was more like a constant flashing.  The flashing light was changing colors from blue to orange or red.  Also, it was low in the north-northwest horizon and slowly moving lower, closer to the horizon.  It was moving very slowly, much more slowly than any aircraft that I know of.  You had to be watching it closely to discern the movement.  It seemed to be hovering as it lowered in a diagonal direction slightly toward the north.

At about 9 PM (2100) I jumped up on a transformer box that was outside of many of the homes in that area.

The lights were in somewhat of a pattern in that they were one behind the other. Miami International Airport is South-South West of were we lived then so my first thoughts were that they were aircraft. After a few minutes I realized that wasn&apos;t possible because not only were they too close to each other, but they were standing still. As I continued to look I called over my friends to ask them what they thought that could be, they had no idea. As we watched some lights would disappear, and appear again only many miles forward (or ahead) of the first lights. Then some others would disappear, and reappear in the same locations. It was the first and only time I saw something that I could not explain in the sky. Years later I saw those same exact lights on television, they were calling them the Arizona lights. I have since learned that Homestead Air Base is also south of us, however I cannot confirm any operations because it was just too long ago, and I have no exact dates.

The sky was fairly clear with only a few clouds. I&apos;ve been skygazing for a while and used to identifying planes, constellations, satellites, etc. The meteors were scarce and as I walked to an open field at the developement to get a better view and less light pollution. I looked up towards the constellation Leo.  East of the sickle (Leo the lion&apos;s mane) I saw a bright starlike object. As bright if not brighter than the near by star Regulus.  At first, I thought the object was a satellite or perhaps aglimpse of the shuttle as it followed a straight east-west path towards the sickle.  It moved at a fairly good pace then angled south about 120 deg. The common way to give rough distances while stargazing is to hold ones arm out and gauge by the number of fingers between stars.  Using others stars as a reference point for its movement, it moved anywhere from two to four fingers between turns.  It made it&apos;s next turn at about 90 deg  and a few more turns as it circled around behind the sickle and over Leo&apos;s back. It made a sharp 25 deg turn and turned again to head North.  It covered the distance at a slower rate and then went from bright to fade out, possibly going straight up. I made my way back to the house and it was 11:15 EST.  The whole time I watched, I ruled out any dust, bugs, (too far away and did not move in erratic manner), planes (a plane could pull off those turns and the light was steady) satellites (they follow a straight East-West or North-South path) etc.", "It looked like a star, but then started moving, it zig zagged and went back the other way.

It moved very fast, then slowed down and turned around and kept going slow and zig zagged and went back the other way.  It would go so far or turn in a way that we would lose it and then all of a sudden it would be back.  It stopped and then moved halfway across the sky. It really did some unusual moves.  After five minutes it disappeared.", "red orbs &apos;dancing&apos; around a central orbSince my sighting was nearly thirty years ago,my recollection is somewhat fuzzy,but i shall do my best to describe my experience.I and my 2 year-old son had gone shopping at K-MART.Upon leaving the shopping center i approached and stopped at a stop light.While waiting for the light to change,i observed a round red light approximately 100 feet above and behind the stop light.While looking at the light,it instantly became three red lights,which seemed to &quot;dance&quot;(for lack of a better word)around one another.The &apos;dance&apos; seeemed to be well choreographed,one red light was stationary in a center position while two lights manouvered up,down,around,behind and in front of the center light.Then the two &apos;dancing&apos; lights merged with the central light and were gone.That&apos;s it gone,no sudden taking off,no streaking of lights, just POOF, gone.All this seemed to occur within a 30 to 45 second time span,as the light changed from red to green.However,my observace of this spectacle, in my mind,was at least 3 to 5 minutes.As i recovered my senses,taking off from the light,i had an inner dialogue with myself, trying to reconcile what i knew i saw to what i thought could not be.Although i lived just one mile from K-MART,i passed up my house and went to my parent&apos;s home fifteen miles away.I didn&apos;t know why, i only knew i did not want to be alone.I was wired,i mean i was so up,so jittery,so energetic i could not be still.Once i was seated with Mom,i was immediately calm,even mellow.I had not recounted my sighting,but as we chatted,a replay of my sighting was constantly going through my mind,sort of like background music.I wanted and intended to tell Mom what i had experienced,however,i never did .I don&apos;t know why,it was an eerie feeling,my sighting being foremost on my mind and not speaking of it.Why was that???????? I know to this day that what i saw was real and not of this world.I sure would like to know if anyone out there has experienced similar sightings.My sighting occurred summer of &apos;76 in Coventry,R.I.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))", "Denver-area:  starlike object in daytime sky is stationary, then speeds offI looked up at the partly-cloudy sky, and almost directly overhead against the blue shone a starlike point of light or object, appearing stationary.  I ran inside to grab my binoculars and was back outside within about 30 seconds, but I couldn&apos;t find the object, so I scanned the sky to see if it had moved to another location, thinking it may have been a balloon very high in the sky.  I located it, or another object like it, substantially east of the original location, but again, appearing stationary.  (I subsequently checked the current weather report and found that the wind was coming from the north, so apparently the object was not simply drifting in the wind.) I sighted it through the binoculars and it appeared to be a single, round, whitish object.  As I watched it for a couple of minutes, sometimes with the naked eye and sometimes through the binoculars, it seemed to remain almost motionless.  Then SUDDENLY, it took off heading to the south very quickly -- erasing any suspicion I had that it may be a balloon.  Whereas I had been holding the binoculars steady, I now had a hard time keeping up with the object.  I attempted to find it again with the naked eye but from that point on, I couldn&apos;t.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Starlike object seen again later in dayI made a report earlier today; a starlike light in the daytime sky.  This evening I decided to recline on a lounge chair on my back patio to scan the sky again, and at about 7 PM I saw either the same or a similar object as earlier today.  The object was apparently motionless in the eastern sky, directly in front of me, and about halfway between horizon and zenith.  Way too early in the evening to see a star, but that is what it resembled, with a spherical shape discernible with binoculars.  There are electrical lines overhead which connect from the house to the garage, and the object was centered between the two lines for the entire sighting, which lasted about 15 minutes until it became obscured by clouds and virga as a small storm rolled in.  The object gave the impression of being very, very high in the sky and of reflecting the sunlight, as it faded in intensity as the clouds approached.((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting the report.

VERY STRANGE.", "It was an amazingly clear, calm night, 3/4 moon and no wind or breeze. My husband, my 2 sons, and I went outside for a late night walk and as soon as we reached the road my husband and I saw a bright white light in the sky right above the treetops traveling from the north heading southward and at first we thought it was a plane, jet, or helicopter but when we stopped to watch it we noticed that there were absolutely no sounds what so ever coming from the object.  We then looked more closely at it after realizing that it was not a plane and noticed that there was a red streak type tail off the back of it coming to a point.  It traveled steady and parallel to the earth for about 30 seconds and then it just faded to just a red light, seemed to almost stop, then disappear completely.  We were in &quot;awe&quot; and somewhate disbelief of what we saw and didn&apos;t even mention it to our boys due to the fact that they are 10 and 6 and that would have been the end of our late night walks.  I have never seen anything like that and neither has my husband.  I know that Venus passed by the sun the next day so is it possible that Venus was able to be seen the evening before also?  It looked alot like a shooting star or meteor with the exception that it was alot larger, brighter, and was traveling horizonally instead of vertically and seemed to be just above the treetops. I could not even begin to tell you how high or how big the object was but if you hold your index fingers together and your thumbs together to form a circle and extend you arms all the way out, that is aproximately how large it was in relation to where it was located and how far away it was. It could have been a large object very far away or a fairly smaller object closer to us but it was too bright to really tell but it seemed to be approx. about 100 feet away and up just above the treetops. Please feel free to contact me and let me know if anyone else has reported this same object. I did not know where to look to see if any other strange sighti! ngs were reported that night in this area and this is the first time I have ever gone to a site dealing with this subject. Our neighborhood is very quiet with very few street lights so I doubt it was seen over by us but hopefully it was seen by someone else in Crestview.  It&apos;s kind of difficult seeing something that cannot be defined or explained.  Needless to say, we did not go walking last night or tonight.  Maybe tomorrow though.  Thank you!((NUFORC Note:  We, at first, thought the sighting might have been caused by an overflight of the International Space Station, but the ISS was not visible over Florida on this date.

The objects vary in speed shape and formation.My family lives in Montville, Ohio.( Geauga County ) We moved to this rural area 8 years ago from Cleveland. We thought UFO&apos;s were a joke. Boy were we ever wrong. My sons and daughter all have seen strange sightings across the street in a cow pasture.We have seen things that were not planes hovering in 1 space or things darting back and forth very fast. We have seen somthing like a fire ball pass over us. I was driving home from work on route 528 going north when something very large and slow stopped over my car. It was lower that trees so I knew it could not be a plane. When I arrived home, my daughter ran to the car and told me I wouldn&apos;t believe her but this strange object flew very low over the house. Her estimated time was close to when I too saw the object. My 13 year old son watches out the window every night for activities in the sky. He watches in disbelief. The most amazing sight I would never forget is when my husband left for work ( 11:00pm). He pulled out of the driveway and down the street.( I always watch him drive away) He could not have been more than 1 or 2 houses away when we noticed ( my three children and myself ) a strange thing in the pasture very close to the road. It was like red and white lights rotating in a circle very very fast. It looked as if it was a few feet above the ground. We watched in amazement. There is no explantation. It could not be kids doing a prank because the movement was too fast. My daughter had a strange experiance 2 weeks ago. She was driving home from Chardon. She said this green light appeared over her car.Her car stopped. Everything in the car stopped working. She said it looked like the other cars on the road stopped too. My son is reading this and is commenting on the different size and colors. He stated that he saw some split into more than one object. My husband has never seen anything and he thinks we are nuts. When I tell people that we see stuff in the sky we get strange looks. We do not report it to officals or sherriff because! we would be laughed at. I am hoping that you read this and take the time to talk with my son.I told my mother about some of the sightings a few years back. She did not say anything. She was quiet. And then she told me a story about her brother. He lived in Ashtabula county. He said he saw something in the sky that looked like a spaceship. He was not drinking. He ran into the house to tell his wife to look. By the time they went back out it was gone. My mother thinks he called and reported it. All the townsfolks laughed at him. His family thought he was nuts. This happened over 40 years ago. My mother never thought of this story until I told her. She was worried if I told others that I would be laughed at too.The information I gave above is not correct because I do not know the exact days or times. The objects vary in size, color and shape.The pasture that most of the sightings happen at was to be an indain burial mound. Do you think this has anything to do with the sightings((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but we doubt that the Indian burial ground has anything to do with their sightings.  PD))", "three metallic spheres moving at great speeds and with difficult maneuvers, watched for 5-10 minutesOne evening as I was watching my two daughters swim in our backyard pool, my youngest daughter looked up and said, &quot;dad, what are those things in the sky, it is too early to see stars and it looks like they are moving?&quot; I quickly glanced up and saw three very bright metallic spheres moving about in no particular formation or pattern. I ran into the house and grabbed my ziess binocs and viewed these objects for several minutes before one broke away at tremendous speed from the other two and disappeared in a matter of seconds. The other two seemed to circle each other until they appeared to be one object (could have been an elevation issue) and then the two were clearly present again as two objects. The spheres were at a very high altitude behind a very bright blue sky with a setting sun. The objects were above what I consider cirrus or cirrus stratus clouds. Those skinny almost transluscent clouds. Other than those clouds, the sky was totally clear and blue. The two remaining spheres simply disappeared while watching them. We did not get the impression that they sped away or climbed to an altitude that would prohibit our sight because of distance. I own my own business, my father is a retired Brigadier General USAF. I know the difference between ballons and aircraft. I know what wind can do and how fast conventional aircraft maneuver across the horizon. I dont know what we saw, but it was not ballons nor conventional aircraft and certainly not atmospheric phenomenon (these objects reflected sunlight).((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I went outside to look for the &quot;black &quot; area and sure enought it was there. I guess it was about 150 feet in size. The stars were NOT visable in the &quot;black&quot; area. As the area moved slowly the stars in the &quot;rear&quot; of the area came into view and the stars in front dissappeared. The sky was clear except for this area. The dogs in the neighborhood were barking and howling. The area moved against the wind and slowly move from SE to NW. I have seen this &quot;black&quot; area in the sky one other time but it may be there other times. There was no noise from the area except maybe a slight hum. It sure causes the dogs to go nuts and causes weired static on my CB radios.", "At about 10:00 PM on 3/5/04, I was ready for bed and went out on the lanai to check if the screen door was locked.  It was a very clear night and I glanced up toward the sky.  Very high in the sky, I saw what I first thought was an airplane, but the lights were pulsing off and on (not fast, it was on a couple seconds went by the off).  When the lights were off, I could not see anything and when they came back on, they were in the shape of a &quot;cross&quot; (not a plus sign -- a cross)  This object was going south.  Then I glanced over to the west and lo and behold, another one was coming from the west and made a turn south.  It was following behind the first one.  I watched until I could no longer see them. I was told by my neighbor (who is a former air traffic controller) that they probably were jets flying into Ft. Myers International Airport.  I question that though because I think the airlines have lights on their planes at all times during the night.  When these lights went off, you could see nothing.  This just didn&apos;t seem normal to me.  I couldn&apos;t hear anything either, but as I said, they were very high in the sky.  They were so high in the sky, that they looked like the size of my hand.

Some kept a stable light while others dimmed it and one was blinking. An interesting detail, that might have been a coincidence is that I remembered to get my camera from the car right before the sightings (to prevent any robery), I tried to film 2 of the sightings and just as I pointed the camera the lights dimmed imediately, so I put it away.", "5 bright lights with bright light trails behind them moved quickly accross the night sky and were gone.First spotted one light with a trail of bright light behind it and thought maybe it was a shooting star.

Our house is under the flight paths for both D/FW Int. Airport and the joint reserve base in Fort Worth, so we often hear and see jets. I was facing northwest when I heard the noise. I looked over my shoulder to the south and saw a very bright white contrail (or smoke trail), very dense and wide, extending from the south heading directly north. Airliners never travel in this path -- they always go east-west or west-east. I visually followed the contrail north until I spotted what initially looked like an airliner, EXCEPT IT HAD NO WINGS. The object and its contrail were higher than the clouds. The object had little fins at the back end like a missile. The contrail was much wider than the object. After about 20 seconds, the object faded out of view. At this point, I went into the house to get my 30-year-old daughter. She came outside and we both saw the contrail still clearly visible in the sky. The trail was slowly fanning out. However, we could both see that the trail started and ended abruptly. We took digital photos of the contrail, which show that it was above the clouds. After taking the photos, I called my husband -- an ex-Air Force pilot -- to tell him about the object. He had no idea what it was. That night, he asked me to draw a picture of the object. The next morning, at work, he showed the drawing and photos of the contrail to his ex-fighter pilot buddies. None of them knew what it was, but all of them said it looked like a missile. They had no idea what kind of missile, but it must&apos;ve been huge based on its altitude. The object was too large to be a missile from an F-16 and there are no nearby launch facilities for other types of missiles. I know what airliners and fighter jets look like. This was neither.

My daughter and I were on their deck at about 8:30 or a little after because I was telling her about the curious jet/chem trails I had seen earlier in the day. We noticed a jet in the distance going straight up, and I mentioned how odd that seemed to me... I see them every so often and wonder where they came from... anyhow, we watched it for a minute or two, and then it just disappeared, the trail ending abruptly. We remarked that that was odd, because we could no longer see the &quot;jet&quot; either.   A few seconds later, we noticed an object moving in a south easterly direction which meant it was horizontally moving right out where we were looking... which was to the north.  As it came closer, we could see that it was actually more of a stunted blimp shape, but cigar shape is the closest to it that you have for me to choose from here. I was, I believe either silver or gold...the sunset seemed to make it look slightly reddish, but I could tell it was not red.It moved slowly overhead..we could both see it clearly. We waited to hear a sound, so we could be sure whether we were looking a plane or not. One can hear the sound of a jet that is so high you can barely see it. This object was not that high at all. NO sound. Nothing. We both watched it until my daughter suddenly asked her husband to get the camera. He ran to get it, and she tried to get a shot of it, but said it didn&apos;t appear in her sights. It didn&apos;t register. It was pretty much gone by then anyhow. Just wish we had thought of the camera right off. Would have been a great photo opportunity. Her husband saw it too, but didn&apos;t seem interested. It was her birthday, so I just looked at her and said &quot;Happy birthday. You have seen your first UFO.

When I focused the bonoculars on the orb it blinked out. With bonoculars you can see an object( plane or helicopter ) even with the lights off but this object was completly gone.

It was about 2:00am when I was driving south on hwy 9 when shockingly I saw the same object directly over hwy 9 about 75-100 ft in the air! It was kind of pulsating behind that same vapor or cloud.

We stopped by a friend&rsquo;s work during her lunch break and then continued on our bike ride down towards the Steel Bridge.  We went under the Burnside Bridge on the bike/walk dock and neighbor stopped suddenly on her bike in front of me.  I thought that something was wrong with her bike at first because she stopped so abruptly.  I came to a stop behind her and looked up to where she was looking.  We both saw what seemed to be a huge metallic pipe floating in the sky.  The sky was covered with very low clouds and scattered light showers.  The pipe was moving slowly from the north in and out of the clouds and then began moving south parallel with I-5, but more so above the east side of Portland.During the bike ride I was in the process of photographing Portland&rsquo;s bridges for my grandfather who is a retired civil engineer.  I remembered that I had my digital camera with and scrambled to pull it out of my bike bag.  I began to photograph the object in the sky (between 2:00 pm and 2:30 pm on 5/ 15/ 04).  Once I started taking pictures the object leveled out, flattened, and moved slowly towards us.  I took the picture and looked around to see if anyone else noticed this thing.  I was surprised when I realized that virtually no one else was out on the dock that afternoon.  There was one runner, a woman that glanced up and over her shoulder when she ran by to see what we were staring at.  She did not stop to look and I doubt that she saw the object from the angle at which she turned her head.  We did not say anything to the runner because we were completely stunned by what we thought we were experiencing.  The object remained flat and continued to hover above us.  I took a couple more pictures and then I got a really weird feeling that I should not be taking these photos.  I put my camera down out of respect for the object (I don&rsquo;t know why).  Neighbor and I just stared at the pipe/ or disk (looked more like a pipe-disk the closer it came because I could see a slight bend at each corner).  I can not tell if it was my eyes playing tricks on me or the pipe emanating energy towards us.  It looked like a shifting aura or something that was pulsing towards us.  Something like a light or small sun beams that break through clouds, but it was not very bright and rather bluish-white-grayish.I then decided to us my video mode on digital camera because I knew my other friend would not believe what I had seen if I did not have moving footage.  Unfortunately I cannot zoom in on video mode like I am able to with still shots, but I worked with what I had.  I began to film the object and it began to move away from us heading east.  I filmed the I-5 and then back to the sky to put the event in perspective.  The object continued to move away and then turned slightly to the left/ north.  It began to move further away and I stopped filming because I was frightened.  When the object was close I was not scared but more so in awe of the event, however, when the object moved away I began to panic because I felt I had seen something I should not have (don&rsquo;t know why again).  I felt that the object was still watching us even though now behind the clouds. I also felt that the object could hear us or knew what we were thinking.  I then turned to neighbor and made her promise that we would not tell anyone, out of respect towards whatever that was.  We expressly agreed with a hand shake (in my head I figured that they needed to see this) and got back on our bikes and headed north towards the steel bridge slowly.  We could still see the object but I just wanted to get out there.  The object dipped back down out of the clouds and then went up and slightly towards to north out of sight.While we were riding away I checked to see if neighbor was all right.  I felt funky through my entire body and pretty confused (not to the point of disorientation though).  She asked me why I wanted to know if she was all right, I did not answer her and continued to ride across the bridge.  We barely said a word to each other for the rest of the ride, only a &ldquo;what the hell was that&rdquo; every now and then.  When I got home I put the pictures in my computer and I was surprised to see that the camera picked up the object on video.  I showed neighbor and we really didn&rsquo;t talk about it much until later that night after we had a couple beers.  We totally broke our earlier agreement because the excitement of what had happened earlier hit us after a few beers.  We decided to show the photos only to people that we thought could appreciate them.  The more we showed the photos, the more we wanted to continue to show the photos.  Many of our friends say that they got chills when they viewed the pictures on my computer.  It really was exciting for everyone and I am glad to a certain extent that we broke the agreement to not tell anyone.I have not contacted this web page sooner than today because I am fearful of the ramifications.  I am fearful of the secrecies within government and I am ignorant to whatever it was that was looking back at us on the dock.  I hope that by sharing this story and pictures with everyone will help in some way.  I don&rsquo;t know how it will help but I know that it was one of the most amazing things I have seen occur in the sky.  The next day I went to the ocean for a friend&rsquo;s birthday and took a picture of my first whale.  This little camera is the best investment I have made this year.  Thanks for listening, there are few more post sighting experiences that I have not included because I do not know if they are relevant&hellip;I don&rsquo;t even know what I experienced.  I would like to talk with someone in person before I share any of that. All we have is a moment", "Three light spots converging to centre and disappearing at amazing speedDuring a tranfer from Italy to Turkey in august 2001, the petty officer on the port side of the bridge called me outside (I was an Ensign in the italian navy at that time). I still do not exactly know what it was, but I saw three very bright spots that could have been the three angle of an equilateral triangle that converged towards the centre. As soon as the reached it, they moved at incredible speed in an eastward direction and disappeared after a few seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Bright lights changing color and pattern above skyline, like I&apos;ve never seen before.I was glancing out our back door while talking to my sister when two very bright white lights caught the corner of my eye. They were above the horizon, which made me wonder what it was. I asked my sister to take a look and the two lights merged into one, then back again. I grabbed the binoculars to see if I could tell what it was. That was when I noticed there were many orange and red lights around the side of it. This went on for about ten to fifteen minutes. My sister got scared and decided she was going to her room so she wouldn&apos;t have to see it. I called for my brother and his friends, who were staying the night, to come look. They all four came to see. We each took turns with the binoculars and everyone but my brother, who couldn&apos;t see where we were looking, agreed that they had never seen anything like it. It occasionally got closer to the ground, then rose up higher again. They all decided to go back in the house, but I continued to watch. Almost as soon as they did, it almost dissapeared. Then it turned into one big red light. I called for them to come back and look. Just as they were getting back to the door, it became one large white light again. Then I watched it slowly turn and became really bright, then dim again. Everyone alse went back into the house because they though I was joking, but then it turned red again so I called them back. As they were coming back, it turned into a long line of several red and orange flashing lights, like you would see Christmas lights in their running fashion. It had an orange glow over the top of it. We again took turns with the binoculars watching it slowly rise and sink in the sky. They all went back inside once more and I continued to watch it. After about five more minutes it began to slowly and steadily move towards my right along the skyline. This all went on for about thirty-five minutes until it suddenly was gone and I couldn&apos;t locate it anymore.", "High-speed, silent triangular formation of lightsAfter visiting the next door neighbours, my mum, sister and I were going back into our house. As my mum was exiting the door, my sister and I were standing on the top of our driveway. I looked up, and in the South East area of the sky I saw a formation of four lights fliyng to the left, I suppose flying North/ North West, roughly. There was one red light at the front, and 3 yellow lights in a trangular formation behind. The yellow triangle was on its side, and the top and bottom lights were flashing on and off alternately very quickly. It did not register as aircraft lights, which normally involve a blue light, or a green light. The lights appeared to be part of the same object, and it flew without sound very quickly, probably crossinb my range of vision within about 7 seconds. However, I cant estimate a speed due to the lack of reference points at night.", "Four objects dissapear before our eyes.Sitting on the back patio at my sisters house we looked up and saw 4 objects in the sky, fluttered around for a while and then took off.

When I said &quot;hey, look at that&quot; it disappeared. We started going faster down the road and we saw it again, it was flying over us in the sky and we could see under it.  There were three lights spaced evenly in a triangle formation. It just stayed in one spot in the sky, then took off really fast. We got home and the whole time home we were keeping an eye on it. It was zigzagging through the sky that it was dogging something. we ran inside and got the telescope, when we went back outside we started setting it up, the UFO was still there were we left it but higher in the sky and it was the same pink light that was there when we first saw it. The object started zigzagging again and in the distance of where it just left there were spurts of lights going off at a time. there was also a loud hmmmmm sound going off. There are farms around and the animals were making very weird sounds like they were in pain. We got scared and ran inside.", "Bright light flashes and shrinks before zipping off.My friend and I were sitting in her driveway in Drain, testing her new telescope. Clear night. My friend&apos;s cats started climbing all over us and we thought that was odd, because they usually hide when company is over. We couldn&apos;t get the tele. focused on anything very well, so I got up to see if I could find the moon, easier to focus on. I walk down the driveway and turn around and looked above the house. She had tall Douglas firs between her house and the road. Above the trees was a round white light. I asked her when they got a new street light and she said they didn&apos;t. So I asked her to look and tell me what the light was. It was NOT the moon. She said she had no clue what it was and grabbed the tele.  When she bent down to look at it through the tele. the &apos;light&apos; (which was a bit smaller than the moon) flashed very brightly. My friend jerked her head back and held her hands over her eyes, saying the light had hurt them. Then the light shrunk to start size, zipped diagonally down and to the left and then took off way upinto the sky, where it continued to zigzag across the sky and then disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "It hovered and its pattern of lights were changing.Full Description of event/sighting: As my boyfriend and I were on our way home from work, I looked up and noticed what appeared to be a plane about to land at the nearby airport. It was V-shaped with plenty of bright lights and was very close to the ground. As we drove closer, the object appeared to change shape from a V to an oval shape. It also picked up speed and started travelling in the same direction that we were going (east) and by this time it appeared to be quite far off. I wasn&apos;t sure if I was seeing things right - I thought perhaps that these lights were a reflection on the windshield or something but my boyfriend verified what I saw. I was still doubting what I was seeing so I stuck my head out the window because I wanted to see the object with my bare eyes. As we were turning into our driveway, the flying object seemed to stop abruptly and then started to approach out direction (west) and as it was doing so, got much closer to the ground (I&apos;m not sure how low). We got out of the car and stood at the end of the driveway to watch to see where it was going. It hovered and its pattern of lights were changing now from random and extremely fast flashing to 5 bright white lights. It was really hard to tell how far away the object was at this point but we both new that it was a lot closer than before. It did not appear that the lights were attached by any one object; rather, it was as though they were together in a group formation. As it was hovering it was &quot;pacing&quot; north and south very slowly. As we walked closer to the door a red/pink light appeared and it seemed as though it were trying to hide from our sight now. Then as we were walking in the door, it hovered back into our view. I absolutely could not believe what i was seeing. My boyfriend&apos;s witnessing to it was the same as mine. It just so happened that as we immediately turned on the TV in our room, a program came on television that was about UFO sightings. It was too odd to be a coincidence. Has anyone else had an experience like my boyfriend and I have had?  Thank you to the witness for the report.

We live five miles from Offutt AFB and what I saw was in that direction.  It appeared to be at first glance an aircraft perhaps coming towards us.  We had seen many Offutt jets during the day and thought maybe this was just another one.  However, it was standing still.  Dead still.  We ovserved it for several minutes, maybe 5 or 6.  Marilyn then brought out the binoculars and we saw right away that it  was not an aircraft like any we had ever seen.  It appeared to be several thousand feet high and north of Offutt. It was rectangular in shape, with the rectangle a light green, but with two wing-like protrusions which were brighter green.  It sat perfectly still so we assumed it was not a kite nor a helicopter.  Didn&apos;t look like either.  We are really not familiar with weather balloons, but it didn&apos;t look like a balloon either.  It held this positon for a good 20 minutes, and then it moved fairly rapidly to the south at what we guessed to be a half mile.  However, prior to its moving, a small single engine aircraft flew overhead.  Marilyn commented that it looked like the plane would fly over the object.  I watched with the binoculars and observed that in fact the plane flew under the object, which we then assumed must be much larger than we had first thought.It held its new position for about ten minutes drifting down slowly and then started drifting, again slowly, to the north and gradually dropped lower and disappeared over the rooftops.  We saw no lights, but its color changed from green to beige once it had moved to the south as noted above.  When it shifted from one position to another the wing-like protrusions had an appearance of gecko heads or modern day fighter aircraft cockpits.During the time we observed this, a couple of Offutt planes took off and landed, but went nowhere near the object.I reported the sighting to the local sheriffs department immediately after, and they said no other calls had been received regarding the sighting.We are both advanced degree college graduates in our mid sixties and have never before experienced any thing like this.  We are not prone to hallucinations nor prevarications.", "It was a very strange object.It was total diffirent from anything I saw before and after.This UFO was not just light it had a form and shape and was made of a gold-like mettal (probably it was gold).The shape of this UFO was airshiplike (cigar shaped),but it had no surface.It was constucted from massive mettal rods like a cylindric cage.It had a nose and tale.The nose was like a cone of spikes and this spikes formed the body.It flew at medium height and not very fast just stright forward.I heard no sound and did not see any engine,but it had some mooving parts.There were no people on board.I can&apos;t remember more details of this object because I was very young at this moment and have seen it only short time.The building in front of me has discosed it.The whether was good on this day.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

We ended up below the dam.  We were trying to catch fish in the puddles in an area that supports the dam -kind of like a second dam but not.  We became stuck in the sand with my mitsubishi mini pickup.  We&apos;d jack it up and get out then get re-stuck.  We rested for a while and hiked around goofing off.  We didn&apos;t care we&apos;d get out. I&apos;d turn on the headlights and light music and we&apos;d fish from the head lights.  Then al of a sudden streaking through the sky we could see what ((my friend)) called a shooting star at first.  I said that isn&apos;t far enough away to be a shooting star and you can hear the damn thing.  As it got close we could immediately see it in several pieces spreading out.  We about 1/8 to a 1/4 mile away we watched a trasformer blow up into pieces.  Then seconds later we heard a distant crash noise.  We went home and told our friends and family.  We were listened to -politely, but not taken seriously because the MIR had broken up at the same time and landed in water.  Well, Wes and I believe that there is more to the MIR then meets the eye, and that more than one piece came down, multiple pieces came down.  We went back and looked around the desert where we thought the bigger piece(s) came down.  It was like looking for a needle in the hay stack.  As a matter of fact we figured it had fallen within a mile and a half from Weaver&apos;s Needle (a rock formation were gold is suppose to be hidden long ago).

The individual reported that he was visiting from his home state of Idaho, in order to drop his daughter off for classes at the University of Washington.  He was standing outside at approximately 23:15 hrs., when his attention was suddenly drawn to a very bizarre looking, triangular shaped object in the night sky.  It immediately captured his attention, not only because of its bizarre appearance, but because of the amount of the night sky that it covered in the approximately 2 seconds that he was witness to the object.  The witness estimated that the object traversed an arc of approximately 90 degrees in those two seconds, and it was totally silent. The witness added that the object did not have the normal red and green navigation lights, required on conventional aircraft during flight at night.  Moreover, he stated that the &quot;edges&quot; of the triangle appeared to be &quot;dark,&quot; and the center portion of the triangle appeared to him to be &quot;empty,&quot; or more lightly colored than the periphery.  The witness estimated that the apparent size of the object, from his vantage point, was three-quarters the size of the Moon. Atmospheric conditions at the time were clear, and visibility unlimited (CAVU), with no clouds visible. NUFORC is awaiting a written report from the witness.

The ball, about the same size as the initial blast of the sled, but to the east of the track accelerated with the sled. At the first booster it began to accelerat at 3 to 4 times the speed of the sled as it changed direction toward my position.

It seemed to move slow then fast at about the altitude of small planes and helecoptors, in other words, not that high up. I yelled down to my husband to go outside to see if he could see it. He saw it. I ran outside, the object was swiftly moving dew north. We ran up the street so that we could still see it.We watched as it stayed in sight for a minute or so.

From a mile away, it looked to be about a size somewhere between a large seagull and the front-end of a compact-car.

All of a sudden a very powerful bright light descended down straight upon us from somewhere and practically paralyzed and engulfed us.  Then, before we knew it, the strange sound was directly overhead of us also, and was still producing an extremely bright light.  This sound stayed over us too for four minutes or longer.  The light was so bright that my cousins and I could not see each other for four minutes or so as this thing hovered and flew directly over us.  We began to shout to try to find each other in the blinding light and noise but couldn&apos;t.  Everyone was totally blinded by this light.  The roaring and swishing sound was so loud that it too was startling, so we all blocked our eardrums.  But the noise was still extremely loud and mind-bogling.  Needless to say, we were all extremely frightened and screeming for help.  Whatever that thing was that flew over us that day had to have been really huge and fast because of the noise it produced.  The noise was loud and screeching, and like nothing I have ever heard before.  It was a strange feeling.  I realize that this story is indeed strange, but it really happened.

The bottom light maybe 100ft from the ground, putting the top light maybe 400ft from the ground.  The lights faded on and off for about a minute.  They seemed to be following the same dirrection of our car and the exact same speed.  We were a little scared to think we might be being followed, for this reason we never did pull over.  When the lights were at their brightest the middle light split into two seperate lights now with a total of four lights in a diamond shape, roughly 300ft hight x 100ft wide.  At one point I rolled down my window to see if they were making any sound.  I could hear our car and the other few cars but no sound otherwise.  They were still pulsating and moving along the same path as the car.  They were not moving any further north towards us but going west with us.  It didn&apos;t actually appear as though they were moving but they weren&apos;t getting any further away and we were traveling about 75mph.  Another couple of minutes and the two outside lights each split into three seperate lights making a total of eight.  They maintained perfect formation and never broke their equidistance.  I couldn&apos;t see an actual structure holding them t! ogether but I couldn&apos;t make out the horizon behind them whereas I could on either side.  The light was completely self contained and shed no light on the surroundings.  Another couple of minutes and they seemed to stop following the same path and were either going a lot slower or stopped and we kept going.  The lights eventually dimmed out all together.  I kept looking up and saw a few more unusual flashes high up in the sky but the latter lights could very well have been some known aircraft, shooting stars, or a meteor shower.  I have educated myself on the appearance of flares.  These WERE NOT FLARES.  There was no smoke, the lights never once descended.  They were amber not white and did not flicker what-so-ever.", "Starlike object seen again later in dayI made a report earlier today; a starlike light in the daytime sky.  This evening I decided to recline on a lounge chair on my back patio to scan the sky again, and at about 7 PM I saw either the same or a similar object as earlier today.  The object was apparently motionless in the eastern sky, directly in front of me, and about halfway between horizon and zenith.  Way too early in the evening to see a star, but that is what it resembled, with a spherical shape discernible with binoculars.  There are electrical lines overhead which connect from the house to the garage, and the object was centered between the two lines for the entire sighting, which lasted about 15 minutes until it became obscured by clouds and virga as a small storm rolled in.  The object gave the impression of being very, very high in the sky and of reflecting the sunlight, as it faded in intensity as the clouds approached.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting the report.  PD))", "Watched 3D cube for 2 min out office window.Craft Description: from out of my office window I observed what I thought to be a large bed sheet (king sized) caught in the wind about 300 yards away and approximately 150 yards off the ground. I thought it peculiar so continued watching. After approximately 15-20 seconds I observed that the motion of the bed sheet was very odd. The only way to describe what I was viewing at this point of the encounter, is to say that I was looking at a large bed sheet that was caught in a rising thermal and being tossed around as it rose. However, the bed sheet was traveling across my field of vision in a perfect horizontal path. As it approached, instead of the bedsheet being swirled around in a random pattern, I could see that it was revolving with some regularity around an unseen object and traveling in a deliberate path. When the &quot;bed sheet&quot; got to within 100 yards from me I could CLEARLY make out the &quot;object&quot;. What I saw was a 3D cube floating above the ground oriented standing on end. I dont believe that it was rotating. The only way to describe the outer surface of the object is to say that if you took video footage of a large sheet caught in a rising thermal (the sheet fully spread out and tossing in the thermal) and projected that footage on the outside of the 3D cube... that is what I saw. I watched this object for some 2 minutes and saw it very easily. It moved from NW to SE and my guess to speed would be 100 - 175 MPH. It was slow enough that I could see it plainly and watch it as it finally went out of site over the south easterly foothills outside my office window.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We looked at it and about 5 seconds later we saw a large red circle appear near the plane. It stayed there for about 15 seconds and we saw a small red dot come out of the red circle directly at the plane. The plane changed directions downward and the red circlular object completely disappeared.", "Bright object crossed the sky leaving a shimmering banner like trail while at least one other object followed before disappearing .I was on my front sidewalk, stargazing with my telescope, when a strange object crossed west to east through the sky. This was unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen before. The lead object was traveling at a relatively slow rate of speed and appeared to be emiting a shimmering banner type of trail. At least one other object was behind the trail. Suddenly the objects disappeared (burned up?). My neighbor and his wife who had just returned home and saw me outside, walked over and asked, &quot;What was that we just saw&quot;?  Maybe this was some space junk re-entering earth&apos;s atmosphere, but I gotta tell you, this was one of the strangest things I&apos;ve ever seen.((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT, SUBMITTED JUNE 30, 2004))(Follow-up to previous reportThis is a follow-up to my report of 6/26/04.

I couldn&apos;t discern an aircraft shape per se, just a shing object that appeared to be 8 to 10 miles to the south.  It was traveling at a pace one would expect of a small plane, and appeared to be 5,000 agl.  (Lake Alpine is 7,300.)  I watched it travel south for 10 or 15 seconds and suddenly it abruptly changed directions (now S.W.) and shot out of sight in a very short time, two or three seconds.  There was no sound.  This is the fourth (similar) incident I have seen here in Calaveras County since moving here nearly four years ago, but this is my first report", "3 arch shaped lights in New WestminsterThis happened in New Westminster, BC. It was about 3:30 AM and there was a power surge, so I went to reset the alarm clock. I turned on the TV to check the time and the cable was out. About 5-10 minutes later I looked outside, and hovering above the trees, was a set of 3 lights giving off a lavender glow. The object/s were 3 lights in an arc shape. The color was like nothing I&apos;d ever seen in the sky. I watched it for 5 minutes as each light seemed to change shape. Then, each light slowly dissolved with the light on the far left dissolving first, then the light on the far right dissolving next, and the largest middle light dissolving last finally to a pin prick of light and then there was nothing.", "I was getting ready to go to a friends house.

A light was shining at me through the east window. I didn&apos;t think much of it but it woke me up, so, I flipped over in bed and looked out of the window behind my head, (South Facing) and I thought I saw a plane but after a few seconds I realized it wasn&apos;t a plane because it was large and triangular with two flashing lights on each tip. My mind was trying to convince me that maybe its a new type of plane or something but a couple of seconds later an orb came our of the top of it and went straight up into the sky.

Was head south, approaching I-40, and just happened to glance up at the full moon. Just to the left of it, was what I can only describe as a fireball, headed SSE at an incredible rate of speed. It was about 1/10 the size of the full moon. I stared at it while driving for almost 10 seconds, and lost it in the lights of a mall parking lot as I passed. I looked in the local paper websites to see if anyone reported anything, but haven&apos;t seen any info on it.", "after midnight, 3 brightky lit objects with red,yellow &amp; white lights flew in perfect  line formation over my houseI was standing on my front porch around midnight and was talking to a friend on the phone so as to not wakeup anyone else in the house.I looked up into the sky and noticed 3 light formations, each about 1/4&quot; in diameter (at arms length)traveling faster than an airplane in a formation-one right after the other. The space between each object at arms length was approx. one and one/half inches and they were traveling from SW to NE, one right behind the other. They appeared to be too close together to be a commercial airplane. There was NO noise coming from the craft as they sped quickly but steadily/smoothly away.Each of the objects were strobing lights of yellow , white and red, which was very vivid. The objects stayed one right behind the other with perfect formation and exact distance between the 3.Eventually, they made a turn from their original course and all banked due North towards Provincetown.I was describing the incident to my friend while I was speaking to her on the phone", "&quot;V&quot; Shaped Object.I saw lots of things since my childhood but yesterday was quite remarkable. I went to get my son in the South East of Ottawa and saw a big light, low above the city, lower than a jet a bit higher than a Cessna. I thought it was a star but when I parked my car, I then realized it was too low and moving in a up and down motion going toward NW. I watched it from my car trough small trees with my binocular, I did not get out of the car being in a parking lot, I did not want to get too much attention... After ten to 15 minutes my son arrived. I showed him the light and told him we would follow it. I was drawn by this thing. Needless to say that my son was too. I drove North, trying not to loose it. We got on Industrial blvd direction West , We could see it going lower and further away. We decided that the best lookout was the Rockcliffe (Higher point to look over Hull and Gatineau) one since this thing was going to cross the river. Trying to get there fast, we ended up wasting time trying to find a shortcut to get to the lookout. From the lookout, using binocular 35X 7-21, we watched it for at least ten minutes. It must have been around 10:30 at the time. The &quot;Light&quot; was over the city of Gatineau still moving in a NW direction. It was not perfectly round, it looked like a pinkish/orange crescent from where we were. We stayed there for about another ten minutes and we decided to pursue it . We got onto the Mc Donald Cartier bridge and followed the 50 direction Montr&eacute;al. We could not see it for a few minutes and then we realized it was gone. After a few minutes of driving on the 50, we saw (Not sure if this is the same light or if these were two different thing?!) a pale orange light low over Ottawa in a South East direction, kind of where we were standing before crossing the river!!! I decided to take blvd de l&apos;a&eacute;roport exit and drove south toward Maloney blvd. The light was getting bigger, coming toward us from Ottawa over the river. My son started to freak out, I did not since we were now heading toward the core of Gatineau. I turned on Maloney direction West and I could see it coming from the West now, heading toward us. I drove for a minute then got in a parking lot( Small Shopping Centre). The traffic on the road for that time was usual. I jumped out of the car and saw the big light turning bright white, as it got closer. There was a bigger light in the middle of two small lights, one on each side. No green or red lights like regular planes and no flashing light either. To add to the mystery, no noise at all. I don&apos;t know if it was the city noises burying it&apos;s sound but if a regular plane would have been there at the same place, we would have heard something !? We live close to the Ottawa Airport so we are very familiar with usual civil planes... It crossed the blvd going in a South East direction and as it turned it&apos;s side to cross over the street, my son kept yelling this is not a plane!  He was spooked! I was totally fascinated, I had my hair standing up all over my body and I taught it was wonderful, it (I know this will sound weird) seemed to change shape as it was crossing over the blvd, I could not see the shape very definitely but it was kind of weird, a red light appeared and we could see a small white light trailing this massive black shape unfolding in front of our eyes. I vaguely saw that it was very huge and still can&apos;t tell the exact shape of the side. It was so close that it seemed unreal to see this. It was, I think within one Km from us flying toward the ground, like in approach for landing. The only airport close by in this direction was the Museum of aviation on the other side of the river. I can&apos;t tell if it was really over it or not but it seemed really close. Then as it was now going toward the ground, it turned straight for us in a slow wide turn revealing it&apos;s top and then it&apos;s front. At that moment, I yelled too! This was no civil plane, no doubt, we saw a V shape. My legs began to soften as my brain was analyzing and concluding we might not be safe there... The V was flat and wide, and I could see on each branch a row of white lights. I can&apos;t really say how many, I think it was five or six on each side, they looked like fluorescent tubes side by side, except that these were separated so it looked like tiny rectangles aligned side by side in a black frame. I don&apos;t remember seeing the thickness of the shape, at that moment, I taught this might be what people call a &quot;Black Triangle&quot; Then it slowly continued it&apos;s turn toward west and we lost it because it was too low. I decided to get out of there. For a second, I did not believed, it was unreal and at the same time too real and way too close! As I drove West on Maloney, I think I saw it kind of hovering close to the ground near a wooded area in the back of a big Industry, aligned with Kettle Island and with the Museum of Aviation on the other side of the river. At that point, it was very overwhelming for both of us. I should have called the police, I know, but I was afraid to do so. We drove home in Ottawa South and did not see anything after that but planes. I wish I had a camera, this would have been a heck of a footage!  Thank you to the person for the report.

I was standing, facing away from the house, looking up at a &quot;star&quot; which I believed to be the planet Mars because it had a reddish tint to it. I was distracted by an object moving diagonally and downwards, coming in over the neighbor&apos;s roof to my left, possibly 1000 or so feet off the ground. At fisrt I thought it was a bat or some sort of bird. It was moving quite quickly and was about to go behind the tree in my backyard when I got a better look at it. The object was almost translucent. It looked as though it had the texture of smoke, or a cloud, yet it retained its shape perfectly, as it flew threw the air. I would define its shape as an arc, a sort of more rounded boomerang. The object then went behind the tree, and was temporarily out of view. I saw it come out the other side, only to change direction, and head in an almost downwardly only direction. I realized then, that what I was looking at was not a bird or bad or smoke or cloud or any terrestrial craft I have ever seen. Then the object simply disapeared. I was, and still am, in a heavy state of panic and awe. I was in tears at the overwhelming site of the unknown. (I&apos;m not crazy, it sounds weird, I know, but what would you do if you saw something you thought was from another world.) I will be deeply moved for the rest of my life. It should, however, be noted, that on this same day, I watched a special on TV with my housemate about UFO&apos;s, and have read numerous books about the subject. But, I had remained more of a skeptic on the subject, and have seen dozens of shows and documenteries and yet have never seen anything this remotely unexplainable. I had always figured that if I ever saw something out of the ordinary, it would be something similar to what I have been exposed to in films and television specials, and I would have doubts in my mind about the whole experience.

It was the Fouth of July 2002 and we where having a picnic with family friends, a lot of family. We were in Henryetta, Oklahoma in the country shooting off fireworks. We all looked up and the sky was full of stars moving in circles, and shooting from side to side, darting across the sky. Crazy! They would change direction in a moment. There where lots of them (don&apos;t know how many) everywhere. All of us just stood there watching. It was as thought they were giving us a 4 of July show. I really believe they where.

I play bass in a classic rock band, and had just left our studio when I saw what I thought was a small plane through the trees, over the east end of the Bay Bridge on Mobile Bay.  Just a couple of red and white lights. As I drove the approx. 3/4 mile to the bridge, I caught glimpses of it through the trees until I turned north on a parallel street to Hwy 98, expecting to get a good look at it. It wasn&apos;t there. Now, this is the weird part.

It was two concentric circles of round lights, the whole craft about the size of a nickel at arm&apos;s length, the outer ring was 7 or 8 red lights with an inner ring of 5 or 6 white lights, non-rotating, no movement, no sound. I lost sight of it for about 20 - 30 sec. turning west, then north coming up to the bridge, then I looked east down I-10 and it was almost out of sight, moving FAST toward Pensacola.  In 25 sec, it had traveled close to 8 miles, that works out to around 1,200 m.p.h.!  No small feat, and apparently no small plane either.&quot;", "When I was a kid, not unlike most, I enjoyed sleeping outdoors with my friends to watch shooting stars and satellites while gazing at the stars talking about whatever we talked about back then.  On this particular occasion my buddy ((name deleted)) and I were laying on our backs reclined in his parent&rsquo;s lawn chairs scanning the summer night sky for the usual targets as the full moon hung low to the north.  And, sure enough, by 2 or 3 in the morning we had spotted a couple shooting stars and at least one satellite. Soon after the satellite sighting one of us spotted what (at the time) appeared to be a very slow, low flying plane.  However, as we observed it we realized that it was somewhat unusual in that it wasn&rsquo;t making a sound on that calm, clear early morning and it was pulsating red, green, blue and yellow lights on and off.  Not flashing, but more of a fade in and out intermittently.  The blue would fade out and the yellow would fade in, for example.  I remember that we couldn&rsquo;t decide whether it was a small plane or a helicopter and we had plenty of time to discuss our thoughts on it, as it slowly passed. The plane flew over the practice football field behind Columbus High School while we watched from across the street. (I believe Columbus Drive).  It came in from the south heading north and then it must have moved slightly east/northeast after it passed by our location.  When it shifted east it just happened to go right over my parent&rsquo;s house and it seemed to stay at the same altitude throughout the entire time we observed it. Now, UFO&rsquo;s and flying saucers were not even part of our discussion until the object passed over my house and in front of the full moon.  Needless to say, we were astounded and exclaimed, &quot;Did you see what I saw!&quot; at the same time.  I pressed ((name deleted)) to go and get his Dad&rsquo;s camera.  Which he did, not before waking his parents to share the amazing news.  His parents were none to pleased to be disturbed and by the time he returned the object had disappeared behind trees in the distance. Well. We had the rest of the wee hours of the morning to compare notes and here&rsquo;s what we saw fly between us and the full moon.  The best way to describe it would be by comparing it to a coffee cup (minus the handle) placed upside down on top of it&rsquo;s upside down saucer plate.

The object was burning bright, orange, white with a dark edge along the bottom.  Very nearly stationary.  About 1/8&quot; at arm&apos;s length.  It faded away over 5 minutes, growing somewhat smaller, but not appreciably.  Most of the observation was through 8X binoculars.  I had the feeling it was initially 2 - 3 miles away.  The angle of elevation was a couple of degrees below the horizon and did not change during the sighting.  My position was approximately at 7300 feet.  I could see surface features in the background, probably 30 miles away.  (If it was not stationary, it would have had to have been traveling nearly directly away from me.)   It moved very slightly toward the west during the viewing.  It did not change shape.

It was definately too small to be an airplane at the low altitude it looked to be at, and what really caught my attention was how fast it was traveling and the fact that it changed position in the sky as it traveled through a low-hanging cloud, then dissapeared behind some trees (total viewing time was 2-4 seconds).  I drove up the block to see if it was maybe a plane, and I then I could explain what I saw but I was not able to view anything in the sky.  Another wierd aspect is the direction in which it was traveling, it traveled from east to west in a slight downward motion, I live about 20-25 miles northwest of the airport and we have planes travel over this area all the time, but I have never ever seen anything that looked like, or traveled like that in anyway. The next day, Saturday, I was telling my dad, who lives in the same area, what I had seen and he was totally shocked because he said that he actually seen something earlier that morning (Saturday) that was almost exactly what I had described...

These were clearly not airplanes or satellites. There appeared to be a glowing ball of light that was dropped from one of the UFOs. It made it halfway to the ground and disappeared behind the trees.

The date,as best as I can remember was early Aug. of 1975. I was 10 years old. This sighting occurred in my home town Hollis New Hampshire, which bordered the #1 city in the country to live in at the time, Nashaua N.H. Hollis sits a little higher in elevation than Nashaua which gave us a clear shot of the whole city of Nashaua including the municipal airport, and it was common to see planes take off and land at night. We must have been 4 miles away, I would quite frequently watch the planes as they made there approach to land, but this evening and the next several nights to follow changed me and are etched in my memory FOREVER...Nashaua sat southeast of our yard and at night the lights from the city cast a glow over it, above which was the glow from the setting sun and above that the dark of space. The planes were never very high, hardly ever over the glow of the city. And you could easily make out the strobe on them, they had a predictable path and were easy to identify. The objects we saw were coming in at a very high speed from the black of space, from out of the star field. They were circular luminescent spheres and seamed to arrive in two&apos;s or three&apos;s or more. They chased each other performing remarkable maneuvers, reversing direction at speeds that would have turned any human being into a puddle. Then all of a sudden they would take off in different directions at such a speed you could not track them with your eye. I ran inside and got my parents out to look, they were speechless. After a wile the neighbor kids saw us looking and came over, we all stood there staring not saying a word. Soon after the two younger neighbor boys arrived they bolted home and returned with there brother and parents in tow. Now there were 8 of us all looking at the same objects. To this day I have never seen anything like them. This continued for about a week, it eventually became almost normal to see them each night, and soon my interest waned and when I remembered to look again they were gone. I did watch them for at least 5 or 6 nights in a row.Thanks for all the excellent work you do Mr. Davenport I always look forward to hearing you on C2C &amp; Rense. And thanks to your WebMaster as well Mr. Stepien great site easy to nav. and well laid out.((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates both 1965 and 1975 as the year of the sighting.

Six of them were pretty close to each other, except for one light that was a bit further away. After about 20 seconds they all seemed to gain height, became smaller and eventually disappeared.

(NO OFFENSE)This posting is NOT to discuss anything which I saw. I am just curious on certain things with regards to UFOs and the Western country. Such points below links to one another, and worth considering. (No offense)  1. Why is the government keeping Area 51 so tightly enclosed and heavily guarded? What is in it that only the government knows but cant let the citizens or anyone else knows about it? That is something that only the western has it. Look at the Asian countries, do they have such thing? Nope!  2. Have anyone ever thought, why almost all UFOs sightings only occured in the western country and not elsewhere? There are so many other countries, vast lands, continents, etc... but why those objects lands only on western lands???  3. If one of your family members are captured at an enclosed area, would you go to that place to get him / her out? Would you try all means and ways to get your loved ones out? Would you fight to the best of your ability to free those who are captured? Imagine... 4. (Not referring to anything or anyone) Would a thief announces his stealings to everyone and wage a war with the authorities and people who goes against the idea of stealing? Or rather, would he use his stealings quietly to his advantage?  5. And if you have ever watched a sci-fi movie, how would the baddies use their stealings to their advantage? Hint: World Leader... 6.

I think I mentioned to you in my last communication with you that over the last few years we have experienced some pretty amazing sightings right from our back yard here in Saskatoon, but I never took the time to report them to anyone. After each experience, I always tend to think, well, that will be the last one we will every see, but it definitely isn&apos;t turning out that way. It seems myself, my family, are seeing way more than our fair share.  I do plan on sitting down and writing a report  of descriptions of what we have seen over the past few years, but for now, I thought I would send you a quick report of what we have seen over the last few days, with a couple of photos attached.On June 28th, my wife and I were sitting out on our back deck around 5:00 p.m. discussing our day when I noticed something in the sky to the east. From past experiences I have learned to always have a pair of binnoculars close by on the deck, and immediately grabbed them and focused in. I think my wife could see my jaw drop as I asked her to quickly run into the house and get a Christmas present she had gotten for me just for this purpose, binnoculars with a built in digital camera. While she was doing that, what I was focused in on was a series of bright white spheres, very high up, but yet very clear. I would say a series of 9 spheres that where joined to form a unbroken ring. I could even see the blue sky through the middle of the ring. The ring kept changing shape from almost a circle to oval and everything in between. I was stationary at first and then, the best way to describe it was, it just kept increasing in altitude until it disappered. Any ways it turns out that the batteries where dead in the binnoculars with the digital camera, so no photos of that one. Needless to say, we replaced the batteries.The very next day, at the same time of day, we where out on the deck again talking about the day before, both of us not expecting anything, but sure enough, as we were talking something out the corner of my eye caught my attention. In almost the exact same location as the day before. Again, grabbing my binnoculars (without the built in camera, that one is sitting on top of the fridge in the house, geez) I focused in on a single sphere, very metalic looking as you could see light refecting off of it. Moving very slowly towards us from the east, it was hard to tell if it was changing in size or just increasing in altitude. What ever it was doing, it was doing it every few seconds. Something I hadn&apos;t seen before was a strange haze or distortion of some kind around the object, almost making it blurry at times. Meanwhile, my wife had run in and got the binoculars with the camera and I managed to get a few photos which the best two are attached in this email. Although not very dramatic, I think they give you the idea of the shape and also the distortion around the object that becomes clearer when you enlarge the photos. Have a look and any comments would be valued. An interesting aspect of what we have been seeing here is that they are all in broad daylight.", "A number of witnesses reported the objet to have crashed or hit just South of Chehalis, however two reliable witnesses saw the same object, at the same time, cross from the West to the East, just North of Centralia...their impression was that it landed in the lake just north of Centralia and, thus, adjacet to my property....what would be nice to know is where did witnesses start to see the object to the South of them....Grand Mound?...the sonic boom was not heard by the two persons I spoke with, their impression was that it was a flare fired from about two hundred yards to their north....((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor.

There were four total. The brightest one was approximately the size of a pea held at arm&apos;s length and shown with a greenish, hazy light (approximately 2 or 3 times the brightness of Sirius -- without the haze surrounding the object, it would have been much brighter). Approximately half a degree to the right (SW) of the brightest object, two smaller, dimmer objects flew along side, one behind the other close enough that the second one seemed to fly inside the trail of the leading object. A fourth object flew to the left (NE) of the bright one; it was perhaps 4 standard magnitudes dimmer than the brightest. All four objects traveled at a uniform, unchanging speed relative both to the ground and to each other (they never changed formation), and all four left a long trail behind them (approximately 4 degrees long), narrow at the emission point and fanning out much as an aircraft contrail does. None of them blinked or winked in any fashion and burned steadily for their entire transit across the sky. Their speed was much slower than the standard streaking &quot;shooting star&quot; but still 300-500 mph faster than a typical high-altitude jet liner. As mentioned earlier, they made no noise. It is difficult to estimate altitude but I would guess it to be somewhere between 10,000 to 30,000 feet (but this is could be very wrong). They traveled approximately 20 degrees to the north of the zenith (they passed close to the two &quot;pointer&quot; stars of Ursa Major, through the &quot;bowl&quot; of Ursa Minor, through the coil of Draco, into Cygnus near the star Deneb, and into Delphinus before disappearing behind a hill).

As we parked on the North side of the street in front of a club whose name I don&apos;t remember a young man rushed out to us exclaiming &quot;do you see those UFO&apos;s&quot; or something to that effect. We all walked into the outdoor courtyard of this club and directly overhead was a small number (maybe 7 or 8) of &quot;points of light&quot;. I hesitate to think of this as a &quot;UFO&quot; sighting simply because I saw no &quot;objects&quot;. The points of light seemed to be white in color and very small, occupying perhaps the same minutes (or seconds) of angle as most stars. Yet they were clearly not stars as they were continuously moving in a sort of &quot;cluster&quot; and seemed to appear and disappear as though ascending and decending. During the encounter my girlfriend (who had lived in LA some years previously) kept shouting &quot;Those are birds!&quot;. After what may have been only a few seconds or as much as a minute the lights ceased to appear while one of them moved generally Westbound at what I perceived would have been a high rate of speed. Frankly I hesitate to clog the database with a &quot;sighting&quot; that is not particularly anomalous. Being nighttime I had no teresterial background to judge distance or size by. The points of light were very small and no detail of any &quot;structure&quot; or even &quot;reflective surface&quot; was visible. There were no attendant sounds that I heard. Given that LA has enormous &quot;light pollution&quot; I find the bird hypothesis likely (birds riding &quot;thermals&quot; could account for the twinkling in and out of the light sources) though I have never seen such a display before or since. I hesitate to think of myself as having had a UFO sighting simply because the experience was odd, but not that odd.

It was extremly bright and appeared to be emitting sparks or debris. Within a matter of seconds, the bright light flashed again and disappeared, leaving a vapor trail where it was shooting across the sky.  I thought about what this might have been for a few minutes and got on my cell phone to one of my work crew who was coming to work from the other direction on Grand.  As soon as he answered, we both started excitedly questioning and answering each other.  Another co-worker was in the car with him and saw it also.  They said at the time of the second flash they saw something that look like it was coming straight down like it was going to crash. When we got to work its all we could talk about.  We are sure it wasn&apos;t a shooting star and we&apos;ve never seen anything that looked like this before.

Last night I had my pen and paper ready to record the times of sightings. These UFOs have a pattern of some sort.If they are at a really high altitude they move as gold globes. They appear at a lower altitude as a white moving &quot;star&quot;. Then as they move they brighten and/or dim to gold or orange globes before they seem to vanish. A couple of times I have also seen after the &quot;star&quot; that they become spiky white light and as they move they start to strobe before they become the gold globe and disappear. The sightings last from 3 to 10 seconds and they cover about (approx) five miles, if they are low. The sky had clouds around the horizon. 10:30 globe appeared white just below and north of Leo in west sky, flared 3 times heading north,dimmed to gold  10:35 another one appeared from same place, flashed,strobed,as it flew into the horizon cloud heading north, appeared to be higher altitude from the first one  10:45 gold globe appeared from same place did not flare,headed north  10:55 another flared low in the west sky,dimmed as it headed north  11:00 another gold globe appeared coming from the south flying directly overhead under the big dipper heading north  11:01 white &quot;star&quot; big and bright as Jupiter appeared low in west and flew directly over my building heading east, I guess approx. under 20,000 ft,staying white  11:15 white globe heading south directly overhead. In south became spiky white light and I saw some color flashes,of red and blue, my view became obstructed. 11:20 gold globe flying by Jupiter heading north  11:40 gold globe changing to orange appeared flying south above Jupiter These sightings are silent, no apparent contrails or burn off. 11:45 a jet airliner flew west. This brought reality back as it made noise, was identifiable by flashing red and white lights surrounding a vehicle. I compared my sightings with the altitude and speed of this jet. The globes were way above and just below this height if the jet was at 20,000 ft. and they moved a little slower.

Eventually the light got bigger and we could tell it was coming towards us.  A Triangular craft with red and blue lights slowly passed over head.  It looked really strange.

It started as one object coming up the horizion from the east it split into two identacle objects an flew side by side with the distance of one craft between them into the west. From the eastern horizion to the western horizion it took 7 to 8 seconds.

One night a friend and I were sitting on the front deck, enjoying the cool breeze and our view of the ocean. The sky was fairly clear, with numerous stars and a few thin clouds. Several airplanes (both jet and prop) were visible as we talked. Suddenly we both saw a bright orange ball of light to our left, towards the fishing pier at Carolina Beach. The object appeared to be a considerable distance away, at least several miles off the coast. The object moved in a straight line and was extremely bright. It abruptly lost its brilliance and became a tiny point of light (which was still visible), and then several seconds later it regained its former brilliance before completely fading from sight. As my friend and I discussed what the object could have been, a few minutes later we saw a remarkably similar object (perhaps the same?) to our right - this time it was a little closer, and it behaved in the same manner as the first object. Finally, about five minutes or so later, we again saw a similar object - this time it was almost directly in front of us, higher above the horizon, and it was much closer - I would guess it was a mile or less off of the beach. It appeared to be simply a large, brilliantly lit orange ball of light. The object was in view for only a few seconds before it vanished. We did not see the object(s) at any other time that night. My friend and I considered our options - the objects couldn&apos;t have been lights from a ship as they were too far above the horizon. They could not have been fireworks or flares, as we saw nothing go up and the objects moved on a steady flight path - they didn&apos;t arc or go down. I have never seen a shooting star behave in such a manner. The objects might have been lights from one or more airplanes, except for the fact that the objects bore no resemblance to the numerous airplanes that we did see at night throughout our trip, and not one of the objects made any sound what! soever.I have considered the possibility that the objects were satellites reflecting the sun, except that we saw three lights in fairly rapid succession (fifteen minutes or less) in different parts of the sky. In short, my friend and I were both stumped, and I admit that on other nights we looked for similar lights, but with no luck. I seriously doubt that we saw something from &quot;outer space&quot;, but whatever these &quot;objects&quot; were remains a mystery to us.", "The object was directly over my car ,sitting still in the air and shining two white beams of light down on me.I was driving home just outside of the city on Lawrenceburg Rd.when I spotted a very big, very bright white light above the trees on top of the hill. It was sitting still and as I went around a curve I lost sight of it untill I came out of the curve on the other side. The object started to move slowly, then as it was going over my car it picked up speed and disappeared in a matter of seconds.I then turned off Lawrenceburg Rd. onto Brooks and started up the hill, as I came around the curve at the top of the hill a boomerang shaped object was sitting in the sky directly over my car shining two white lights down on me. It had red, blue and white lights all along the boomerang shape, some of them blinking and some not. It was big, I`m not sure how high but it was low enough for me to see that it was huge and what it looked like. I was very scared but it just sat ther and shined it`s lights on me untill I went under it and then I couldn`t see it anymore. I continued on and lost sight of it behind my car but as I turned right on Barth Rd. I saw two of the bright white objects, one on my left and the other coming around behind it. I stopped my car, got out and called my brother on my cell phone and told him what I was seeing. The objects started coming in closer so I got back into my car and drove to my house. They followed me. They then went over me again and went over the trees back toward Lawrenceburg Rd. but I could see them all the time except when they went behind a tree. They started going in a big circle from my house to Lawrenceburg Rd. back around to here continuing to circle slowly, at times speeding up and other times completely stopping, but continuing on in the same pattern for an about an hour, then they started to go in a bigger circle and I would lose sight of them but they allways came back around only getting closer to the house, going in bigger and bigger circles. Then one of them came around and it had a lot more lights and almost looked box shaped , going slowly and a litt! le lower than they had been before,it also had different shaped lights on the side almost like a quarter moon shape and they were white. It made the same circle and went out of sight. When they came back around, they started to get higher in the sky and then one stopped straight up from my house and the other was to the left of my house at about the same height. They just sat there for about 10 minutes and disappeared. It was overcast and cloudy, no stars or moon. It started to clear up a little and I could see some stars about 2:37 AM and then at 2:39 AM they just were gone.It was very quiet while this was happening, no dogs barking, hardly any noise at all.Occasionally I could hear sound from one but it was a muted hum not very loud and other times I heard nothing.

The object seemed like a aiplane 2 connected airplane wings with no body. There was no sound as it moved through the sky. I do not and still do not belive the existence of flying saucers however I do believe this to be an unidenfied flying object. There was no way anyone else would have noticed if they were not looking at the sky with particular attention to see something ie a shooting star, which I was.

My room-mate was asleep in the passenger seat, and as I start to crest the top of one of the hills, there on the side of the road is what would almost appear as someone sitting on a bike.  I honestly believe that it was not human, and it wasn&apos;t actually a bike.  It was sitting on a silver triangle shaped frame the point of the triangle pointing at the ground.  Honestly it was like no metal I have ever seen.  It had no wheels on it. (just a note I had my high beams on so we both got a really good look at it)  Whatever this thing was that was sitting on the bike was dressed entirely in this white/silverish material.  It had a full faced helmet on, but not like a motorcycle helmet.  It only had a small black oval at the eye area for it to see out of.  Neither of us saw any kind of skin what-so-ever. Every inch of it&apos;s body was covered.  Now it was a very hot night.  There is no way it was a person sitting on a bicycle completely covered including gloves and boots, it just doesn&apos;t make sense. It almost seems like the thing wanted us to see it.  You know when a car passes you at night and they have their bright lights on, you can&apos;t really see into the car.  But this thing, it was almost like in slow motion, looked right at us as we drove by.  I looked at my room-mated and asked her if she had seen it, and she replied that yes she had.  She had been dead asleep and woke up for some reason, just as we were passing this thing.  It scared me bad enought that I quickly rolled up my window and punched the gas.  I just knew that this thing was going to come up beside me on the road which thankfully it didn&apos;t. This triangle had no lights or reflectors on it of anykind.  We drove back by that area the next day to check it out.  And the place that we saw it was at the end of a dirt road that joins highway 64 with no houses around for at least 5 miles.  I know it was not some farmer sitting on the edge of the road on a bike at 3:30 in the morning in a silver outfit with matching boots, gloves, and helmet.", "At about 4am i was seated out in the balcony when i noticed the ufo.

I was 7 years old, my brother was 6 and my baby brother was 9 months old. My 14 year old cousin was babysitting us while my mother was out for the evening.  We lived off the lake in Wabasca, AB, Canada.  It was dark outside and I recall seeing many colorful lights hitting the inside of the trailer walls. I found that quite odd because from the direction of the lights, there was no street lights--just the lake and part of my grandmother&apos;s property.  This was a very secluded town, no street lights or airport.  I remember walking over to the window, at the same time I can hear a strange high/low noise.  It was getting louder and louder.  As I looked outside I couldn&apos;t see the stars. I saw a huge black circular craft hovering right above us, approximately 30 feet off the ground--tree top level.  The size of the craft covered my granmother&apos;s house and our trailer--and most of her land. As I looked up and saw the underside of the craft, I recall it being black on the under side--and the colors shining outward were coming from the edges of the craft.  My cousin screamed.  We all panicked and screamed and cried.  I recall the intense noise, it was ear piercing..nothing I did would block the sound that was hurting my ears.  My brother recalls vividly the trailer shaking violently.  He said that this is what scared him the most.  He recalls things falling off the table and shelves.  I recall my cousin running back and forth, and hearing my baby brother crying hard in his walker. I tried to block the sound with a pillow from the couch.  The next thing I recall is my cousin screaming for my brother.  I looked around for him and he was gone.  The trailer door was open.  I looked outside again and saw him standing right under it--in between my grandmother&apos;s home and our trailer.  He looked frozen.  My cousin was screaming his name--he didn&apos;t hear her.  The next thing I remember is sitting on the couch looking out the window--! this time the craft was hoving above the lake about 100 feet in front of my grandmothers property.  I can see it clearly.  It was saucer shaped with a belt of colored lights/rays circling the mid-section of the craft.  The lights were a rectangular shape and they circled in a slow/fast motion.  At the same time there were 3 white beams shining from the underside of the craft.  (at the age of 7 I thought it was landing on the lake).Moments later, my mother walked in.  I thought she saw the UFO and came home early--it was too early for her to be home, but it was the scheduled time she was to be home--approx. 10:30.  (I remember being confused because I thought time had sped up---for many years I thought this, until I learned about missing time.)  My cousin was curled up in a ball at the corner of the trailer and my mom was angry and said &apos;whats going on here?  Why is your baby brother crying so hard?&apos;.  She picked him up to console him, but as his scared cries started to slow down, he started to gasp for breathe.  My mom said &apos;whats wrong?, whats going on here?&apos;  We were all still crying and my baby brother&apos;s eyes rolled up and he had a major convultion.  He shook violently and his eyes were white, and we all screamed again.  We scared my mom and she kept calling out my baby brother&apos;s name.  Then he stopped breathing.  My mom cryed and I covered my head with my pillow.  She tried CPR and nothing happened and then my grandmother came over and she couldn&apos;t do anything.We all ran to my grandmother&apos;s house and they layed my baby brother on the kitchen table.  My aunt entered the room and she managed to revive him, but, she said that she first had to scoop out a thick white foam from his mouth.  Being a nurse, she said &apos;it wasn&apos;t the usual or typical foam that people have when they have convultions or seizures.&quot;.After nearly 5 minutes he was fine.  However he did suffer some minor brain damage due to the lack of oxygen to his brain. That night, he was admitted to the Slave Lake Hospital and the admission date was Oct. 7, 1979.  The explaination the doctor gave to my aunt was &apos;maybe he had a bad reaction to asprin&apos;.  Yet he was not sick and didn&apos;t have asprin that night.My cousin has no memory of the encounter, but remembers vividly the events of my brother&apos;s near death.  My brother recalls a few chopped things.After doing interviews with people from the area, I found out that there were over 50 people who witnessed this event--and the hundreds of other sightings and ufo landing spots.The RCMP were called out to my grandma&apos;s house and a train of vehicles followed. I tried to contact the RCMP and get information about this but no one responded to my call and email request.In the interviews I found there are hundreds of unreported sightings, experiences with other paranormal events (related and unrelated to UFO&apos;s and abductions), ufo landing spots.In fact, when I was 9 or 10 years old I remember walking through a field of high grass close the the edge of the lake.  I remember coming to a clearing of burned grass--in a perfect circle.  I remember saying &apos;wow, who did this? how did they burn it in a perfect circle?&apos;  I was told that a UFO landed there as well as dozens of other spots in the community--one being my great aunt&apos;s property.  A year later, I walked over the same spot and found the large dead area.  Nothing grew in that spot again. It was a dead area.  The other landing spots had the same dead spot.  There are still some of these landing spots today.", "Light to the far west of TucsonIf  you go to this site http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/05/11/mexico.ufos.ap/index.html this is what I seen from Ajo/Taylor to the west horizon.

I am driving southbound on Jester Blvd. towards Ranch Road 2222.  We had just left my friend Tony&apos;s house on Crab Tree Road.  I have made it about a quarter mile away from Tony&apos;s house.  I had the fog lights turned on because there was so much fog i could hardly see 30 feet in front of the car and I am driving very slow because of the weather conditions as well as the many deer out in that neighborhood.  Plus I am driving my room mates 2004 Nissan 350Z Roadster and I am very aware and careful when driving his car. I am heavily concentrating in the foggy road ahead then all of a sudden I see this green light right there in the fog in front of us in the sky.  it seemed to be about 50 to 100 feet high from the ground.  If I had to guess I would think it was about the size of a school bus. The object flew from the right to the left covering about 100 yards within 1 or 2 seconds, then it disappeared.  At that moment I was barely able to get the words out of my mouth to my friend &quot;What was that?&quot; and as he is saying &quot;Did you see that?&quot; the object appears again after it not being there for at least 3 seconds and it seemed as soon as it reappeared it shot upward into the sky at a left kind of angle, the same direction it just shot towards, but upward this time. I had two lady friends following us in their car riding together.  As soon as this happened I was concerned and pulled immediately over.  My friends pull up in their car next to me and I ask them &quot;Did you see that?&quot;   The passenger (Lisa) says &quot;That thing in the sky?  I thought I was just seeing things&quot;.  And the driver (Robin) says &quot;See what?&quot;  So I know that since Lisa saw it that there is no way it was a reflection, or anything we were able to comprehend.  We only stayed about long enough to pause for a moment and then we decided to go ahead and continue to head home.  I looked down at the radio and the time was 4:14 am.  I do not know what time it was prior to leaving, but I honestly do not think there was any missing time lapse. The more we spoke about it, the stranger it seemed.  I was driving a 2004 Nissan 350Z convertible and even though the top was up, we never heard a sound of a helicopter or a plane.  The headlights on the car are florescent lights and gives a good visual in the conditions we were in and there was nothing to justify what we saw. Grand-it was 4:14 am and you may be thinking what were we doing up so late, that we must have been drinking and just seeing things.  And I will admit we had been drinking earlier that night out at a bar, but had not had a drink for over 2 hours, since last call in Texas is 2 am.  I had had 3 beers all night long and was totally sober and the designated driver.  For the record. So anyway, Yesterday I was thinking still how strange this occurrence was and that I wanted to find out more.  I was thinking of calling my local Airport, but thought asking some desk clerk about a UFO she would think I was nuts.  So I got on the internet.  I came across www.ufocenter.com and thought this is who I need to contact and report this strange sighting. So I spoke with Peter Davenport on the phone.  He asked me to document this report and this is what I am doing.  Mr. Davenport took my report verbally and during the process he has pointed out some things that now has me a little worried.  I am referring to Sleep Paralysis.  Just last night, one day after this incident I had what I call a &quot;Sleep Paralysis Attack&quot;.  I will not get too into it, but it sure is strange timing.  I have these attacks maybe about once every year or year and a half since I was about 12 years old.  You can do a google.com search for sleep paralysis and read up more on it.  I did not have any visual during my attack. So in detail about the object in the sky.  I will describe this object in the sky that I can not identify as anything I have ever seen.  Like I mentioned earlier the soul foundation of the object appeared to be about the size of a school bus.  It was long and narrow.  It had this distinct green light glowing in the shape of a bus.  And underneath the largest green light I described was this thin green line the same width of the large object.  And to the right of the object was a orange or red colored ball of light.  It all happened so fast, but the bright light of the object in the sky burned the image in my head and I can recall it like I am just seeing it now. I will get my friends to try and give a statement of this occurrence as well.  I might be the only one out of us that is taking this so seriously, but I will try and get them to participate in anything you at the UFO Center need as well, because 3 out of the 4 of us were very fascinated and interested in what we saw.

As yet, I have not found anything that matches what I saw.I was sat in my living room playing on my games console when I saw a light in the sky out of the corner of my eye, I hit the pause button on my game and stared through the window at the lights in the sky.  There was a big oval ring of light with two smaller lights near it moving across the sky.  They were not round, but oval and not in perfect triangular formation.  They were very high up in the sky, higher than you would typically see planes and the jet stream from planes and it was very bright.  The lights were a white/light yellow colour - I couldn&apos;t work out whether there was a haze around the lights or whether the lights were that bright that it just looked like a haze.  The main ring of light was very large - I guess maybe 5 to 10 times larger than a medium sized plane.It all happened very quickly, but as I started to look at the lights they suddenly just sped off in to the distance very very quickly.  I don&apos;t believe there is anything that could travel that fast - there is no jet or missile that could travel that quickly. The whole thing lasted for no more than a couple of seconds.My logical brain quickly thought it might be a light reflection in the glass of the window pane or a new type of plane, but I could see it in the sky so I know it wasn&apos;t a reflection and this light was so big and so fast that there is no way it could be a plane.Before you ask, no I hadn&apos;t been drinking or taking any drugs. I don&apos;t know what I saw and I only wish I had evidence to show you. I have done a drawing (which is not my best subject) to give you an idea as to what it looked like.", "Triangular shaped craft brushes apple tree in Columbiana County, OhioIn the evening my father (a teacher &amp; community leader) and I were outside in the backyard.I was approximately 12 years old at the time. I am now a retired police sergeant. We heard a faint hum then out of a dense woods across the road. At tree level we saw an elongated triangular shaped craft. It was just above the tree lines and was moving South to North.  Dad and I watched as the craft, now silently glided directly over our yard and ourselves. The craft was so low that it brushed the top of an old apple tree in the backyard.The tree was probably a story and a half high.I will always recall looking up at the bottom of the craft. It looked like I was looking at the underside of the a nearby railroad bridge (girders, supports.)There also appeared to be a large square in the center of the craft. I am unsure if the square was a door(opned or closed) or a structure. The craft rose rapidly as it glided northbound then zipped outa sight to our east. The apple tree&apos;s leaves turned brown and curled up, like live brush exposed to a fire. The tree&apos;s interior subsequently dry rotted, the tree died and Dad had to cut it down. Dad and I discussed this event until his death August 2001. My children all heard their grandfather tell the same,unchanged facts about the event.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When I zoomed in on it it would move out of my camera sight...so I would have to go back to normal to have it come back into view.  After about 10 minutes it began to play with me....coming up close to my camera then dancing around and then going back high up into the sky.  Also, when traffic would come down the road it would stop playing with me and sit high up in the sky.  Every once in a while there were spurts of static on my camera outof no where.  I spent about 20 minutes filming (until my battery died - funny thing about it is when I began filming I had 43 minutes of battery life left).

LISBON (AFP) - The Portuguese airforce has been on alert since late Tuesday, when several authorities and witnesses reported seeing a luminous unidentified flying object.  AFP/File Photo    &quot;Military radar surveillance has been increased and F16 planes are ready for take-off,&quot; tabloid daily Correio da Manha reported Thursday.  It said the Portuguese civil protection service had received scores of calls from people who reported briefly seeing a silent, luminous object in the sky on Tuesday night, giving off white smoke.  Air force spokesman Colonel Carlos Barbosa confirmed to Lusa news agency that military radars had detected &quot;a target... that was not identified as a plane&quot; for two or three minutes.  The national air traffic control authority, Navegacao Aerea de Portugal (NAV), also confirmed a UFO had been spotted in the north and south of the country just before midnight on Tuesday.  &quot;The control tower in Oporto (north) detected a flying object which had been observed 25 minutes earlier in Montijo and Beja (south),&quot; NAV spokesman Paulo Lagarto said.  The authorities were unable to say what the mysterious object was.  But Jose Fernando Monteiro, a geology researcher at Lisbon&apos;s science university, said he had consulted US air defence officials and the UFO could not have been a meteorite.  If it had been a meteorite it would have travelled much faster and made a lot of noise, Monteiro told Correio da Manha and Lusa.  The European Space Agency said the UFO was not a falling satellite either and the Portuguese weather service said there was no meteorological explanation for the phenomenon.  The only person to come up with a possible explanation was astronomist Jose Matos, who said the UFO might have been an Iridium telecommunications satellite.  &quot;These satellites orbit at a height of about 780 kilometres (490 miles). They each have three antennae, which are polished like mirrors and reflect the light of the sun,&quot; he told the media.", "Intense bright flash of light lit up bedroom in Snohomish WAThis is probably not UFO related, but just in case there is a ufo sighting in our area we are sending it in.

The door way is exactly to the opposite of where my husband was standing.  The louvres were closed.  All of a sudden there was a tremendous bright white light that lit up the room like one of those old fashioned photograper flashes, but slower.  My first thought was it must be a large lightening bolt, but when we ran to the doors and opened them up there was a full moon and a clear sky.  Our enclosed backyard does not face anything that could have made such a light and we checked to make sure no one had broken into backyard through locked gates.  Maybe it was a meteor--unfortunately we didn&apos;t see the cause of the flash of light, but it must have been terribly bright to light the room up like it did.

Today, however, I saw a cylindrical object moving across the sky to my immediate west. At first I thought it was a jetliner, but several things about it stood out. First, it was headed north, which would eventually take it into the path of inbound traffic to FLL; secondly, I could not determine its altitude. It was also moving at a peculiar orientation, i.e., it appeared to be rising slightly but its nose seemed to be pitched slightly downward. Most significantly, I couldn&apos;t see any wings.

I noticed to my SouthWest a bright object and at first I thought nothing of it because I live near the airport. However I kept noticing that it would get really bright and then go dim to the point where I couldn&apos;t see it. I also noticed that it wasn&apos;t moving much. I was trying to be rational but when I went and grabbed my binoculars I saw something about this light that was pretty amazing ...I saw 6 or 7 small red balls of light shooting downward out of this light or whatever it was. I then remembered a UFO documentary that I saw one time but I can&apos;t remember which one but it was exactly like the video that I saw on that show. The video showed exactly the same thing I saw and I remember in that video there were several people watching and making comments as these red balls of light were dropping/ shooting out of this object. Of course I called several newstations and at the time I called they had no reports of this but I clearly saw the &quot;red balls&quot; of light dropping out of the light or object.((personal information deleted))", "UFO&apos;s filmed in moviesYou must have received thousands of reports of this event.  However, it seems I want to report it just in case.  While watching the movie JAWS, on Bravo TV over the last month there are two scenes wherein a UFO flies across the screen. Both are towards the end of them movie, right after the shark starts to attack the ship.  In the first scene, the sherrif is on the bow of the boat trying to get his gun out.  A bright object moves from right to left across the sky at a very high rate of speed.  It leaves a con trail.  When the scene is stopped, there is a bright object that can be seen.  It travels across most of the sky in about one second and disappears behiind the Brodie. In the next scene, the camera moves back showing the boat from a distance.  In this scene, the same type of object appears and moves across the sky from left to right and moves into the clouds.  Based upon the speed of these objects, it does not seem likely they are airplanes. Is it possible the entire world has seen film and documentation of UFO&apos;s by way of a very popular movie?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have seen both passages in JAWS.  The objects appear to be below a solid layer of overcast.

I complained that he always sees &quot;everything&quot; and went outside to let him explain where it was.  He described it as a tiny light, which looked like a star moving swiftly from west to east and disappearing from his view.  He pointed where it came from and then we gazed at the sky longer and I saw either the same or another one going from south to north.  It truly looked like a star flying because it was the same size as all the other stars.  But it just kept going in a long straight line until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  I went inside, having my curiosity satisfied.  He came in later and said he saw it again going from west to east.  It was absolutely not a plane.  It was far too high.  It wasn&apos;t in the usual paths of the planes which fly (very close) to our home and there&apos;s no way the aviation people would have allowed their paths to cross like that, being so close together.  They made no sound and left no trails that we could see.  There were no auxillary lights near them, as airplanes even flying very high, still have that flashing red or green on them in addition to the brighter white light.

As it traveled across our field of vision while we were facing east, it turned into two lights.  A plane headed north flew just a few feet from the object.  The object neither turned nor tried to avoid the plane, but the plane looked like it tried to avoid the object.  Then a third light appeared.

We looked to the north to see what looked at first like a bright blue firework (with trails) shooting straight into the air from ground level.  It kept getting higher and higher to the point we both realized it was not a firework.

My friend and I were sitting in her van in the left hand turn lane going from Northbound Beach Blvd. to Westbound Ellis Ave. waiting for the light to turn green. It was a clear day with no clouds in the sky, very bright, around 2:00 pm. I looked up in the sky to watch a bird fly across the street from my left (East) to my right (West), when I saw two objects high in the sky to the Northwest. They appeared to be giant balls of burning magnesium so bright that they made the rest of the sky seem suddenly dark. I would approximate their size as about the size of my house, but judging size in the sky is tricky to say the least. I would place their location over Terry Park in Huntington Beach, approximately a half mile above sea level. They remained motionless in position for about 30 seconds, the larger one on the left, and the smaller one on the right. Then I saw 2 helicopters rise toward them, a Huntington Beach Police Department helicopter and an Orange County News helicopter. My friend and I sat through the left hand turn light watching this, and I believe there were many people who witnessed this because no one honked at us to go when the light changed. I knew the light had changed because I could see in my peripherial vision the cars going Eastbound on Ellis and Southbound on Beach who would not have seen the objects because they were behind those cars. This is why I believe the sighting lasted one to two minutes, but I was so amazed by the objects that it seemed like an hour to me. The helicopters got approximately halfway to the objects, then the objects suddenly moved horizontally to the North and were gone in less than a second. As soon as I got home I called the Huntington Beach Police Station and asked what the helicopter had seen. I was told that no helicopter had been sent up that day. I called OCN (the news network) and asked what their helicopter had seen. I was told that their helicopters had not been over Huntington Beach that day. I asked my friend (now ex friend) to relate the story a few days later, and she denied having seen them or the helicopters, even though she was driving and sat through the turn signal to watch them.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I worked in a factory that was located by the airport in Toronto, and because the location was almost directly underneath the flight path for large planes that were landing. At night when they were close enough the lights were very bright, and that is what I thought I was observing on this night.

What I thought I saw was something entering our atmosphere(like a meteor that gets brighter as it burns up on entry), but what I saw was like the total opposite. Instead of getting brighter, it started to grow dimmer and smaller until it was the size of a star that you would see on any night.

I manged to snap one photo and went to take another when the bright orange object went out. In the second photo only the two smaller ones appear.

It was not a satellite nor a plane.  It was moving in a southwestern pattern.  It was also pulsating.  It would get bright, then very dim as if to almost disappear.  I thought maybe it was a satellite, but it was different.  As I continued to watch, I did in fact see a satellite cross, and this thing was definetly bigger and brighter and did not move in a very straight pattern like the satellite did.  I then began thinking it must be a plane, but it was way too high.  I then saw a plane float by and I realized it definetly was not a plane either.  The planes have the distinctive blue and red lights that alternate, and the moving thing did not.  It was also way higher than any plane can go.

We were facing south.  There was a garrage in fron of us and a pear tree behind.  North to South we had about 60 degrees of sky visable.  To the West and East most of the sky was visable.  Suddenly the stars disappeared.  There was no noise.  The hair on my neck stood up.  All I could yell was &quot;Did you see that?&quot;  My uncle and I compared observations, we had the same impressions.  What appeared to be a trianglar shaped, unlit, solid object had block out the stars, all of the stars.  The duration of the blockage was very short.  The object had to be large and very close to completely block out the stars (there was no noise) or massive!  I was about 12.  My uncle was about 30 years older.  We often spent hours night after night during the summer talking outside.  Never before or after seen such an object.

It was getting too late for the boys 9 and 12) to be out so we started packing up the telescope. Out of nowhere it seems(though I believe it flew from the north) this giant, swirling mass of light appeared in the sky. It was no particular shape, but was more like an egg in a frying pan, or an amoeba.  It changed its shape, and its size as well. It appeared to go farther away, then closer, then farther, this could explain the apparent size change. We watched it pulsing there for at least 30 minutes, my wife wanted to call the police but I assured her that it would not help. All of a sudden, the white, bright thing began to change colors, first to a reddish brown, then to a dark cobalt blue, and finally it culminated(and stayed) at a dark steel gray color, that was still as visible as the original object(for it shined so). This color transformation took perhaps 10 minutes. Then the craft began an ascent, higher and higher it went as it spiraled around, and then at the end of our time watching it, it came down, very, very quickly. It came so close to our house and the trees around us that the trees actually shook, and the grass waved. My kids were scared and I admit, I was also, my wife ran inside, and you could feel the heat from the thing. Then there was a sudden coolness, calmness, and just a general feeling of peace about the place as we watched it inch towards us. It took on a more readily noticeable shape, something like a circle, and shot into the sky, disappearing on its way up.

Those lights spin around to alert low-flying planes that there is a tower there. However, it quickly came to my attention that this light was not connected to a tower of any kind; it was in fact, floating freely. As we left inner-Batesville, heading up Ramsey Mountain to the South, I lost sight of it. However, as soon as we crested the hill, I re-acquired view of the object, only to learn that it was MUCH higher than I had previously thought. It was still very bright, and it pulsated in a very regular pattern. It reminded me of a heartbeat, it was so rhythmic. It would be interesting to see if anyone else has seen anything like this. For those interested, the object appeared to be no bigger than a medium orangeish-yellow dot. It reminded me of a radio tower light immediately, but like I said before, that wasn&apos;t anywhere near to the truth.

They could have been passenger jets or military craft, I couldn&apos;t say which though. While I was viewing the object, it seemed to stay in one place, moving very little; just pulsating like  crazy. I realized just how high it was when the clouds began to mess up my view of it.

These lights were brighter than conventional aircraft lights but were in perfect alignment with each other, floating in the air without any observed movement. Within 5 minutes, the lights in the string to the right began to go out, as if a dimmer switch was being used to slowly decrease the light until only darkness remained. There was no obvious logic to the sequence. A couple lights would diminish together and vanish, then a third, etc. Finally, the string of lights on the left began the same sequence. We rushed to get binaculars but saw no craft behind the lights. However, once all the lights were gone, we saw 2 helicopters fly into that zone and circle, as if searching for them.

She described the objects looking like a wheel with spokes that connected to a disc or sphere in the middle. The area between the spokes, or bars, was open space. The crafts, she said, rather looked like an old fashion horse drawn carriage wheel. They were completely still in the air in a vertical position. She noticed people out in the street where also looking up at these objects and other people becoming aware of what was going on since it was very early and people were leaving for work. She had been observing the objects for 15 minutes or so when two helicopters arrived. The choppers stayed hovering in place for a while, and then began moving closer to the objects. The crafts started tilting into a horizontal position and then slowly moved up and away from the area while gaining speed till they where no longer visible.

I should explain.  I went to a movie on the night my son saw the object.  When I made the report I looked up the date on my ticket stub then I submitted the report.  But then I looked at the data base and saw the report for Cotati on the next night.  Cotati is only 3 miles to the north of our house.  I  looked up the date my ticket purchase was recorded by the bank and it was ofcourse the next day.  However, if the date on the ticket stub is correct, the sighting must have been on the 30th.

But, it was moving too slowly for an airplane.  And, it did not have any of the warning lights common to an airplane.  The object moved very slowly from north to south.  It was moving in a straight and level manner.  It did not twist and turn at all.  As I watched, the object slowed down to almost a stop.  At that point, I was convinced it was not an airplane.

I was standing on the east side of 13 highway and it was on the west side.  It appeared to be less than one mile away and approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon.

It was NOT like any Conventional Aircraft Engine I have Heard..We could not Hear it off in the Distance as You can a Combustion Engine Approaching.. We Only Became aware of it Just BEFORE it Very slowly Passed Directly overhead..and for a short time after it continued down the Valley..I doubt if you were any distance away you would even be aware of it Flying Nearby..6. The Weather conditions were Good, No Rain, But VERY Dark, No Moon or Illumination..I could Not see any Lights on this Craft at all.7. We Both sensed that it was a Pretty Large Craft, just by the Sound of It passing overhead, You got the impression of something BIG..8. For some Reason we Both sat there afterward somewhat shocked,and had uneasy feelings of Vunerability..We Both immediately agreed that what ever flew over us was No Conventional Airplane and the Only thing that could Have Made those Sounds was some type of UFO..and still Believe so today..It was definately SOME TYPE of  Unconventional Flying Aircraft..

We were in Charing Park in the Craig Henry area of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The night was partly cloudy, mostly clear skies. We were facing directly at Jupiter, we had been viewing it with the telescope. I just now checked the evening sky map at skymaps.com and found Jupiter to have been due west of us. Earlier, I called the hotline to report our sighting, and I reported on the phone that the object was Northwest of us, but I did say that it was righ next to Jupiter. I correct myself here, for the record, it appeared just a few degrees South of due West. All three of us were facing the right direction, at the right time. I can&apos;t speak for the other two, but I&apos;m sure I was looking right at it the moment it appeared. It was a bright object, moving from South to North by Northwest OR from South to North with slight declination. It seemed to be moving in a slight arc, but that may have been an illusion created by its trajectory. It first appeared brighter and bigger by far than any of the stars in the sky. It appeared in the sky about as big as the eraser on the back of a pencil, held at arms length. We estimate that it was 30 to 45 degrees above the horizon, we all slightly disagree on this, but  I think it&apos;s a small enough range to consider it an accurate estimate. We all agreed that it travelled a handspan (at arms length) avross the sky, ending one fingers width south and two fingers widths below Jupiter. During this time it flared brightly three times, bright enough to illuminate a small portion of the clouds with each flare. I have been told that a bright flare from an object close above the clouds will light up a large area of cloudcover, but a bright flare from high altitudes will illuminate a smaller area in a &apos;beam&apos;. This was probably the latter. It did not die out in one of the flares. It appeared, in the first instant, a constant intensity, flared, returned to original intensity, flared brighter (I think), back to original intensity, had its third flare, then a distinct period of slightly lower intensity tham at the start, before vanishing without a trace. Two more observations that we made, but I think are suspect. We all thought it slowed down as it flared, BUT that could easily have been an illusion created by the flares. My other thought on that, and I&apos;m not educated in this, so don&apos;t take my word for it, but maybe if it was something breaking up in the atmosphere it actually would slow down with each flare. We also thought that it may have slightly changed trajectory, its angle descending slightly with each flare, but again, perhaps an illusion. In shape, I suppose one could call it a &quot;fireball&quot;. It had no tail, no debris could be seen coming off as it flared, but maybe if it had been daylight we would hae seen debris, or a tail. The colour, though, we had to discuss. After the event, we tried to note all the details right away, but none of us ever said &quot;What colour was it?&quot; So now, 3 hours later, I remember it being red and green, when it flared it was more red with yellow. The other two remember it as being blue/green and flaring just brighter blue/green. So this was all very exciting, seeing a &quot;UFO&quot;, filling out this report, talking to the guy at the UFO report center. But in the end, I really don&apos;t know what we saw. I&apos;ve seen pleanty of shooting stars in my life, and this was worlds apart from a shooting star. This moved way too slow, it was way too big, bright, and flashy!! On the other hand, I have no reason to thinks it&apos;s an &quot;unexplainable phenomena&quot; or a flying saucer. It made no maneuvers, no course change significant enough to be sure of, nothing to indicate that it was controlled. Though on a side note - if AVRO built an actual flying saucer that successfully lifted off, hovered and maneuvered a little then had a rough landing FIFTY YEARS AGO, imagine what 50 years of development would have done. SO I do believe in flying saucers, but not necessarily aliens. I&apos;m pretty sure that what we saw was not a flying saucer, but we did see something. It wasn&apos;t a shooting star, it wasn&apos;t an iridium satellite flare (which I just learned about at heavens-above.com). So what was it? I gave this organization permission to contact me, so if you have any suggestions, or if you witnessed the event, report it to this website and they can contact me. I&apos;d love to get a reasonable explanation. OH! I almost forgot! Two last details, there was no sound associated with the sighting, air traffic seemed heavy in the area in the hours before the sighting.", "Three round ivory-colored single objects and two groups of 5 objectsBetween 1:30 and 2:15 p.m. on February 1, 2004, my wife and I were in a national park in the northern part of Murfreesboro, TN.  We were watching more than 25 jets that either flew northward toward Nashville or flew from west to east above Nashville or south of Nashville, above the town of Murfreesboro.  These jets were at a high altitude and left contrails that changed the sky from clear and bright blue to an almost uniform white haze. During the 45 minutes that we watched the jets we saw (1) three different single objects and (2) two groups of 5 objects flying together but not in formation.  They remained in one place almost directly overhead, moved quickly from one part of the sky to another part of the sky, and disappeared and reappeared.  These objects were round and ivory-colored with a metallic appearance.  We did not see wings or evidence of propulsion, and we heard no sounds.  The objects were below the haze but seemed to be at a high altitude and small in size.  At any given time, the length of time that we could see the objects was about 1-3 minutes before they would disappear and then reappear in another part of the sky. During this time we also saw a free-floating mylar balloon floating high in the sky with the wind, small aircraft, jets in the pattern to land at or take off from the Nashville airport, birds, and the above-mentioned high-flying jets.  The ivory-colored objects did not resemble these other things and flew in different directions (including against the wind).  None of the aircraft in the sky turned to approach or avoid the objects. We doubt that these objects were very large white birds.  Our better guess is that they were some type of small remote-controlled flying objects.", "Bright light breaks up into three lights, which then fade.It was merely a light at first, but it was as bright as Jupiter. It didn&apos;t seem to move much. We watched it and after a few minutes, it became 3 lights, which seemed to slowly fade away. As it became harder to see, it still didn&apos;t move much. Minutes later, we thought we could still see something.

I can not describe the shape as a disk because it seemed to be more like two disks together one off set from the other, as if one were riding on the other. What startled me was how silent it was and that there were no lights. I always thought UFOs were lighted up and had a hum or something, but this object seemed to absorb the light, only reason I could really see it was the fact that the bottom was not smooth but had various shapes at various levels.I jumped up, scared at first then amazed and excited. I moved back into the wall of my house keeping my eyes on the object as it moved slowly (5 mph;a guess) out of my sight passed the roof of the neighbours house.

Roosevelt Mid-Hudson Bridge to Poughkeepsie, NY at about 9:15PM. As we wended our day at about 25 mph (speed limit) down the serpentine on-ramp from the toll booths, both bridge stanchions were visible directly ahead of us. For less than 30 seconds, they were blocked from view as the road took us through blasted out rock. When we took a left turn out of the rocks and onto the bridge, an immense object was directly ahead of us, hovering just above the bridge(less than 100 feet). Though no surface was visible on the object, it&apos;s outline was traced by thousands of multi-colored lights, many in motion. My friend and I simultaneously shouted, &quot;holy shit,&quot; as we drove across the span, which the bridge authority later told me was about 3,000 feet. Parked at our end of the bridge, it&apos;s length extended 2/3rds+ of the way across it, or approximately 2000 feet, and certainly no less than 1500. As we drove across the span, it was visible out of every window in the car for most of our crossing.  About halfway across, I rolled the window down and looked directly up at it, as my friend white-knuckled the steering wheel, repeatedly uttering, &quot;I&apos;m not stopping, I&apos;m not stopping.&quot; It was completely silent, and many of the lights underneath were apparently rotating around a central axis at speeds that were changing often. The strange thing is that they didn&apos;t appear to accelerate or decelerate, but were instantly going different speeds, like the speeds were quantized. Some of the lights were detached from the main object and rotating around the central point at some distance. A glowing spherical orb of an orangish color was about 25 feet from my head, just beyond the bridge girders, moving with us. About a half mile south of the bridge, a smaller lighted object was hovering above the river channel, which may have been the more commonly seen-then and there-chevron shaped UFO seen edge on. As we got across the bridge, to the top of the hill, at Market! street, I turned and saw that it was still there, in the same position it had been. Note that this immense object had to have silently moved out of nowhere to just above the bridge in the 30 seconds that it was not in our line of sight.The night of this sighting, the local radio stated that 1500 people reported seeing it, including numerous police, doctors and nurses at Vassar Hospital.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I would estimate the object to be travelling at an altitude of 2km with a rate of speed simillar to that of a small airplane.  The object made no sound, had no lights, and had no contrail.  It&apos;s colour was white-ish/ silver and the sun did reflect off of it.  This was observed under a blue sky with zero cloud cover and no wind.((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite?

I was concerned because he was gone a long time and rarely gets up in the middle of the night.  I had opened my eyes and was about to head downstairs when i saw a very bright flash coming through the small window above my head.  I waited to hear a car backing up as i assumed it had driven in our driveway.  There was NO NOISE and it was eerily quiet.  I instinctively looked at the clock which read 2:40 am which is very out of character for me.  IN my head i heard that its important to note the time.  Then i started getting worried because i thought of an alien ship and my boyfriends previous encounters with things unexplained.  So i raced downstairs half expecting him not to be there.  He was at the foot of the stairs which made me jump.  I asked him if he saw the light and he said yes. Then we both heard a rumble and he exclaimed that it was probably thunder and lightening. I didn&apos;t believe that it was lightening since it was too bright.  Intuitively i felt that it was much more than a meteor when i heard about it the next day.

I did call him the next evening and took the report which is below. The man told me that he is the type of fellow who watches the night sky as he has a really interest in astronomy and mentioned that he also had found me through the Jeff Rense website. The fellow went outside to have a cigarette when he first saw the light/object. At first the man thought it was a satellite. The object was as bright as the planet Venus and heading in a northerly direction traveling from the south on a straight line. As the object moved across the sky another two lights/objects shot out of it, one light heading to the east and the other towards the west. Both of the lights that shot off together went at the exact same time. Also they were not as bright and allot smaller than the main light. The main light never lost it&apos;s brightness as it moved across the sky. The witness believes the object he was observing was at a very high altitude. The object was visible to the fellow for approx: 30 to 40 seconds before it finally disappeared. All of the object were white in color and no tail or trail was seen following behind each of them.

I was assigned to maintain and operate a small 24 hour diesel power house at this very powerfull search radar site called Yoza Dake Air Station. We were loacted at the southern tip of the island and there was a Army Hawk missle site near us. One night me and a co-worker were coming out of a NCO club that was our late night mess hall as the regular mess hall closed at 7 pm. We had a Okinawan waitress that came out side with us as she was beginning to clean up the NCO club and she was coming out to get a mop bucket and a mop as she did almost every night. When we came out of the door she shouted out in Japanese ..OH My God. (OK Sami Yo).. and she ran back inside the NCO cluub. We were very astonished ourselves in the very large red/orange colored light that appeared at 25 -30 degrees above the horizon on the eastern side of the mountain top. We asked each other what could this light be from as it was not usual to see any light on the east side of the mountain as the Naha Airbase has a glide path on the west side of the island and our radar site. We asked each other who had a camera in the barracks which was only about 50 meters away. My friend ran to get his 35 mm camera and I stayed and observed this light alone for about 5 or 10 minutes. The weather was pretty humid and there was a slight misty rain earlier, but it was not raining when we saw this huge bright light. While I was waiting for him to come out of the barracks I was walking towards the rear door of the barracks and watching this light which is very bright. The intensity of the light seemed to stay steady. and it did not move at all and then it suddenly disappeared befor my co-worker came out of the door with his camera. We asked our radar observers that was on duty that night in the block house if they saw any boogies on the radar screens that night and they said no. But later after many questions some did admit the radar observers were! tracking this and some other boogies. Later after this incident one of the senior radar observers said they have logged many unknown boogies there over the years in a daily log book. We both talked about this openly with the 80 plus  staff on the radar site and some were open to discussions but most said they could not discuss these boogies as they were instructed by their officers to remain quiet about boogies. A very well known radio personally who was in the Air Force then was also there at this time. He was moonlighting as a DJ at a local NAHA radio station there that we all listened too called KSBK. He is the host of After Dark on the weekends now. I remeber there was newspaper articles in the local dailies as this light or lights were observed in many places that night and it scared alot of people. The KSBK radio station had radio news stories about this light that same night as we went back to barracks and listen to the DJ as the station received alot of call in reports. I visited the KSBK radio station during my 18 month stay there and I was able to meet the current weekend host of After Dark.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

It happened one morning on the way to work when I was driving I noticed a reflection from something in the sky that caught my attention. As I observed it closer I noticed it was a metallic sphere of some sort which was absolutely dead still in the sky it didn&apos;t move whatsoever. I only saw this object for like 1 min at least, it was difficult keeping on eye on it as I was driving, but I looked back up again to where I had saw it and it had vanished from sight. After I had noticed it had vanished I saw what I believe was a kind of haze or even a heat wave left in the sky. It seemed at first like it had left really quickley and left a mark in the sky, but I had come to the conclusion that it might well of become invisible or even transparent. I know what I saw wasn&apos;t a plane or a blimp, all I know was it left very quickly almost like it had sensed it had been seen.

I&apos;ve been seeing lights appear and disappear over Seymour Mtn. nearly every night so last night right after sunset aimed my camera over there. Just got it set up when I saw a large streak of what looked like fire appear in the sky over Grouse Mtn. It was about twice the height of Grouse and I didn&apos;t see any object at the head of it. Just a bright yellow streak of what looked like fire with drips coming off the bottom of the flames. Can&apos;t think of proper way to describe it. Sort of like throwing burning gasoline. Appeared just above summit and disappeared above the bottom of the ski run. Time was 21:30 still quite a bit of light in the sky. 21:52 - Camera picked up a white light moving east just over Seymour, I assumed it was a small plane but was unable to see it with either pair of binoculars. I zoomed in with the camera but was unable to see any fuselage behind the light even though it was still fairly light and I should have been able to see something. 22:03 - Camera picked up what appeared to be a similar light approaching  Seymour Mtn. light stopped just above the summit. Unable to see it through binoculars. I zoomed in with the camera and it looked like those other mysterious lights. Object began moving slowly eastward just above mountains in half and hour it was over Indian Arm and at one hour over Heritage Mountain north of Port Moody. I stopped tracking at that point. 02:00 - Was just scanning the sky with the camera, came across what looked like three stars in perfect triangle all equal in size and brightness. I tried zooming in on each of them and they all appeared to look like luminous slowly pulsing pearls, quite pretty actually. They didn&apos;t appear to be very far away as they filled the screen right away while the starts around them were hardly magnified at all. I don&apos;t know if they were connected to anything as I couldn&apos;t see anything except blackness around them. I could see faint stars all around but nothing showed between them. They were about 80 degrees overhead and just slightly to the NW of my location. Was looking at a star chart and Virgo looks somewhat similar but does not appear to be quite the same shape.

As I approached the Rockfield Elementary School area I noticed a glowing yellow-white oval shape ahead of me. I judged it to be close to the Natcher Parkway overpass (approx.6 miles ahead) and about the size of my thumb with my arm stretched out in front of me.

Suddenly, the oval light changed into 5 separate white lights! They were in the formation of a triangle. It was very odd in that it wasn&apos;t a flat triangle. There were three lights forming the bottom base, a light at the top point, and the fifth was on the right side of the triangle closer to the base. It moved upright.

I leaned against the railing and set my coffee down and begain to scan the horizion from port to starboard, ( no waves, just flat smooth water as far as the eye can see) At that elevation of almost 180&apos; off the water viewing distance is about 20 miles on a clear night.As I look from starboard back to port along the horizion line, out I would have to guess at about 8 miles was what looked like the reflection of the moon on the water but it looked kinda funny, so i pick up the binoculars and focused in on it.what I saw was what appeared to be a bright light but under the water! I then walked over to the ships squak box(inter ship radio)hit the switch, leaned in and said ..Con sigs ! a second later a voice cracked back Con I, I said Con I have a contact baring 210 off the port beam, can you confirm ? The voice said stand by sigs.sigs..Con ! I said Sigs I Sigs we have negative sonar contact ..do you have visual? my reply was afirmitive Con I have visual! The reply was stand-by Sigs ! I turned picked up my coffee and heard footsteps behind me from the ladder leading up from the bridge. Within 10 minutes, I had the captian,the XO, the flight boss and what had to be 8 or 10 officers from IOIC ( ships Intel.) All on my bridge. For the next 20 minutes we all watched as this thing moved back and forth across the bow of the ship at what had to be from 60 up to over 100 miles an hour cutting a zig zag pattern back and forth in front of the ship all this under water! at one point it stopped directly in our path and allowed us to come within about 4 miles of it. Suddenly it pulled away like we were parked and disapeared into the depths. Standing in the background behind all these officers I kinda felt out of place, so I retreated to the signal shack sat down at the desk and begain to fill out my log on the preseding events. Just as I was finishing up my report,a Lt.stepped into the doorway of the compartment and said the XO would like to see you.. and bring your log ! As I followed him down the ladder I was thinking I&apos;m in trouble for something! He opened the door to the captains quarters and in the room were no less then 6 officers. The look on there faces was not good. The first to speak was a comander I did not recognize. his words seemed funny to me in the context of what had just happened. He said ...What do you think you saw this evening ? my responce was..I have no Idea sir ! He said.. Well these events are currently under investigation by the navy and you are hear-by ordered not to speak of these events to anyone, not to your section chief, your division leaders not even to your buddies.. do you understand ? I said what events sir ?.... He looked at me with a very serious look and said ..very well you may leave your log on the desk on the way out, your dismissed I said.. yes sir! turned and stepped out into the hallway as the door closed behind me. I took two or three steps stopped and put my back to the wall and just slid to the deck. A Lt. stepped out of the room and I jumped to attention and stood there in front of him, he said all inquiries concerning your log are to be fowarded to the XO&apos;s office , Is that understood !

The report read that the person saw a large rectangular craft.......had a starry looking underside and so on.well this really blew me away because in Oct. of 1990 I saw something that was very similiar. I was living in Ripley Tn at the time. My dog woke me up about 1:00 a.m. barking his head off. Thinking that maybe something was wrong with my horses I grabbed a flashlight and went outside to investigate. Seeing that the horses were fine, I found the dog barking in the back yard and looking up. At the time I didn&apos;t think to look up, but did hear a low hum like you&apos;d hear from power lines only a bit deeper and louder. I got the dog around to the front yard and sat on the front porch steps to have a cig.Anyway I looked up to the sky since it was a clear and starry night and noticed a huge patch of stars that seemed to be very close.(meanwhile the dog is still whining and distressed and I keep hearing this low humming noise) all of a sudden this patch of stars starts moving and then I could see this huge rectangular outline ariund the whole thing. It must have been the lenth of at least 2 football fields and was at least as 3/4 the width of a football field. To tell the truth I was pretty shaken at this point but I couldn&apos;t move...... this thing wasn&apos;t that high only ,maybe 300 feet. Then it started sorta of floating to the South towards Memphis. It seemed to have come from the North. The humming stopped,a few of the star like lights flashed and it just moved on. I had never seen anything like this in my life.Finally when it was out of sight I went back inside and my daughter who was 12 at the time yelled out Mom, why were you out so long? I just told her at the time I was checking the horses. I can tell you this....I laid awake a long time that night pondering all this and the next morning felt sort of addled but I know what I saw and have never forgot it.

My report concerns a sighting by a very close long-time friend of my family whom we regard as a very honest and trustworthy person who lives outside of Scottsville, Kentucky.  She told the following story to my late Grandmother only because she trusted her, and she truly believed that nobody else would believe her fantastic story.  My Grandmother told me the story a little later on.  I, as a person who has witnessed a UFO up close before, did believe her story.  I cannot be sure about the exact date of her sighting, but I do know that it was sometime around the middle of the 1990&apos;s.  So I used the date of 1994 to be as close to the accurate date as possible.  This lady who saw the object lives directly beside my late Grandmother&apos;s residence in Scottsville.  Anyway, as she told it she was driving to work early one morning from her home in Scottsville to her job in Franklin, Kentucky.  Her travel route takes her from the old White Plains road exit in Scottsville that leads directly into Franklin about twenty-four miles away.  She works in a medical facility there.  Shortly after she has crossed the Allen County line into Simpson County she said that she looked ahead of her through her automobile windshield and noticed something rather odd.  It seemed that something was sitting out in the middle of the road directly in front of her line of sight.  After slowing her automobile down she finally saw that the object was indeed a perfectly shaped disk, and it was hovering directly over the road ahead of her.  The disk was hovering low to the ground and was very silent-no noise at all.  Being alone, she did not want to stop and investigate, so she just kept driving slowly and passed directly underneath the disk.  The lady said that as she drove underneath the object she looked up at it and saw that is was definately a disk and somewhat large.  We did believe her story because I can tell you for a fact that she is a lady of honesty and integrity as was stated above.  There is absolutely no way that she would ever make up a story such as this.

Hovering over wooded areaSome brief but much needed history behind this sighting is needed before writing this report to you.  My wife is as un-likely a person, in my mind, to discuss UFO sightings as I&apos;ve ever met.  We were sitting on our back deck just talking about our work days the night before when we stumbled upon a dual sighting, hers much better than mine but ironic to say the least. I am a veteran ((law enforcement officer in Lake County, Ohio)) (20 miles east of Cleveland on Lake Erie)and in good standing within.  I&apos;ll tell you the story in a chronlogical order as it occurred to me and how it unfoled to me as well.  To begin, this is not the first sighting I&apos;ve had but the first in which my wife and I saw something together. We were apart when it occurred and we did not have the opportunity to talk about it when it happened. This is, however, my first report I&apos;ve ever filed with any agency. I signed up to work a side job for the ((deleted--local community)) and was waiting for the rest of the bingo crowd to arrive. I was in the parking lot waiting to direct the patrons into their spots when there was a lull in the traffic coming in.  As you probably know, there has been some pretty violent weather in the area and I was checking a storm that had blown over (approx. 1745 hrs).  I first saw a very normal jetliner cruising through the sky at normal height and speed when I saw an object not familiar to me.  I&apos;ve seen satellites, helicopters, small planes, big planes and weather balloons due to the fact we live 25 miles from Hopkins Airport and have three smaller air fields in our patrol zone as well as a nuclear plant 10 miles away (busy with with activity).  I followed the plane for about 15 seconds and lost sight of it after it flew over a cloud deck.   I continued to check out the sky to see if threatening weather may be on the way.  I then saw this object in the sky that was much higher than the plane I&apos;d just seen. The speed was unreal compared to the speed of the plane lower in the sky.  I picked it up much further to the east that I&apos;d seen the plane just seconds prior.  At first, I thought it was a satellite because of the small overall look it had and incredible speed it appeared to be cruising at. I then realized that it should have been difficult to see a satellite with it being daylight.  After just a second or two, it appeared to get bigger but I realized it was getting closer.  I saw what appeared to be a triangle object that was still far away...probably at 10,000 feet, but it was oddly shaped and had no wings or tail.  It looked to be about the size of my thumbnail in the sky. I dismissed it, as I have in the past, and just wondered as to its origin.  My day ended with nothing else worth noting. That brings me to my wife and I talking on the deck.  She and I were just talking about everyday things and our work days the day before, I never talk to her about UFO&apos;s and the like and had pretty much forgotten about my &quot;sighting.&quot;  My wife then said something about her needing to call me at 1645hrs the day I worked the bingo detail but she didn&apos;t because I was probably enroute to the location or already in the armory (location of the bingo game) where my cell phone gets no reception.  My wife then told me what happened and said she was driving east on I-90 eastbound between SR 91 and SR 306 and said, &quot; I saw a triangle thing in the sky, I was so scared cause it looked like it was watching something.&quot;  I asked her what she meant and had still forgotten about what I&apos;d seen and expected a normal explanation from her. My wife proceeded to tell me that the &apos;thing&apos; was hovering and not moving.  She said that the &apos;thing&apos; made no sound and didn&apos;t even bounce in the sky.  I asked her if it could of been one of those self-made gliders moving real slow like they do and she became adamant that this thing was &quot;HUGE, no way.&quot;  I realized at this point that she didn&apos;t have a clue what she was describing in respect to the relevance to UFO reporting. She&apos;s never heard of the triangle phenomena or even the UFO research being conducted. It was like asking an innocent kid about seeing a crime or describing their first home run....it was completely honest and very compelling.  I then recalled what I had seen but didn&apos;t tell her because she gets really freaked out about these types of things, you&apos;d see if you ever spoke to her. I then asked her if she could tell how close it was to the ground. I figured she&apos;d give me an airplane type altitude.  She looked at one of the trees in our neighborhood and said &quot;about 100 feet above that tree.&quot;  I then became very curious but skeptical about her sighting and asked her if she was sure it wasn&apos;t a plane or something else she&apos;d seen before.  I know my wife and it was clear that she was freaked out because she had went to work and told her friends she thought something was going on with &quot;911&quot; and we were being watched.  I told her that I would have been the first to know being that I&apos;m in law enforcement and being next to an international airport and nuclear plant (at least I&apos;d like to think so).  My wife then told me that she thought it was a plane but she couldn&apos;t believe it was a plane because it just stood still in the air.  She said that she had to stop looking at it because, as she kept driving, she was losing her field of vision at it, and thought she might wreck if she kept trying to watch it as she kept driving.  She said she saw it over a very thick wooded area and thought it was looking at something.  We live only 5 miles from that location. She then arrived at work and her sighting ended.  She described the object as being a triangle with no wings and no tail.  She said it was a darker grey shape with no lights or no other markings worth noting.  Anyway, our story and wherabouts can be easily verified as well as her telling her co-employees about it and our wierd way we came about this story.

I had stopped to watch a developing funnel cloud (somewhere near Omaha) from a safe distance when this object caught my eye to my left. It was round and somewhat cone shaped and appeared to spin. It looked metallic because even though it was overcast, it did produce a glare. The bottom portion of the object looked to be red in color, but I saw no lights of any sorts. At first I thought it might be a meteorological device that scientists use to actually get into the eye of a tornado. They are similar in shape and usually painted red and often are lifted and thrown great distances to later be picked up and studied.  As I realized it was headed my way, I also realized that this was much too big to be such a device.  This thing was at least 20ft in diameter or more and moving in a controlled manner.  At that time I lifted my camera and took two photos before the object stopped for two seconds, hovered, and shot vertically at a very high rate of speed. Then it was gone.

I wonder if anyone else has seen a similar thing. We live in a house at 1,400 ft elevation that sees clear across the Valley, and often watch the city lights and night sky. As usual, before going to bed, I took one last glance out the window southwest toward Phoenix. There I noticed two bright, orange-hued lights that appeared to be above or past (to the south) South Mountain. I assumed they were on a landing pattern (one behind the other) to Sky Harbor Airport and the orange tinge was due to haze in the air and the angle I was seeing them from. There is always alot of air traffic and though this approach was unusual (for me) to see, an approaching aircraft made sense. They were very bright, though. Then all of a sudden there appeared four, then six. All bunched together (extending my arm they covered the width of about one, maybe two fingers) but not in any perfect geometric formation (at least from my angle.) I thought this had to because the glass in the window was making them appear double or triple. I got my wife on her feet and out we went to see them outisde. There they were, at least six of them (maybe 7 or 8). Very bright, quite orange. They almost seemed to be dancing (this could have been because of refraction due to the heat). Their height was about the same as the radio towers on South Mountain but they were more to the east of them. I got the sense they were over the valley to the south. Then, just as suddenly as they appeared, they one by one disappeared, all in about 10 seconds. It was as if they went below or past the horizon of the mountain, but it&apos;s odd to have so crisp a departure from such a distance (South mountain is about 20 miles away.) Maybe this was due to their brightness. I have seen other objects and lights I&apos;ve wondered about from time to time over/beyond South Mountain but this multiplication, and abrupt departure was unlike anything. Maybe military formation? If they were commercial aircraft why did they appear so suddenly as a group and leave as quickly? Also, usually when I see commercial aircraft that appear orange it! is only from a great distance (or dust storm, smoke from fires, etc.) and they are dull and not nearly so bright.

My energy was especially intense so it seemed like the mountain top was a good place to go to campout, meditate and relax. The weather was beautiful and there was not a cloud in the sky. A handful of early arrivals and people who lived there gathered on the porch of the main house by the trees. We played music and sang as the sun set and the stars began to appear. Then something happened that was the most unusual thing that I have ever seen. A phenomenal bright light appeared over the tree tops between the garden and the house.  Amazed and curious, I walked out from under the porch and trees to get a better look.&quot;Look at that light!&quot; I exclaimed to the others as they began to notice it too.It was awesome!  We found ourselves looking at a huge, round, pure, white light as big as a mansion, hovering over the retreat.  One of the men who lived there grew afraid and went into his house.  I was feeling so euphoric that nothing could have frightened me.The rest of us watched silently or whispered comments to each other.  There were no other sounds; no breeze; nothing but the white light against a dark sky.I made it a point to remember this moment in every detail.At first the light was very close, just above the tree tops, but gradually it began to expand and move up and across the horizon toward the west.  I could see was no spacecraft. It was just &lsquo;light&rsquo; which began to fade in brilliance as it expanded.  Gradually the &lsquo;light&rsquo; individuated.  Where once was a solid &lsquo;light&rsquo;, millions of individual &lsquo;lights&rsquo; became distinct. They covered a full quarter of the sky. The lights got farther and farther away until they faded out of sight.Aside from a few comments by the others who were watching, there were no other sounds. Neither the sound of a breeze blowing across the sky nor the rustling of leaves could be heard, for there was no wind. I saw no clouds in the sky and the moon was not yet up.

I was outside with a friend at night in a sidewalk cafe in Los Angeles. I was looking at the stars and noticed that there were more than usual.

I yelled, &quot;Look at these!!&quot; and that&apos;s when the sidewalk was invaded by men dressed in black, with guns coming from everywhere. They were herding us all together and there were hundreds of people now on the street, screaming. Then something odd happened; they were shouting orders and threatening to &quot;put a button in everyone&apos;s neck&quot; but the man in charge was looking straight at me. I was freaked!  He should have known that I already had one, but he shot this gun at me that didn&apos;t have bullets; it had some type of electrical-tingly sensation instead...not pain...but it most definitely got me to stop in my tracks and pay attention!

Witnesses say they saw a large, fiery object zigzagging through the sky at about 5:30pm yesterday. The witnesses say the object left a trail of thick smoke and then they heard a bang. The observatory says it appears the object was travelling somewhere between Perth and Albany in a south-south easterly direction. Walpole resident Heather Burton was in her backyard when she saw the object. She says it was unlike a normal shooting star. &quot;A shooting star usually just goes straight across or straight down - this one had these gradual zigzags just coming down,&quot; she said.

Dr Bevan says it will be difficult to find where the meteorite landed. &quot;Unfortunately there doesn&apos;t seem to be as many observations, so actually pinning down where the object landed might be a bit difficult and in that area, the vegetation might mean searching for it would be difficult,&quot; he said.", "2 or 3 objects flashing  lights that were red,blue,and white.The objects might have landed.My aunt and I were looking at Venus, when suddenly my aunt saw a red,blue,and white flashing object appear from nowhere.It seemed to have come from Venus.It also seemed like it was conjoined with a second object just like it.The object went North then did a zig-zagged pattern from North to South.It then headed North again.Trees were blocking our view so i went to the East where the object kept moving North.As i was watching my aunt saw a second object come from Venus again.It looked the same.It took the same direction as the first one.Since the trees were again blocking our view,we moved East.The first object descended somewhere to the North of us while the second one headed West and descended also.There was no vapor or jet stream from either objects.The objects made no sound.The sky was free of clouds.We do have a airport,but it is to the South of us.Also the towns to the North and West of us are rather small and do not have a airport.We are not sure how far it was from us,but we think it both objects landed either in town or the outskirts of town.One of my aunt&apos;s friends saw  a disk shaped craft 6/16/04.He lives in Ames also.", "String red lights , moving rapdly upw and away; turned off, didn&apos;t fade away.

It was way off. I was on the east side of Albuquerque, and this thing looked to be to the extreme west, southwest end of Albuquerque, or even possibly a little farther out over the mountains. It was maybe 10,000 feet up. I regularly observe Venus, and Mars, and know exactly what both look like, and where to find them in the sky. This object was way brighter than Venus, or any star, and it was still broad daylight. I stopped passing the ball and just stared at it. One of the kids (ab out 10 years old) asked what I was looking at, and I said I didn&apos;t know. The kid laughed and said it was a UFO. I ruled out a Hot Air Baloon, Venus, a helicopter, and it obviously wasn&apos;t a plane because this object hovered there for more than an hour and a half. I should note that it&apos;s position in reference to Earth never changed. During this 100 minutes, any celestial object would have disappeared over the horizon, but this one remained at the same relative position over the horizon the whole time. After we finished playing catch, me and my son drove down to Target, still watching this object hovering in the same spot. By this time I was fairly sure it was a UFO. Now here&apos;s how I know this wasn&apos;t venus, because if you do your homework, you&apos;ll probably conclude that I was looking at Venus, especially as bright as it is right now, but this was August of 2003. Venus wasn&apos;t unusually bright then, like it is now. This is how I judged how far off and how high it was. Because as the Sun went down over the western horizon, and the western sky turned red, this object also went from glowing a bright white, to turning red as the sky turned red. And when the sky went from red to dark, the object went from reddish, to disappearing in the darkness. So my conclusion is that it was in fact not Venus, it was in the atmosphere, it turned red as the sunl! ight weakened, and disappeared in the dark because it&apos;s glow was actually the sunlight reflecting off of it. I should also note that about a month later, someone sent George Noory a photo of a UFO over arizona within a month of my sighting, and it looked like the same thing I had seen. So two similar sightings within a month, one in New Mexico, and one in Arizona. The other thing I found totally suspicious was that this thing had to be on Kirtland Air Force Base&apos;s radar. It was within a few miles of the base, but no aircraft ever approached it the whole time it was there. I should also note that it hovered not to far from where air traffic comes in to the Albuquerque Sunport. However, I never saw any commercial flights coming in in that vicinity all during the sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

Their altitude was high enough to prevent any real description but their formation.   When I reported back to the MCCC, he told me our findings were what he expected.  He told me that Cheyenne Mountain had just told him of eight UFO&apos;s over our location. I might note, that I later was told that Tinker AFB in Oklahoma City had eight UFO&apos;s reported over them the following night. The various sightings continued for almost a 30 day period.  At one time, we had a two man security crew posted at one of our silos.  When teams such as that, were posted,  they were equiped with a rather top heavy vehicle.  Usually a 4x4 Dodge Power Wagon with a camper mounted .  Because of this, when they were parked on the site, they would tie them down with guy wires to prevent them from being blown over.It was reported to me, a UFO hovered over the silo and over the teams vehicle.  It seems the vehicle began to shake as though it was being raised.. The guy wires prevented any further movement..

IT is located between the small boroughs of colegrove and betula in south east mckean county pa.", "5 objects chasing each other in the sky...I was outside looking at the moon and the sky before going into my house and i noticed these spherical lights chasing each other around the sky, then suddenly four of the spheres went straight up to be unseen and one went straight over head traveling at a fast speed then it shot up and disappeared.", "It was brightly illuminated...like the moon...and about half its size....seen by mother and daughterIt was brightly illuminated..looked like the moon...about half its size in appearance, with a very slight greenish tint, and no trail as it darted above the tree tops. I first saw its bright light moving through the trees as I stood on my front porch. (I was looking west-northwest, and the sphere was moving from north-northwest to south-southwest.)My 7 year old daughter saw it just a second later, and together we watched it move in a fast, slightly jerking motion, in a fairly straight horizontal path, just above the treetops across the road from us. When it disappeared, I assumed it was behind more trees; my daughter says it disappeared in the open. Looking at the trees in daylight as I report this, I think it may have disappeared, because I should have otherwise still been able to see the brightness through the trees.", "My husband and I saw a triangle shape in the sky, it was pretty close to our house. It was very dark in colour and silent. Our cat&apos;s reaction to a slight vibration made us notice. Then our garage door started to open and shut on its own. A few hours later we managed to fall asleep. But something really strange happened all night. I will tell you what happened to me, then what happened to my husband. I fell asleep in our bed but my husband found me later on the sofa in the living room. The patio door was open. I was half dressed, really weak and disoriented. I felt drained of my energy. My husband had a really difficult time getting out of bed. He was also disoriented. He found me on the sofa. He doesn&apos;t remember anything except that something prevented him from getting up. I have a vague recollection of getting up, being guided by something, then nothing except I felt like I was in some strange dream. 3 hours went by between getting out of bed and waking up on the sofa. The day after, still tired and taking a shower, I noticed something on my arm. When I was a child I had a triangular mark that had disappeared since then. Now it was back again and it looked like 3 dark stains and my arm was itching. My husband felt weak the following days. Like me, he felt like he was under observation, spied on. Then the sensation went away. I don&apos;t know what happened that night but nothing felt normal. I had the same experience when I was 5 and living in Texas. It happened a second time when I was 15. Now I am 29 and it happened again. I don&apos;t know what it is but it&apos;s not of this world. Thank you to the witness for the report.

Totally unlike anything I have ever seen.I first noticed a bright light in the sky, looking like a very large, very bright star. I then thought it was a planet, although it looked a little large. Then I became aware of a red light to the side of it and realized that the object was moving closer to my position. At this point I decided it was a helicopter, as police helicopters routinely fly by this location. I waited to hear the familiar sound of a helicopter in flight, but the sound never came. As it drew closer it looked very much like a big car in the sky was headed towards me. By this I mean that the most noticeable thing was two big lights, on what was presumably the front of the aircraft, looking very much like car headlights in the sky. There was a third, smaller light between these two. All these lights were rather standard looking lights, although very bright. I&apos;ll note here that these lights were constant, not flashing. The object wasn&apos;t moving very quickly, but it was moving in what I consider to be a normal manner for an aircraft. As it drew closer I began to wonder why I still couldn&apos;t hear the noise of the helicopter&apos;s rotars, it seemed as though it was close enough that I should be able to hear it. When I did finally hear it it sounded like a jet airplane rather than a helicopter, though it was still moving at a speed that I associate with helicopters, not airplanes. The sound was also remarkably quiet. I am familiar with passenger airlines flying by with a deafening roar, this was nothing like that even as it passed almost directly over me. Now, as it got very close I began to notice the bizarre shape of the craft. It was night, so most of my impression of the shape came from the positioning of the lights, but I also got a general feel of an outline of the thing. It looked essentially like a big cross or letter &apos;x&apos;. The &apos;headlights&apos; I had seen before were still visible, and I now noticed that they also extended under the object at what I assume to be the front, reminding me somehow of a cockpit although I make no! assumption that is what I was looking at. This was approximately at where the branches of the &apos;x&apos; join. On each branch there was a light near the end, plain white light on three but a red light on one, as best as I could tell. It is hard to be sure because the general impression I got was that I was looking at something the likes of which I had never seen before, so that added to the darkness made it hard to draw any 100% conclusions. I immediately called my friend who I know to be interested in this kind of thing. When I explained to him what I saw and told him the direction it was travelling in he informed me that it was heading directly towards Forbes Field. Interestingly, he had noticed a lot of military aircraft flying here lately, I had seen one or two myself while out with him. Also, almost immediately after I saw this UFO I noticed a helicopter circling the area for a few minutes. While my friend was here with me we actually noticed several aircraft flying by. It seemed like a lot more than usual, but it&apos;s not like I usually pay much attention to be honest. Background information of the observer:  I&apos;m 22 years old, currently unemployed. I&apos;m English but I have been here in Kansas for 3 years. I&apos;m not sure what background information anyone would find useful. I did very well in high school, followed by a couple of years in college in which I didn&apos;t do so well for personal reasons. In that time I did get an AS level in psychology though. I&apos;m fascinated by anything unusual, but anyone would tell you I&apos;m also a very down to earth guy. I have seen unusual things in the sky before but I have never made a report because I always had doubt. The general populace already mocks the study of UFO&apos;s enough without vague reports adding to it. This time I am positive I saw something highly unusual, an aircraft of a design that I am totally unfamiliar with. I am sure background information is meant to supply credibility for the observer. I can&apos;t think what to say to increase my credibility, but I assure you I am a sensible person, fascinated by the unusual but if anything I tend towards cynicism. I do not make this report lightly, and I have not embellished or jumped to any conclusions. I make this report because I feel it is the duty of credible witnesses with honest experiences to make a report.", "Several bright objects seen moving with incredible speed and flight patterns in the night sky over Onalaska, WisconsinI was sitting on my patio facing the east sky when I noticed a large bright object proceeding from south to north at a rapid, steady pace. The object seemed to fade, then disappear when it reached about the centerpoint of the skyline. Moments later I began to observe at least three smaller objects move in irregular patterns in small regions of the sky surrounding the spot where the first object disappeared.It was difficult to say what shape the objects were, but they definitely appeared solid and light reflective. They were at about a 40-50 degree angle in the sky.The altitude appeared to be about the same as a commercial jet liner would fly in. These were no ordinary craft as they appeared to change both altitde and range in jerky and sometimes shaky motions. They exhibited zig-zag patterns, back and forth motions, rounded or circular fire-fly like flight patterns. They changed directions at will and at an incredible speed. Considering their distance, and comparing with the speed of a commercial jet airliner, I would say unhesitatingly that the were capable of hovering, then traveling at several thousand miles per hour and making a 180 degree flight change.They seemed to hold their patterns in a region of the sky as if committed to that area. There was some kind of a haze around these objects. No sound could be heard at any point, including the original large, lower flying object.I brought my wife and 18 year old daughter outside and they too sat in chairs and agreed that they saw the objects and that there was irregular, freakish, awesome movement. We then began noticing that several more bigger, brighter objects similar to the first object I sighted were traveling across the sky. Two went south to north together. Others went seperately in a southerly direction. These sightings were followed by the prescence of many more of these smaller objects, all with jerky, rocking, up-down, fire-fly, incredibly fast speeds/ changes. It was hard to say how many total craft there were  but it was starting to seem intimidating. My wife, in fact, found it important to rationalize these away as military aircraft defending us from terrorists.We are a professional couple with excellent reputations.((NUFORC Note:  We will telephone the witnesses and attempt to establish whether the objects might have been satellites.  If they were not satellites, we do not know what the witnesses observed.  PD))", "In June, 1973 myself and 6 others watched a huge, silent, metallic disk hover over my house.While observing the planet Jupiter through a telescope that night, I noticed a very tiny pink dot twinkling right next to the planet.  My sister-in-law was visiting and we were out in the back yard checking out the planets and stars.  I told her to look at that little &quot;star&quot; next to Jupiter.  It had not been there on my last turn to look through the scope. We took turns observing it when all of a sudden it started moving and I exclaimed &quot;It&apos;s not a star, it&apos;s moving. It must be a plane but I have never seen a plane that high up in the sky.&quot; She took her turn to look and the thing was moving fast. We shortly could see it quite clearly without the scope and we stood out in the yard with our heads up to the sky watching this thing zoom through the sky. Some of my neighbors noticed this and heard us and came out to see what the commotion was all about. It kept getting bigger and bigger and came right over my house and hovered. It never made a sound but it was huge. I had a 4-bedroom ranch house and the thing was as big as the house. We all stood there awestruck, no one saying a word, when I finally said &quot;what the hell is it&quot;? One of my neighbors was an older man and he said, &quot;I was in the Coast Guard for 25 years and all I know is it&apos;s nothing of ours.&quot; I ran into the house and called information to get the number to Scott Air Force Base. I called them and a man answered. I told him everything. I asked him if anyone else had reported this and he said &quot;Hey, lady. What are you drinking&quot;? I told him I wasn&apos;t drinking, that there were 6 other people besides myself who were with me and I didn&apos;t care if he believed me or not. He said, &quot;Calm down, lady, calm down. We have had lots of reports tonight but we don&apos;t know what it is. We&apos;re checking it out. There is nothing from Scott Air Base that fits that description.&quot; He then proceeded to take my name, address, phone #, etc. and said that someone would be contacting me. No one ever did call or contact me in any way. I slammed down the phone and ran back outside to join the others. The thing was still there. It was huge, had a domed top and windows (I guess) all around because we could see light coming from the inside. It looked metallic against the night sky. It just sat there hovering, not making a sound and finally started to move slowly away and then instantly (like woosh) shot off and disappeared. After it was over we just milled around, talking. We were just shocked. It was an awesome, unforgettable experience. I have asked myself a thousand times why no one thought to go get a camera. To tell you the truth, I didn&apos;t even think about a camera that night. I don&apos;t think anyone else did either. We all just stood staring at that thing and there wasn&apos;t a sound out of anyone until I wondered out loud, &quot;what the hell is it?&quot; My husband and children and I moved into the Westglen Woods subdivision in December, 1970. It was a brand new area of new homes. We lived at ((address deleted)) Drive. There were no large trees to block our view, just open sky. It was a warm night, clear night. Houses were on 1/3 of an acre. My children were sleeping and my husband was out with a group of his friends at a local school gym where they played volleyball.I was 28 years old at the time.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I do know it was toward the end of summer vacation so it must&apos;ve been in mid to late August.  I was riding my bike up the street with my friend to my house and just when we reached the edge of my driveway, my friend yelled &quot;Look!&quot; and he pointed to the sky ahead of us.  I saw three black or dark gray saucer-shaped objects rapidly flying up at a roughly 45-degree angle, one right after another.  They looked like they had come from an area of woods north of my house that is now a neighborhood.  They were moving so fast and quickly disappeared in the clouds.  My friend and I were stunned because they definitely weren&apos;t airplanes.  They made no sound that I could notice.  My dad was right there in the driveway washing his car.  I asked him if he saw the objects, but he was looking down at the time.  The weird thing is that I had deja vu right at that moment.  I remember having a dream before where I asked my dad &quot;Did you see that?&quot; while he was washing the car.  Probably just a coincidence.  This was during a summer when UFO sightings were quite common in the Anchorage area.  There was even something about it on the local news and in the newspaper.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Our house is on the very top of a hill and the side facing most of contra costa county is all windows and sliding glass doors.  I was seated facing the windows.  Suddenly, the tree&apos;s outside lit up with an extremely bright white flash.  At first I thought it ust be lightning. Then 10 seconds later the was another bright white flash that lit up the tree&apos;s.  My girlfriend also saw the second white flash and we immediatly walked over to the window to see what was happening.  Not more than 5 seconds after looking out the window we both saw a bright green light lighting up the tree&apos;s and moving straight up towards the sky.  We both ran outside to get a better look.  We saw an aircraft hovering above the tree&apos;s for about 3 seconds and it then shot straight up into the sky and dissapeared.  When we were outside the green light emitted from the aircraft was so bright we could not tell what shape it was. We watched the sky for another 3 minutes and saw nothing so we returned inside.  What puzzled both of us is that once inside we noticed the stereo had turned on as well as the ceiling fan. There was no one else in the house!

Our driveway faces almost due west.  I noticed a very bright object toward south of the driveway which was moving horizonally at an elevation of approximately 40 degrees above the horizon.  I pointed this out to my wife and she commented that it must be an airplane.  We watched for several minutes and I pointed out that there were no other lights ( red or green) as normally seen with aircraft.  She said the object looked like a sphere with a halo adound it.  She went into the house to get the binoculars and I continued to watch the object which continued traveling toward the west at a slow rate of speed.  The moon was very bright and was at an elevation above the object and east of the object approximately 30 to 40 degrees.  Only a few stars were visible to the south an these were much higher in the sky.  At this point something very strange happened. A bright object ( not nearly as bright as the original sphere ) eminated from the sphere and traveled at a very rapid rate to the east at an angle of 120 degrees from the path of the bright sphere.  This object ( much smaller than the original sphere) had a faint red glow to it.  It continued moving at high rate of speed in a straight line until it was no longer visible at an elevation of approximately 75 degrees above the horizon almost due south.  I returned my attention to the original object which was no longer moving to the west but appeared to be moving away from me as the size continued to get smaller.

The camera used is a Nikon D100, with a 17mm to 35mm lens.  This lens is one of Nikon&apos;s better zoom lenses.  In fact it&apos;s the top of the line.  It is not prone to flare.  The digital camera is a 6mp.  On the second of the four shots, there is an object in the sky over the building.  I did not see it at the time of photography, but only noticed it when reviewing the shots.  In fact, there are several objects in the frame, as well as the other frames, but they are so small you wouldn&apos;t notice them unless I pointed them out.  None of these objects appear in any other frame, either of this building on any other that I shot that day.   What makes this image so interesting is the fact that  the object  is sun lit at exactly the correct angle.  This is not a plane or bug etc.  I reviewed the info in the camera regarding this frame, and it revealed that the shutter was at a 60th and the f stop at f11.

On the morning of July 7th, 2004 while on a break at the local hospital I noticed in the sky a very bright light glowing in the sky.  The light appeared sort of orange in color and resembles the sort of light one would expect to see on an approaching helicopter, the light was stationary in one area for about 2 1/2 hours.  I work security at the hospital and have access to the surveillance cameras at the facility, so I went inside and decided to position the cameras skyward to see if I could get a better and closer view of the object.  Once I fixed the cameras on the object and zoom in on it the object appeared to be a bright circle with another circle inside of it, I then focus the view of the camera to view as near as possible and the object appeared to glow outward from the center and had the appearance of a huge eye.  The sky was clear and stars could easily be viewed by natural eye but this object appeared closer than the stars.  I took pictures of the object on the camera with my picture phone.  I don&apos;t know if this is a UFO or a natural phenomenon of some sort, but I am definitely sure it was not an airplane or manmade craft.  I am sending via email some pictures of the object, the photos will be EyeNSky1 and EyeNSky2.", "bright light in day time with what apperaed dashes around itAs I developed a picture I took while we were flying a rc plane.  The picture had a very bright light in it.  Upon enlarging it you could see rings or almost like dashes that made a cirlcl around it.", "Three bright round lights at high altitude hovering in the sky  adjacent the airliner I was in. Moved very littleI had just departed DFW International Airport enroute to Little Rock Airport, and we were passing through a Flight Level as announced by the pilot.  I noticed a bright round light in the distance.  Being an Air Traffic Controller I thought this was an aircraft at first thinking it was in a sequence to land with two similar lights behind it, but the lights weren&apos;t flashing like most lights on an aircraft at night do.  I thought then maybe it was in holding but the lights weren&apos;t really moving. This made kind of look harder at what I was looking at. I thought it kind of strange. They looked very similar to how bright lights are on top of a Radio tower or something but they weren&apos;t flashing.  Of course, it was way too high for a tower or a helicopter because of the altitude we were at.  By this time I am pretty sure were around FL 200 or higher. As we flew along what I initially thought to be a sequence into DFW started to look two of the lights came together and one was still in the distance behind it. These lights stayed like this for along time. The longer I looked the lights seemed to be in one spot the whole time.  THey were big almost round spots of light just hovering in the sky.  I looked around in the plane to see if anyone was seeing the same thing I was but no one was. These lights never really moved the whole time I watched and I stared at them til they were just tiny spots in the sky. They moved slightly lateral from each while I saw them.  They were not aircraft and I still cannot to this day figure out what it was.  I waited so long to report because I felt like people wouldn&apos;t believe me  or think I was kind of crazy, but after reading the report about the Mexican Air Force pilots and their encounter ( it was in the news not too long ago)...what I saw was very similar to what they saw.  I am not going to check any boxes below about being contacted but if anyone reading this wants to then they can contact me if they feel the need to", "Orange orb in the sky vanishes.....I was standing on the driveway saying goodbye to eachother one evening.  We were looking in the northern sky and about 30 degrees up from the horizon there was an orange orb.  It stood out from the stars arround it and there were no airplanes in the sky.  It hovered, I would say, about 30 miles away.  We were in a suburbian area just out of Tulsa.  Just as I brought this strange orb to my fathers attention it disappeared.  Didn&apos;t move...Just disappeared.  There was not a cloud in the sky.", "at approx. 3 am while watching the night sky with my wife i saw several faint blinks of light out of the corner of my eye and when i shifted my sight to that direction i observed an image that can be explained by physics. near where the second to the last star in the big dipper handle is came a sharp crisp blue flash and then out of that came an object that looked exactly like a satelite as the flash disappeared. this object moved about the same rate as regular satelites we observe and the appearence was about the same, a small lit dot crossing the sky. however this  &quot;satelite&quot; did not return on path as others do. other satelites were visable for another hour. if an object was coming at us fast i think the blue shift would apply and that explains it and as it slowed it became just white light. we average about 500 hrs a yr of sky watching this is our second report in two years. something from out there came here last night. or maybe its just us coming back?", "Bright elongated object traverses skyNoticed a bright object high in the sky. It was slightly longer than an airplane fuselage yet tapered at each end. There were no wings or tell tale signs of such (such as dark areas around it&apos;s mid section). It glowed or shone silver white. I ran towards an elderly couple on a park bench close by. I pointed it out to them and they came into the clearing to get a clear view. They both saw it too. The lady said she had seen it before (I didn&apos;t ask when). They both agreed that it was not an airplane. I put forward the notion that perhaps it was a meteor but dismissed it myself as it left no trail nor did it appear to be moving as fast as one would expect a meteor to. It stayed on a steady course heading west at a somewhat leisurely pace comparable to an aircraft at 30,000 feet. It seemed to flare when it was about 60 degrees above the western horizon, growing brighter for a second. I lost sight of it shortly after as it got further away and trees obstructed my view.", "Blue Light Streaks Accross the South Texas SkySaw what appeared to be a bright blue (almost neon) streaking across the sky while fishing in the early morning hours. My son saw it first and called it to my attention. I would have noticed the after effect as it appeared to go behind a lone cloud and explode. The night sky lit up to the point the ground was fairly lit up. Did not hear any sound and it was not lightning. Very interesting.", "About 7pm PDT 6/5/04 I saw two small bright objects to the South East about 45 degree elevation over Sonoma Mountain. The tiny dots were to the west of an old contrail. I got my binoculars and a digital camera. My wife was thr first to see one of the objects in the binoculars. It was red and white, irregular shape, and appeared to be tumbling about very high up. I also witnessed this with the binoculars. It&apos;s position relative to the contrail did not change appreciably. I lost sight of the other object right away. I took several digital photos in the area where I saw the object and one of them captured it, although the resolution is poor. After about 15 minutes I lost sight of this object too. There were no noises, lights or color changes.", "Bright point of light travelling south to north, zig-zagged, stopped, slowed, instantly resumed speed.On top of beach house with three friends looking for meteors and satellites.  Saw 3 meteors, and six satellites. Then, noticed what appeared to be a satellite coming from south in region of Scorpio, about 35 degrees above horizon. - Magnitude between that of Saturn and Polaris.- Shape was a point.- Color was bright yellow/white. Object followed a trajectory that first arched westward, then northward where it disappered around 40 degrees above the norther horizon. Along its trajectory from south to north, the object zig-zagged, slowed down, then instantaneously resumed orginal speed several times.  Zig-zag pattern was around trajectory path from south to north.  If its path were drawn, it would look like a schematic of series electronic resistors. Amplitude of zig-zag was about 5/16&quot; (width of my little finger nail) held at arm&apos;s length, and seemed to be in groups of four of five over a distance of 1 1/4&quot; (distance from first joint of little finger to tip) held at arm&apos;s length. The object seemed to do the zig-zag pattern, straighten out for about 1&quot; at arm&apos;s length, then repeat the pattern in the opposite direction.  It would then repeat this pattern.  When object slowed, zig-zag motion ceased. Before I saw the object the witness who saw it first saw it stop a couple of times.  I did not see it stop, but I did notice it slow down about three times and resume its original speed as it passed through the ecliptic. I cannot say that the object was self-illuminated, however, it did not behave in a fashion indicating reflected light, or a spinning satellite (these tend to sinusoidally vary in brightness, i.e., &quot;pulse&quot;).", "Orange circular object moved quickly to NE and was followed almost to the horizon.While walking my dog, noticed directly overhead a moving yellow-orange circular object that looked like Jupiter but was 50% larger. Jupiter was nearby, a little more to the west, and just below the constellation of Leo. This moving object headed straight NE at a speed that convinced me that it had to be a satellite. It had the same deliberate and steady motion. I was able to follow it to within a few degrees above the NE horizon. As it receded, it not only became smaller but also decidedly more orange. Since it still had considerable angular speed when it approached the horizon, it convinced me that it was following the earth in a circular orbit. Based on these observations, I would have to conclude that I had seen an unknown satellite. What puzzles me though is the fact that about 1.5 hours after sunset, it should have blinked out at an elevation of about 22.5 degress as it entered the Earth&apos;s shadow. It did not do that and I could follow it almost to the horizon to within about 2 degrees.", "Amber colored spheres following the vehicle, moving in erratic directions in the Maccan areaOne night as my sister, my mother, my grandmother, and I were travelling from Parrsboro to Amherst, where route 302 and 242 connect, I happened to look out the driver side of the vehicle.  As I did, I noticed 2 golden sphere shapes in the window.  At first I thought they were a reflection of the amber colored street lamps in that area.  Then I realized that they were actually outside the window, approx. 30 - 40 feet from the vehicle.  They were moving erratically, around each other almost following the car, staying about the same distance away.  I told my family to look, and they also noticed them.  I wasn&apos;t scared, however was a bit anxious, not sure why.  They followed the vehicle on the waterside (driver side) for approximately 10 minutes before they just disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I intend to bring in a telescope, hoping that it will be repeated again tonight.", "Star like, rapidly changing colours, pulsating, high speed movement, very high upI was out with my on the handle of the big dipper, hoping to catch some of the so-called surprise June meteor shower.  I was well rewarded with a few streaking meteors, and several flashes.  During a lull I started looking in the west-northwest sky and an object about the size and brightness of venus (maybe not quite as bright) caught my eye.  My initial thought was &quot;wow, that&apos;s a really hyper twinkling star&quot;. I kept my eye on it and noticing it was changing colour rapidly.  Almost &quot;pulsing&quot; you could say.  Seemed like there might be a pattern to it.  Then it suddenly stopped changing colours and stated sort of a blue-ish hue.  It suddenly zoomed over to a new location.  If you extend your arm, and hold your hand up to the sky and measure approx. 3 inches from your thumb to your pointing finger, that was the distance it moved in approx. 1 second.  It left a faint streak momentarily. That move seemed to be straight towards the north.  Then it stopped and then moved again, same distance, but this time seemed to be going down, or possibly East.  It was hard to tell because it seems to be at a great distance.  I would not be surprised if it&apos;s not even in our atmosphere.  (hard to guess without having any idea of it&apos;s size)  This was my very first UFO sighting.  I have always had an open mind to the possibility, but without actually seeing one with my own eyes I could never totally believe it.  I wish they would just land on the white house lawn and end all the charades. I was out again tonight and saw the exact same object, same time of night, same general area of the sky.  Except instead of doing an upside down L in the sky, it seems to sort of just zig zag, and at one point did 2 circles.  Cloud cover obscured my view after only 5 minutes of watching it tonight. I suspect that anyone with a clear sky around 02:30 Eastern time will be able to see it.  It seems to be a regular visitor.((NUFORC Note:  We believe the possibility that the witness is observing a &quot;twinkling&quot; star would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that he was observing a UFO.

They were confined to a fairly small area of the *sky* and seemed to be at about cloud level. My guess is the lights were moving about perhaps a few miles off our shoreline, and would likely have been high enough and far enough over the lake to also have been visible from the US side of the lake. It had been an overcast day and the sky at this time was clearing. It wasn&apos;t nearly dark enough yet to observe any stars. At first I saw one small pink-red light at cloud level traveling parallel to the ground and in a straight line moving from east to west at about the same rate as I&apos;d expect to see planes travel. This light flashed on and off with a regular rhythm like an aircraft and was about the same size as an aircraft light seen at such a distance. It seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, then traveled west for perhaps 5 seconds and disappeared. I thought I had seen and then lost sight of a plane. Suddenly from the very same place in the sky that the light originally appeared, and only seconds after the first light vanished, another light appeared. It was the same colour and behaved exactly like the first light, even traveling in the very same line. It too disappeared in the same manner as the first light. This behavior of a light appearing, traveling for a few seconds across the sky and then disappearing repeated 6-10 times. After a few passes the reappearing light ceased flashing as it moved across the sky. It glowed a reddish pink colour and without blinking as it moved. The behavior of the light then changed. Suddenly the light was moving from west to east and towards the end of the sighting it seemed that there might have been more than one light in play. Just as one vanished another appeared. The direction of flight changed to a sweeping arc. The flight started parallel to the ground and then curved steeply upwards and seemed to accelerate just before disappearing. There seemed to be a distinct repetitive pattern to the flight of the light(s). As one light moved from east to west, arcing at the end of its flight, another light mirrored that pattern by flying west to east and then arced upwards at the end. The area the lights were &quot;playing&quot; in the sky drifted higher and a little to the east as the sighting continued. It also seemed that the activity of the lights became more intense towards the end. They appeared and disappeared more quickly and the flight pattern became more energetic. The best thought that comes to mind is it appeared that they were growing increasingly excited about something as the activity became quite hectic towards the end. The display of these lights lasted about 5 minutes and was witnessed by a friend with me at the time. His impression was that the lights were chasing each other, as in a dogfight. The flight pattern reminded me of when you see a powerful spot light beamed in the sky circling and moving about, starting and finishing its routine in the same place every time. These lights were a lot like what you see when you use a red laser pointer, except the colour of the lights in the sky were less intense red than a laser, rather being an almost pink sort of colour. Since the cloud cover was quite thin at this time it&apos;s unlikely that some sort of laser was beaming around on the cloud cover (If it was an extremely powerful laser I would have seen the lights fade in and out as the beam struck thin patches of clouds. The lights I saw held intensity as they flew across the sky before vanishing suddenly.)  There was no sound accompanying this sighting and I think the flight behavior was too radical for normal aircraft. The speed and turns were not something I&apos;ve ever seen planes capable of doing, particularly without making sound. The regular flashing of the lights in the beginning was aircraft-like, but the reddish-pink colour was unusual. I got the feeling while watching the lights that I was seeing glowing objects, something without mass (like the spot made by a laser) rather than a solid aircraft. In such an urban area as this I can&apos;t imagine that my friend and I were the only two people to have seen this blatant display of something quite unusual right out in the open and in daylight. Surely our beaches and boardwalks, which provide a perfect view of the southern sky, were busy on Saturday after dinner and many people could have seen this event. I&apos;ve checked into all the major local news sources, newspapers, radio and local TV news and haven&apos;t seen a mention of this event. I hope to learn what it was that we saw, or at least hear accounts from other witnesses. Thank you to the witness for the report.

It was making a rather distinct humming noise, which vibrated through the air. I got out of bed and was goign to head out of my room where all of a sudden the light expanded and shone on my wall and this HUGE sense of gravity hit me, i could barely move, i tried resiliantly to get to the door from my knees, however when i got as far as a cm higher the gravity was just too much and i fell to the ground, i noticed too that i was awfully tired which is extremely unsual, it&apos;s as if i had been gased as i could have fell asleep if i wanted in 5 seconds. Which i did. As i was thinking what to do in the short period of time i came to the conclusion of conforming to the gravity and gas (or wateva it was)and fall asleep as i would havefelt it extremely tense and frightening to have stayed awake. IF it happens again i just might stay awake. Anyway as soon as i fell asleep lying on my bedroom floor i wokeup just at the same rate as i fell asleep. Slowly gathering conciousness remembering only the time when i saw the light until i fell asleep. It felt to me as a huge time gap had been erased as when the &quot;incident&quot; had occured it was dark and when i woke up it was light, however i felt as if i had just woke up from it.Take this into consideration however take into considerationh that it could have been a dream, a dream like NONE OTHER as it was terrifyingly realistic.

When he got back in the car, and we started driving East on Melrose near Paramount Studio&apos;s, I saw it break into 2 round light speheres, at that point, I asked him to take a look up, to see if he could see what I see.  He did.  We pulled over on Bronson Avenue, pulled over, got out of the car, and watched... Now we saw three lights all the size of Venus, forming a triangle, not moving any direction, but further up towards the atmosphere.  I read on this board that at some time in April a couple of hikers saw this same formation over Griffith Park. We had made mention that this event looked like it was over Griffith Park as well.

Myself, my father-in-law,his friend and his friend&apos;s grandson. We were returning home from a Phillies-Cardinals baseball game. We were traveling south on I 95 approximately 2-3 miles before the I 476 interchange (known locally as the &quot;Blue Route&quot;). As we were traveling south on I 95 we all noticed a very bright light directly ahead of us on the horizon. Because of our proximity to the Philadelphia International airport, I believe we all assumed it was plane approaching for a landing at the airport. After about thirty seconds I remember thinking to myself,why hasn&apos;t the incoming plane closed in distance on us? It seemed we weren&apos;t closing the gap. (which I found strange because we were heading directly toward it. And it initally appeared to be coming toward us.) About 15-20 seconds later the gap between us seemed like it was finally closing. I then commented to the child in the group, &quot;look here comes a plane in for a landing&quot;. Right after that the object shot off to left at an incredible speed on an approximate 60 degree angle. It was totally out of sight in a second or two. We all imediately rolled down our windows and looked up to try and track it. However, it was gone. One of the other witnesses said, &quot;Did you see that? It was like it was yanked on a string! That isn&apos;t anything from this world!&quot;   I also remember was thinking to myself how bright the light was compared to what I remember normal landing lights on a plane to be. It was a brighter and whiter glow than you would normally see. A final observation. There is a Boeing facility within a mile or two of where the sighting occurred. Was this some sort of experimental craft? I don&apos;t know... If it was, I can&apos;t rationalize why they would be testing it in such a densely populated area over heavily traveled interstate highway.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, but can easily be confirmed because of the baseball game.  PD))", "Saucer seen briefly over road - may have landedThis happened to me in November of 1980.  I spoke of it only briefly and guardedly to my two best friends at the time, but the incident has stayed with me. I&apos;m sure that it was a Saturday, and I think that the date was probably November 22nd.  I was nineteen years old, just about to be twenty. I was living away from home for the first time, in the town of White Sulfur Springs, West Virginia, attending a photography school.  I&apos;d set off to drive to visit my mother in southern Indiana for Thanksgiving week. I was approaching the town of Alloy, West Virginia, heading west on US 60.  Alloy&apos;s about 20 miles SE of Charleston.  It&apos;s very small, and may not appear on some maps. The day was cold and grey, and the tops of the mountains were hidden by clouds.  I regret to say that my attention wasn&apos;t fully focussed on my driving - my radio was fading in and out (The Who - &apos;Magic Bus&apos;), and I was trying to simultaneously adjust the vernier knob and drive.  I attach no particular importance to the problems that I was having with the radio.  That&apos;s just a lousy area for radio reception, there in the mountains. At that point the road is skirting around the flank of a mountain, so that to my right was a rising slope, and to my left was the wide valley of the Kanawha river, with another mountainous ridge rising up from the far side.  There was some sort of heavy industrial complex situated in the valley by the river - if memory serves correctly, it was a steel mill. I crested a small ridge, and saw a sign to the right side of the road warning me that heavy trucks entered the highway ahead.  I noticed a light grey or aluminum hemisphere just barely visible over the crest of the next ridge, perhaps two hundred yards away.  I glanced at it, classified it as the top of a tank truck, and went back to fiddling with radio. A few seconds later, as I started to top the next ridge, I gave my full attention to the road, expecting to meet the tanker that I thought I had seen.  The road itself was empty.  The hemisphere that I had seen earlier was hovering above the road, perhaps 50 feet in the air and climbing. It took me a few seconds to accept what I was seeing, and by that time I&apos;d passed under the hemisphere and lost sight of it.  My last glimpse was of it seeming to tilt slightly on edge as it rose.  It was overall a light grey or aluminum color.  I can&apos;t say if the finish was reflective, as the sky was so heavily overcast.  A circular patch about 2/3 of the diameter on the bottom was of a darker grey color.  It seemed to be flush with the bottom, just as though the color were painted on, with no difference of texture or anything.  The edges where the hemisphere met the bottom were widely rolled, not at all sharp.  The bottom was very slightly convex.  I noticed no surface features apart from the dark patch - the whole thing was quite smooth-looking.  The thing was perhaps 15-20 feet wide, and maybe 8-10 feet tall. It took me a few seconds to recover.  During this time I was coasting downhill slowly, my foot off the gas, looking in my rearview and side mirrors trying to see the thing.  To the right was a pulloff marked &quot;Alloy Slag Dump&quot;, and I pulled in and stopped.  I jumped out of the car, and looked back up the road, maybe 100 yards or so to the road just below the crest of the ridge where I thought it must have been sitting when I first saw it. Nothing was there, and the sky was empty as well.  I looked up the mountain (now to my left, as I was facing the way I had come) and saw that the top was obscured by clouds - the cloud deck was maybe 100-150 yards above me, and thick.  Looking for it in the sky was futile.  I remember saying to myself that there could be an aircraft carrier overhead, and I&apos;d not see it.  Nor was there anyone else about who might have seen it.  The parking lot of the steel plant below me was almost empty - just a handful of cars, and there was no guard in the gatehouse. Still, I was excited - I&apos;d actually seen a flying saucer!  I grabbed a camera and a couple of empty 35mm film cans from my gear (I had three loaded cameras with me, but obviously had had no time to use them) and set off back to the spot where I suspected it had touched down, looking to take photos and maybe collect samples. I got about three steps, just as far as the rear bumper of my car, when I abruptly had a very vivid image of the car being found empty, engine running and door open, with my new winter coat and several thousand dollars worth of camera equipment sitting in the passenger seat.  All that would be missing would be the driver and a cheap 35mm, and wouldn&apos;t everybody just scratch their heads and wonder?  Suddenly I was terrified.  I was alone, with no-one in sight, and those clouds might be concealing anything.  I got right back in the car and drove off, considerably rattled and eager to get into a town.  That&apos;s the almost the end of the story. Later in the journey, somewhere in Kentucky near Louisville, my car broke down.  I bundled up and started walking.  A very nice old preacher stopped to give me a ride.  He left me at an abandoned gas station which had a working payphone, and I sheltered in the disused men&apos;s room while my mother drove down to get me. Apart from the shock of actually seeing the UFO, three things stand out in my memory.  The first is the radio.  I know that it&apos;s common to experience radio trouble in conjunction with a sighting, but I honestly don&apos;t think that was the case here.  I have no real evidence to offer beyond the fact that I usually got bad reception in that area between the mountains. The second is my abrupt mood change upon beginning to walk toward the presumed landing site.  I do associate this with the UFO, as much as I dislike the idea.  For lack of a better term, it felt to me (and still does) as though the imagery of my empty car were being imposed upon me, instead of arising naturally from my own imagination.  I had the sense of being warned off.  That&apos;s what really frightened me.  I&apos;m not a small man, and I&apos;m not timid, and at the age of 19 I thought I was indestructible to start with, but that got to me.  Again, I have no real evidence to offer apart from my own impressions. The third is the preacher who gave me a ride.  In the years since this happened I&apos;ve read quite a bit of UFO literature, and I&apos;m aware that many people would jump on that as a sign of possible abduction (at the time I&apos;d never heard of such a thing).  I don&apos;t think him stopping to give me a ride was anything more than what it seemed to be on the surface - a kind man stopping to help someone on a cold night.  I debated whether or not to include the incident at all, but finally decided that I should for the sake of completeness. I&apos;ll send along a drawing of the thing by snail mail.  Also, please note that while I think the object was probably landed the first time I saw it behind the ridge, I didn&apos;t check that box because I&apos;m not sure.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I saw a light through the trees to my right(north) and stopped on the Harpeth River Bridge. This is a rural area and back then there was almost no other traffic. It was night time. I&apos;m really unclear as to the month or day of the month, but there were no leaves on the trees and it was warm because I was in a convertible Corvette with the top down. I turned off my headlights and walked to the guard rail and focused on the light which I had seen through the trees. I was looking northeast and saw that the light was a crisply defined, pure white globe about 30 feet above the river and moving at south west toward me and following the course of the river. It was moving at a speed of less than 5 mph and less than 100 feet from me. I could have thrown a rock and hit it. It was only about 4 feet in diameter. I knew right away that this was not a naturally occurring phenomena, but was an object made by some being. I assumed immediatetly I was in the presence of an alien craft. I stood there and decided to raise my right hand and WAVED! at it with a goofy smile on my face. It came a few feet closer to me and then changed direction and headed to the northwest away from me, lifted over the line of trees 300 feet from me, and  went back down behind them and I was no longer able to see it. I will always believe it changed direction because whatever very small entity inside it saw me standing there on the bridge with my hand in the air. I guess I am one of a small number who suprised a UFO. I drove around the area the rest of the night, but saw no more of the object and never reported it, but I think about it often as it changed my life. No one will ever convince me that I did not see something from another world or another time. Whatever it was, it was very interested in the river itself as it was following the course of the river exactly until it saw me. This is an area that was inhabited by prehistoric indians and ! there are 3 indian mounds south of the bridge within sight of the location so I have wondered over the years if the pilot of the craft was doing a little historical research, but of course I have no way of knowing. It made no sound whatsoever and there was no wavering in its movement. It moved as steadily as if it was on a track and never changed its speed at all. What struck me the most was that it was moving toward me and then instantly away from me with no change in speed. I forgot to mention that it was as bright as a street light and the light was coming from within the object.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

She said it was the wierdest thing she has ever seen in her life and she almost stopped her car in the middle of the road to watch it.

I have lived in this area for nearly forty years, and I am very familiar with launches from the Cape, regarding the horizon location. In most likely early 2000 I had been observing what appeared to be early morning rocket launches from the eastern horizon.  Over a period of weeks I had observed maybe three or four.  At about 0400 hours, a traveling white light caught my eye.  At maybe 45 degrees up off of the eastern horizon I observed a light that had the appearance of an average size star, with an average star brightness.  The light was traveling in a due north directon.  This light appeared to be located in the same flight path area as launches from Cape Canaveral.  Just looking at it, it appeared to possibly be thirty or forty miles away, it was far. I watched the object because it was traveling the same path as the recent orange colored lights (rockets) that I had seen.  I might add here that when I observed the rockets, they all appeared to travel due north for approximately 20 seconds, then accelerate east at a fast rate until out of sight. I watched the light, it traveled due north at 45 degrees for approximately 20 seconds.  At that point the light appeared to stop in place.  At the same instant, a circle of light of the same brightness appeared to surround the small starlight.  The light circle started out at approximately twice the size of the starlight.  It immediately enlarged within less than a second to three or four times the size of the starlight.  At that instant the light circle collapsed back onto the starlight.  The starlight then appeared to head due east, away from Florida.  But this occurred at incredible speed, nearly instantly, it vanished more than flew east.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

After the initial attack into Az Zubayr (near Basra) my Regiment re-assembled for the movement to Nasariya, about 22 March (the war was very chaotic and I did not keep a journal as things were so hectic). We formed along the highway and started movement well after dark, 2100 or so. As an armored vehicle commander (AAV) my duties had me in the turret searching for threats/targets as we proceeded along the highway at about 20 mph. I had a pair of NVG&apos;s (night vision goggles) to aid my night vision and needless to say my crew and I were very alert and nervous/excited with the start of combat a few days earlier. I soon started to notice pulses of dull orange light in the night sky which could be seen with the naked eye. They would trace an arc and pulse in intensity like a flare but would give off very little light (unlike an illumination flare) and the really curious thing was that when observed through NVG&apos;s they still gave off very little light. NVG&apos;s amplify natural and infra red light very intensly and I could not understand what it might be. My crew saw these lights as well and we agreed none of us had ever seen anything like it in training (new weapon?... if so, whose?) I called it over the net (radio) to the command vehicle and they acknowledged they could see them as well and did not know what they were. These continued one after another all night and seemed to be close aboard. The obvious reaction was that they were some form of illumination being used by the Iraqi&apos;s but I should mention that the surrounding area was desolate arid desert with little place to hide and hardly any terrain features for miles. We encountered no resistance whatsoever during the movement, and so no enemy to explain the source. There was no sound that could be heard though the engine noise would have made that difficult. What I found to be really curious was that nobody seemed to care though it obviously! implied some sort of weapon or device was being used and it was not ours. The airspace over the Marine advance was tightly controlled to avoid friendly fire and we saw plenty of helicopters to know the difference. These were to be seen on later nights as well during our push on Baghdad and it got so that we stopped reporting it at all as we would any enemy contact. I never got an explanation though the Regimental Staff was part of my column and all the officers I asked could not explain it either. Again, these lights would move in  slow shallow arcs like small orange balls that would glow brighter then dull and then brighter again. These would pulse maybe 5 or 10 times then disappear and soon another would be seen in a different direction. These were noticed with the naked eye and did not look any different with night vision goggles (?). They were seen only up in the air and did not seem to fall to earth and seemed relativly close by. I should also mention that we were all obviously sober and awake and very alert. On that first night in particular they were seen during most of the movement, 8 to 10 hours along 150 miles of desert highway. The night sky seemed clear enough to make out the stars some of the time but not a lot of moonlight to aid night vision. There was no noticeable effect or purpose to these lights to explain them.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I got halfway down the street, approaching the intersection of Rose and 3rd Avenues, when I noticed what appeared to be a very large swarm of agitated black balloons. At first I thought someone must have released the balloons for a festival, or perhaps the balloons were released by some cruise ship out at sea. I struggled to make sense of what I was looking at. The entire cluster seemed to be visibly composed of 8-12 large individual black spheres, all rapidly moving around each other. They were swirling and leapfrogging as though an animated cartoon. The words &quot;nightmarish&quot; and &quot;cartoon-like&quot; come to mind. Each sphere seemed blacker than black - mere silhouettes. When I realized I was observing something incredibly out of the ordinary, I hit the brakes, shifted into reverse, and back tracked into my driveway. I then went into my apartment to grab my camcorder, stepped outside, and started taping.  This entire process took about 4 minutes. In 4 minutes, this cluster, size difficult to determine - appeared to be as large as a car or perhaps house, managed to travel from above the intersection to the clouds you see in the clips.

I am a Christian and I do have an open mind about many things.  But I still haven&apos;t figured out exactly what me and a friend of mine saw that one particular night back in 1976.  We had been on a fishing trip to the Barren River Lake area, and was returning home late one night-around 1:00 AM if I remember correctly.  Anyway, as we were driving back home to the Scottsville area we had to pass by an old abandoned oil well in a wooded area.  We had taken this route many times before.  As we were driving along we spotted something very odd sitting beside the abandoned oil well in the woods and it was very bright.  We decided to stop the pickup truck and get a closer look.  When we stopped we saw a solid mass of bright red light in the woods beside the well.  The light was perfectly round and circular in appearance and sitting on the ground.  It was as big as our pickup truck we were riding in, and just sitting there in the woods glowing.  There was no noise at all to be heard, and we had both never seen anything like this thing before.  The light was bright red, and it did appear as though it was a part of something of a solid mass-an object of some sorts.  Why it was near an oil well I do not know.  I must say that the night was really dark, and there was practically no moon shining at all.  Although I do realize that there might be a practical explanation as to what we observed that night, I cannot think of what it might be.  Believe me, we were not out UFO hunting or anything like that-it just happened.  We both know what we saw.

I don&apos;t know why I didn&apos;t shout out, I felt a bit paralyzed or mesmerized. What I do know is from that day on I started acting very much more mature, and became disinterested in kid stuff, and grew to have a 160 I.Q. and seem to have an amazing grasp of the inner workings of the world. I&apos;m not saying that was even a result of this encounter, but something changed that day. I never talked about the sighting until years later with friends. And many years later I saw a craft with this same design in some science fiction movie, the name I don&apos;t know. The point being, I have drawings I made of the craft from 30 years ago, long before I could have possibly seen this design, and it begs the question did the movie&apos;s designer, accidentally design my craft, or have others seen this and made reports of it that could have been copied. I will include a drawing if possible.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

His parent came out and we just stood and watched these strange lights in the air. They were sort of a greenish tinted light. The 12 lights were an oval shapped and did not look real big. From our view they looked about 1 centimeter. So if they were up close i would have to guess they were all about the size of a small jet.

And now comes the weird part. I was still looking in its direction, still north on I-95, though I had pulled off the highway to watch. Right at the lowest point where the meteor vanished, at exactly that point, something else began to come into view.Not a sudden appearance, like &quot;poof&quot; there it is...but a gradual visibility, taking about 5 seconds to come fully in sight, though it didn&apos;t &quot;grow&quot; in size(as an oncoming headlight, or light source, might do).What it seemed to be was a craft, oblong/oval in shape, no blinking lights, but it was illuminated...a dull glow, as opposed to brightly lit.Once it was fully visible, it sat in that spot for a couple of seconds, then proceeded to move in a westerly direction, the quality of the illumination never changing. There were no blinking lights at any time during this observation.I pulled back out on the highway, and watched it until I could no longer see it. It was on a westerly path the whole time, which lasted about 5 minutes.", "Star that moves in circles.We saw a light in the western sky over our house as we were watching for satelites in the sky.  At first we thought it was just a star, but then it kept bouncing around and moving back and forth, in circles, and up and down.  At one point it looked like it was moving farther away from the earth, then it moved closer.

We were watching some air traffic that fly over the house checking out the moon and the planets. After the last plane went near the horizon, I ask my wife to look at the planets because one of them started to move SE and gained speed greater than that of the planes we were watching. After about 3 seconds of speed the object then veired upwards and began a high rate of climb. I told my wife that I have never seen anything climb that fast. The object went straight up and the yellow light got smaller and then faded out of sight. The object did look like a yellowish planet in the SW night sky.

The evening was perfectly clear and there were millions of stars visible with little moon light. At approx 2241 hrs, 21 Aug 04, we noticed a light high in the atmoshpere heading in a South Eastern direction that looked just like a statellite, but the we noticed there were two more behind it (in a right angle trinanlge formation), and one trailing about at a distance behind. I noticed that all of the lights seemed to be oscillating slightly as they moved, unlike a statellite which moves smoothly and swiftly. As we were talking about these lights, the fourth light that was trailing at a distance began to speed up and looked like it was going to pass the other three on the left hand side, but just as it met up with the middle two, it quiclky veered off to the right (south) and sped off out of sight. A few seconds later the remaining three formed an almost perfect triangle and then disappeared (the lead one first, followed by the remaing two). I do not believe these were aircraft b/c the lights were constant, resembling what a statellite looks like, plus there was no sound or vapour trail.  I also do not believe these lights were statellites, since on obviously changed course and the remaining three fluctuated in speed and laked the fluent, smooth movment consistent with a statellite.

At first I thought it may be a commercial or military aircraft because of my proximity to Grissom Air Base, however, as the object grew closer it looked as if the front was rounded or oval shaped. I slowed my truck and the object passed just behind me making no discernable noise. I began to speed up and I noticed the object had changed its direction, now moving towards the north northeast gaining altitude until it dissappeared in the clouds.

Our friend pointed out what he thought was a sattelite moving across the sky.  I did not note the exact time - I beleive it was approximately 10:30pm. I picked up the object and followed its path.  The object was moving in a straight line.  No lights were detected or trails behind it. Numerous things stuck us initally: 1) It was agreed amongst us that it was moving significantly faster than other satellites or shooting stars we have seen.2)It seemed very low for a satellite.  I can not give an estimate of height, but, it appeared that the object was almost close enought that we could pick out details of the object, not just a general shape profile.3) It seemed of reasonable size - potentially due to the low height??  Larger than other satellites I have seen by approximately 4-5 fold. At approximately a 25&deg; angle, the speed of the object slowed slightly and it moved in a half-circle profile.  I would suggest that the radius of the bend took place over 5-10&deg; of the horizon.  On completion of the half-circle profile, the object then resumed a straight line course.

My folks were asleep and I put my luggage in the spare room and went out to the back patio, by the pool area to call my husband. As I was talking to him I saw a red triangle come up from behind the church roof. My parents live on a busy road but their house is set back from the road and the church is about a football field away. It was bright red inside the triangle with an outlining of yellow/orange. It was moving very slow, there were no sounds except for crickets and the sound of a light breeze through the trees. It was dark except for a few street lights across the street and the sky was clear as a bell. It also had like a white tail coming from the lower left hand corner but it wasn&apos;t attatched. I whispered into the phone, oh my god, oh my god, hon, there is something weird in the sky, he laughed and said why are you whispering, I just said I don&apos;t know this is really weird. Then the triangle began to get smaller where you could only see a little bit of the red part and the yellow/orange outside. It was still moving slowly up into the sky at an angle towards the Big Dipper. It then began to slowly get bigger again and I saw a red dot fly out of the lower left hand corner and disappear. Then seconds later there were 3 more balls of red. One came out the bottom center, the other to the right of that one and the third came out from the right hand corner, all disappeared in a flash. The triangle stayed at that size and was still slowly moving up into the sky. Moments later I heard an airplane coming from behind me, I turned around and it was going at a high rate of speed towards the triangle. I&apos;m not good with distances but if you out strecthed your arms this is about how far the plane was from the triangle, then the triangle suddenly just disappeared! Then out of the corner of my eye I saw 2 more airplanes coming in the same direction as the first plane. I looked and saw the first plane had turned around coming back towards me. These planes didn&apos;t sound like jets, just regular planes, but I couldn&apos;t figure out how come they were moving so fast. I was shaking, it was so amazing I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off of it, I could&apos;ve went inside and grabbed my mom&apos;s camera as she always has it right on a shelf handy, but I was afaid it would be gone and I didn&apos;t want to miss a second of it.

This was long before the paranormal was widely accepted, and there was no knowledge of this reporting entity. The report that follows is actually two seperate incidents that occurred within a short time of one another, within 1/4 mile of each other on the same farm.As a farmer one must always be aware of the conditions of your farm, and everything on it.  You must stay aware of your field conditions, your water supply, and the condition of your livestock. You also keep an eye turned to the sky for your weather reports.  While checking the fields and livestock one day, my father noticed three large patches of green grass in the northernmost field on our farm. This field was the most secluded part of the farm,sloping down toward the north, away from the nearest roadway over 3/4 of a mile away,and tucked in between huge areas of timber 400 acres to the east and north, and even more meeting it, and wrapping all the way around to the west, stretching on to the south.  The patches of grass were round,smoothly round, not irregular, and roughly 6 feet across.  The patches were in a perfect triangle shape with approximately 15 to 20 feet between circle. At this time of the year in southwest Missouri, after a long hot summer there is no fresh green grass, with most of the field turning quite brown by this time, and having been grazed down short by the cattle, and sheep.   These patches however were dark green and lush, like fresh spring grass,and stood out in sharp contrast with the field around them.  There had been no water available other than rain fall, and this was pasture land so it was never fertilized.  This same phenomenon was seen in this same at slightly different locations on two or three other times in the years before and after this event.  I have no explanation of the cause, but the reports I have been hearing in recent times of the frequent sighting of triagle UFO&apos;s struck a chord with me, triggering the memories of these unusual triangles in the grass.The second incident took place in the field immediatly southeast of where the circles were seen slightly later in the same year, in mid October.  When we went to the farm to make our daily stock count, and field check we found what had been one of our sheep.  I say it that way because the sheep, 100-120 lb ewelooked as if it had been hit by a giant lawnmower, or as I used to tell peoplel like she was cut to pieces then dropped from a great height. She was scattered like when you take a hand full of confetti,hold up your hand then suddenly open your hand and let it drop.  This was not an animal attack.  Running a large flock of sheep teaches you the signs of that. Coyotes will attack a single sheep then eat the parts it wants. Dogs run through the flock slashing, and killing as a game often eating nothing. This ewe was very different.  There was no blood at the sight, the skull was completely missing, as were the hooves,and heart with most of the rest just looking like it blew up.  This was a one time thing,with investigations revealing nothing,but there were wide reports of animal mutilations in the region at this time. I report these incidents here due to the proximity to each other, and the fact we had previously had a good  clear UFO sighting over this area, of probably 30+ minutes in duration, and being seen by my extented family, of aunt, uncle, cousins, and grandparents, as well as my immediate family of four.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It flew as gracefully as a bird, incidentally one of the reasons this may be a misidentification.  The craft was in the shape of a black wing.  It flew  around in circles first up the Mississippi toward me, asscending some.  At its closest point, I saw what seemed to be manufactured rather than somethin of God&apos;s hand.  If it was a bird, it would have been close enough to make out more clearly.  I could see that it was shaped as a wing, and looked further off.  Then for about four minutes, I watched as it turned and moved southward away from me along the river.  During the ladder half of this encounter, it was joined by a smaller object, along the treeline.

Then a second later, the craft sped up with extreme, high velocity across the sky and suddenly turned into a bright, yellowish fireball-orb.  It raced across the sky with great speed and made a quick zigzag motion before flying out across the southeast direction of the horizon.

Having seen numerous anomalous sightings from my patio looking east in recent weeks, I scanned the sky for another.  Within moments I saw a &quot;fast-mover,&quot; a dim sphere travelling due south at a good clip -- a bit faster than, say, a jet or a satellite.  Through binocs, it was circular and reminiscent of the others I&apos;ve seen recently, appearing to reflect the sun a bit.  It was halfway between horizon and zenith to the east.  As I watched it through binocs, it travelled into a feathery cloud, and I didn&apos;t see it come out the other side.  Lowering the binocs, I noted that the cloud was not very large at all, so it was odd that the object didn&apos;t come out the other side, and I looked but couldn&apos;t find it with the naked eye either.  I noted that the clouds, which appeared to be cirrus and rather sparse, thus higher than cumulus clouds, were moving slowly northward.Just a few moments later, at 3 PM, I saw this object or another one which seemingly suddenly appeared almost directly overhead.  It was shining as bright as Vega but in the daytime sky.  It remained absolutely motionless, mimicking a star, for about 3 minutes, while clouds approached slowly from the south.  Through binocs it appeared to be a perfectly circular, white object, with the typical thin crescent of darker &quot;shadow&quot; area on its side opposite the sun.  It remained steady and very bright as I gazed at it through binoculars.  I lowered the binocs briefly as a cloud moved into the area of the sphere, and then looked again through binocs.  Now I noticed what I thought was something different -- a solid BLACK sphere moving through the cloud.  (Since the cloud itself was moving, for the moment I couldn&apos;t tell if the apparent movement of the object was an illusion or real.)  However, I soon saw that it was the same apparent object, only when it was in front of the clouds it was pure black, and when it moved out of the cloud (or the cloud moved away from it) it became instantly pure white again against the blue sky.  I watched as the apparent colour changed instantaneously.  If this foreground/background colour change is a known phenomenon with rubber balloons, I&apos;ve never known of it before; anyway the object did not appear to be a balloon.  At 3.05 I noticed it had moved from its stationary position just south of an overhead wire to the north, by several degrees, and then it started heading to the east/northeast rather slowly, until by about 3.08 it had passed behind some trees and continued out of sight, now lower than half-way between horizon and zenith as it travelled away from me.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting the report.

We saw the individual dot for about 5 seconds.  We watched it move behind us, when, we noticed another shape made up of about 10 points of white light in a chevron formation with a somewhat soft point seem to intercept the single dot.  The larger shape passed from a far point behind us, all the way over us, then disappear into the horizon in about 10 seconds.  While there were no visible clouds, the sky was partly hazy or fuzzy.

RainierMy friend and I are amature astronomers and we often like to take our telescopes to the relatively dark skies around Mt. Rainier. On the night of 8-19-04 while we were setting up our scopes and checking on the sky condition we noticed what appeard to be two satelites slowly moving together so we grabbed our binoculars to take a closer look. In the binoculars we could see a third light in the formation. The lights moved in a tight isosceles triangle formation about two degrees across with the sharpest angle at the front. Stars could be seen unaffected inside the formation. There was no sound. The lights moved across the sky in a northwest to southeast direction and maintained their exact positions in the formation. After traveling about 45 degrees across the sky the lead light disappeared followed by the other two lights that disappeared together exactly at the same line in space where the first light disappeared.  This is the second time we have observed this  type of phenomenon by Mt. Rainier. The first time occurred August 12,2001 3:20am. That sighting was similar to this one except that there were two lights moving in a south to north direction with the third member of the formation catching up to the first two lights it than slowed down and moved over towards the second of the two lights and then all three lights moved northward together maintaining their exact positions to each other. The formation continued to traveled northward for about 5 min. until we could&apos;nt see it anymore with our binoculars.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the objects may have been the satellites thought by us to be part of the  U.S.Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; satellite system.

We were amazed at the number of satellites &amp; shooting stars evident in the clear night sky and observed for a period of time.  Because we were focusing on the sky above our property facing south we (my wife and I) noticed a large peculiar triangular shaped object slowly moving southward towards Calgary fly right overtop of us.  What I initially thought was why are we not hearing any sound from such a large low flying object.As mentioned and better appreciated from my sketch of the object it was very large and if I could relate it to something it would be large enough to fill a football stadium. There were 5 disctint lights within the triangle and were very dimly lit with a light low enough that if we were not looking at the exact right spot we would not have even noticed it even based on it&apos;s size.  It blended very well with the clear and dark night sky so well that if it had just been myself witnessing it I would have written it off as my eyes playing with me but thankfully my wife witnessed it as well.  We know it is strange and even tried to see if it blocked out stars above it to confirm an object and sure enough we could not see the stars directly above it.

I remember that sometimes when getting to Austin using this road I would see the military jets landing at Bergstrom AFB. It was about 9:30 pm or so, it was pitch dark and a bit cloudy. So I am driving when, suddenly, I see through the top of my windshield this object that looked like a football, glowing bright green, so much so that the green light reflected off the few clouds above. This reflection made it real for me at that moment because my brain said, &quot;this cannot be imagined, the light is actually reflecting off the clouds!&quot; And I remember thinking that the object could not have been too high off the ground, maybe 300-400 feet off the ground or so it seemed. It was flying the same direction I was driving and I was startled to say the least. So I leaned forward on the steering wheel to see it better when, suddenly, it just shoots off towards Austin extremely fast and doesn&apos;t go more that 20 yards before it just disappears.I was utterly fascinated, I think I noticed a car in front of me a couple of hundred yards but it didn&apos;t stop. So I pulled over, just to see the whole sky and to, I guess, get a grip on reality by just looking at the spot where I had witnessed this event. So I am standing next to the car, looking at the sky, when to my left, across the road, into the forest, in the distance, I noticed like smoke and glowing red/orange lights; it looked like a fire but I was not sure. I think I then climbed onto the hood of the car to have a better look when all of a sudden I felt fear, a gripping fear that made me think, &quot;hey, you better get out of here, get in the car and get out of here, this is just too weird.&quot; I got back into the car and drove outta there and didn&apos;t stop till I got to Austin and told my girlfriend about it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The next day, 7/8/04, I decided to lounge on the patio during the afternoonto read magazines and scan the sky periodically for another sighting.  It took awhile to be rewarded for the wait, but at 5.55 PM I saw what appeared to be the same object from the day before, again, in nearly the idential eastern placement in the sky.  Again, through binocs, it was a single sphere, apparently reflecting the sun, but not glinting.  I watched it as it very slowly moved toward the south, passing BEHIND one small cloud which itself was drifting generally northward.  (The local online weather details indicated a north wind in Denver, though I&apos;m not sure at what time or altitude that stat was documented).  As previously, this object gradually faded out of sight, though it was visible for about 10 minutes total, until 6.05, during which time it had moved only a few degrees.  NOTABLY:  Less than 1/2 hour later, the same or a similar object AGAIN appeared, but several degrees north of the location where the earlier one had disappeared, and once again it very slowly headed to the south/perhaps SE as it gradually faded in intensity.  Second event lasted from 6.30 to 6.38 PM.  Using Occam&apos;s razor, I started thinking about these 4 sightings which had occurred in a 30-hour period, and there are several things worth noting:  1) I did not change the focus on the binoculars from the time I saw the distant, near-stationary object SUDDENLY accelerate during yesterday&apos;s sighting, indicating it was the same object and not the result of an unintentional, split second &quot;blink of the eye&quot; viewfinder adjustment to something closer to me (for instance, cotton from a cottonwood tree)and besides, the speeding object looked identical in size and shape to the steady object, 2) in addition, this time of year there is no cotton drifting in the air,  3) the object was relatively stationary and steady in intensity -- rather unlike a balloon might appear if drifti! ng in upper level winds, and 4) the object moved slowly southward while the clouds at apparently a similar altitude were drifting northward.

It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon, with bright blue skies and a few of those puffy marshmallow-type clouds so typical of summer in these parts. I was using my body weight to brace an upright from behind, while my neighbor drilled screws into the fence sections from the other side, and had my head turned to the left facing west. I noticed a persistent contrail (a &quot;chemtrail&quot;) was being laid in the western sky, coming in my direction, so I kept my eyes on it, as I had nothing better to do and realized in short order that this particular chemtrail was rather unusual: it was what researchers into this phenemonon refer to as an &quot;intermittent&quot; chemtrail - in other words it was not a single long contrail but rather was broken up into many shorter pieces almost like a morse code in the skies...dot, space, dot, space, dash, space, dot, space, dash, space, dash, etc. - obviously *not* an ordinary contrail. The plane itself was quite difficult to see immediately in front of its trail, and for some reason seemed to be most visible in the intervening open spaces. I finally lost the plane and leading edge of the trail behind some nearby buildings in the backyard, but the intermittent chemtrail itself was very cohesive and retained its shape so I kept watching it to see if another plane would come over the horizon. I had in mind to compare a follow-up contrail to the first. After watching for 2 or 3 minutes, I was stunned to see a very large and bright silvery object shoot through an open space in the original chemtrail path, in other words from one side of the trail, through an open space, to the next section of the chemtrail. Whatever this thing was, it was obviously following the trajectory of the chemtrail perfectly. I was unable to see any wings on this craft nor was I able to hear any sounds from it, but it obviously was metallic as inferred by the very bright silvery flash it made when out in the open and reflecting the sun. The entire sighting actually lasted less than one second, and if I hadn&apos;t been lucky enough to be looking in precisely the right spot I never would have seen it. By the way, I referred to my sighting as &quot;cigar-shaped&quot; but that impression may have been due simply to the speed of the sighting...this event happened so quickly that it&apos;s possible I suppose, that the object could have been almost *any* geometrical shape.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Mr. Davenport, this is a correction and an addendum to my original report filed recently, from Fargo, ND. The correct date of my sighting was Sunday, 8 August, 2004, and not the 6th as I&apos;d originally entered. My sighting as I&apos;ve stated happened very very quickly, but after running or looping it over and over again through the camera of my mind, I came up with a few more details: I actually saw the craft twice. The first time was a very bright flash, which alerted me to focus my attention on that small area of the sky. This was obviously a result of the bright sun reflecting off of the surface of this bright silvery craft and also occured in a gap of the chemtrail, but more distant. A very brief interval later, the craft came shooting out the end of another break in the chemtrail in plain sight but moving very fast. For some reason the dark band running from the front to the back of the craft that I mentioned in my original report, has now resolved itself in my mind to be a row of very dark windows which also reflected the sunlight, and the shape of the craft seems nearer an ovoid or large circlular shape rather than cigar-shaped. Also and for what it&apos;s worth, it almost seems as if the craft STOPPED for the briefest of intervals, the instant it breeched the chemtrail and then continued on its way, but this may only be my mind trying to explain to itself something highly anamolous.((END ADDENDUM))", "There was a flash in the sky for less than a second then about 2 seconds it appeared again lower down in the sky then in another far position then probibly once more before disappearing.

It appeared round and stuck out like a sore thumb as it was completely dark and the sky was very clear without any trace of clouds.

We could see the lights of the city through the V shape at the bottom of the mountain valley and the full moon was almost straight S/SE and at maybe a 70 degree angle up. We had NO lights on at the time as we were watching the stars and moon. My father brought to my attention a glowing single lighted object moving above the mountain ridge to the west of us and traveling south. (this would be to our right side maybe 1/8-1/4 mile away) The entire object glowed in a constant white light and seemed large and elongated. We could see it through and above the trees depending on its position as it was above and on the opposite side of the mountian ridge from our view point. While moving south along and above the ridge it would stop and hover, move at right angles up and down for a period of maybe two minutes before it circled around to the left (easterly direction) at the far south end of the mountain ridge. (this next part took maybe 3 or 4 minutes) Then it gained in altitude and stopped almost straight south of our view and hovered at maybe a 40 degree angle from our position over what seemed to be the north west area above the city of Colo. Springs just east of the foot hills. It must have been 7-10 miles away from us by this time, maybe more, but was still big enough to see its elongated shape. While it hung in this position two bright orange objects slowly came out of this UFO (about a minute apart). One from the top and then one from the bottom. Once they were a short distance above or below the craft they shoot off at an incredible rate of speed in opposite directions (east and west)and disappeared immediately. I then noticed a very high flying Jet coming from our left side (east)and traveling south west. It was traveling very fast and seemed to be headed directly for the hovering UFO. I speculate maybe 12,000 ft high. I mentioned to my father that it seemed like it was heading straight at the UFO and wondered what would happen when it got close. When the jet did get close to this object (UFO) it accelerated up and out at a +/- 45 degree angle straight south and disappeared out of sight in maybe 1 or 2 seconds. Just like a scene in &quot;Star Trek&quot; when they go into warp. I have never seen anything accelerate that fast in my life except for a SciFi movie. At no time during this entire sighting did this object make any noise what so ever. I have not shared this story with many people through the years and recently had a massive heart attack and felt it was time to tell my story while I can.((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness have his father submit a report, as well, if that would be possible.  PD))", "Yellow/Red Slow Moving Craft and Two Flashing Starlike Objects Over Lacey, WATraveling, by car, north on Ruddell Rd SE, starting at the junction of Ruddell and Yelm Hwy, I noticed a bright yellow light about 40 degrees above the horizon. The light appeared to be traveling slowly south-southwest. I initially thought it was a planet, but it was clearly moving. I then assumed it was an aircraft. However, I could see no other lights and no flashing on the craft. As I turned east onto Mullen Rd I noticed that the light had turned red and appeared elongated. This change prompted me to pull into a parking lot to get a better look. At the same moment I noticed two smaller starlike objects in the same area of the sky. They flashed like strobe lights, and appeared to jump up and down as they continued on their trajectories. There was also an easily identified airplane flying east of the objects, apparently at the same altitude. The objects eventually went behind some tall trees and I lost sight of them. My conclusions: the red object may have been a blimp or some kind of personal craft. I suspect the craft had a yellow headlight or spotlight, which ceased to be visible as I traveled north and as the craft passed me moving south. The starlike objects could have been very high altitude jets passing over the region coincidentally. Because of the flashing of the starlike objects, it was hard to tell their flight paths. One or both of them may have changed direction, but I am not certain of this. The main reason I&apos;m reporting this incident is that others in the region may have seen it and may be able to provide more information. Observer background: I am a hospital manager with an MBA and more than a passing interest in astronomy and the UFO phenomenon.", "Triangle shaped craft with three lightsTwo of my friends and I were on a beach in Olympia WA relaxing.  We had a fire burning on the beach, a pretty big fire as a matter of fact. As we looked out towards Puget Sound we seen what we thought was a Stealth Bomber flying slow from the north towards us.  At the time we spotted it we estimated it was approximately 5 miles away.  I know a Stealth bomber is black but it had lights on the corners and it appeared to be shaped like a triangle. We thought it might have been from Whidbey island where Navy planes take off from. However it was moving very slow towards us and low. We estimate that it was approximately 500 feet above the water and closing. As it got closer we did not get nervous but excited. What was weird is that we started to feel like we had static electricity on our bodies, kind of like an electrical charge. As it hovered right above our heads we were looking up at it when it all of a sudden vanished, not took off in some direction, but just vanished as if it disappeared.  When we looked down the fire we had just started ten minutes ago that was blazing 10 feet high was just a burned out group of charred logs. For some reason we all felt very tired and instead of building another fire we just went to our tents and went to sleep.", "approximately at 16:19 I was observing the sky (it was beautiful) and there were a few passenger planes passing, going in and out clouds. Then I noticed from far away an object coming towards me from the north (i think); it was far away so i thought to myself &quot;hm that plane looks like a UFO, but the closer it was coming the more obvious it became to me that it was UFO! It never hit the clouds, so i can say its size was smaller then the passenger airplanes (more than twice), it was flying approximately twice the speed of the planes (constant speed), but i didn&apos;t have any means to capture the image. It appeared to me as a silver shining ball, very vivid. This is first time in my life I&apos;ve seen a ufo during the day time and that vivid.

I dont know if this was a weather balloon or what but it stayed there for hours the last time i looked it was starting to get dark out and it was still there(there were no other stars yet) I took many pictures of this and can provide them to anyone who wants. it even made the local news for a while but they dont seem to be talking about it anymore. The object did seem to move very slowly in the sky over a period of many hours but i dont understand how any weather balloon could move so slowly and be visible for so long. I have no idea the altitude but i would imagine it was really high, probally 100,000 feet and the object must have been huge. There were some reports from aircraft at 35,000 that said it was still just a dot from up there. i observed it for periods of ten minutes at a time or so between going in my house and calling people to tell them to look etc. It did seem to change shape ever so slightly like it became elongated(such as what a weather ballon would do) it also appeared to emit small pulses of light off it.((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the Twin Cities area.

We went outside to our driveway and saw a reddish-blue object at about 50 degrees azimuth off the horizon in the Northwest sky about the size of Mars or Venus but brighter, with what seemed to be flashing rotating red, blue, green &amp; yellow lights. My first impression was that it was a planet but upon closer observation we both saw that it was moving left to right and up and down without any specific pattern. The movement suggested that the object was &quot;hovering&quot;. The movement would be as much as 5-7 degrees in either direction at medium speed. I then noticed what appeared to be an aircraft with a blue light approach the object from the West and disappear once it reached the object. After the apparent aircraft disappeared the &quot;hovering&quot; movement resumed and the flashing lights took on a different characteristic of rhythmic pulsing. I then went upstairs and got my video camera and began taping. This continued for 3 hours until we both became so sleepy that we had to go back to bed.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be serious-minded.

Said to wife that a childs balloon got away, but it held my attention and I didn&apos;t know why at first.  It was rising beneath a mammatus cloud formation and the wind was blowing 20 to 30 mph.  At first it looked like a solid white balloon that had been released from a nearby shopping center seconds earlier; like an 18&quot; balloon that was maybe 150 feet up. As I and my wife watched we both said that it was no balloon of any kind because it was rising straight up with no sideways movement at all.  Second, it was moving way too fast to be a helium balloon.  It was at this point that I had the impression that the object wasn&apos;t as close to me as I first thought.  It continued to rise in a non-swirling uninterrupted manner until it was about 80 to 85 degrees over head from horizontal. I had been viewing this through an open window of a car to this point.  I looked down to open the door and get out to continue viewing.  When I looked back up I no longer saw it beneath the dark clouds where I expected to find it once more. Instead, I saw a black dot moving in a northerly direction at 90 degrees to the direction the white object was moving in seconds before.

So what ever It was it seemed to be moving to reposition itself to be camouflaged against the sky...But unlike others which I have noticed over airports at times this object was in the same area moving again to &quot;reposition&quot; itself with a flash or glint of sun reflecting off a silver metal disc before totally disappearing. I slow down and check to hear engines or see if it is a small plane.

A small flash of light caught my eye in the sky between my trees and the neighboring apartment roof.  I looked at the lights about seven in all as it moved just a few degrees off south.  The lights were white in color, and in a V pattern.  I stood up because the lights were moving very fast, and I was going to loose sight of it.  My first thought was that it is a very fast airplane, but I couldn&rsquo;t hear any noise, just that of the city.  I couldn&rsquo;t tell how far away the lights were or how big the object was.  As I watch trying to think what I was looking at, it moved straight to the west (right) without any wing tip or signal.  It was as if it was going forward then just moved to the right without stopping.  I just said what the hell, still trying to make something out of what I was seeing.  The lights then began going out as if the object had some thickness.  The problem with this I couldn&rsquo;t see the object.  This I can explain, after all it was very dark and if the object were black I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see it in the dark sky.  This incident only took a few seconds and the object moved very fast.  My only explanation would be a B2 bomber with landing lights on; I just can&rsquo;t explain the turn. Thank you ((name deleted)). I already filed this report earlier today.

I was living in a trailer house in Salina, Ks in a small trailer court on the southeast cornner of the intersection of Cloud and Broadway street&apos;s. The trailer set lenght way&apos;s north and south on the lot, with the front or front room&#x5C;kitchen to the north. The layout of the trailer was the front north the first room is the kitchen, then the living room, two small bedroom&apos;s the bathroom then the master bedroom on the south end. There was a hallway that ran from the living room down the east side of the trailer to the master bedroom. With two outside doorway&apos;s, one from the livingroom to the front porch just off the kichen and the second back door down the hall across from the bathroom. It was probley around 11 or 11:30 at night and I had just gone to the back bedroom to to to sleep. I hadent been in bed for very long when I heard a very loud bang or exsplosion (ever put a cherrybomb in a metal trash can?) right out the south bedroom window not but a few feet from my head. I was just starting to setup in bed to go out to see who was messing around. And right when I got ready to swing my feet from the bed to get up I noticed something on the east wall of the hall some four feet down from the back door. There was a spot on the wall glowing kind of orange in color and as I sat frozen in bed watching this spot it slowly grew bigger around and came outward from the wall in a glowing dome of light on the dark brown wood paneling of the wall, and ever so slowly it grew bigger and then a more solid core of this thing started to come threw until it emerged completly into a glowing orb of redish&#x5C;orange light. And as it was floating across the hall some two feet above the floor then started to go threw the wall between the hall and bedroom I saw another spot start to form on the outside hall wall this time a greenish&#x5C;yellow in color and it slowly grew in size and came into the house into the hallway and as it was coming into the hall the first redish one was slowly going threw the other wall into the second bedroom. Then the greenish one moved across the hall to go into the wall and into the bedroom after the first one. The doorway of the bedroom was open and as I lay there half out of bed frozen in wonder at what I was seeing and watch one then the other of these ball&apos;s of light come into the house and float aross the hall and go threw the wall into the bedroom I could see the light grow brighter and bigger as they came threw the wall from outside and the full brightness and size of them while they where in direct veiw in the hallway and as they kind of dimmed down as they moved threw the bedroom wall and as the first one was going threw the bedroom wall a notice as the full brightness of it th! at was in the hallway dimmed down and as part of it&apos;s light no longer came from the hall but slowly started coming out of the open doorway of the bedroom until the light from the first one came more and more from the doorway and less from the hall and all the while the first one&apos;s light changed from the hall to coming out of the doorway the second one was coming threw the outside wall into the hall until by the time the light from the first was coming from just the door way and now the second one was now fully in the hall in all of it&apos;s brightness and size and then it too slowly went across the hall to start to go threw the bedroom wall into the second bedroom fallowing the path of the first and it&apos;s light slowly changed from just coming from the hall to slowly starting to come out of the doorway until it too was  in the bedroom with the first one and I could no longer see eaither one of them but only there light coming out of the doorway and I could see the angle of the light change as they move across the bedroom until the redish&#x5C;orange light of the first one slowly started to dimm and then the light of it went out completly and then the second greenish&#x5C;yellow one slowly dimmed down to go out after the first one. I set there as I had the entire time half setting up in bed  in the darkness now that the light from the orb&apos;s had gone. Then I got out of bed and pulled on my jean&apos;s and went out the back doorway and around the south end of the trailer to the west yard to try to see where the ball&apos;s of light had gone to but I could see no sign of  them, there was another trailer that set to the west of mine and I looked at the window&apos;s  to see if I could see the light of the orb&apos;s coming from them thinking that maybe they had gone into it as they had mine but I could see no sign of them.  After looking around and up into the night sky for a few minute&apos;s I gave up and went back in and went back to bed and fell quickly asleep as if nothing much had happened at all. The lenght of time of this sighting is about 2 to 3 minute&apos;s? The orb&apos;s&#x5C;ball&apos;s of light about two to three feet in diameter of the outer corona of light coming out from the more solid inter core of the center wich was about a foot across.

And to the best I am able to tell they are of the same type of craft&#x5C;probe or whatever they are. And they had a feeling about them that they where somehow alive or at least controled by some intelegant being? And one thing that has alway&apos;s puzzeled me is how while it was all going on how in wonder and amazement I felt and then how after it was over I could just forget about it all and go to sleep as if nothing had happened at all. It was only year&apos;s latter when I thought about it any at all that I wished that I would of thought to get out of bed and touched one of them to see what would happen and to know for shure that they where real by touching them, but then maybe that would&apos;nt have been such a smart thing to do?

They looked like many of the objects in home movies objects seen in Mexico. I framed them against a tall building to see if they were moving and they were not. The wind was moving the clouds at a pretty good rate so I didn&apos;t think they were ballons. They seemed above the clouds. Then, one by one, they slowly moved to the south. As they started moving and with all the cloud cover, I lost them pretty quickly. I wished I had a pair of binoculars and the next week I put a pair in the truck.

It was red, and as it made its way towards us, I could tell that it was maybe no larger than the house.  It was red, very red, like it was pulsating, as it had the bright blue sky as a background.  It had no reflection, I remember because I thought that it should since the sunlight was hitting it, any metallic object might reflect.  When it stopped above the power lines, about fifty feet above us, it was then when my half-sister saw it as well.  I remember that it just hovered, and seemed to make a dull low-throbbing sound.  As it hovered, my half-sister began to yell and ran inside to get our parents.  While I stood there, the object just hung out, perhaps moving ever so slightly.  It seemed to be looking at me.  Then just as my half-sister came out, the object zipped a bit to the sides, and then shot straight up and disappeared. No trails, no sounds.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I didn&apos;t think anything of it when i first saw the object but became curious when i noticed that there were flashing lights on the object.  Although i realize there are lights on such things as aircrafts it caught my attention because the object was stationary or &quot;just floating&quot; like a wieghtless object. The lights were a bright red.  They would also fade in and out and a bright white light would be present. The object was a little  distance away so i could not observe it&apos;s exact shape.  From the different angles which i saw the lights from it seemed to be a fair size.  After observing the object for some time a few strange things started to happen.  As i stared at the object it seemed as there were flashes of light on the treetops.  This may be a result of me starring at these lights for some time.  Another strange thing that occured after about 15 minutes of observation was that all the silouhettes from houses andtrees seemed to dissappear and all that could be focused on was the lights.  it was almost as if i was being hypnotized.  the only way i could see the houses or the treetops were if i closed my eyes or looked away for a few seconds but they would dissappear shortly after.  This may not have been due to the object but i observed a very faint flashing white light.  There was no solid light (one that was on for any duration of time) but it would appear and dissapear every few seconds.  The object was statonary for about 15 minutes and then the most amazing thing happened.  It started moving in very eratic patterns without a sound. It would be siting there and all of a sudden it would move up and down then stop.  It would move diagonally and turn so sharply that it amazed me.

That plane is really low!&quot; She peered out of the front window and said, &quot;That&apos;s no plane!&quot;  Just as she said that, I realized that despite it being very very low (we could see the lights on it) there was no noise. It hovered over the school and then took off to the west at a leisurely pace. It was in no hurry. We followed it with no problem down the road about a mile or two and then made a turn towards town. We could still see it without any trouble. Then, it started to descend into a clump of trees. That area had been a house but the house had been torn down due to it being right near a toxic dumpsite.

It was heading directly over my head when it suddenly stopped and then about 5 seconds later just vanished. The sky is very clear with no clouds whatsoever and where it vanished was among a number of stars. As far as I am aware, satelites cannot just stop in mid orbit and neither can high flying planes.

After the object went out of view, I stared at the sky for a couple of minutes, then started to go back to work when I heard the sound of a jet engine out of the southeast. I spotted the jet, and could make out the delta wing. It was up around 30,000 feet flying a wide S patern coming up behind whe object&apos;s path screaming at well over mach 1. If the object was at 30,000 feet, I would estimate it to be the size of the space shuttle with a ground speed of over mach 2.", "Shimmering star-like objcet that dulls into a metal oval.The driver saw a glimmering object in the sky moving slowy that appeared like a shimmering star, however this was still daytime.

I could see stars and what I thought was the moon though it seemed odd that this small `moon` had a kind of orange glow around it. I continued to look at it when to my astonishment this shape began to move across the screen in such a way that it was clearly not the moon or a star. For two minutes I watched it as it moved across the screen in an S-shape. Occasionally during this 2 minute period it disappeared from view only to reappear again in a slightly different place. Because of this it could have been possible I was witnessing more than one UFO. I am a 28yo male and this is my first experience of this kind and I am writing this report because there is no rational explanation for what I saw. All other passengers appeared to be asleep when this happened and I did not confer with any of the flight staff/pilots etc about what I saw.", "Ball of light moving at a rapid speed.The ufo I saw was a white ball. It was at a fairly high altitude and moving at a speed that would not have been a jet or plane. I was sitting on the backyard swing about 8 p.m. central/standard time Saturday, Aug. 7th, and looked down on the ground for only a couple of seconds to pick up some trash underneath the swing and when I looked back up at the sky in the clearing was this ball of light that had just appeared out of nowhere in a vast clearing in the sky. It was moving quite swiftly. I live not far from the airport here and I can say with certainty that there were no strobe lights as required by the AFA as well as this being a perfectly shaped ball. When a plane is at that altitude it simply cannot appear to move as fast as this ball of light was doing. It was making a straight shot through the sky, had no sound, and left no chemtrails of any kind, nor was it losing any altitude like a meteor particle or falling star would. It moved across a vast opening in the sky in 30 seconds or less and had this been a plane I would have sat and watched it for several minutes before it made that distance.

I was facing north and suddenly a bright light caught my right eye fronm the right side of the Milky way ( I think that is that cloudy apperanced). When I looked directly at it, it grew very large and bright and seemed to be coming directly at me. It grew to be larger than any of the stars (or planets) in the sky, I am certain the &quot;Morning Star&quot; would have been covered completly by it were they aligned.

Me and the family were packing our camping trailer, because we were headed to South Dakota on a camping trip. Our camper was parked in the backyard of our house. We have a small cludder of trees right behind the house, but nowhere near to blocking my view of a strange object moving against the SE wind in the sky, almost directly above me, as I was standing next to the camper, loading some silverware and misc. items into the camper. As I had finished, I looked up into the sky, searching for any storm clouds, as it was windy that day, yet pretty hot and a bit humid. The weather forcast recently had described several showers in our area, therefore I was searching to see if we were going to get poured on while packing. It was 2:30 or so in the afternoon, and as I was searching the sky, I saw a small circular object, the color of white, moving against the wind. The wind speed was about 10 - 15 mph, heading SE, with sudden strong gusts, which leaded me to guess a cold front was moving in, with the present warm front already in the area. The object was far out into the sky, near the clouds that I had seen. Some of these clouds were rather thin, but a few large cumulonimbus clouds could be seen headed our way, near Big Creek lake. This object was definately not an airplane or satellite, because it moved in strange patterns. It also left a very very faint trail as it made sudden bursts of speed. First, it moved at a steady pace going North, then it would suddenly jerk towards the West. As I watched for 2 minutes, the object seemed to be making strange, sudden movements in the sky, the slowing down  to almost a stop. It almost looked as if it was zig-zagging in the sky, but at incredible speed. Its speed would change dramatically every few seconds. Within 3 minutes of watching this object, a few clouds came by it, and it seemed to do more of its jerky movements, then it slowed down again, only this time whipping around one of the clouds. As the cloud that the strange object had hidden behind passed, the object had dissapeared, and then reappeared just left of its original location. I was so amazed at this, I quickly made my way into the house and got the camera. I came back, and the object was still there, making slow movements, and then sudden jerks in the sky. I took a picture of 2 of it, and had my parents send the film in right away. The strange thing is, I never got these 2 pictures back, as I remember my mom bringing home the set of pictures, and I could not find the snapshots. I was furious. The object was again, circular, white color, and was rather small, as it was far out into the sky, perhaps the same altitude as the clouds. After I had taken a picture of the object, it came to a stop, and then again whipped around another cloud. I waited for it to pass, but as I searched, the object had dissapeared. It never reappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "On Highway 66, a little after the city of victorville and before barstow. A bright reflection caught my eye. I was driving, my grandmother was in the passenger seat. I thought it was a plane but then noticed two of them, so I thought they were jets from the nearby airforce base. I noticed that they changed shape, the best I can describe it was like from a disk shape to a blobby orb shape. Then they would disappear then reappear. This is when i freaked out and asked my grandmother to look at the sky. I pulled over to try to convince myself that they were airplanes but there was nothing in sight. I did an internet search to see if I can find information which I did so now I am a believer.", "Lighted Triangle object hovers by major interstateMy wife, daughter and I were driving from Ankeny, Ia to Des Moines, Ia which is about a 12 mile drive.  As soon as I got onto I-35s in Ankeny I could see 2 bright lights in the sky and a decent altitude.  I thought it was an aircraft approaching the Ankeny airport which is a small facility that handles small planes.  The object didn&apos;t move though as I kept traveling and it seemed to get lower the closer I got to it.  When I was about a mile from the object I could finally make out a good description.  3 white lights formed in a triangle with a strange red light in the middle.  As I passed it I looked up and could see the smooth red light moving back and forth.  I turned around on the next exit and went back, but it was gone.  I&apos;ve never seen a tower in that area that looked like that and I&apos;ve never seen a plane with that red light. My wife also noticed 3 cars stopped along the side of the road apparently not working. When I got back home I called my friend who was at the Iowa State Fair to tell hime to watch the skies.  The reason being is that my &quot;sighting&quot; was very near the fairgrounds(3 miles).  He told me the next day that the only thing he saw was the news helicopter that was filming overhead get escorted away by 2 military type helicopters.", "Blinking star.I was in my backyard at 10:30pm. I noticed a blinking light very high up in the Northern sky. It blinked 4 or 5 times while I watched and then stopped blinking. The intervals between blinks was about 3 or 4 seconds. I thought it might be a plane at first (planes and helicopters are always flying above where I live). I was thinking that maybe the blinking was actually a plane headlight and the light was bouncing back from some thick clouds or smog which would give me the illusion that it was a blinking light. But the light never moved the whole time I watched and it was completely quiet and clear outside. No sound of a plane at all. It stayed in the original point I first found it in the entire time. When it stopped blinking I couldn&apos;t help but stare intently at the location it had been in. I stared for what was probably 20 seconds at that exact spot. Then, from exactly that point in the sky, I saw the largest, brightest most colorful shooting stars I have ever seen. The trail covered 1/3 of the sky as it shot past and the head of this thing was bright reddish colored and the red color appeared to be lining the sides of the outer edge of the front of the trail. It was stunning. I admit that this blinking light could have been anything and the shooting star could just be a tremendous coincendence. Personally, I have never witnessed anything quite like it but it would be great to find out what it could have been.", "Bright white sphere of light 45 degrees from horizon changing into three smaller lights when closer to the groundFrom a distance in the full moon night sky (blue moon) saw a bright white light too large and close to be a star.

Went to beach to eat ice cream and getting out of the car being especially aware of the sky saw multiple brighter than star lights hovering overhead, one in particular more bright and closer than any other.  After 10 mins or so heard a noise from behind and saw a boomerang shaped triangle shadowed by three circular lights.

I was working at what was then HomeDepot as a &quot;runner&quot;. It was around 9:15-9:30pm, closing time, and I was responsible for &quot;shagging&quot; shopping carts out of the parking lot. Typically during business hours the parking lot flood lights are on to help customers get to there cars. After closing time the lights are turned off at this particular site. While I was out tracking down some carts I happened to look up and noticed a black, rectangular object silently fly directly over head. The object was all black with no running lights. The object made no sound. It appeared very smooth as I did not view any surface features. In fact the only way I noticed it was from the reflection of the street/city lights off the bottom of the craft. I would say the craft was anywhere from 500-1000ft from the ground and maybe 100-150ft across. It was a clear night and the craft was as black as the night sky if not slightly darker. It was heading due North. The whole event lasted about 10secs. Another point of interest is that McClellan AFB is about 1-2 miles west of sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

First object  continued west.At the time of this sighting, I lived South of Brookley Field, an old Air Force base shut down in the 60&apos;s, now a commercial industrial park with a still active airport. I believe it was late spring or early summer in the mid 1980&apos;s (possibly 1984-1985). It was shortly after 5:00 p.m. on a bright cloudless evening. The sun was in the west and the sky was still blue. I saw a shiny metallic object about the size of a lower-case &quot;o&quot; flying east to west, north of my location. At the time, I was relatively knowledgeable about many different types of aircraft. Brookley Field was and is still an active airport, and there were military airshows held there occasionally. The first thing I noticed was the object appeared to be reflecting the light of the sun, it did not appear to be producing it&apos;s own light. There was no contrail. It was travelling steadily due west. I first assumed it was a high-flying airplane. It then, without slowing down, stopped in mid air. I thought it may have been a helocopter, but it was higher in the sky than I had ever seen one before. I moved over to where I could see the object and a tree for purposes of verifying that it had indeed become stationary and to use the tree for a reference point. While I was observing the object, another object appeared to come from the first object. This object was slightly smaller than the first, and it moved off in a southwesterly direction from the first object. It was similar in appearance to the first, shiny metallic in color. it seemed to go from a dead stop to a steady pace with no transition speed noticed. There was no contrail, or smoke behind this object either. I observed this object until it was out of sight to the southwest. The first object then continued on to the west, again going from stopped to its previous speed without any transition. It continued due west until it was out of site.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I was looking toward the west, a silver ball of light caught my eye.  This light moved from south to north with no noise and no flashing lights (we live near McChord AFB and SeaTac flight paths and frequently see planes in the distance).  My second thought was a bird, but the light moved very smoothly, with none of the obvious &quot;Bobbing&quot; of a bird, plus it was illuminated from the east side, not the west where the sun was setting. As I got to my front yard I could no longer see the silver light, however as I looked into the west I saw an orange colored cloud (from the sunset) off to the west.  As I looked at this cloud, I saw a gold colored ball appear.  It appeared to drop from the cloud (the best way I can describe it is like when a plane, coming out of a cloud, kind of fades into view)then travel in a northerly direction and then just flash out as if someone had turned off the switch (it could have re-entered the cloud cover, but I&apos;m not sure of this).  At first I thought someone was burning and I was seeing embers flying through the sky except that you could clearly see them come out of the cloud and move toward the north.  About the third one I saw looked like it was moving toward the ground, then went back up and continued its flight to the north.  In all I watched about 10 of these gold balls of light.  At one point there were three in the sky at the same time each appearing to come out of the cloud and then moving to the north and disappearing.  Again, there was no noise, no flashing lights, just these gold balls appearing to drop from the cloud. The entire thing lasted 5 to 10 minutes maximum.

Facing north, I am north and close to the landing pattern of Reno International. I was watching as an airliner was taking off and noticed out of the corner of my eye, a small white dot. I thought it was moving, but thought also that it could be because of the airplane taking off...they were pretty close. As the plane left sight, I noticed that this little white dot was still moving.  As I watched it heading south (in my direction), this little non blinking light lit up into this huge red light.  As it still was heading south, this red light split into two red lights...and from the second red light, it split again...totaling 3 red lights. These lights did not twinkle or have any glare. As I watched and called for everyone to come out to see...these 3 red lights split again becoming 6. Each one of the 6 had red and white lights moving in a circular pattern...and not always consistant.

I am not a good judge of aerial distances, but maybe 1000 feet in the air. It seemed likely that the object was an airplane at first, because it bore the blinking red, white, and blue lights typical of airplanes.  However, after a few blocks the object was nearly directly over me, and it definitely had the shape of an isosceles triangle with the short side not much shorter than the two even-length sides. Two aspects of this sighting made it strange. First, the object was barely moving. Although I was driving, I had slowed way down to maybe 5mph and it seemed to be hovering. Becuase the car was on, I cannot say whether it was making any noise, though I heard none over my engine. Second, after driving by the object about 5 blocks, I turned the car around to look at it again. It still seemed to be hovering, so I reached under my seat to grab my binoculars. When I looked up, it was gone. I didn&apos;t see it zip away or blink out. It simply was no longer visible. There were some high clouds, but definitely higher in altitude than the object. Of course, turning off its lights would have been sufficient to hide it from my sight. I guess I&apos;m not an unbiased reporter, since I frequently scan the sky in the hope of seeing something. However, in ~ten years of sky watching, this is the first sighting I&apos;ve felt compelled to report.", "3 hours in a UFOI was 14 at the time, skate boarding with 2 of my friends. We were coming home down an alley in the back of our house. There was an empty lot next to my house with a large elm tree about a 100 feet tall at the far end of the lot. I use to climb that tree a lot because it had a lot of branches where I could hide and spy on the people down below. As we reached the empty lot, we all gazed up, because something caught our attention. It was a real UFO hoovering above the tree line. I could see into it through a window that looked as if the blue,gray metaled UFO had opened by making that part of it transparent. There were no hard edges or frame like regular window. It was if it was all part of the ship but could make that part of it see through. As I gazed up at it, I was unbelivably exited. There were many sighting in our suburbian town through out the years and I was finally looking at one close up. Little did I know, how close up I really would get to see. I started waving at it as if to say, please give me a ride! I really did want a ride in it and I knew that they knew what I wanted. I could see two beings looking out the window at me. They appeared human. One was taller then the other. I could only see sillouquettes though. They appeared to be a darkened gray. They didn&apos;t look like the grays so often described. they just looked like regular humans pearring out at me. I could only see them from the waist up. I felt that they were reading my mind and that I could feel that I was being acknowledged when I was waving both my hands up high to get there attention. My two friends were beside me, one on each side. They were gazing up at it also. I commented to them, we are actually seeing a real UFO! They looked as if they were paralized. They didn&apos;t move at all, just staring up at it. I couldn&apos;t understand why they weren&apos;t as excited as me. They just stared at it with plain faces. I was so excited about it, that I didn&apos;t let it bother me to much. This thing had my full attention and I wasn&apos;t about to let it out of my sight for a second afraid it my dissapear before my eyes. As I shout for joy at it, I examined it close. It was bluish gray in clor except for it&apos;s underside. In the middle taking up about one third of the bottom was a round glowing reddish black, pulsating, what I formulated was it&apos;s engine. It glowed and pulsated every half of a second from a deep red to a deep black,red. It reminded me of a red bike reflector and had the same texture. It portruded out from the rest of the ship, not a lot, but made it distinct from the rest of the ship. It to looked as if it were all one piece with the ship. It was simply beautiful in my eyes. It was completely round with a domed top where the window was located half way down. It was half way down from the top of the dome to where it  blended in with the main body of the ship. I could see no other portholes or marks on it. It was smooth all around and the domed top was about as high as the rest of the body. As the engine pulsated, I could see that the rest of the underside did not take on the reddish glow of the engine. It remained it bluish gray color. It didn&apos;t make a sound. It was a little errie but I was to excited to think was green little Mars men. They made me feel very comfortable as if they were my friends and would harm me. I stood there about a minute or at least it seemed about a minute. I could see both my friend on either side of me still just starring at this beautiful object. Then the next thing I remember is looking at this UFO leaving me. I was completely turned around, my two friend were now together to the right of me still looking into blank space as I was waving good bye to it. My two friends, Craig and Joey were just starring up at nothing as if they were paralized. I myself was very saddened by this UFO leaving me. I remember feeling sad but also at peace as I waved good bye to it. I felt a lonely type of feeling as if saying good bye to a good friend or freinds. The UFO was now smaller appearing because it was higher up in the night sky when I first noticed it again. I thought it very strange, because I was facing a different dirrection then my two buddies. I could see them out of the corner of my eyes as I was waving good bye. The UFO was no longer a UFO to me. I could identify it and I saw it&apos;s occupants. I knew that I was a witness to the most extroidenary event I would ever see with my own two eyes. I watched as the ship zipped away going faster a nd faster as it seemed to dissapear around a three quarter moon. It left a tracer behind it as it first went straight the curved around to the dark side of the moon. I didn&apos;t want it to go! I heard them say good bye to me in my mind as if they knew I needed that. I stood there for an instant and then turned to my two buddied. They had just awoken up from this deep trance that they were in. I reminded them again of this spectacular event and all they could say as we didn&apos;t see anything. I thought they were teasing me but they weren&apos;t. They looked at there watches and commmented that they were going to get killed for being so late. They had a curfew, where they had to be in their doors at 7:00 pm. were there at 7:00 pm, because at that time of year it got dark around 7:00 pm., but it was now 10:00 pm. and that&apos;s why they were scarred. I couldn&apos;t believe it was 10:00 pm. ((name #1 deleted))  and ((name #2 deleted)) were both on curfews but I wasn&apos;t. My parents let me stay out till 10:00 If I wanted. It was vacation time from school in the summer so I was always aloud to stay up later except when school was back in. Anyway, They told me that they had to get it or they would be in bigger trouble by their parents. As they were leaving, I said I would come over early the next mourning to talk about it. They, didn&apos;t acknowledge me, they just ran home, which was right across the alley way to their house. I went home thinking did this really all take place. My mother was up waiting for me. She asked me where I was. I told her all about what had happened. Some how we had lost three hours out there and I wasn&apos;t about to forget any of it. My mother didn&apos;t act to surprized but listened intently. I couldn&apos;t wait to get up the next morning to got to my friends house and relive this fantastic experience. I went to sleep and got up early. I went dirrectly over to Craigs house. He got in trouble and wasn&apos;t aloud out the whole day, but he did come to the door. I ask him about the UFO. HE said he didn&apos;t remember seeing it. I was beside myself. I ran over to Joey&apos;s house. He to was grounded and he to said he didn&apos;t remember seeing any UFO. Now, I thought I was going crazy. I ran home, I knew I wasn&apos;t crazy, I knew I saw it and I could notr deny it. It was clear in my mind as if it had just happened. I told my mother that my two freinds don&apos;t remember seeing it. She said don&apos;t worry about it because it had made front page news in the news paper and that several people had seen it going across the sky of our town. I jumped for joy, just knowing that I wasn&apos;t crazy and then I felt at peace again. I said see mom, I wasn&apos;t lying, I really did see it. Later that month, I started to remember other things as clear as a bell. I remembered being inside of this UFO. I was sitting on a silver colored bench. Next to me were two adults, just sitting there, starring, like my freind were when they were fixed on this UFO without moving a muscle. I said Hi to them, but they didn&apos;t say anything. They just starred straight ahead. The bench was about eight feet long and was curved around what seemed to be the roundness of the ship. It was blocked off on one end to the left. On the other side it seemed to go on following the circumfrence of the UFO. I looked up straight in front of me and I saw two humans standing in the interior of the UFO. ONe was a man about 6 feet tall and the other was a beautiful women about 5 foot 8 inches tall. They both had on silver grayish jumpsuits but was formed to their body not to loose or not to tight. I could see that it was all one piece. Even their shoes were a part of their appearal. It had the same color as the outside of the UFO. There was no collar to the suit but it was up to the neck near the bottom. She had brownish blond hair and long and flowing down to about one third her back. It was shinny and very pretty to look at. She was very pretty and she smiled at me. He was very handsome and had blondish color hair. They both had very blue eyes that were warm as they looked at me. I got up off the bench and walked towards them seeing the other two just sitting there starring. As I walked over to them the man was standing across from a wall of the dome. He was moving his hands across and down what seemed to be a panel of some sort. It didn&apos;t have much to it, but what ever he was doing was like a waving motion over it. She was standing to the right side of him and then came around toward me. She gave me a hug, which made me feel very welcome. She then moved back toward the wall and was also doing something like waving her hands over a panel. He moved away from the panel and motioned me with his hands to move to the left. As I did I could see a window. it was panoramic in shape and about waist high. I guess it was about 4 feet by 15 feet across. I could see stars. Millions of them. They were very clear, clearer then I&apos;ve ever seen them. I walked closer to the window. I felt as if I were watching a movie in a movie theatre but much more clearer. I felt like I could touch these stars as they slowly moved across my view. I knew we wer moving in outer space. We must have been going very fast because the stars moved to the left and right of me as we went forward. They were like diamonds. The window was deffinately all one piece of the ship. there were no rivets or bolts of any kind. The window blended in with the rest of the ship. Even though it was rectangular in shape, it had no blunt or deffinate frame, just as it looked to me from outside the ship, looking up at it. I knew I was now in this UFO and the pilots were giving me the ride of my life. I was so excited, I just felt at peace and that these two beautiful people were ansering my request. They appeared to me a perfect people. Now, that I&apos;m a 53 years old and very religeous, I could identify them as looking like two resurrected personages. I could see not one flaw on their faces. They seemed very happy with each other. I had the feeling that they were married and that they were husband and wife. When they looked at me, they always looked contented and that they enjoyed what they do. The window of the space ship contoured around the dome. I could feel the impression that I was in the the same space hip as I was looking at from down below. I felt very comfortable and at ease. I knew they would not harm me in any way, that they just wanted to please me. The next think I remember is waving good bye to them, not wanting to leave. I didn&apos;t even think of my family then, I was to caught up in this great venture I was taking. I often remember this incident over and over again. It ist till this day so very clear in my mind. However, I don&apos;t recall anything else that happened during my three our ride. One day I will and just hope it was a fuylfilling as what I did remember. I will never forget it and since then I have seen many sightings of UFO&apos;s, some golden egg shaped, some ball shaped and others just round. My children also have seen them many times. My daughter also had a very close encounter of one bluish shaped UFO that came right down the street when we lived in the San Bernardino Mountains. It flew right over her and my wifes head, only about 10 feet above. She said if she were as tall as her mother, she could have reached up and touched it. But that is another real story I can tell later. I know they exist. I know who they are and where they come from. I also know more about them, probably then most people know. That doesn&apos;t make me special. I have just been told and it sets my mind free to live a productive, happy and informed life.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We both noticed a large red glowing fireball which was larger than a star or planet.  It went away.  Then in an area to the left we saw it again and it disappeared.  Then we saw it in another spot which was close to before and it vanished.  About 5 minutes or so later we saw something appear even further to the right and a much farther distance than before.  At first we assumed we were seeing the same object appearing in different locations.  Minutes later we went back inside the beach house.  Immediately, I told my brother-in-law that we just saw a UFO and expected a good laugh from him.  However, he informed us that he was at a store at the Pier and some guys came running in saying they had just seen a UFO.  Later, we realized we could&apos;ve been seeing different objects appearing at different times.  We still don&apos;t understand what we saw.", "Red glow from unseen objectI am currently a librarian.  On a summer night in 1964 or 1965, my brothers and mother and myself observed a red light bathe the backyard, there was no sound, no wind, nothing but the light.  It&apos;s appearance was similar to the &quot;safelight&quot; used in darkroom photography. Then it was gone, like a light being switched off. Details of the source were not visible, you could only see the red-orange round source of the light itself. I remember looking out the screen door, walking outside, looking up and then the next thing I remember is looking back into the house with the light gone.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Please see another similar report for August 15, 1937, from Fontana, CA.  PD))", "Satallite with a mind of its own?? Riviera Maya, MexicoMy boyfrined and I went back to our hotel after dinner in Riviera Maya, Mexico, an hour south of Cancun. It was approx around 12/1AM. It was a very dark and clear night. Our room was right on the ocean and my boyfrined and I were on the balcony enjoying the cooler night air. I was looking for satellites (I do this often when outdoors at night). I saw what I thought was a satellite and pointed it out to my boyfrined. We watched it float across the sky slowly in a very straight line. We were faceing the ocean(East)and it was moving from North to South across the sky. After a few seconds it suddenly slowed down then moved BACKWARDS VERY VERY QUICKLY! From there it started moving very fast and erratically. Most satallites that I have seen in the past move in a very linear pattern at a semi slow and constant speed. This however would shoot across the sky, stop and make a 180 degree turn and shoot diagonally throughout it&apos;s random motion. We both kept asking each other if we were seeing the same thing, not quite beliveing our eyes. Whatever it was it gave me chills. Both my boyfriend are avid outdoor types. We have spent countless nights camping out all over the western USA in some very remote areas and neither of us had ever seen the likes of this.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I come to the end of Forest and Merrideth, and look up at this weird jet flying way up, with really short dual contrails.

Anyway, I digress. So we are sitting at the stop sign for 30 seconds staring at this craft, when off to the left from this airplane,  we both noticed this shiny bright, very bright ball, was there for 4 or 5 seconds, then disappeared. We both saw this. The ball was not particularly big, but not just a pinprick either. Really cool, I assume it was a reflection, though what was shining off of what up there i cant imagine.It sort of disappeared from the top down.", "Triagular craft hovering over I-70 in OHMe and two friends were returning from a visit to Cincinnati. We were traveling west on I-70. it was slightly rainy out, but not enough to obstruct your view too much. I&apos;m not sure where we were the first spotting, but it wasn&apos;t far out of Dayton. My friends both saw it and pointed it out. It was maybe a mile up in the air and was triangular in shape. I only saw a glimpse of it, but it appears to be illuminated. The whole ship was lit up in a light blue/white glow. It passed us pretty quick and we kinda shook it off as a plane in town for the air show at Wright Patterson this weekend. We proceded to drive down the interstate when my two friends pointed again at an object in the distance. We were near the Lewisburg, OH exit. It was only a light at this point, but it was dead ahead of us. We kept driving towards the light, which never seemed to move. It wasn&apos;t going left of right. So I assumed it was flying in the same direction as us. The closer we got, the more you could make out of the craft. Again, it was triangular in shape. But not a perfect triangle. The nose was more narrow, then it contoured out, but difinetely triangular in shape. There were two lights on the outer &quot;wings&quot; that blinked in sync about once per second. The front of the craft put off a decently bright glow, but was not a beam of light. I can&apos;t estimate the exact size of the object. It was bigger then a stealth bomber, but not by too much. It wasn&apos;t very tall either. Very flat in appearence. It couldn&apos;t have been more then 10-15 feet tall. The only way I know it wasn&apos;t a stealth bomber is it wasn&apos;t jagged in the back. I&apos;ve seen the stealth upclose, and I can definetely say it wasn&apos;t one. We continued to get closer to the object, and as we did we started to realize the craft wasn&apos;t moving. We slowed down pretty good as we got within a half mile or so from it. By now, you could see that it was maybe 500 feet in the air and was simply hovering. We could now also see the underneath part of the craft. This to me was the most significant part. The ship appeared to be facing us, and on the front underneat part was the light. After that there was a narrow and long opening, rectangular, that was lit up. Not brightly, but enough to tell that you were looking into the craft. I&apos;m not sure what was inside the opening, but to me it looked like red pipes are bars of some sort that were red in color. This also made it seem like it put off a red hue with the white light around it. We slowed down to around 40mph while we drove under it. I hung my head out the window and looked up at the craft, which was posistioned directly in the median off the interstate. I couldn&apos;t hear anything, but then again I was driving down the insterstate with the wind in my ear. I also happen to be deaf in one ear, so not hearing anything didn&apos;t suprise me much. I didn&apos;t even really think about that fact until later anyhow. All the traffic seemed to be slowed down with us. No one passed us and the semi ahead of us wasn&apos;t pulling away from us either. I think everyone was looking as close as they could at this unexplainable object. I wanted to pull over, but I was hesitant too. I had two females with me, and they were a bit spooked by this, as was I. After we went under it we watched it as best as we could. We decided we had to have another look. We sped up to the next exit and turned around. I drove about 80mph to get back to the spot. It wasn&apos;t long before we realized the ship was gone. And then I realized I did something pretty stupid. I had my camera phone on me the whole time, I just never thought of it. I will never forgive myself for not thinking of it. But I was so in shock that it just slipped my mind. I can only really give you credible background for myself. The two girls I was with I&apos;ve only known a short time. I believe they are good people. And I know they saw what they saw seeing as I was there with them. As for myself, I&apos;ve always been a believer in the paranormal. I&apos;ve always believed there is life outside this planet or solar system. I&apos;ve listened to Art Bell many times. I&apos;ve watched anything UFO or alien related I came accross. I even went as far as to have a tattoo of a cartoon alien in a spaceship made of wood on my arm. I&apos;m sure all this leads you to believe me less on this story, and that really doesn&apos;t matter to me. I know what I saw. I never in the world would believe I&apos;d see something like this. And knowing a thing or two about UFO&apos;s made me think that even more. I mean why would it happen to someone who would love to see such a thing? I can only say that I&apos;m an honest hard working 32 yr old American man. I don&apos;t lie, cheat, or steal. I&apos;ve never made up a story in my life for attention, and I frown upon those who do. I know what I saw, and what I saw was a huge craft hovering in thin air. I haven&apos;t reported this to any local authorities. I really don&apos;t know what I would say when I called to report it. I&apos;d think they would think I&apos;m just some drunk guy seeing things. But it does so happen that one of the girls mother is a corrections officer at the county jail. We&apos;re waiting for her to return to work this week and inquire about any UFO sightings reported. Feel free to contact me via email.

The light, first estimated to be about 2500ft altitude and 3 mile distance, drew my attention because it appeared to have the intensity and quality of a bright aircraft landing light as observed in the night time.  The initial velocity was considerably faster than aircraft often observed flying at that altitude and range.  The object flew at relatively constant velocity and altitude for the first 30 sec. and then came to a gradual stand-still during the next 15 seconds with the light dimming and finally appearing as a white circular diffuse object with relatively sharp edges.  I retrieved my binoculars (7X35 power)within 30 seconds and viewed the object which appeared more like a bell jar shape (1:1 aspect ratio)with an occasional sliver of black at the bottom observed.  The object seemed to move slightly up and down and sideways hovering just below one of the white cumulus clouds (elevation 3205 ft per local meteorological report).  I continued to view the object through binoculars for an additional minute until it disappeared upward into the cloud.  The object never reappeared during an additional 15 minutes of observation.

On occasion it (there was always only one)would &apos;go out&apos; and then several seconds later re-appear in the same place, then &apos;scoot out&apos;, often in a retrogade, high speed direction; Then it would re-appear at about the same place, &apos;bob up and down&apos; a few tmes, then go out. I was always a &apos;non-believer&apos; ( I am 79), but no more.

The first 2 were vertical in nature, long &amp; thin, approximately 150 feet long, phosphorescent green glowing consistently &amp; rising slowly as if they were a streamer from a hot air balloon. No balloon or other object was visible above the objects. The third object was 2-3 times longer &amp; had an offset near the top 1/4 of its length. It rose very high over a period of 15-20 minutes, decended slightly &amp; continued east until out of sight.

But every time I looked in that spot, there was nothing there. Finally, I caught another glimpse, and decided to drop the kite to the ground and focus on that spot in the sky. Eventually it became clear that there were three spots of light, no brighter than any night time star. The lowest light was about 45 degrees, with a second light about another 10 degrees directly above the lower. A third, and somewhat smaller light, was slightly higher and to the right of the middle one. These lights did not seem to have any movement to them. I called to my eight year old daughter to look up in the sky and tell me what she saw, and she described what I was looking at. I asked her to run back to a camping area to fetch a pair of binoculars that were left on a picnic table. As I waited for her to return, the lights became more difficult to observe. It seemed that they were quite far off since they were becoming obscured by some haze blowing off of the ocean. Eventually the higher, smaller light faded out, but the lower two were still visible. I noticed an airliner approaching from west to east, and as it neared the area by the lights, they turned a reddish color and appeared to fade much like the smaller light had done. As the airliner left the area of the lights, they reappeared. Another airliner approached, again from the west, and this time the lights reddened and faded, but did not return. By the time my daughter returned, the lights were gone.", "Two adults, one a former mil. pilot, witness a green fireball pass over car at high speed, southbound.Telephoned Report:  A former Canadian military pilot reported witnessing a green ball of light streak over his automobile, descending at what appeared to him and his passenger as a steep angle of descent.

GEORGIA UFO GROUP- Joint post of 2002 witness account via MUFON of Georgia inquiry. The below described inquiry and witness debriefing was conducted by this investigator during my tenure as Georgia Director of MUFON.  On 20April02, this investigator received a WUFOD report from a former Georgia resident then living in Minnesota. Over the course of April-May 2002, this FI communicated in detail with the witness via email, telephone, and U.S. Mail.  The witness stated that in 1973 or 1974, she was a 27 YOA mother and home-maker living in suburban MACON GEORGIA. Her husband (now deceased) was an aviator and away from home at the time of the event. Her husband&apos;s cousin and family lived very close-by.  (Investigator&apos;s Note: Macon is one of the larger Georgia cities, sitting astride north-south I-75 in our state&apos;s &quot;center mass&quot;, with Warner Robbins AFB being about 14 miles due south, mostly very flat terrain).  WITNESS ACCOUNT - During the evening in question, the witness said it was very warm, the sky was clear, but with some clouds, perhaps above 5000 feet. The witness stated that she had put her baby to bed, fixed a glass of iced-tea and proceeded outside to sit on the patio in the dark. Within a short time, she noticed a GLOW coming across the tree tops to the SW, proceeding TOWARD her, and while enroute, passing directly over the parking lot of the &quot;Disabled American Veterans&quot; organization, which was located ACROSS the N-S road from her E-W residential street. Witness continued, stating that the GLOW was LOW-LEVEL and SILENT, continuously moving toward her in a SWIFT manner. As she watched the approach, the glow resolved itself and she observed a THICK LENS SHAPED OBJECT heading right toward her position. This object was still SILENT and steadily GLOWING in a bright YELLOW-ORANGE color......also described as AMBER. As it passed directly OVER the witness, she was able to determine from UNDERNEATH that is was actually a ROUND saucer-like craft, additionally described as being &quot;gigantic&quot;, like two ranch style homes placed together (WUFOD data fields.... ACTUAL SIZE-300 ft.; ALTITUDE-500 ft.+). Witness observed NO fuselage protrusions, portholes or the like.  At that time, the witness became nervous, ran inside and locked the door. She went to her rear bathroom window and watched as the craft departed, continuing on over the nearby homes to the NE.  The next day, she discussed the matter with her husband&apos;s cousin who told her that along with his wife and kids, he too had observed something similar. They debated if it was the same object, but the witness does not recall their final conclusion. She DOES recall a newspaper or TV news report about it, saying several other people described similar observations in Macon from that night.  OTHER RESEARCH- GUFOG investigator Officer Michael D. Hitt spent three years of intense research, focusing year by year, on ALL locally reported UFO phenomenon in Georgia from 1947 through 1987. This resulted in his 1999 publication documenting this activity (appx. 250 accounts). The period of 1973 in Georgia reflected the SAME TYPE of activity as that being reported nationally.......&quot;The Wave of 1973&quot;........as it is described by some of the top American researchers, Ronald Story, Peter Davenport, Dick Hall, Stanton Friedman, Jerome Clark, et al.  1973 in Georgia found reports POURING in from citizens, motorists, MANY law enforcement officers, pilots, reporters and news crews. These reports were being made to the various media, local police and other officials. Numerous of these reports were from central and south Georgia, including the MACON area where our primary witness lived. This writer was a police Patrol Officer in 1973 and during the summer and autumn of that year, had been routinely assigned to temporary administrative duties after shooting and killing a deranged gunman. While working at night in the radio center during this period, MANY teletype messages from central and south Georgia were monitored as various agencies had patrol units actively pursuing and reporting &quot;unknowns&quot; from county to county. This included the MACON and central Georgia area where the witness lived and made her observation. A few of these teletype messages were preserved by this writer (if conditions had permitted, ALL would have been preserved!).  Due to the above circumstances, this writer feels that the MACON witness&apos; report is PROBABLY part of the &quot;1973 Wave&quot;, even though she cannot remember the exact date or year......stating either 1973 or maybe 1974.  The MACON witness was forthright and above board in ALL of her accounting and conversations with this investigator. The witness&apos; OUTSTANDING writing ability and diction was traced to growing up and being educated in England AND Europe. She did not muck about, being intelligent, observant and concise. One highly credible lady.  I imagine that bits and pieces from the &quot;Wave of 73&quot; and other eras will probably continue to come in and undergo some form of scrutiny by GUFOG or my friends and associates in MUFON of Georgia. Credible witnesses, such as described in this report, will hopefully add more pieces to the 1973 Georgia puzzle.  As always, any past or present citizens of Georgia that might have information related to these events, can contact me at the GUFOG office in Fayetteville Georgia--- 678-817-4555; or email at &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;georgiaUFOgroup@webtv.net&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   GUFOG WILL HOLD THE IDENTITY OF ALL WITNESSES CONFIDENTIAL.

We had been interviewing a local tribe of that region.  My crew (except for the cameraman and I) had left.  We stayed behind to spend the night for &quot;wrap-arounds&quot; and extra footage.  We were sitting high above a moonlit field or plateau talking with some of the natives over a  small bonfire.  I happen to detect an oval shape gliding over and across the large field rapidly.  When I alarmed the rest to witness, it had retrieved into the woods.  It had no lights.  It looked like a floating silohette about the size of a car. Natives and my cameraman wondered if I had seen a horse or a car, but I assured them that niether would have had the distinct abiltiy to move so steadily the way I saw this, and glide as fast across the open space.  They began to cajole about it as a superstition, so I dropped it to avoid further embarressment.  But later, after about half an hour I heard a noise (like someone blowing hard into my ear)and immediately felt like someone threw a burst of air on my back.  I reacted.  Surprisingly, I looked around and noticed no one heard or sensed this even though we all sat tightley in a circle.Later that night we went to bed in our cabin.  Needless to say I was a little scared, but the calmness and assurances of the natives made me feel safer, &quot;that none of these &quot;energies&quot; would bring us harm so long as we stayed away&quot;.The cameraman and I slept on the floor in individual sleeping-bags.  He slept in front of me facing away about five feet away.  I couldn&apos;t sleep, but just when I began to feel drowsy I heard that harsh noise in my ear again.  Then I heard the sounds of children(for about a second or two).  I didn&apos;t want to hear anymore, when all of a sudden the cameraman&apos;s head bobs up asking me if I had heard the same thing.  He scrammbled for his flashlight in his backpack.  I had the strange sensation that this was truley abnormal, but the juornalistic sense in me had me curious as to see what was going on, and we stepped outside.  As we reached about ten feet away from the front door.  I heard and felt the air go through me again.  I turned around and looked at my cameraman.  Staring at me wide-eyed he blurted, &quot;I heard it this time!&quot;.  We rushed back inside the cabin trusting the natives warning that &quot;these energies would bring no harm if we stay out of their way&quot;.  We didn&apos;t hear anything the rest of the night.Six years later, back in the United States, I hosted a conference for the Air Force.  But there was one group which anchored the event called Air Force/IPT whose activities were not to be disclosed or disturbed.  Their makeshift computer displays in secluede rooms of our Ranch were to be visited or touched in any way by our staff or anyone.  At the end of the week a small reception to place where all colonels, captains and respective staff memebers of IPT congregated for farewells.  They were a lot more relaxed and I was able to find out a little more about their organization.  &quot;IPT, they said, &quot;stands for Integral Programming Technologies, we put your military satellites in space&quot;.  Curious about their stand on UFO&apos;s, I was surprised that they admitted they did believe in them, and that in their line of work they had constantley interacted with them in one way or another.  They couldn&apos;t elaborate - sworn to duty...  I proceeded to tell them about my incident of El Ajusco.  They were intrigued.  One of them even said that, &quot;I may have been too close for confort&quot;.Can someone give me some enlightment as to what may have really happened?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked to my left(south east) and out of nowhere appeared to be a hazey sphere that I mistook for the moon for a second.  It then got larger and larger and a light appeared in the middle of it.  I stopped and fixated on it.  I told myself it must be a helicopter looking for pot crops or something but it then burned so bright that my eyes hurt and I had to look away.  It was very close to a star of which I don&apos;t know the name and I used the star as a marker to see how much it moved. It dimmed out to a cigar shaped haze and zigg zagged a little and then started to glow in the middle and had a haze on top and below the glow. It looked like a star if you were to glance at it quick.  Obviously &quot;they&quot; have this way of camoflouge(hope I spelled it right) it can trick your eye.  I looked at this thing and could not believe I was seeing it so plain.  I woke my 66 year old father at 4 in the morning to have a witness. He calmly told me he had seen one as a little boy and I should keep watching because I will take off really really fast. I then discovered another one more to the direct east glowing on and off.  That is the thing.  It glowed on and off. It disappeared and then reappeared about 15 times approx.  Totally amazing.  I have never had any doubt that there are entities out there but this is an affirmation. It hovered in the relative same spot for nearly 2 hours glowing on and off and slowly moving around.

I would say it was about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away from us, and at first I thought it was an airplane or helicopter, but the way it moved was like nothing I had ever seen before.  It was able to change directions so quickly there was no possible way it could have been a helicopter or an airplane.  It was about this time that my friend Josh said &quot;WHOA, UFO!&quot; and pointed out in the direction of the light I was observing.  It seemed like it was on cue, but as soon as Josh spotted the same fast moving light that I was looking at, the object either appeared to change shape, or some lights were turned on that emitted about 8 or 10 beams that completely lit up the desert below the craft.  The source of the lights were clearly visible and they almost had an orange or purple tint to them.  There was a row of lights on the bottom part of the craft, shining down on to the desert floor and I could also see slighly dimmer lights around the edge of the craft, above the spot lights.

This writer spent about 20 minutes debriefing the witness as he CONTINUED to observe this episode, which he said he had been watching for some 10 or so minutes before calling.  The witness is a 20 YOA male citizen of Stockbridge Georgia. While it is impossible to fully vet a witness without some form of in-depth investigation, during the conversation and questions, he seemed to be a sober minded and observant individual. He was in amazement while describing his observations to this investigator, indicating he&apos;d never watched anything in the sky that performed in the manner he was witnessing.  WITNESS ACCOUNT---- On Tuesday, 3Aug04 at 5:16AM, this writer was reviewing reports previously filed to GUFOG when the UFO reporting phone rang.  The above described witness immediately explained that he had been outside of their Stockbridge home and observed an unusual LARGER than star-like light off in the distance toward the City of McDonough (Stockbridge is about 13 miles SE of Hartsfield Airport.....McDonough is about 8.7 miles SSE of Stockbridge).This light was also described as being about the size of a BB held at arm&apos;s length, definitely circular in shape, being about 1/4 of the way off of the horizon, and changing from glowing blue to yellow. Said light had been observed to move slowly, then DART up and to the right, then up and down, back and forth, moving about the width/length of witness&apos; hand held at arm&apos;s length. The light reportedly passed behind a tree limb at one time. Witness was frustrated because he did not have a videocam or binoculars. Not knowing the exact distance to McDonough, the witness guessed the light might be about 2 miles away, and when asked, said definitely in the direction of McDonough (which is 8.7 miles SSE). The witness stated he was familiar with the various commercial air traffic all around the Hartsfield vicinity, but this was not similar to that. As the witness watched, he stated that the light seemed to change into a boomerang or V shape.  At that point, this writer decided to ring off and move to a location outside where a view toward that event location is possible. My location in Fayetteville is about 17 miles due west of McDonough. Efforts were made to observe in that direction with 7X50 and then 10X50 binoculars.......with negative results. There are some large trees obstructing part of that view toward McDonough.  WEATHER----Temperature 73 degree, little or no wind, predominantly clear, with some thin dissipating patches of Altocumulus directly over Fayetteville, but clear skies in the direction of McDonough and Stockbridge.  INVESTIGATOR COMMENTS--- Distant lights in the vicinity of a major international airport are often mistaken for something anomalous. (Hartsfield, generally about 13 and 20 miles to the NW from locations described). Additionally, weather conditions, optical illusion w/celestial bodies, as well as the natural eye phenomenon called &quot;autokinesis&quot; might also readily contribute to such an assumption.  (A subsequent phone call to the witness&apos; residence on 9Aug04 found him to be at work. A short conversation with a family member seemed to indicate that the witness took some form of scoffing from his family for reporting his observations).  This FI feels that the Stockbridge report, while NOT of the unmistakable &quot;up close and personal&quot; variety, needs documentation for several reasons, to wit;   1) The above described witness seemed sure of what he was observing, and described it in real time to this FI. PLUS there appeared to be sufficient CLEARLY OBSERVED and RADICAL movement, to include shape changing of the light, to PROBABLY preclude any tricks of the eye or other illusion in the clear mild weather;   2) Additionally noticed by this FI were recent reports to NUFORC by Georgia witnesses...... these events being similar in nature to the aforementioned Stockbridge/McDonough case; (19July04 Atlanta-Sphere; 20July04 Lagrange-Unknown {Multiple Lights}; 23July04 Atlanta-Sphere).  3) ODDLY ENOUGH, upon taking the initial call from the Stockbridge witness, this FI had been reviewing newly received written accounts from MULTIPLE witnesses that observed an ALMOST EXACT event on 10July04 in the vicinity of Cherry Log Georgia. Said group of witnesses were in a REMOTE mountainous part of Georgia. HOWEVER.....subsequent to the aerial portion of this mountain experience, their episode concluded with an encounter with an UNKNOWN GROUND BASED GLOW and STRANGE ODOR near the position of said witnesses. This Cherry Log Georgia case remains under investigation as GUFOG looks at the possibility of natural &quot;night orbs&quot;, spook lights etc., and local military operations, in an effort to identify the culprit. (Certain areas of this mountain region are used by the U.S. Army Ranger School for training purposes). If the causation in Cherry Log remains unknown to the point of indicating a suspected anomaly, the case will also be posted to the NUFORC data base upon completion of the investigation.

My 9 year old son had spotted some white spots in the sky.  When I first saw the spots, they were very small and I only saw two or three.  They looked to be at a very high altitude.  As I scanned the sky, I saw at least 50 of the spots overhead.  I ran in to get some binoculars and then observed them at a low magnification:  they appeared to have white mushrooms on the top and bottom, connected by a dark cylinder and the mushrooms were spinning.  They were not in a recognizable formation, but seemed to be equdistance from each other, randomly scattered. As they moved from east to west, they were obscured by some very high, wispy clouds.  After all were no longer visible, there was one larger (or lower altitude) device that seemed to move away, then it too disapeared from sight.

As I was driving along, the sun glinting off something metalic ahead of me a little above the tree line, caught my eye.  It did not seem to be any type of aircraft or anything I had ever seen before.  It was crescent shaped and skipped along horizontally to the right for about the length of two or three housetops and then receded into nothingness, much like the fin of a large fish might appear out of the water and then disappear as the fish descended deeper into the water. I remember saying to myself, &quot;What on earth was that?&quot;  I looked all around up in the sky ahead of me but could no longer see it.  Thinking about it immediately after as I was still driving, I came to the conclusion that what I saw was only part of a larger craft of some kind, perhaps a saucer or dsk, the edge of which appeared out of another dimension briefly and went back in.  I am very puzzled by this, but I saw what I saw straight ahead of me, clearly without any obstruction.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

Centered on the 4 back lights about the diameter of the moon away was another white light.  About half way between the single light and the middle of the 4 lights there was one red light, slightly brighter than the white ones.  It appeared to be facing west(the single white light was to the west of the 4 white ones.  It did not appear to be moving at all at this time(about 45 seconds).

From this angle there were 2 white lights, the same distance apart as the farthest of the line of 4, and there was a red light, about 1/4 the diamater of the moon above the middle of the white lights. I watched it for about a minute, while glancing at road enough to stay on it(wide interstate, so not much).  I glanced at the road and looked back.  It was gone.  It is possible that it flew into a cloud, because it wasn&apos;t too far from the moon in the sky which was temporarly behind a cloud.  The cloud moved on leaving a clear sky in the direction.  I turned around and headed back towards 85 then south.  There was no more sign of the object the rest of my trip home.There are reguarly planes in the area, and I watch them reguarly.

As we got onto the interstate I noticed a brightly lit object in the sky about halfway between Ankeny and DSM.  I initially thought it was an aircraft approaching the Ankeny Regional Airport, but as I kept driving the object didn&apos;t seem to be getting closer.  From my early vantage point the object looked to be at a height of around 1500 ft.. The craft was still in plain view when I passed the mixmaster area which is 6 miles from DSM, but considerably lower(1000ft.?).  I now was thinking this might be some sort of tower, but I had never seen anything like this and being from that area I&apos;m sure I would have noticed it before.  I&apos;m also sure that I wouldn&apos;t have been able to see it at the altitude that it was at now when I first saw it in Ankeny.  When I finally passed it I could finally rule out a tower.  I slowed down to 50mph and rolled down the window to look at it.  It was right off the interstate and I was able to look directly up at it.  It was only 250 ft up with 3 bright lights in the shape of a triangle with a moving, smooth red light that moved back and forth in a fluid motion.  My wife who is an absolute skeptic on things like this pointed out 3 cars on the far side of the road that seemed to be not working.  I turned around on Guthrie Ave.(DSM), which is about a mile from where I saw the object, to go back and get some footage with my Digicam.  I could tell it was gone though and could now determine that it wasn&apos;t a tower because they just don&apos;t get up and walk away.  I am a former Marine and I know what helicopters look like at night.  This was something I&apos;d never seen before.  On a side note, I called a friend of mine after I got home to tell him about my sighting.  He was at the Iowa State Fair which is approx 5 miles from where I saw the craft.  I told him to watch the skies.  The next day, he said the only thing he saw that night was a news helicopter get escorted from the area by 2 huey choppers.  I thought that was interesting.

We are at an altitude of 6,000 feet and the lights were higher and just to the west of the mountains. Looking through binoculars the lights were solid with no other lights in,on,or around them. The two lights behaved like the Phoenix lights, fading in and out for some thirty minutes and appeared in three locations. (I have seen the Phoenix lights).  There were aircraft in the vicinity.

It was composed of four white lights and two red lights, none of which were flashing, and it was traveling quite fast.  It seems like it would have been triangular in shape with one white light at the forward point, three white lights in a row behind it, and the two red lights at the opposite back corners.  There were no green lights and no &apos;headlights&apos; that we frequently see on aircraft landing at this time of night. At arm&apos;s length, it was about the size of the end joint of my thumb (about one inch).  A pure guess about altitude would be about 1,000 feet.

The entire even took approximately 3 seconds. I&apos;ve seen 2 other instances of this type, in the same general area, occuring in the past couple of months. It is possible that these objects are simply sattelites, as I don&apos;t know what satelites look like in orbit, although I&apos;m not sure they fade from view.
