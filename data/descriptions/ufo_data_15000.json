To the other observer, the object was an extremely bright silver ball with a short comet-like tail. Both agree on the size.

I usually just go down to the cafeteria and grab a cup of coffee but that night I noticed the hallway door had been open to the outside.  This was rather strange because the doors in the hallway were always kept shut to make sure no prisoners tried to escape.  The hallway was pitch black as I walked towards the door, and just as I went to grab my flashlight a bright beam came shining through the open door.  I rushed over to try to find the source of the light.  As I got to the doorway I looked up to the sky and I noticed a large craft hovering above me.  My breath was taken away instantly and a rush of fear came over me. I tried to call for the other guards to come and check out the scene but no words would come from my mouth.  I was speechless.  The large craft swayed back and forth through the air, still with its light beam shining bright.  There were no windows on the craft so I could not see any activity inside.  As the thought came to me to run and grab a video camera, my feet grew heavy and unmovable.  I just stood there, stunned, for a good 5 minutes until the bright light turned dull and the craft shot straight up into the air and out of sight.Never in my life have I experimented with hallucinogens or any other drugs.

On our way up to my front porch my friend stopped me and we both looked up to see the &quot;plane&quot; go straight up in the air, rotate in the circle using the red light as the axis.

I live in Eastern Kentucky about six miles outside of a small town with a population of about 3200.  The place I live at is a rural area with wooded hills surrounding the house I live in with my husband.  At approximately 1:00 a.m. on the morning of Tuesday, April 16, 2002 I walked outside onto my front porch to bring my cat inside.  It was a cool night but not cold and the sky was very clear.  The stars were bright- no clouds.  I glanced up in the sky to the left of my house which would be east and an object flashing in the distance and above the trees on the hill caught my eye.  At first I thought it was an airplane but almost immediately dismissed the idea when I noticed that it was not moving across the sky like an airplane would but rather it was sort of bouncing around a bit and moving erratically.  What also startled me was that it was flashing different colors.  At first it appeared light blue then would change to white and then green and then reddish.  It appeared round in shape and small.  I watched in shock for about two minutes as it hovered and moved around in the same spot in the sky, flashing and appearing different colors.  After I realized that it couldn&apos;t possibly be a star or an airplane or helicopter the thought occurred to me that I should call someone and get them to come over and see this.  I thought that if I was the only one to see it no one would believe me when I told them about it.  So I called my friend who lives about one and half miles away and told her what I was seeing and asked her to come over and bring her video camera.  My husband was gone at the time.  She arrived in about six or seven minutes and we stood in the yard and videotaped the object for about twenty eight minutes.  The object would just hover in one spot at times and then move around erratically all the while flashing and seeming to flash different colors.  But it stayed in the same general area to the east and above the sa! me tree line.  It appeared far away so the shape was hard to make out but upon viewing the video footage later in slow motion it appeared to be round.  During the time that we were filming my husband returned home and watched it also.  It never left our sight the entire time but watching it through the camcorder it could only be seen when it flashed white or light blue.  We were all amazed and could not figure out what it was.  When we decided we had enough footage of it my friend and I decided that we needed to get her adapter that allows playback of the videotape in a VCR that she had left at home so we left to get it and when we returned to my house it was gone.  We have watched the video footage of it over and over again and still can&apos;t figure out what we have seen.  When it is watched in slow motion the movement of the object is much more visible and unbelieveable.  It also appears to change shape and color as it zig-zags around.  We have never witnessed anything like this before.  I am a very open-minded person and have always believed other stories of sightings but I never thought I would see something like I saw.

Also, it hovered like a helicopter at times.  It was black on top and very shiny (almost like a mirror) on the bottom.  At first I thought it might be the stealth fighter, but I don&apos;t remember the stealth being able to manuever quite like this vehicle.  Once it got to West Seattle, it shot up straight (from approx. 5,000 ft. to at least 35,000).  I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing.

It was a white light and it flashed about every 5 seconds. As it approached me it was moving at about the same speed as a passing car would.

I got two real good looks at it though as we passed, and when the light flashed it lit up most of the craft. It was gray and kinda shaped like a hot air ballon. But with very rigid angles. It also had none of the lighting required by the FAA. It mayed no sound. Never changed course, speed, or altitude. There is also no airports for 60 miles. So that furthered my suspicions.

(approx. 21 mi. north of downtown Houston, off I-45), I went out on our outside apartment patio to smoke, and after I sat down, I looked up and saw an object moving from left to right in the south sky (moving east to southwest). My immediate reaction was that it had to be an aircraft, but when it suddenly stopped on a dime, and stayed in one place, my changed very quickly about what I was seeing. I wanted to go tell my sister, but was afraid it would go away, and I&apos;d miss what it would do next. I waited then, and it then started moving in a straight line to the east, from it&apos;s stationary position I seen it move to. It was then I knew I better get my sister, so at least someone else could see this. My sister came out in time to also watch this dimly lit white object continue to move, more rapidly now in a straight line to the east. This thing was definitely going MUCH faster than any commercial airliner, or Air Force jet ! We watched it getting farther to the east, when suddenly it stopped ! -- and I mean it stopped on a dime, too... about 10 seconds of sitting there, it then started moving back towards us (southwest), but this time it was moving slower....it moved towards us for about 15 seconds, then turned around and started going east again ! It continued at the same slower speed (but still very fast for any flying craft we have - or at least anything to our knowledge that we have).....It kept going this time, moving eastward till we couldnt see it anymore.We waited around 10 mins. for it to come back, but it didnt, and it was a very hot humid night here in Houston, anyway.I went at got the binoculars and will keep them outside from now on.I have a feeling that whoever was contolling this thing, they know they could really go faster than the speed we seen it move..... :) I hope anybody else seen this last night will also come forward.PS : There was a commercial jet flying west to east, much lower than the UFO, but they wouldve had no problem seeing this on such a clear night if they just looked upto their left.", "2nd hand accountThis is second hand information.

The lights were visible for approximately 2-3 seconds.  The lights were traveling at very low altitude based on my view, and the mountains around this area (estimation, it is pitch black around that area in the night, Fort Huachuca lies approximately 20-30 miles south of where the lights were seen - lights may have been approximately 15 miles away from F.H. and may have covered the remaining 15-20 miles in what appears to be 2 sec, this should give me a speed, correct 27K mph? ).

At times it gave the effect of a light reflecting on the clouds around it. Each 3 of the lights blinked off and on very slowly though not in any sequence.

There is a great deal of commercial and military air traffic in this area, so I was watching the sky. As I watched I saw what I first thought was a regular aircraft light, i.e. a commercial airliner &quot;headlight&quot;.As I watched though the light increased n brightness. It was a lightly clouded evening and this object was positioned so that it was ringed (as though it were in the center -the doughnut hole- of a &quot;doughnut-lke&quot; cloud formation). It was a very dark night, I&apos;m not sure if it was a new moon or the moon had already set.I could not tell the distance, but it seemed clearly too far for even an airliner light source to be so bright. Also it appeared to be stationary for the duration of my sighting. It became bright enough to illuminate the surrounding edges of the cloud formation that it was in. It grew and diminished slighty in brightness, until it eventually disappeared (it seemed to have &apos;winked out&apos; rather than sped off).Very shortly after the lght&apos;s disappearence, a smaller plane, what I would perceive as a military or private sized plane (I do not know which), passed very quickly through an closely adjacent region of the sky. This craft did not appear to be the same object, but I presumed was there to &apos;check out&apos; the light. I am not sure of this this is pure speculation.I consider myself a relatively competent observer (I am a visual artist), and I was a bit taken aback by the prominence of ths object in the night sky.", "BIG AND BRIGHTOK THIS WAS WEAR FOR ME BECUSE I AM ONLY 14 BUT N/E WAY I JUST GOTOFF THE WEB AND WES GOING TO BED WEN I LOOKED OUT THE WINDO TO SEE ALL THE STARS.

We wondered if it was just a pole or something else.  As we got closer we saw there was a red flickering light in the middle.  We pulled over and watched whatever it was and it looked like it hovered.  It all of the sudden took off back toward town.  I rolled down the window and listened to it.  It sounded somewhat like a lawn mower.  We turned around and followed it.  We were going about 55 or 60 mph and it was speeding way ahead of us.  We thought it might be a plane because there was an airport  (Central Wisconsin Airport) that way but couldn&apos;t figure out why it was so low and why it was going so fast.  As we kept going, we saw it hovering over a field again.  We saw that it looked triangular and somewhat flat.  We pulled over and watched it again.  It took off once again and we saw yellow lights now.  As we followed it back the other way, it looked like it dipped and crossed the road and hovered about 50 or 70 ft above a house.  We reached up with it again, pulled over and watched it again.  This time, it took off very fast and looked like it landed in a field somewhere or something up ahead but it was too fast to see where it went or landed.((NUFORC Note:  We will request a written report from the other student-witness.

It was hard to tell its shape cause we were moveing and because it was dark but it had a red light on the front of it. A bright light shot out from under neath it (like a spot light).

We only saw the objects as lights or spheres of light from this distance. There were approximately 2 objects, one was stationary and the other manuevered around in a manner which was uncharacteristic of any conventional craft that I know of. It performed tight circles and moved very fast as compared to the commercial traffic in the area, which I used as a comparison. The most dramatic manuever it performed was a tight loop which only took a fraction of a second, then it shot out a thin beam of light to the other object and it seemed to ride that beam up to that object. The light that eminated from the objects was blueish white in color and seemed to flash at different intervals depending on the objects manuevers.

We were all about 15 to 16 years old. As the night started to draw in. We were looking at the stars now and then and when the light was fading rapidly we noticed a ball of light moving incredibly fast around the sky. It was clearly not a satellite as we all know what they look like nor was it standard aircraft. It was moving too fast and in all directions but for some reason not up or down just on the same plane. The object was basically 4 or 5 times brighter than the brightest star on view and would very roughly guess that it was anything from 5 to 7 miles up, based on the background of stars and the objects movements.We were all gob smacked at the site of this object and it&apos;s slow to fast and curved movements it was making. One witness I hasten to add ran home crying not wanting to accept or appreciate this thing, but the rest of us stayed. My Father was not there at this point but on another day, which I will get to.So on this night while watching this light dance about the sky we had a rabbiting lamp and proceed to flash at it for all it was worth. About 1/2 an hour passed by then this light became static and just hung there like any normal but bright star.This is the point where we knew we were seeing intelligent life elsewhere as what happened was an incredible sight. From this one bright light a second light shot out of it to the end of our towns edge and back at magnificent speed. A second light went to the other edge of our town, then a third, forth, fifth, etc, etc. In a minute or two we were seeing between 30 to 50 lights shoot out from this one main light covering the entire span of our town(roughly 18,000 population). The smaller lights coming from the main static light were the same brightness as a normal star but did not flicker like stars do, proving that they were roughly 5 to 7 miles away.The speeds of the smaller lights varied in speed but all were moving the same when they turned back to merge with the bright static light. The only way I can describe it is this way. Imagine a dart board and the bullseye the Bright light. From the Bullseye smaller lights shot out from it to the edge of the dart board and back again, sometimes 10, sometimes as many as 50 lights. After a while we all began to get neck ache through looking up for so long.After a while the 50 lights were going down to 40 then 30 and so on and I will never forget that one last light returning back to the bright light speeding up almost as if it didn&apos;t want to get left behind. This is silly I know, but that&apos;s how I felt about it. Once all the lights were back to the main bright light it just faded away. We all walked home feeling differnet things, but I for one felt privelleged.The only way I could describe what we saw is that it was scanning our town, whatever it was. But it was truely not from this earth due the speeds involved.2nd part.the following night I had 2 witness&apos;s but will explain later what they saw. Directly outside my house I was looking up in the sky for more activity. This time I saw a large round sphere. It was like seeing an up turned hot air balloon but much too high up for one to be there, way too high.This round balloon had numerous coloured lights flashing different colours. I ran into my house to alert my Father and to grab my binoculars. Ballancing them on a fence post I got a much better view and could quite clearly see form and space between the lights which were square, hexagonal, octagonal, etc, but not round, all of which were attached to this sphere/balloon shaped craft.All the lights were changing colours many different colours. This event lasted roughly 10mins and the object I would guess was about 2 miles up above my house.Now here is the strangest part of this sighting. Like I said before I have no reason to lie and sit here writing all this for the fun of it that happened many years ago for me but this sighting my two friends with me could not see the object. I kept persistently pointing at it and it was clear as ever for me and to this day I have no explanation as to why they were unable to see what I could see..My Father a total non believer in anything like this would never discuss or talk about it even now he will not talk about it and would niether admit seeing it or not.This has totaly confused me. In a way I wish I never saw these things as I have many thoughts about them. What was it, why was it there and why do I feel that it was singling me out in particular. It has now been 17 years since then I have never seen anything else like that.I hope this article has been of use to your research((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Approximatly one mile South of the Elger Bay grocery store, an object crossed above the road at a height of no more than 50 feet above the treetops at a distance of about 300 yds in front of us. The object was low enough that I was only able to view it in profile. It had a wedge-shaped profile with a pointed nose. The object glowed with the luminous intensity of a fluorescent light. I was able to observe a glow on the trees and ground that helped me identify the distance as the object passed over. The object did not emit any sound that I detected. The size of the object appeared to be a wedge about 80 feet long and 20 feet high at the tail, viewed in profile. There was a small dark area about fifteen feet behind the pointed nose that may have been a window.As a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, I had developed the habit of taking a mental snapshot of an event, then analyzing it during the following moments, even while engaged in other activities. Due to this habit, I was able to compare its speed to my memory of a Phantom F-4 that I knew was flying at 600 knots at a similar range. Based on this comparison, I would estimate the speed of the object to be three times that of the F-4, or about 1800 knots.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Also, two distinctly different lights, each an off-white with a faint, bluish tint would randomly streak past the red light from different positions in the sky as though trying to catch it, each leaving a faint haze behind it which dissipated quickly soon after.

The second piece broke away at a 90 degree angle and remained at a distance approx. 500 ft. from the first object and continued parallel through the sky. Both objects sent smaller objects toward one another and continued east when we lost the object over badger mountain. The sky was clear, no clouds, it was night. There was another aircraft in the vicinity but it was not chasing the object. The object produced no noise, no tail and no sparks. The other witness, contacted the local airport and was informed that nothing was seen. I contacted McChord Airforce base in Tacoma, WA and was told to contact the local police. I have also contacted MUFON and no answer has ever been given.

As I looked up, I saw the red lights of the helicopter and then I saw that there was something next to it.

I observed it as they went North East from where I was facing, over what is the City of Glendale. It went about a mile or two to the point where I could no longer see the object, just the red lights of the helicopter. Then I saw the red lights coming closer, heading South West from Glendale.

I yelled for my room mate to come to the balcony so I could be sure I was not the only person seeing this.

When my husband joined me on the day of the funeral, he told me of this incredible sighting, and believes it could have been a UFO.  He is not absolutely sure that it was a UFO, but he has never seen anything like it before.  Also, he isn&apos;t particularly interested in UFO&apos;s, but he knows enough on the subject, through me, to realize that what he was seeing would definitely fit the description of similar sightings.We live on a flight path to Pearson, International Airport outside of Toronto, so we are used to the sounds and sights of planes, including flashing lights, their shapes, and sounds, etc.  However, what he saw was completely unfamiliar.  He was just opening the bedroom window, before going to bed.  The window winds outwards, and faces north-east, and as he glanced to the north,  4 very, bright lights caught his eye, as they must have just passed through our property, heading northwards.  He said the object was completely silent.  We live in the country, so we know the sound of silence, and are aware of the times when it is disrupted even slightly.He described the object as appearing to be one, long completely flat, and rectangular craft (from the angle he was seeing it..retreating).  The lights were flashing or blinking in a pattern, as opposed to being like beams or spotlights, and they were very, bright white.  The object appeared to be descending in a manner that he described with the motion of his hands, (difficult to translate to this page) and it was as though it was descending in steps, as opposed to a smooth transition.  It quickly, and completely disappeared from his view, as it dropped beyond the horizon, just beyond the tiny, hamlet of Mono Centre, located approximately 1/2 kilometer north of our house.  Also, there is a large, Provincial park, just beyond Mono Centre, where the object appeared to descend.  He described its&apos; movements as quick and completely silent.

I am reporting a different shape, but in such a close time-frame and geographic location that it tends to make me think we probably saw the same craft, about a half hour later.Date:  July 23, 2001 Location:  Del Dios, just southwest of Escondido, CA, on Lake Hodges.Weather:  Clear, starry sky.At about 10:40 PM (22:40), we (two of us) were alarmed by a loud, relatively high-pitched whine overhead outside of our house-- apparently an aircraft, on a descending path from the west.  The impression of &quot;descent&quot;-- increasing volume, i.e. sound from an incoming source-- was fast enough for my friend, who is an experienced pilot, to say that it sounded like it was in trouble.I went outside and spotted the craft to the north-northwest of us, at an apparent altitude of about four thousand feet, about 1/3 mile to the north of us, moving almost due east.  The whine of the engine had stabilized, and the craft was cruising slowly to the east.  My friend put shoes on and came out too.  What was visible were four blinking red and four continuous white lights in a kite-shaped pattern (I chose &quot;diamond&quot; &lt;&gt; shape out of your menu choices, but it had a shorter point to the front than to the back).  The craft filled the pattern of the lights-- that is, it was not an airplane body with wings sticking out.  Stars were blocked out (and reappeared) as they crossed the &quot;line&quot; from one pair of red &amp; white of lights to another.The span &quot;across&quot; was at least comparable to the wingspan of a 737, with the length about one and a half times what would be expected.  My impression is that it was more like 1-1/2 times that size, but size and distance are tricky to estimate at night.  The craft was moving distinctly slower than a 737 on final approach, however-- i.e. at what should have been well below &quot;stall speed&quot; for any plane of its size.It was in sight for about a minute and a half, in level or close to level flight, going almost due east, before it disappeared behind trees and a low ridge northeast of us.  That path would take it over the city of Escondido perhaps a mile north of the central downtown area.  It traversed one and a half to two miles of sky while it as visible, so its apparent speed was about 60 or 70 miles an hour.The sound it made was like the whine of a turbine, with a &quot;beat&quot; in it on about a one to two second interval.  The beat was not, however, like the beat caused by wave interference from two or more sound sources slightly out of phase.  (I&apos;m a musician, with a decent knowledge of physics.)  I am reasonably sure the whine was from a single source, not multiple engines.It made me especially curious because of the many reports of &quot;triangles&quot;, whereas this was apparently kite-shaped.I mentioned it to several friends the next day.  One of them said they had been on the coast highway around ten, and had seen something out over the ocean that they couldn&apos;t identify, but didn&apos;t pull over to get a better look.Regards, ((e-address deleted)).com PS: Since this is an &quot;old&quot; sighting, you may contact me if you wish, but I am not requesting it.", "Fast moving large bright object seen over south central Connecticut at 1:35 AM on 3-28-02.Please be sure that I am as serious as could be.

Object was red, with no visible lighting or running lights, discernable &quot;deck&quot; lights, or other indications of being a multi-leveled &quot;craft.&quot; Its shape was that of two plates, one atop the other; wide in the center and tapering to ends; which appeared to be a consistant trait in its construction (angle/position to/of object did not change appearence). At first it approached low  (-300&apos;) and silently from SW (?-directions aren&apos;t my thing!). While manuevering, there was no apparent change in the objects relationship to the observer (it was as though It was &quot;facing&quot; us even as it changed direction... perhaps- likely, the effect of no identifiable markings from which to ascertain its true orientation. Though there were no &quot;visible&quot; indications of an aura or haze that I readily remember- it seemed pretty clear too Me!... I reckon&apos; one may have existed: that would explain the lack of definition and inability to denote any change in orientation during course changes/manuevers.We were at the bend of Lighthouse Road near Fort Mott Road, facing field (lighthouse to left)away from developement. It was coming  (slight angle to right- 1 or 2 degrees relative, travelling left and closing, toward Zero relative)  directly towards us and those with me were quite concerned. I at the time was 14 and quite curious, and got out of the car (a VW) to &quot;see it!&quot;. I was pulled into the car and in the excitement (panic) to get away, my cousin nearly ran off the road and into a ditch. I observed the object as it gradually turned 180 degrees from us (to the right and away from our original observation point) and headed to the actual park area (app. relative bearing from original ob. point: 045). It then proceeded (North?) from park area and while over the dike began to accelerate (acceleration was smooth and rapid- in a &quot;up-river&quot; direction towards Wilmington, DE... North?). Then it was gone! Not a streak as seen in (say) a rapidly moving light... just a clean, crisp light which increased in speed and disappeared. Note: The object did not diminish in mass or change shape indicating a turning/arching motion, nor did it fade or in any respect give the impression of a light being turned off! Never did I hear noise, nor did it behave in a manner consistant with any aircraft of my knowledge, before or after the event.

Closest approximate distance was 150 yds. I would estimate the object itself to have been the length of a medium-sized house: 40 feet? ]... this account is from memory, and except for it being &quot;somehow strange and out of place,&quot; I didn&apos;t think to correlate the incident with known landmarks for size, altitude, or distance. Quite honestly, I was 14 and fearless... more interested in determining what! it was than how big, high, or where, it was! The conditions of incident: Clear evening. Stars bright. Farmland, swamp, and open ground, which I was relatively familiar with, and no unusual activity of any kind. (Note: Aircraft activity was light, visible, and easily recognizable as aircraft, though distant; Delaware side of Delaware River- refinery and Wilmington area, with some air traffic in the vicinity of the Nuclear Power Plant).Events prior to incident/event: My sister and two friends had come home obviously distressed- literally crying because they saw a UFO. My cousin and I, for laughs and kicks decided to go back with them so they could &quot;show us&quot;... they were after a lapse of app. a 1/2 hour, still distressed. Niether of us were expecting anything- we thought they were stoned to be quite honest! Anyhow, what occured is pretty much that as stated herein, and to, the best of my memory.Since then I&apos;ve been in the Navy, at Sea, and have seen various types of Aircraft under varying conditions. None of which would fit into the category of unidentifiable or unexplainable! I was a FT (Fire Control Technician-Missiles). I am somewhat imaginative and creative, but not predisposed to irrational thought or fantasy; however, to this day I cannot explain what that object was! It continues to defy any attempt at my rationalizing what it may have been! It truely was uncharacteristic of any aircraft or aerial phenomenon of which I am familiar. A friend that lived in that area said she too saw wierd things, but I mention that in passing! Interesting Note: None of the other four People involved- my sister and cousin specifically, will discuss this incident/event; which really aggrevated me for some time! They acknowledge its occurence, but will not discuss it... which is behavior I find rather strange in and of itself! NUFORC: As stated, this account is from memory and occured some 27 years ago! This is the first I&apos;ve bothered to report it since it was so long ago and without willing witnesses or supportive evidence seemingly a waste of time. But, why not?

Before last night I had never seen anything unusual. Last night, however, as I laid down in bed, I looked out the window and saw a light flash once up in the sky. Nothing unusual there, except for the fact that less than a second later it flashed again at a distance that I would estimate to be at least 500 meters (1,600ft)from the first point. I jumped out of bed immediately to watch it, thinking that it could have been a supersonic jet, but, to my amazement it flashed again, now much farther away from the second point and not in a direct trajectory line. It flashed several more times, zigzagging in the sky, until it finally vanished behind some trees on top of a hill near the horizon. I kept looking out the window for about five more minutes to see if it would come back, but it didn&apos;t.There was no sound associated with the event.I wonder if there are any more reports of sightings similar the one I witnessed last night.

I ran inside grabbed my telescope and noticed (through the telescope) that the objects were alternating in color from red, orange, green, then white.  At first I thought I was possibly looking at a streetlight, however, these objects were at a high altitude and I realized that the lights were alternating at a very fast rate.

My two friends, who wish to remain anonymous, were with me and we decided to ivenstigate from a closer distance. When we pulled into the gravel parking lot of Padre Serra Church, the object slowly descended out of site behind the mountains. Before it descended out of site, from this distance, we could tell that the surface of the object had a distinct liquid-like texture resembling a ball of water in zero gravity. From where, I assume, the object had landed past the horizon; there was a short but distinct flash of light which momentarily lit the surrounding area to the point of daylight. When this happened, the headlights of my car instantly died followed by a sputtering motor about three seconds later. When I checked my cellular phone I found that it was also dead.

My car was about and eighth the size of the sphere. It&apos;s surface was definitely liquid though we could not see what was inside due to the silvery reflection of the surface. My friends and I panicked and tried to run from the car in different directions at which point the object descended with the same terrific speed, encompassing the entire vehicle as well as us. At that instant, there was another flash and the cold feeling of the liquid on my skin was gone. Neither my friends nor I knew what happened but when we checked, we found that we could not account for a twenty-four hour period of time.

I noticed something moving in the sky above.  It was moving in a straight line from approx. WNW to ESE.  It was viewed from about 60 degrees to about 90 degrees vertically(directly overhead), until it was obscurred by the roof of my car.  Without any reference points to determine size/height, I would guestimate that it was somewhere between 300 to 600 feet in altitude.  It&apos;s diameter I can only describe by how much sky it blocked...I liken it to holding up a penny at arms length(I know...not very professional).  It was either relatively close and small, or relatively high and large.  I could not discern which, although I am leaning toward the former.  It&apos;s speed, if the former is in fact correct, I would guestimate at about 110 to 120 Knots(about the speed of a Cessna 172).I could not tell its overall shape (whether it was a disk or saucer) due to my looking up from almost directly below it.  From below, it was circular in outline.  It did not appear to be solid, but more like a ring. It was the exact color of the very clear, blue sky.  At the risk of sounding crazy, I would have to say that it was invisible/transparent, with a slight darkness around the edges.  What I did see was a wake of whitish blurring sky moving along with it, following it&apos;s trajectory, as well as a larger blurry wake(?) being pushed(?) in front. There was also a somewhat darker white blurring towards the sides. I can only liken it to when a ship is cutting through the ocean, as it&apos;s bow pushes through the water, it creates a white foam in front of the ship as the bow parts the water.  The foam travels around both sides of the ship, and then rejoins at the stern, and then leaves more foam behind.

The fourth and last set of lights there were approximately 10-12 sets of double lights.  Each set ran vertically only this last time they made a half circle that was moving clockwise.  They were closer together than the first 3.  Kind of like a double chain or a rollercoaster.  There was no sound at any time and it took less than 2 minutes.

To our amazement...when these three &quot;satillites&quot; crossed the path of a fairly intense star(i forget which now) the star vanished until the &quot;satillites&quot; passed our particular line of sight to the star.This is all a little hard to explain...however, there was no visible lines connecting the three &quot;satillites&quot; and they never waivered from their speed,heading, or height.

It wasnt until we saw the craft moving in untraditional ways to a normal aircraft that we were a little taken back. The craft moved extremely fast and agile. It would pick up speeds that i had never seen in a normal aircraft and then instantly turn around the other direction... as if it didnt have to slow down to turn around. I realize helicopters have this capability basically, but there was no noise, and the speed and liquidness that the turn around was, could not have been a helicopter.

The boom sound radiated from the west, as well as the sound of the jets retreat, towards Holland/Grand Haven area.(25 miles away).", "The object took round around one fixed object at a very high speed. The fixed object might be the place from where these UFO&apos;s might beThese were days of exams. One of my friend came to my residence for study. When i was sitting on the staircase and talking with my friend standing in front of me, i saw one very small illuminated (white color) object up high in the sky (north direction) just on the head of the friend. The object travelled at a very fast speed in parabolic tragectory from north to east direction. The fantastic thing is that when the object just came exactly up in the sky (slightly towards east-south) the object took a small round around on fixed object in the sky even at such a high speed. The object then continued in its original parabolic tragectory and disappered towards east-south direction. I have been thinking of this event for last many years and still feel that the fixed object around which this object took a round might be the place from where these UFO&apos;s might be coming. The event time is exact. The exact event date can be found after consulting the university as to when the 2 nd paper of these exams took place.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate.

However, after it reached an arc of approx 50 degrees from the horizon, the object rapidly slowed and then curved sharply to the east. The object then hovered in a random-dancing motion before halting to a stationary position. Then, to the north of this object, i notice two similar objects, parallel to each other, moving overhead-north at satelitte speed. These two objects then simultaneously changed directions by an angle of approx 40 degrees in opposing directions, appearing to cross paths and flew off, one to the north-west &amp; one to the north east. Another object then appeared close to the stationary object, travelling towards the east. This object looked identical to the first object and was again, moving in a &apos;random zig-zagging&apos; motion, as if dancing in the sky. The brightness of this object then became very intense for about 5 seconds. It then dimmed and &apos;shot-off&apos; at &apos;satillite speed&apos; towards the north east.((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the witness uses the European style for the date.

Walking home late with hubby and suddenly noticed a very large blue light in the sky.  It seemed very low, perhaps just because of the size.  A fist held at arm&apos;s length would just about contain it.  It crossed our path on a diagonal, moving very slowly.  It continued (as best I am aware of) without any pauses.I stopped just because it caught my attention.  My mind raced to explain what I was seeing.  The best I&apos;ve been able to come up with is a helicopter with an all-glass front that was illuminated so brightly from within that nothing was visible except the light.But this doesn&apos;t explain the hardest part to comprehend.  It made absolutely no sound whatsoever.I&apos;m not sure of how long I stood there frozen in my tracks.  I could not move.  I was scared and wanted to run, but I could not move.Next, I was walking (not running) home again.  The last I saw it, it was directly overhead.  I did not turn back to see it once I could move again (which makes no sense to me at all).  I had no fear of &quot;it&quot; following me.  I fully remembered all of what I&apos;ve written here; there was no amnesia of seeing this light.

I could easily see Jets taking off from the Airport and was able to judge this object as just a few miles further North.The best way to describe this is: A SMALL WHITE, but nonreflecting DOT. Moving East to West. I caught it as it went in front (towards me) of a Cloud that was Dark. It was moving at a pretty good rate, but I know that even if it was a small plane like a Piper or Cessna, or a Traffic Reporting Plane, I would be able to make out more than a small WHITE DOT.

I sat watching it, and it only moved to a different location in the sky when i did not look at it. these distances were probably around 0.66 to 1 mile apart. it was difinately not any type of air craft i have ever seen and it certinly never acted like one. e.g no engine noise, it seemed to &quot;hover&quot; and moved large distances in short periods of time.", "big red object flew by me.my mum is 45 i am 16 we have no visual disabilities or mental illnesses. the object was round and had a red tint to it  moved in a north easterly direction until it disappered behind the building.", "Cluster of lights passing overhead at high speed simultaneously changing configurationWhile walking across the yard Friday evening I paused to see if I could identify a newly discovered comet mentioned in the news recently.Facing west I scanned the cloudless sky trying to locate Mars in order to find the comet but a cluster of swiftly moving dim lights caught my attention. The lights numbered five or six and the intensity of their luminosity was no greater than the fainter visible stars that night. In fact had I not been starring in their general direction at the time I would not have noticed them. They moved from south to north at a high and relatively unchanging rate of speed. When I first noticed them they were arranged in a roughly straight line and I took them for conventional airplane lights except they didn&apos;t strobe and then I decided there were too many and the configuration was unusal. As I tried to determine what aircraft this was the lights reorganized into a rough arc. At that point I figured these were indivdual objects and not a solid lighted body. The reconfiguration took place very quickly and it seemed as if the trailing lights had increased speed slightly and took positions on the easterly side of the arc as the others spread out to the west. The pattern was very tight which lead me to discount the normal military aircraft in formations I&apos;m accustomed to seeing in the area skies. The lights remained in the arc formation and I had the impression they were breaking into another pattern but I lost sight of them in the glare of a street lamp. the glare of the street lights of the intersection north of my home coupled with the speed the lights travelled made it impossible to find a better vantage point to track them further.I tried to listen for aircraft engines as they passed overhead but the din of passing traffic on the highway an eighth of a mile west of my location made this difficult. I couldn&apos;t make a determination of the altitude of the lights but their faint appearance gave the impression they were very distant. Likewise the individual lights seemed to be in close proximity of each other but this is impossible to determine definitively. Their size and luminosity gave the impression they were roughly at the same altitude and attitude.I would be content to dismiss this formation as satellites but for two factors: Their high rate of speed and the ability to reconfigure their positions simultaneously. On the evening of Sunday, 3/31/02 I watched the sky between 7:45 PM and 8:10 PM with the perhaps eroneous assumption that I might see the same cluster of satellites pass by yet did not.I did however note two satellites, one passing north to south and the other the opposite, and noted that these had roughly the same luminosity as the cluster I&apos;d seen before but not the greater speed. I&apos;m read of four or five clusters of satellites launched into orbit by corporate entities but I&apos;m not aware that they can reorder their relation to one another or regulate their speed. A couple days of research hasn&apos;t yielded any information on such a satellite cluster but I&apos;m open to education.", "On May 22,2002 I was leaving my job at Spearament Rhino and as I was walking to my  car I noticed a strange light hovering over it a few mles up in the sky.

Even initially, it was an exciting event.  This was a huge object.  Following a precise course and maintaining an exact altitude, this craft intercepted Scottsdale Road, made good a southerly heading until approximately Indian School road, turned over Sky Harbor Airport and eventually disappeared in the vicinity of &quot;South Mountain.&quot;  As the craft approached, we began to eliminate what it wasn&apos;t.  Not airplanes, helicopters, blimps etc.  It&apos;s speed was estimated at 40--50 mph.  It was titally silent.  It featured large amber lights on the leading edge with some smaller lights underneath, some on the side (left from our vantage point) and some visible aft.   As it passed 90 degrees and aprx 1 1/2 mile, we thought we could see substance to it, i.e, blocking out lights behind it  but transparent at the same time.  I estimated it&apos;s altitude to be 10,000 feet at the iniitial contact, roughly the same altitude as inbound air traffic bound for PHX... as it passed, the lower portion of the craft was an estimated 200 feet from the ground.

I  live near University of Southern California (USC).  I  witnessed a very strange object today on the skies of Los Angeles on the west horizon. It was a very bright object, a intensely and brightly glowing object, moving at nearly at the speed of fast low flying airplane. It was moving in an zig zag pattern and left a long trail(zig zag). This object suddenly disappeared in a fraction of second as if it dissolved into skies. This event took place, I mean I saw it at 6.25 pm 15th March 2002 for nearly 30 sec,it may have been visible for more time. I am sure it was not a air plane, or a missile or weather balloon or meteor, because all of this make a straight smoke trail and this object made zigzag trail. Other thing  which suggested that it was an unusual object was the way this object disappeared in a fraction of second. The trails of this object could be seen clearly till 6.55 pm, till it became too dark. This object was moving from North- north-west towards south and the trail could be seen starting from same directions. Other details: 1: Though it is difficult for me to tell you the exact altitude but I can explain you in relative terms. The point at which the object vanished from the skies (6.25PM), I could see the moon nearby rising at the same point (6.40PM).Assuming that the object was directly above the sea shore, which is around 11miles straight from the place where I live and applying Pythagoras theorem the distance above the earth comes out to be 8.4 miles taking 35 degree angle and 6.9 miles above the  earth taking the angle as 30 degree.2: Taking West as the horizon the Angle of inclination of the object must be around 35 degrees at the point where it diminished.3: I was just adjacent to University of Southern California from where I graduated, at the gate  of my house. (Latitude = 34.020N Longitude = 118.29W approx.) I believe that the object must be above the pacific ocean or could be within the coast, but for sure not too much within the coast at the time it vanished.4: At the time when I saw this object I was coming from the University, walking, after playing tennis there and when I saw this happen I was just infront of my house.5: I didn&apos;t hear any kind of sound coming from the object.6: The color of the object was like very bright halogen lamp of some 10,000 Watts seen from a distance of 20 meter (bright yellow), and in the same way it illuminated the large part of the surface surrounding it.7: Yes there was one of my friend who witnessed the with me the things they happened.", "I watched a diamond shaped craft hover for about 10 minutes, and captured some of it on video.I saw this thing up in the sky, several hundred feet away.I did have access to a video recorder at this time, and started filming.I just want to say that I was at work, and used the work camara that we have installed in the vehicle.It was diamond shaped, and hovered for several minutes.

I looked up and I saw like a little silver shiny sphere. It did not seem to have light by its own. We think it was just reflecting the sun&apos;s light because it was a really sunny and windy day with blue sky and few clouds (not so common in Mexico City). At the beginning we thought it was a metallic ballon (those for children) but it was a windy day and we were very surprised because this little sphere was static just like a light bulb in a room. We estimated it was very high because we saw an airplane passing by and the sphere seemed to be even higher. The same happened with the clouds. In fact after approximately 10 minutes we could not see it any more because some clouds passed by just under it. My husband concluded that maybe it was a geostationary satellite. That is why we could not appreciate its movement. But days after I searched in the  internet and it did not look like one. Besides these kind of satellites are very far from the Earth. I also looked for weather ballons but apparently these kind of balloons have some movement and they are not so big. If this was a a weather balloon it should have been a very big one because it was very far and we were able to see it.

I would like to report a UFO sighting that I experienced back in the month of August 1968. I know that this is long time ago, but I was so impressed with this incident that I still have a vivid memory of it. So there it is: On evening around 7 :00 P.M. during the month of August 1968 (I can&rsquo;t remember the exact date), I was sitting on the porch of one of my friend&rsquo;s house located on Decelles Street in St-Laurent, Quebec, which is a suburb of Montreal. We were three persons there: myself, this friend who lived at this house and another friend. We were 16-17 year old teenagers at the time and we were just talking. The porch of the house faced west and the sun was setting, but the sky was perfectly clear and it was still quite bright.All of a sudden, something caught the corner of my eye, in the Southwestern sky, at about an elevation of about 45 degrees. There was a cluster of at least a dozen disc-shaped and dark-colored objects that were moving to the north. As they crossed the sky, they assembled in a perfect V-shape and vanished somewhere in the darker part of the northern sky. The discs were about the size of pinky fingernail held at arms length and it took them about 5 seconds to cross the sky. I would say that their altitude was above 20,000 feet and they seemed to travel very fast. There was no sound.Less than a minute later, another similar group of objects that seemed to just materialize in the same southwest location of the sky, crossed the sky, while assembling in a V-shape formation, and then vanished towards the north. At first, not believing what I was seeing, I did not say a word to either one of my friends, but then I noticed that one of them was also looking at the sky in disbelief. We looked at each other exclaiming something like &laquo; what the hell is that??? &raquo;. We pointed out the discs to our third friend, who also saw them.This continued for at least another five minutes. We observed at least ten other groups of discs that would always perform the same maneuver: they would appear in a &ldquo;bunch&rdquo; and move to the north while lining-up in a perfect V-formation. All in all, we must have seen more than 100 of these discs cross the sky.These were definitely not aircraft or birds.((NUFORC Note:  Date in August 1968 is approximate.

As they passed, the second light split into two separate lights, as if up until then one light was obscuring the other. When the lights reached our 5 oclock position they all disappeared. I would estimate that each light was 200-400 feet in diameter, and each contrail was illuminated for 2000-4000 feet. We notified ATC and they had no other aircraft in the area, or anything on radar. Also, another aircraft 100nm behind us at FL280 stated they had seen the same lights.

I sat and talked with him about his sighting and he spoke of it in a very no nonsense manner as a child this age would when recalling an event from memory. I was extremely impressed by his sincerity and feel that this boy saw exactly what he described to me as seeing. In my many years of interviewing people I have become very good at noticing the difference of how a story is presented from actual memory compared to a fabricated story told more than once. With younger people like this boy, the details searched for during the interviewing process are even more profoundly different as boys this age are much better at telling you the details of what really happened rather than repeating a scenario created in story form in their head. At one point during his testimony, I asked about the second craft and how it followed in the same path as the first oval shaped object, and he corrected me in that the second triangle shaped craft actually followed a little lower than the altitude of the first object, a detail that could have been easily left out of a made up story but came out when pressed, a good sign that the story was in fact being recalled from memory.

I was it first and called out to my mother, brothers and sisters and a couple of neighbors to see the cigar/oblong shaped black/dark object just sitting still in the sky.  It was close enough that if it were a helicopter we would have heard the blades.  It preformed several fast short movements in different directions, returning to the same position.  Then it shot to the right and out of sight for several seconds and returned, the speed was to fast for a helicopter or a plane.  It stayed for only a couple of seconds more before it left and did not return.  At the time I was a teenager in highschool, my mom a wiatress.  I have not seen any other UFO&apos;s since.

When I caught up to the truck that was now in front of me, it had the same mirrors.Now, as I am writing this, I feel like I did when I realized something was wrong, confused, disoriented, and my head feels strange.Nothing like this has ever happened before, my hands are shaking as I am writing this. I feel very paranoid, like there is something wrong.I was listening to the &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; soundtrack on the way home, and the song that was on was track 10, when I turned onto the street, it just started, when I noticed the truck in front of me, it had gone to the next song. Track 10 is 3:40 long. The road is a cut through, less than a half mile long. There is no way it could have played all of the way through.", "Strange shape observed gliding over Galveston island during a warm Saturday afternoon.The object we saw was elongated with a larger bulb shaped front. It was a light grey and moving slowly (gliding) across the sky. It slowly moved about the length of a football field (I&apos;m not good at guessing aerial distance) into some clouds and out of sight. The object could be seen for about 20 seconds. This occurred during a warm sunny day with some clouds and haze. The shape and it&apos;s movement could be seen very clearly as we approved the causeway connecting Galveston island to the mainland. There had been an airshow during the day, however this craft did not have visible wings nor did it appear to be a vintage aircraft like those in the airshow. I could not see any lights or markings of any kind.", "Me and my Mom saw a saucer  with many lights hover by a house and trees then disappear with no trace.It was midnight when I was on the computer and my mom was watching t.v. We heard a annoying sound that sounded as if some one had left a radio on low. My mom asked me to go check it out. I went to my bedroom which is at the other side of are apartment and could hear the sound louder and clearer. I then looked outside to see if it was a car or someones radio. Nothing. I returned to tell my mom and the noise grew louder as i walked away returning to our living room. I then went to our screen door and looked outside nothing could be seen or heard. But the noise continued. My mom then went to our dining room window and looked outside. She looked up above the house across from are apartments to see a saucer shaped craft spinning and hovering above some trees beside the house. It had lights around the whole craft. The lights were red,blue and some green. We first thought it may be an airplane or a helicopter. But we would of recgonized the noise if it was a helicopter and planes can not spin and hover in this such way. In the hovered their for about 5 minutes max. Then all of a sudden it just hovered down fastly and it was gone and did not appear again.", "Lights Over HollywoodAt around 9PM me and my co-workers were taking a cigarette break when someone said &quot;what are those lights?&quot; they were traveling in a northern direction and very high. over Hollywood. they were traveling very fast, at that point a helicopter was flying overhead in a westerly direction. the copter gave us an indication that the objects were quite high. They stopped still very north from us. They began to vibrate. And started to switch positions from left to right and vice versa. Then they started to clime in altitude stopping occasionally. This kept on for a few minutes. I ran up strairs to my yell to my co-workers to come and see the event as it unfolded. A total 0f about 8 people witnessed this.

And as I got off my van, I happened to glance up at the sky, right over my neighbors house. At that moment I saw about seven to nine lights shoot across the sky. The lights were amber in color and they weren&apos;t blinking, the lights were steady. They looked a little bigger than the brightest star. They seemed disk shaped. They were in a formation, two lines parallel to each other, but one line was one disk ahead of the other. About four or five seconds into the sighting, the last disk maneuvered its way to the front in what seemed a split second. I ran to the left side of my house as they dissapeared over my house. I caught sight of them again on the other side of my house, but only for a couple of seconds, then they disapeared behind some trees.", "Spotlight within its own generated haze searches around,locks onto us with the lightbeam, then blasts into deep spaceI have refrained from reporting my account of what we witnessed on 6-25-01 because I wanted to wait and see what others would say over a period of 6 months or so, but after almost 9 months now I won&apos;t wait any longer.We&apos;ve kept it to ourselves and swallowed alot of emotions and neither one of has been the same since.         Here is my account  :  My wife and I were sitting on our patio (wich was coastal waterfront facing due East with no obstructions).Our conversation was interupted when this bright light seemingly turned on like a spotlight at a very high altitude.Like others I aggree it looked exactly like a spotlight from a helicopter-- but it was too high in altitude and it made no sense for a chopper to be using a spotlight that high up.There was NO noise at all and it was a crystal clear night without a cloud in the sky,just black sky with many sparkling stars.This light was large enough to make us feel like it was within the atmosphere--- but other characteristics proved me wrong.I knew from experience that on such a quiet clear night a chopper would have to be at 10,000 ft or higher to have NO noise audible.And I believe 10K ft is pretty much the &quot;useful ceiling or limit&quot; for the average rotorcraft.And yet a &quot;chopper&quot; is the only craft that can &quot;hover&quot; in one spot as this one did.(A Harrier jet wouldn&apos;t be goofing around hovering at this altitude).The &quot;light&quot; was indeed engulfed in a haze as most others said------ this haze seemed to be pruduced by the light source.The light looked like a flashlight searching in the dark--- it was actually searching around WITHIN it&apos;s own sphere of haze/fog and the beam stayed within the haze.As we staired in amazement we said things like &quot;Oh my god !!&quot; But we were at ease and actually had feelings of elation.   At this time the &quot;beam&quot; of light found its way to us and &quot;locked-on&quot; to us as soon as it crossed our position, and at this time began to move slowly directly towards or &quot;at&quot; us.We both had the overwhelming sensation that we were going to quite possibly &quot;beamed-up&quot; any second because we had this beam pointed directly at us and the source began to slowly move at us.Although I didn&apos;t want to miss one second of looking at this thing---- I had a realization that if I didn&apos;t make an attempt to &quot;record&quot; this event in some fashion it may very well be reduced to a fairy-tale story buried in skepticism by all we shared it with.I knew I had our camcorder literally within 2-3 feet just inside the sliding door and I made a frantic move turn around, throw the door open, reach and grab the camcorder swing back around simultaneously pounding my finger into the &quot;power&quot; button to fire it up and DIVE back out onto the patio all in 3-4 seconds.Well this &quot;light&quot; honest-to-god seemed to respond instantly as I pointed at it with the camera and just bursted into deep-space infinity all at once actually FORCING the haze that was surrounding it into a downward spiral/corkscrew fashion--- and as others have  said, this haze/fog lingered for awhile as it decended.The light was instantly gone leaving only the black night sky and stars to see.In OUR case, the story DOES NOT END HERE !!!!! As we sat in SHOCK and AWE on our patio-- we refused to leave our positions for about an hour thinking it may come back-- but it didn&apos;t.So we went inside to nervously play the tape and see what I got on tape-------- and I actually DID get the last few seconds before it took-off.And to me, the interesting thing on tape was the downward spiral it created in the haze when it accelerated out of there from a stationary position !!! This shows PROPULSION !!            Sorry guys, but NO missile can sit stationary at an outer-atmosphere altitude, then suddenly take off at an immeasurable speed into infinity with NO &quot;blast&quot; characteristics behind it, and what does a spotlight have to do with a missile anyway ???????? Something VERY strange happened with our vcr.We tried to turn it off because we were going to bed and it WOULD NOT turn off no matter what buttons we pushed ! I just left it like that and we went to bed.        The next morning we went to watch the tape again and the damn vcr began to chew up the tape !!! I tried to stop it but by the time it was through------ we had lost the EXACT length of tape to get rid of my proof of  what we saw.I thought I was going to drop dead I was so mad--- we have never had a tape get chewded in 20 years of watching videos and this ONLY chewed the &quot;sighting&quot; footage part and the rest was fine.The vcr has NEVER acted up again since this and we continue to use it today.I tried to take the tape to a specialist to try and correct the &quot;fold&quot; that resulted in he tape and he said it was not correctable.I still have the 9 foot section of tape sealed in a container and plan to hopefully find someone to restore the tape to &quot;watchable&quot; condition.The reason I know this tape is so important is not only what it shows------- but what it DOESN&apos;T !!  Anyone seeing this tape will know it wasn&apos;t a damn missile launch.I mean C&apos;mon guys, listen to the reports including accounts from 06/07/98----- they don&apos;t even &quot;sound&quot; like missile launches--- they lack the proper characteristics as even the people who have lived near the Cape for many years and KNOW what launches look like---- have said !! I am asking you guys now how I can ever get the chance to communicate with any of the other people who have sent in reports---- especially the pilots like the one that was flying South and caused you guys to change your explanation at the bottom of each report to state that it was an offshore submarine launch instead of the former KSC launch  ??  Can any of us &quot;sighters&quot; communicate with each other and share thoughts on this unique encounter ? Can/will you guys have something set up where someone like myself can talk-to and eventually meet others who saw this ?  Because I want to.By the way, I am a college grad,38,a military vet,former military flight officer candidate and paratrooper.

That is when we noticed these small round objects in the photos.They were different in colour, blue red and green.She took several photos and we noticed a few of these fireball-like objects had formed a triangular pattern. We stared into the night sky at them for a few minutes.It was late and dark and to be honest we were all a little frightened by the sighting and went inside.I am expecting to receive the photographic evidence anyday now via e-mail and will post them a.s.a.p., I will remain anonymous until after I post the pictures at which time I will make myself available for any questioning.((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous to us, so we cannot request copies of the photos.

After watching it move for about 30 seconds or less, it disappeared from view, either suddenly stopping, or extinguishing lights (if it had lights), or for some other unknown reason.As stars do not move like this, conventional aircraft do not exhibit these characteristics, and asteroids/comets etc. do not suddenly begin movement from being stationary, this - to us at least - was a flying object that we could not identify.((RESPONSE TO WITNESSES))Dear((deleted)) Family, Thank you very much for your report!  I found it particularly interesting, in that I, too, sometimes find myself in the Cascade Mountain passes, gazing at the beautiful night sky. My first suspicion is that you may have observed a satellite that &quot;flew&quot; into the Earth&apos;s terminator, a.k.a. the shadow behind the Earth.  When satellites fly into that shadow, they disappear from the sight, given that they are no longer being brightly illuminated by the Sun. I suggest that you watch the sky again in the near future, to see whether you can observe a similar phenomenon.  If you do, please let us know, since we would like to &quot;flag&quot; the report to let the readers know what caused the sighting. It is only a guess, on my part, but we have handled MANY reports of satellites, and yours is certainly not inconsistent with a satellite sighting. Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!

The light was the source and became incredibly bright as the vapor continued to grow and expand from the light in a perfect triange.  I can&apos;t estimate the distance to the object, but 50 miles might be a close guesstimate.  The light continued to get brighter and continued to gain in size while emitting this gas vapor - the light then travelled in a vertical direction gaining speed at an incredible rate, the light seemed to veer upward and vaporize while the gas vapor triangular cloud remained, much like a contrail.  The vapor disapated at a slow rate, but much faster that the evaporation of a contrail...more like dry ice vapor.  Within a few minutes of disapearance of the light, the vapor vanished.

After this sighting which was my first and last good sighting of an U.F.O. i tend to beleive in them a lot more. But still feel that this could have been man-made, but a U.F.O. none-the-less.Nice bright blue sky, with about 10 to 15% of it dotted with puffy white clouds that you can not see through.I had just pulled up to a stop light, facing south and was just looking at the sky, when I saw a Fairly bright silver, apparently reflective type orb emerge from one of the clouds moving east at a very slow rate and then it appeared to stop. As I looked at it I knew i had never seen anything like it before and had this really odd feeling of being watched. I looked around and remember seeing only a couple of cars to my right and the people had not noticed it, and I felt the urge to call out to get them to look up at what i saw, but as I looked back up, the orb was moving back to the right, (west), and went back behind the same cloud it came out from behind to begin with.It did not reappear on the other side, and when the light turned green I crossed the intersection and pulled over on the side for a few minutes keeping an eye on the cloud I saw the orb emerge from, but did not see it again.Well I live in a military town and on top of that there is a small airport to the south of my town so I have seen many different types of Aircraft over 30 years of my life in all different weather conditions and of course there are times when you see things that are a little different but always upon closer examination you knew what they were, jets or copters or flares, and commercial aircraft of course. From the size of this object and comparing it to all the other flying aircraft I have seen in the skys I would say the object was 10 to 15 ft in diamater, of course its hard to be sure of that aspect.But this defied anything common to say the least, the clouds were moving just perceivably to the west, so the object actually stopped or slowed down emensely and retreated back to where it came from even though the cloud was moving away from it. But that was the closest cloud in range to the object. Also the object made no sound that i could hear with my windows rolled down. Which was also very unusual.I told my wife and little girl when i got home and they were slightly amazed because they know i do not get excited over anything, and also told a couple of friends about it, and then about a year or two later, we saw an episode of sightings on the fox network that had a video of an almost identical sighting as mine, but in a different state and different time.

I had noticed a bright star that seemed to very slowly be moving downward and toward us.  I told the others to look at the start that was moving toward us.  We had just stopped at an intersection. All was dark with the exception of the bright white light that was moving toward us. We were all frozen and the man driving the station wagon was also mesmerized at what we were seeing.  He comented &quot;It is probably a helicopter.&quot; I told him &quot; But there is no sound.&quot; As it got closer we could make a shape. It was a saucer like shape.  Finally, it was almost directly over us. Actually toward my side of the station wagon.  It was about as high as a two story house so we could see many details of this thing that was above us.  On the lower part of the UFO there was a bright light and it was surrounded by what seemed about a ten foot section area which all of a sudden started emiting different lights.  It almost seemed as if there was a pattern to the lights as they went in one direction then in another.  The lights emited were changing fast from white to yellow to blue to red and many other colors.  Then they stopped.  It almost seemed as if they were trying to communicate to us.  Above the area where the lights were being emited there were what seemed to be glass windows and I could make out things moving in there.  The shape of those things were exactly like a human being except the arms seemed to be very thin and long.  The man who was driving the station wagon got very anxious and said &quot;Let&apos;s get out of here.&quot;  His mother agreed.  This UFO followed us for what seemed to be about five to ten minutes and as we were getting closer to the city lights it suddenly took off in the oposite direction.  It disappeared in what seemed to be an eyeblink.  I looked behind and noticed three military helicopters headed toward th! e genera l area where the UFO went.  We were silent all the way home.  We dropped off another of the students and then my boyfriend and I were dropped off at my mother&apos;s house.  We ran in and told her all about it.  To this date I have never mentioned this to anyone else.  I ran into the mother of the driver on a city bus and she looked at me and asked if I remembered what we saw and I told her I did.  She said &quot;It was incredible.&quot; and I agreed.  It would be nice if someone would try to contact all of us and see what we draw and say.

What I could see was tiny little lights big as the stars you see in the sky and a sort of silhouette shaped like the kite or bird which was definite by the little lights. It moved softly to the right and then disappeared behind the trees, it made no noise.

I stepped outside to light a cigarette. I looked up because I usually do as I have witnessed sights in the past many years ago and it is just habit now. Just as I looked directly up, facing the southeast, I noticed a white, star-like object appear out of nowhere. It glowed unlike a star and then went out. I continued to stare at that area in the sky and the light appeared again. It stayed like that a few seconds, went out again and came on again about 3 seconds later. To my absolute amazement, it began to move north slowly. It moved approximately the width of a face of a quarter, at arms length. Then all of a sudden it took off at the most incredible speed I&apos;ve ever seen! It left a hazy bluish, white trail for an instant and disappeared. This was the second sighting I saw that week. On April 18th at around 9:30 P.M. I saw a stationery red light from the same spot I witnessed the previos sighting. However I was facing due West. The light appeared out of nowhere, went out for about 10 seconds, appeared again and went out. This was not a plane because this light did not move. I reported it to MUFON a few days later only to find out that there were 2 other witnesses to a day time sighting in that same location. The witnesses were pilots on the ground. It hovered over the police station. Needless to say this has freaked me out quite a bit.

We saw it come from behind a mountain, and it flew upwards in a straight line. It got very bright and there was an oval halo around it, kind of a vapor trail. We thought it was either a rocket or a flare, but we couldn&apos;t see any defining characteristics. It was just a very bright light. It stayed bright as it ascended, and then it disappeared. As the sun was below the horizon, the sky wasn&apos;t very bright, but the smoke trail glowed for a really long time after the light vanished. It could have been anything, there are military installations around there somewhere, so it could have been a plane or missle. But, it also could have been Alien Grays. Who knows? There were three of us in the car. We all saw it. We are all in our early 20&apos;s and pretty cynical, but it freaked us all out.", "Silent, jet-shaped, beige hovering object viewed. Magnetic interference with watches.While driving SW on I-25 between Albuquerque and Deming, off the highway (west side) a large jet-type vehicle (bigger than a 747) was observed to hover SILENTLY off the ground for about 30 seconds.  It was identifiable by shape only.  The color was completely beige.  No windows, doors, or lights were seen.  It lifted straight up, off the ground, like it was on a trampoline, but then hovered for those few seconds, then again completely silent, dropped back down.  It disappeared from view.  The observers were myself and my husband:  1) computer specialist and 2) Registered Nurse.  There was one other vehicle behind us.  A white Chevy pick up truck, which did not stop.

Initial sighting was at 30 degrees above the horizon and it was falling left to right at 10 degrees from vertical. The oject was silver to white and was brighest immediately before it disappeared at 10 degrees above the horizon. In checking with the Regional National weather station the following day, they had other similar reports of the same meteor-like object, one from a location 50 miles to the north.

It&rsquo;s not terribly common, but certainly it&rsquo;s not impossible.&quot;Reports of the meteors flooded the 911 dispatcher&rsquo;s office about 4:15 p.m. The calls came primarily from residents of Springfield&rsquo;s east side and eastern Sangamon County, according to Springfield police Sgt. Kevin Keen.&quot;At first they thought it was a joke until more and more calls began coming in,&quot; he said. &quot;We&rsquo;re keeping our eye out for anything. None have been confirmed yet.&quot;A spokesman for the Sangamon County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office said there were no reports of damage from the falling space dust.Commonly referred to as shooting stars, meteors are tiny particles that orbit the sun and typically are no larger than a grain of sand.The particles are called meteoroids once they enter the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. They become visible, rarely for more than a few seconds, because friction between the particle and air molecules creates a blue or white glow.

First an egg shape, then disc, and finally a triangle. It also changed colors. It turned blue to red to purple to yellow and then orange.Every time I would get a good shoot of it through my telescope, it would hide behind the tree line. Almost like it knew that I was observing it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have been observing a twinkling star, but that is only a guess.  If, in fact, it was moving, it was not a star.  PD))", "Myself and two witnesses observed a light, not a meteor, moving at low altitude across the sky; its duration was no more than three secMy wife, a friend and myself were looking in the western sky trying to observe the planetary alignment.  Having missed going outside shortly after sunset we were pontificating which of the bright stars could possibly be planets.  There came a bright light coming from the south and moving at a very, very fast pace towards the southwest.  We only observed the light for about two to three long seconds.  It could very well have been a meteorite but we all agree that there was enough evidence to discredit it being a meteorite.  If it were a meteorite there would be so many coincidences, making this one of the most abstract, obscure, and simply rare metorites ever documented.  In fact the only evidence that could sunstantiate it being a meteorite are the facts that it had a very short duration, and moved at a rapid speed.The light came from behind us.  It seemed to come from nowhere the way that is common with meteorites.  I should add here that to the south,not even seconds before we observed the light, we were commenting on the number of aircraft were in the area.  There were anywhere between five and ten aircarft flying around directly south of us, again the same direction the light came from.  At least three of these aircraft seemed to be flying in almost a triangular formation as if looking for something.  It was only seconds after we made the comment about the aircraft that we observed the light.We are all in agreeance to the following characteristics that we feel differentiate this light from a typical meteorite.  Again, this could all be a rare string of coincidences.  I feel at some point you have too many coinidences and have to look in other areas: 1.  The light had no visible tail as is indicative to most meteors.  It seemed to be a simple ball of light.2.  The light never faded or quivered in its brightness and intensity.  The light remained the same constant brightness.3.  The light just disspeared.  One moment it was there, the next it was gone.  This is important because most meteors seem dissapate.  They seem to start bright and slowly fizzle out to nothingness, or at least grow dimmer.  This one just plain vanished, there was no dissapation, it gave no indication to going out, it just vanished.4.  The light seemed to remain parallel to the horizon, it gave no indication to have downward momentum...it was moving horizontally.5.  The light seemed to be lower than the aircraft.  It was at least in the troposhere or the stratusphere.  To think that this light was in the ionosphere would have to make it incredibly large.  Also at the rapid speed that it was moving would have made it close to, if not breaking the sound barrier.6.  Again, the local aircraft seemed to be flying in formation as if looking for something.  This is the same direction that the light was travelling from.7.  Again noting the size of the light.  Although meteors come in all sizes, this one seemed incredibly large.  If you could imagine a ligt about the size of the tip of your thumb moving across the sky, that would be about the size.  Again, this could be another indication as to how low the light was.  The light was larger than the lights of the aircraft, and to be 30 miles high would make this a massive object.....The general consensus of our group was that this was not a meteorite.  Was it a craft?  Maybe.  But there are just too many characteristics that could not lead us to believe that it was a meteor.  Whatever this object was, seemed to be trying to get away from something.", "&quot;v&quot; shaped orange/red thing in sky moving slowly in the distance.We saw a boomerang shaped object in the sky behind our house just above the tree line.

He also was pointing to other planets telling me what they were. I got cold (actually I got bored) and went back into the house.  A few minutes later he stuck his head in the door, and said &quot;you gotta come see this!&quot; His eyes were bulging out of his head so I thought maybe I should go.  He pointed to what looked like 2 VERY bright stars.  One higher than the other. They sorta looked like other group of stars to me, so I said ya, what about them?  He said &quot;MY GOD, THEY ARE MOVING&quot;.  I took a better look and sure enough they were not moving like a plane would, but more like floating and floating very fast. They were both moving at the same pace, one was higher than the other.  They were moving from north west to south east.  It only took say 30 seconds to move from one side of the sky all the way to the other side.  Then all of the sudden the bottom one disapered, right while I was watching! Then within 2 seconds the top one just vanished.  Where they were floating it was perfectly clear skys. There were several airplanes in the area, so we could compare movement and lights.  These were very different.  The light was so intense, especially for as high as they were, Like I said when we first saw them they looked the same size and as far away as the stars.  Only these were brighter. And the way they just seemed to float or, I don&apos;t even know how to explain it exactly. It was just so different.  And they were in perfect harmony with each other. It was 2 crafts, not one with two lights. Well, it was quite a site that we will never forget.  To bad neither one of us thought to swing that telescope around and have a better look.  But really they were flying to fast for that.  Guess I&apos;ll have to go star gazing with my husband more often... I never thought it could be so exciting.((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle passed over this area of the U. S. at 20:50 on this date.  Please see www.Heavens-above.com.

It was in fact a P-2 Orion used primarily as an electronic intelligence gathering craft.What I found unusual about this sighting was that I observed this craft over a heavily populated city at an altitude of no more than 2,000 feet and was apparently suffering from some type of powerplant malfunction, for I observed white smoke eminatting from the port outboard engine.What I found most troubling was that when I contacted Los Angeles International Airport and a local Air Force information office, I was told in no uncertain terms thatI DID NOT observe the mentioned aircraft.After being informed that no military aircraft were on any flight plan within this city&apos;s area, I did not even waste my breath relaying what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness may allude to a P-3 &quot;Orion&quot; aircraft.

I was focusing on Mars when she said &quot;hey look at that star&quot;, &quot;it moved&quot;. I looked over to the West and saw a very bright star like object fall roughly 1/2 mile to the tree line and go exactly back up to the same spot. I said &quot;did you see that?&quot; my wife said &quot;good, you saw it too!&quot; I put my telescope on it to see the object better. It looked like a yellow orange sphere that pulsated with a bright white light almost like a heart beat. There was a extemely bright band of moving full spectrum rainbow light which encompassed the object and flopped around like a Lazurus sign wave, the &quot;O&quot; shape. After watching for a few minutes we noticed a jet moving towards it from the NorthEast, then we noticed another jet coming from the SouthWest. At this time the object moved straight up about a mile and the jets passed under it. Then another jet passed under coming from the North. Then the object flew further West and it was a much smaller dot in the sky. I then remembered I had a video camera in the camp trailer. I did video tape it but it didn,t show up very well with the digital zoom so I tried focusing thru the eyepiece of the telescope. Due to some more movement by the object and myself shivering from the cold night air I didn&apos;t get much good footage, but there is about 1-3 seconds where you can see the image fairly good. Your can definately tell that the object is pulsating in multiple colors. We watched do manuevers from the same distance off and on until 11:30pm (23:50)We had to go inside our trailer to warm up about 1/2 hour of each hour. The manuevers were geometric patterns like squares and triangles and some occasional full circles. About 11:15pm I saw it perform a loop type of manuever and then another bright object came from the South and did a loop and stopped very close to the other one. They then flew futher North West looking like one bright object. I did notice jets going by a few more times (atleast 3 times but only 1 or 2 at a time) during the rest of the sighting.I hesitated to report this until I read that other people in Colorado saw the same object that night. I mean we hardly believe it and we saw it.I saw a upside down black pyramid shaped UFO in 1982 and reported on this site.I can send a video copy and drawing.", "Silent boomerang shaped craft without lightsMy 2 other roommates and I were outside on our back porch/deck, sitting down on our patio furniture looking up at the stars in the sky, when suddenly one of my roommates interjected, &quot;Hey, look at that!!!&quot;  The boomerang-shaped object had no visible lights but was clearly distinguishable from the night sky, as if it was metallic/reflective/or light-colored.  It silently sailed in a straight line in a SSE (south south easterly) direction for no more than what could have been 5 seconds.  If my attention had not been drawn to the object I would had never noticed it!  The sky was mostly clear, but there were a few clouds.  The object disappeared from view into a cloud, so I&apos;m going under the assumption the object had to have been up several thousand feet.  The relative size of the object I believe was large (i.e. larger than your commercial jet plane), relative to the size or a quarter or a tad bit smaller in perspective and appeared to have been traveling at a constant, high rate of speed (15-degrees of the sky in a manner of those fleeting seconds.)  Also, it is important to note that the &quot;V&quot; of the boomerang was the front of the craft as it was moving.  The wing tips were rounded and it really did have an overall pronounced boomerang shape, not as sharp as a 90-degree angle, I would have to say it had a 120-degree angle to it.I do not believe this was a stealth bomber; I have seen pictures of the stealth and this did not have the wider midsection of a stealth bomber with the notches.  The craft my roomates and I saw almost had the appearance of a glider, it had no larger/wider area where a cockpit would be in the &quot;V&quot;.  By all recollections the craft had no distinguishing marks on it, except for one of my roommates, she professes that she could make out a thin, black band that laterally ran across it (the band running along the front side of the craft, the side of the boomerang moving forward).", "Big Orange sphere traveling very high rate of speed,no noise like a sonic boom,no vapor trail left,no descending like something falling.Whatever it was still amazes me and the others to this day even after twenty eight years.

As I was approaching her I looked up to the North and saw two airplanes, one flying South and banking East to make an approach to Mitchell airfield.  The other was much higher and heading North West leaving behind it a vapor trail.  Immediately upon fixing my eyes on those airplanes I saw a small circle shaped grayish colored object streak across the sky in a Westerly direction.  I tried to get my wife to see it but she looked toward the direction of the airplanes and discounted what I had to say.  With my eyes fixed on this new object I walked around the back of the cars to get a better look.  This object was flying in a straight line, and the only noise I heard was from the first airplane which was on approach.  The UFO was smaller than either airplane and was traveling quite fast.  Also, it was not leaving a vapor trail.  As this object was flying away to a point West of my location it suddenly started to turn, but I didn&apos;t notice a banking movement as with the airplane.  It started making complete counter clockwise circles along the same altitude it was flying, and I made a mental note of how small the flight radius was for such a fast speed.  Well, within a few seconds there appeared a second object, and then a third and a forth.  They were all flying in counter clockwise circles stacked over the same airspace separated by altitude.  The objects were going in and out of view as if they were reflecting off of the sun and then not and then reflecting again.  I estimate watching this for about five minutes when my eyes became strained from the sunlight and I desperately wanted to go get the video camera.  So I went inside and got the camera but when I went back outside I could not find the objects anymore.  There were no news reports of any unusual flying objects.

At least i thought it was a star.

It was on the last day of class of my ninth grade year and school had been over for about 30 or 40 minutes. As I was listening to the other two guys talking, I was gazing up at the clouds overhead. All of a sudden, I saw a very bright light suddenly just turn on within a cloud allmost directly overhead. The light appeared to be moving within the cloud because of the way the shadows shifted within and without the cloud. The light appeared to be of a greenish hugh and moved slowly for about 10 seconds, then as suddenly as it had appeared, it just went out. For some strange reason, I never brought it up to the attention of my two friends who were still talking to each other. Indeed, I passed it off as a flare to myself and thought little of it afterward. Two other incidents in my later years have brought this incident into the context of a possible UFO sighting. One was the sneezing of a BB like object out of my left nostril that struck the palm of my hand and then struck  the passenger window of the car I was in with a loud &quot;click&quot; like metal on glass.

I was observing a South bound single engine aircraft climbing in altitude following takeoff and the normal 90 degree turn normally performed to avoid entering the traffic path of aircraft departing from SJC.  I noticed an unusual reflection which at first appeared to me to be a very light colored balloon reflecting what I believed to be the amber color of the city lights below.  The object appeared straight West of me at about 70 degrees, well above the aircraft I was observing.  At first I beleived the object was only two hundred or so meters from my location.As the object continued on what appeared to be a South East direction, I watched it and noticed that the shape was more of a wedge shape.  I became aware that the winds were calm and that the object was moving at a rate of speed far beyond wind velocity.  There were no distinct lights or sound produced by the object and because of this, the altitude is difficult to estimate beyond my belief of at least 1 mile or better above the ground.  I reside in the Eastern Foothills of the city at around 300 Feet above sea level in comparison to the valley floor at 80 feet above sea level.  The object&apos;s altitude appeared to remain consistent and I was hoping to get a better view of the object as it&apos;s direction of travel was bringing it towards the full moon.  Unfortunately, the object, slightly larger than half the size of the moon, did not pass into the moonlight but the moon did briefly display a companion object to the right and slightly behind the object that was not previously visable.The object continued a consistent direction of travel, disappearing around a minute after the initial observation.  What seemed unusual about this is the object speed, the shape and that as it passed into an area where city lights would have dissapated the reflection but the consistent coloration and shape did not reflect that.I have seen weather ballons lanched from near the San Jose international airport during the day and I&apos;m sure that San Jose State University also launches them at night.  The prevaling winds are such that when they are launched, they do pass over the area were I live.  I&apos;ve seen these ballons before during the day and they are usually visable only when winds are fast enough to carry them over before they are too high to see.  Those types of winds were not present tonight.  I would readily dismiss any observation day or night as one of these balloons.  If for some reason it was a weather ballon, it was huge and it was moving a lot faster than I have observed before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

We used 14 channel hand-held radios, available at Radio Shack, for comm between vehicles. On both the trip North and on the return trip South we noticed very strong broadband radio interference with both our radios for a period of tens of minutes (while travelling about 75 MPH) in the vicinity of Mercury, NV, which is about 30 miles east of Area 51.I have tested these radios and they break the preset squelch at a distance of about 2 miles, broadcasting an estimated 500 mW at roughly 440 MHz. The interference we observed broke the squelch many times on the radios as we travelled. IF the distance between us and the transmitting antenna was 30 miles when this happened, the transmitter, apparently located in Area 51 would have been transmitting at least 5 KW in a narrow band of one channel.I observed that the interference occured in all 14 bands of our radios, so this would indicated a broadband transmission of at least 70 KW to achieve this phenomenon. The total power from the transmitter could be much higher, depending on the actual bandwidth in use and location of the transmitting antenna.It is well known that typical military broadband radios transmit only a few watts or less.The only use I know of for very high power broadband radio transmissions is to transmit over extreme distances. I once calculated that I could transmit a receivable signal over 2 million miles (the distance to Mars at close approach) with only a few hundred milliwatts of output power if I used a broad bandwidth of 10 MHz. I cannot guess what would require the kind of broadband power that I observed near Area 51.((NUFORC Note:  Although we have seen no convincing evidence that Area 51/Groom Lake in Nevada is related to the UFO phenomenon, we include this report, nevertheless, principally because the witness who submitted the report is well know to us, and he is highly qualified in the field of electrical engineering and communication theory.

The atmospheric conditions were clear with vsibility unlimited.  The two objects appeared high up, and were very bright. Within moments of the sighting, a third, less brilliant object, appeared from the north west sky behind the first two objects, and flew between them. It also appeared to be a star.

I have ALWAYS been one of skeptism and thought UFO&apos;s were bogus lies from people with nothing better to do....until now.......I saw a solid oval, NO blinking lights, or colored lights, moving rapidly across the sky from EAST to WEST. I&apos;ve seen thousands of satelites before and I know for sure this was NOT a satelite. Why?? Because this object was about the size of a dime moving across my windscreen/windshield. Also, it travelled from directly overhead (where I intially saw it on climb-out), to slightly above the horizon (about 1 thumbs width with your arm stretched outward) before I lost it in the haze. The object travelled this total distance in less than 3 minutes time. My estimate - 250 to 300 miles. It had a soft, medium, white silouette light which illuminated the entire object. I was climbing out of 4500 feet at the time......my guess was that the object was in excess of 50,000 feet. I inquired with ATC, to see if I had any potential conflicting traffic, he panned his radar out to include all altitudes, and then he said nothing was on his scope execpt for &quot;a few low altitude targets that were in bound to K.C.

It was a mild yellow color without any red/green blinking lights that are required as a warning to other planes.  The weather was cool and clear  with a just few high thin clouds.

We had just set up camp when I noticed what appeared to be 5 round lights at the canyon rim, approx. 1/4 mile directly above us. I told my wife it looked like we had some &quot;spotlighters&quot; up there, and grabgbed my binoculars.  I was surprised that I could only see round lighted objects, no vehicle.  At that point two of these lights slowly moved above us and the other three slowly began to &quot;float toward us just above the juniper/pinion trees.  We jumped into the truck and headed up the only way out just as the objects were to the camp site.  When we reached the rim of the canyon we could see many objects that seemed to &quot;vibrate&quot; as they moved just above the ground, around and over trees and the landscape.  They appeared to have two sections, the bottom green, the top red, and had a white tube like section that hung from the bottom.  (like a vacumn hose) Over the next approx. 5 miles we observed approx 50 of  these.  We came to a building that looked to be used only seasonally for cattle or the bean field workers and pulled up to see if anyone was there.  I honked my horn and was starting to open my door when the windows of the bldg began to glow red.  We took off again for the paved road, not stopping to see if there was anyone at a couple of other ranch houses we saw on the way in.  As we approached the paved road, we could see a glowing red object just off the side of the road on my side.  We passed it and stopped.  I got my binoculars out and told my wife to shine the  spotlight on it.  When the light hit the object it sort of &quot;exploded&quot; and the main peice flew past my window.  We were just sitting there wondering what was going on when my wife said a car was coming behind us.  Very soon we knew it was far too bright to be auto lights.  As I turned around and put the truck in gear my wife started to scream as we took off.  I looked in the rear view mirror to see a round, very bright object, approx 30&apos; in diameter, above an be! hind us.For the next 10 miles it would drop back and then instantly be right behind us several times.  I was going 80-90 mph down this narrow country road. We turned onto hwy 666 and headed towards Monticello, about 12 miles away.  The object stayed with us until we were close to the highway patrol truck station outside of town.  I skidded to a stop in front of the station and ran inside to tell them what had happened.  They said they were having a hard time believing what I was saying but that a trucker had a very similiar story only a week before.  They had decided that it must have been a helicopter, possibly with a flame thrower of some type, because paint was burned on the truck trailer and the trucker opened his window tolook and had recieved minor burns  and hair burned off.  I offered to take any test they wanted to prove I was not under the influence but they declined.  I asked them to go with us to see for themselves and because  we had left all of our gear where we were camped.  They called the sherrif dept. and the sherrif, highway patrol and my truck headed back there.  As you might expect, there was nothing there.  Not one light.....nothing out of the ordinary.  What could I say ?  I asked them to stay up on the rim of the canyon long enough for me to retrive my gear.  As we were throwing it into the truck, we could see them leaving.  We drove up and out of the canyon and decided to find somewhere near the highway patrol station to get some sleep.  The next day, around 10 am, we awoke, sitting up in the front of my truck, at the rim of the canyon where we first saw the lights. Neither of us remembered driving back to this spot. I asked my wife if she saw the big eyed deer that was looking in the windows of the truck at us. She did not.  For two years my brother and I went back there several times and saw many of the same small luminous balls that seemed to follow us everywhere while we were in that area.  After that we saw nothing out of the ordinary for several years that we returned to the area! .

I realized then it was jet fighters who have often practiced over the White Mountain area. As seen on tv shows, they were clearly dogfighting or doing practice bombing or straffing runs and dropping the the &quot;chaff&quot; or flares, to practice avoiding anti-aircraft fire. The show lasted about one half hour and they left and flew to the west.I believe there are F-16 fighter places in Vermont with the Air National Guard, and have seen A-10&apos;s many, many times in the Sandwich.

So dim I couldn&apos;t see them with my naked eyes, only with binnoculars or maybe with a video cam which I don&apos;t have. The only other way to see them was if you caught their occasional blink. They were positioned diagonal from each other, like if they were dots on a square one would be on the top left corner and the other on the bottom right. Then Object 1 moved very slowly to the top right corner of this invisible box, while Object 2 moved at the same speed to the bottom left. They moved so slow it was like they weren&apos;t moving. By now it was 21:30. I called my mother to look while I was still keeping an eye on these things. I asked her to get her notebook to write all of this down as it happened, but somehow the notebook was never retrieved.(I later drew everything on paper.) Still in the same slow manner they switched positions. So Object 1 is now in the bottom left. Then Object 2 slowly kept going in the right direction in a straight line until it disappeared into the trees. Object 1 started to blink and was joined by another which was also blinking(maybe Object 2 again I don&apos;t know). I don&apos;t know why I did it, but things got extrodinary when I grabbed a flashlight and started turning it on and off trying to mimic their blinking. They (Object 1 and Object 3) started to move slowly over top of m! y house still far away as a star. I was Looking up towards the roof, hanging out the window. At this point my mother couldn&apos;t see what I saw. Then my mother shouted look! And directly in a straight line parallel to my window as I looked straight out there were about 13 blinking lights. At this time 21:45 several planes have already passed by in which we compared the blinking lights to, but none matched. I kept on blinking my flashlight. I don&apos;t even know why. In the back of my mind I really thought they couldn&apos;t see it because it was too high up. But still more appeared. Too many to count because of the annoying blinking. Two of the blinking objects moved left in which I followed with my naked eyes only to see them meet up with a really bright one, about as bright as the very first one I saw. It was there up until 22:45 but I stopped looking at 22:15 because I got board. It was just hovering there with the other 2. The rest had gone. My mother checked on it twice, up until 22:45 til she couldn&apos;t see the bright one anymore. The first two objects had a yellow/reddish color. The bright ones were the same only brighter. The others were dim as stars but blinking enough to get your attention. Probably 1 blink every 2 seconds.", "I Have No Idea What HappenedI was driving down the motorway with my girlfriend when I saw something hovering in the sky about 3 miles away from me. The object appeared to change shape every few seconds. At first I thought I was seeing things because I&apos;ve been driving for 3 hours non-stop. But when the object started to glow a greenish colour I woke my girlfriend up who was sleeping at the time. I pointed to the object but when I pointed there The object turned into a red glow and vanished into the woods nearby. I tried to call a friend to tell him what just happened but when I turned my mobile on all I got was static and a buzzing noise through it. An hour later my mobile started to work again but when I tld my friend what happened he just laughed at me and hung up.

I was parked in a lay by near to the village of saxton in yorkshire, England, UK when i caught sight of a shiny sperical object crossing my line of vision as i looked out through my windscreen. The object was approximately 150 - 200 ft in the air and was as big as a golf ball from where i was sat in my car. It crossed my view fairly slowly from left to right and disappeared into the field to my right hand side. It made no sound and gave off no light at all which i found strange but the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end as i watched it. I am positive that the object landed in the field to my right but again there was no sound and no light to back up my thinking. I saw no visible markings at all, it was just a plain silver sphere. I did not get out of my car as i felt the need to move on. The hairs on my neck still stand on end as i think about it even today.

My first thought was that it was a craft just hanging still in the sky - the discussion at the moment with my partner was about life in the Universe, etc. and Hope for Mankind.  It was at that moment I saw spherical light that I think became momentarily brighter ( pulsed).  I told my partner &quot;Quick Look!&quot;.

The exact shape of the oject is best described as a wide arc. Not a &quot;V&quot; or a &quot;U&quot;. It is possible that it was a formation of smaller aircraft, but with the naked eye it appeared to be solid, as the lights stayed within the same proximity of eachother throughout the entire sighting. I noticed it at 10 PM, Daylight Savings Time, moving slowly from the north to the south above our home in Tehachapi, CA. From its northerly position the leading edge was lit with blinking lights, white and redish. My husband and I were not aware of sound until it was directly overhead, then it sounded like one very high altitude jet. There was one amber light to the rear left side that did not blink. Two other aircraft were in the sky at the same time. One, which appeared to be a &quot;normal&quot; smaller aircraft behind and possibly lower but traveling in the same direction, and another to the left of the object traveling in the opposite direction. I tried to measure the size of the object with my fingers to give me some idea of its size, but with no idea of the altitude any accuracy was impossible. None-the-less, I will include that information. As it continued southward, no longer directly overhead but still close, it was approximately the length of my index finger, about 3 inches long, in a wide arc shape. The unblinking amber light to it&apos;s left rear, mentioned above was approximately an inch and 1/2 behind it. We watched it until it was obscured by the small hill in front of our house.

When ((name deleted)) called me by phone with alarm in his voice, I was surprised to find him reporting a UFO to me (I voiced my doubt as to his sincerity because ((name deleted)) is a comedian who constantly uses my interest in UFO&apos;s as material for routine comedic &quot;assassinations&quot; of my character).  He reiterated that he was not kidding and that I should come topside immediately for a look. I popped the hatch over my head and moved upward on deck to see something which made absolutely no sense whatsoever: Above me nearly 90 degrees but slightly north and heading directly overhead to the south-southwest was a brightly lit array of lights which looked like they were configured to an &apos;&quot;invisible&quot; structure which all connected to what appeared to be a central jet aircraft. Flying at about 15 to 18 thousand feet, the atmospheric bounce seemed to illuminate the bottom of what looked like a typical jet, but that is where typical ended.There is always jet noise from being very close to LAX.. this was the case as this object went over.  There were other jets in the area. What sound I might have attributed to this object would not be accurate based on our proximity to Los Angeles airport.To the right and left side of this central craft was a &quot;formation&quot; of what looked like rotating red navigational beacons.  To the right were a series of three outboard beacons, the first one being the only one that was not rotating, constant, and red. Each beacon was equally spaced on either side of this craft. The distance from each beacon to one another was at least three full wingspans of the &quot;central&quot; craft?s main wingspan. That wingspan was approximately my thumbnail width at arm&apos;s length. Relative to the central craft, none of these rotating red lights moved independently of one another as if to be fixed to some &quot;superstructure&quot; and connected somehow to the central craft.To the left of this craft and starting outboard at the same distance as the right side were approximately six of these beacons making the left &quot;wing&quot; appear much longer.  At the farthest outboard &quot;end&quot; of the left side formation was a smaller white light trailing behind its respective leader as if it were being dragged by this leading edge beacon.  This gave the impression that this &quot;wing&quot; was squared off at the left end.  The distance from these two lights which formed this termination was about four fuselage lengths of the central craft.  There did not appear to be any visible structure to the larger wing formed by these outer beacons, though, there was absolutely no variation in spacing visible which might have been caused by independent buffeting from wind turbulence or speed differences. These beacons and lights seemed &quot;fixed&quot; to a rigid but invisible framework.Each red rotating beacon seemed larger than what it should have appeared to have been for its distance and did not seem to be &quot;attached&quot; to the bottom of anything like individual fighter aircraft or the like.  They looked like they were just oversized flying red beacons, clear and bright.  I don&apos;t remember anything significant about what should have been &quot;normal&quot; sized navigational lighting on the central craft.If there was a &quot;superstructure&quot; to this formation, the sweep angle of the main wing from the central craft&apos;s leading edge was the source for any &quot;attachment.&quot;  This formation&apos;s angle might have been pitched slightly forward of the angle of the central craft wing&apos;s leading edge.The reasoning for such a configuration made no sense.  Any superstructure necessary to keep such a formation fully fixed in place as it appeared, would have been ripped apart by air turbulence from the speed this craft traveled at.  On the other hand, if there was a much larger main craft partially &quot;cloaked,&quot; then this would explain such an odd sighting.  This was my first unexplainable sighting so it is significant for me The duration of our sighting was approximately 2 minutes until this &quot;configuration&quot; of lights and craft moved out of sight to our south southwest.  That path would have taken it directly across the western end of the LAX active runways.We watched these lights from our different positions in the marina about 30 yards from each other. Scotto was watching through binoculars with another attending witness, and mutual friend Larry.Since that night MUFONLA has received at least two additional reports from different cities within LA County.

The spacing between the flashes covered approximately 10 degrees of sky (one fist width = 10 degrees)the flashes approximately 10 degrees.  The first four bursts of light were in a straight line.  When I saw the second one I thought that something was &quot;bouncing&quot; in and out of the atmosphere.  I dismissed this idea when I realized that their intensity was constant.

I also observed a white object that was moving, wich I presumed to be a white pair of jeans reflecting the moon light as the figures moved. As I was a lone female out walking on a reserve very late at night, I thought it prudent to wait quietly in the dark near the trees until these boys had passed on there way.As I crouched there with my dog and watched them approach, I slowly became aware that the figures I had thought were children were actually small humanoids who&apos;s arms and legs seemed to be too long for their bodies. They moved with a strange gait and seemed to be unclothed with dark greyish skin (although this was difficult to disern in the moonlight). As I watched in amazement and horror the boucing white object revealed itself as a rolling ball of light trailing behind the three pint size people. At this point my dog began barking and growling at them and was obviously terrified! The figures who had been walking in single file, followed by the rolling ball of light stopped in their tracks. The leader lifted his strange long arm high in the air and let out a spine tingling cry, and at this point my dog bolted with her tail between her legs, leaving me to fend for myself. After watching my dog disert me the creatures duplicated my dogs behaviour and they dissappeared into a thicket of very high wild lupins not far off! This experience was followed up the following night when my cousin, on hearing of my encounter, some how persuaded me to return to the lake with him, armed with a camera. We did not meet anymore strange figures but were buzzed by a large craft of white light which hoverd several times over the clearing.  My cousin took photographs of the light but I wasn&apos;t so eager to rush out into the clearing. The strangest thing about the whole episode was that although I was naturally terrified, I believe these creatures were even more terrified of me.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Then I started looking around and noticed that it was a starlit cloudless night. Well then I surmised that may be because it was low in the sky that it was the moon partially hidden by a hill in the distance. That was when I begin looking around to make sure it was even the moon. I glanced over my left shoulder and saw the moon. So then I got excited and went home (approx. a mile away) and got my video camera. I went to the parking lot of this church I attend because it was on a hill with a much better view, in my rush however, I did not get my tripod, but I did manage to get the object on video and took still pictures from the video.

We we&rsquo;retravelling eastbound on the downhill portion of I-44, with &ldquo;Forest 44&rdquo; on the right and Lone Elk County Park on the left, a mile or two west of Peerless Park in southwest St. Louis County, Missouri. The sky was clear blue and cloudless, with a fair wind.My wife was driving our car.  She was looking upward through the car windshield and said to me, &ldquo;Look out your passenger-side window and tell me what you see.&rdquo;  All I could see out the passenger window was the close-in trees&hellip;which is what I told her.She said that she saw a large (as big as a silver dollar held at arm&rsquo;s length), round object that was dark gray with a silver reflective edge.  (The sun was slightly behind and to the right of our travel path at that point.)  She also said that she expected whatever it was to pass right over or in front of the car &ndash; from right to left &ndash; and that I should watch the other side of the road (while she negotiated the interstate highway traffic) to see if I could see anything.Only a few seconds later, we were on the flat portion of I-44 with a break in the trees on the left/north side of the highway.  I immediately spotted a highly reflective, glaringly silver, object seemingly &ldquo;hovering&rdquo; in the distance.  The object was oblong &ndash; about an inch long at arm&rsquo;s length &ndash; and very thick.  It was much thicker (at least two or three times) than the fuselage of an airplane.  It had no appendages, or wings, at all.Since we we&rsquo;re travelling at highway speed in the car, the object may have been moving at an equal pace in relation to the speed of the car.  However, I did not detect any movement on the object&rsquo;s part in relation to the ground.  But, the object was well above the background scenery -- between 20- to 30-degrees in elevation, with clear blue sky all around it -- so there was no easy reference point.I only caught sight of the object for 2 or 3 seconds before an additional clump of trees obscured it from view.  It was only another couple of seconds before we passed that final clump of trees and the object was suddenly no where to be seen!  It was not seen again.  (Since she was paying attention to traffic, my wife was not able to look over in time to see the object that I saw on the north side of the highway.)", "Overpassing UFOIt was fast and it drove very fast. im bad to wrtoe english but excse me...!!!!", "Object releases dark orbs in Portland skies...photographed.Friday afternoon this witness reports getting out of his truck after getting home from work and seeing an object in the sky.Witness writes...&quot;I stood at the end of the drive and watched as it held it&apos;s position for 20 minutes. At that point I ran into the house and grabbed my digital camera. I ran back out to the end of the drive and it was still there in the same position. My neighbor across the street was out in her front yard and I called to her to come look at the object. I asked her if she saw something above the tree line. She replied &quot;Yes!&quot; and asked &quot;What is that?&quot; I replied &quot;I have no idea but I am not going to miss an opportunity to photograph it!&quot; I then proceeded to take the pictures I am sending you. My neighbor noticed that it was not round and that it looked like it had a wobble in it&apos;s movement or rotation. I started to take more pictures when my wife pulled in to the drive. I asked her if see saw the object and she said &quot;Yes.&quot; She also asked what it was. At this time I looked back up at the object and it was starting to move, very slowly, to the East.&quot; The object moved to the east against the wind. There was no noise and as he was looking through the lens of his camera, he noticed the object was ejecting small black objects to the north west...seven total...and then it began to move again.The couple went in the house and returned 45 minutes later to leave for dinner and watched the object from the car.&quot;As we drove across the hill towards Lake Oswego I noticed that I could still see the object and it still looked to be the same size. After dinner I made a quick scan of the sky and could not find the object&quot; the witness wrote. It was estimated that the object was at around 10,000 feet because of scale to passing aircraft in the PDX pattern and angle to horizon.Update: June 26, 2002...OUFOR team member and investigator Cameron Johnson followed up this sighting with some phone calls to the NOAA in Portland regarding weather balloons as well as a local police department for other sighting reports. He found that standard weather balloons used in Oregon are 3 to 4 feet in diameter and are taupe (tan) or red in color. The only place that the balloons are released in Oregon is in Salem and, during daylight savings time are released between 4 and 5 p.m. The balloon telemetry recorded the drift being to the South East from Salem. When asked about the possibility of a balloon hanging at a fixed position for a long period of time, he said that it was not possible because the balloons are in a constant state of ascent and the telemetry corroborated his statement. He gave a official statement that it could not have been a NOAA balloon.The attempt at finding other sighting reports from the police department yielded no results.

Loud jetlike-whistling noise awoke myself..strange because I never had heard a jet before in Raymond NH.

Note: No street lights in community where I once lived. I started screaming to my brother and cousin to come out see the object hovering above me.

VERY STRANGEI was with my girlfriend, we were walking across the street - it was one of the first days of the warmer weather in the summer so while enjoying the night I looked up at the sky before getting into my car.  I noticed I strange redish-orange light blinking in the sky.  I poked at my girlfriend at pointed at what I was seeing in the sky and she freaked out when I said it could be a UFO.  We turned our heads and browsed the rest of the sky noticing there were two other identical lights flashing in the sky.  They all had the same characteristics - they would move suddenly, then flash the redish-orange color.  No other colors were witnessed.  The two seemed to pair up, and then move in a strange manner across the sky - one that I believe convential aircraft could not make.  I can almost best describe it as a zigzag motion.  The third object continued on it&apos;s past in the opposite direction until it too was out of site.  No sound was ever hear from any of these lights.  The first two seemed to be relatively far away, but the third object did not appear to be a great distance from where we were standing.  Strangely, neither one of us heard anything from that object either.The most intersting part of this experience was yet to come.  We drove down the road briefly to go and get some ice cream from the grocery store down the road.  We we came back to my home, we drove down to the end of the road where it is a dead end and you can turn your car around.  On the way back up the road towards my house we were looking in the sky to see if we say anything.  Within just a minute my girlfriend pointed her hand up at the sky and so I pulled the car over.  We both saw what could be best decribed as an object of some sort, what now more clearly appeared to be a red flashing light, with a steady white light.  My girlfriend is insists that the object was triangular shaped with the white light on the top, red light on the bottom.  We drove, pulled over, and watched the object until it was out of sight.  Interestly enough a couple other red lights, with white flashing lights came into site by the end of this - there was an obvious distinction between the two sets of lights.  Small planes are easy to pick out in the night sky, the patterns of red, and flashing white lights on the wings is normal for this area.. but I must say whatever I saw tonight did not appear to be of the norm, althought I cannot be for sure.  All I am now left to do is wonder..", "black disk flipping over or rolling over end to end.We were walking the dog in our neighborhood and saw a black disc in the sky. There was still plenty of light in the sky and we could see it clearly.It made no noise. I saw an object last month like this also. This was only one block away from that previous sighting. This time it was higher but it behaved in the same way, flipping or rolling over end to end. It moved very slowly upwards and southwesterly. I don&apos;t know of any manmade craft that can fly so slowly. Even a balloon would rise more rapidly. When I ran to get the camera my daughter saw it give off a whitish light. By time I got back it was higher in the sky and I took six pictures. I don&apos;t know why but there is not even a black dot on any of the images. Nothing showed up.

At the time I was only  6 years old and my brother 11.We were standing in back of our house and both noticed a white light shoot down, stop,  then two red lights slowly shot down to the ground.Then the original white light shot back up into the sky much faster than when it came in and disappeared.   The whole incident took a good one to two minutes.  Not just something you see out of the corner of your eye.  We sat there and observed it discussing it with each other as it happened.  We may have been young but we know what we saw.We were both so certain that something alien had been deposited on earth and we wanted to check it out all though I was scared.  It was then our mother called us in for dinner and she didn&apos;t believe our story.  She insisted we eat dinner first and then allowed my brother to go search for whatever had been deposited.   When my brother went out armed only with his BB gun I was both scared for him and curious, hoping he&apos;d find proof of our sighting.   Unfortunately he came back empty handed.Now 31 &amp; 36 my brother and I recently were visiting when my brother asked if I had remembered our experience.  We found it rather eerie that we both remembered it exactly the same way to the detail in the same place all these years later.We&apos;re certain It was not fireworks or any other man made device.There are no military bases anywhere near our family home.  It seemed as though it were very close say one mile away but that could have been deceiving.   There&apos;s a floodway running behind our house and it seemed as though that was where the lights should have gone.  They may have landed as far away as Bird&apos;s hill park which was about 10 miles away. We were unable to make out a ship or anything other than the lights, it seemed very close but still was no more than a bright light.Thanks for allowing a venue to tell our story, people tend to look at you funny when you tell such a story, particularly because of our age at the time.

However, I had never heard of iridium flares before- might this explain what we saw? It did not appear to be as high in the sky as satellites are though. Are iridium flares that big?

It was in the middle of a banking turn with one wing tip down and the other up. This gave me a good look @ it&apos;s top view profile or footprint. It was a solid black chevron shape. It&apos;s nose and wing tips came to points. After turning the craft descended dissapeared behind the trees, which obstructed my view of it actually touching the ground. I saw a Cessna @ about the same altitude about 10 minutes later and from comparing the sizes of the 2 craft I figure the UFO was about the size of the Stealth Bomber. I design packaging for flying toys. I have a lot of reference photos of our Stealth Bomber, and this was NOT a Stealth Bomber. As soon as I saw it, I knew I had to be looking @ the craft responsible for the famous &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; incident because the shape was the same as the shape rendered and shown on local TV. The thing that sort of puts the icing on the cake, is that this aircraft landed @ Evergreen Air Center. This thing flew like a conventional aircraft. I had my windows up and was probably too far away to hear any noise anyway, so I didn&apos;t hear anything. I saw no lights, and I didn&apos;t see any cockpit or windows. As it leveled out on it&apos;s approach, I could see what had to be it&apos;s landing gear, but I couldn&apos;t make sense of what I was seeing. It didn&apos;t seem to make sense, it just didn&apos;t jive with what I know about retractable landing gear. The shape of it&apos;s profile seemed awkward, I tried to contact local news about it, but they just refered me to guy locally that didn&apos;t help or do anyting.", "I WAS OUT WITH MY DOGS IN THE FRONT OF MY HOUSE AT ABOUT 11:00 PM WHEN AN OBJECT CAUGHT MY EYE IN THE SOUTH IT HAD RED, GREEN AND WHITE FLASHING LIGHTS SO I FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRPLANE.

I live in a master planned comm. in the mountains of scottsdale and have a view of most of phoenix. I was driving home at 9:45 and noticed three very large orange lights (10x the brighteness and size a commercial plane puts out)above some cell phone towers.  I thought that a mountain was on fire.  When I got home I told my girlfriend about the fire and we went and looked and the fire was gone.  A minute later 2 &quot;fires&quot; started back up followed by a 3rd.  They were on for a couple of minutes and then quickly flickered out (they same quick flicker from a rotating movement, which we would later figure out.)  Another minute later the 3 lights (obviously not a fire anymore) appeared much higher.  We got binoculars out and verified that in fact there was no mountain where these lights were.  We observed this flickering and moving for another 15-20 minutes.  During this time they moved behind a notable landmark, Camelback Mountain and hovered there for at least five minutes. In looking through binoculuars, it looked like we could see a shadow, approx 10-15x the size of a 747 behind each light.  When the lights &quot;flickered&quot; out, we could somewhat make out that the shadow was rotating.We decided to get in the car and drive to a higher vantage point within the community.  We were there for approx 25-30 minutes. During this time, we observed that air traffic over phx had come to a standstill. Sky Harbor Int&apos;l Airport is one of the busiest in the country and at that time of night multiple planes can be seen in approach pattern.  For 10-15 minutes while were at this location, we observed no planes and no bright lights.  For Phoenix, this is totally improbable.  Then all of the sudden the sky filled with planes. These planes had weird lights, a triangle shape, and moved extremely fast w/o making any noise.  they appeared to be patrolling the skys and playing cat and mouse with bright lights that appeared and disappeared. A bright light appeared directly overhead and then disappeared as a triangle object that resembled a stealth fighter appeared behind it. We left the area and went home because we were frightened.  Once arriving at home (2 minute drive) we went back outside and the sky looked normal (planes in the air and landing).We did not call any of the local news because we felt for sure there would be many witnesses and footage.  As of 12:00 PM Phoenix time 6/28 there has been no mention of this.((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Francis Emma Barwood, former Phoenix City Council member, for having directed this witness, and others, to our Online Report Form to have these sightings recorded.

We thought that it was a weather bloon.  It was not moving around and just seemed to stay in one place.  As we watched it, the object, that appread round from our point view, rotated on its axis, so that we could see that it had the shape of a saucer.  It was gray in color with no flashing lights, noise, or windows that we could see or hear.  We had to use one hand to block the sun from our view.  The saucer shaped object then started to move slowly towards the West.  We ran to some of our neighbor&apos;s homes and asked them to come out and look at the object.

For the duration of the sighting, the object appeared to simply hover in one spot in the Houston sky.Because the oject was in the part of the sky that I, the driver, could not see, she was the only witness to it. She took her eyes off the object for the briefest moment and when she re-focused on the area in which she had seen it, it was gone. It appeared to have simply disappeared.My wife thought of every possible explanation for the object (helicopter, hang glider, etc) but nothing could explain its strangeness.I am the UFO buff in the family and you  can imagine my disappointment that I could not see the thing!", "What my parents do not lie.IT was in the 60&apos;s I was asleep in the back set of the car and did not see anything, my parents and older brother seen it land in a feild and just hover.

No one that we knew of was on the road.We were able to see and hear the approach of about three passenger jet planes as we walked. Each plane was clearly visible and fairly well into descent as we saw them. There were distinct intervals of time between each air approach when the windless quiet of the night resumed. In other words the traffic wasnt &quot;stacked up&quot;. It was during one of these interludes that everyone in the family heard the sound of something up above us.The sound was of something clearly moving thru the air,BUT!!! there were no lights no engine or jet sounds... nothing but this sound. I want to emphasize that there was no natural wind activity in the area. Everyone was perplexed and at a lost for explanation. There were two events of this nature. At the end of this section of road an airport police squad car was parked.We are wondering if anything like this has ever been reported. We are stumped. We know all of the noises and effects associated with planes overhead in this area,as we have walked it before.((NUFORC RESPONSE TO WITNESS))Dear Mr. ((name deleted)), Thank you very much for the report!  Yes, what you report has been reported to us before...I believe you heard the turbulent vortex activity generated by the tip of an airplane wing.  When airliners land, using a relatively high angle of attack on approach, the air on the bottom of the wing &quot;leaks&quot; around the tip of the wing.  This continuous process generates a &quot;tornado&quot; at the tip of the wing, which persists in the atmosphere for a long period of time.  The twisting air can be heard at ground level, and it is quite prominent in a calm sky. That is only a theory, but I suspect that if you return to the same location, you can experience the same effect. Thank you for sharing the information with our Center!

A group of 7th graders were supposed to swim in a lake on the mountain top, but moss or scum was on our side of the lake, so we just started talking. The subject was Hawaiian dancing, I remember, and suddenly, one little boy screamed, &quot;Hey! Look at THAT!!!!&quot; It was silver, and looked like two saucers glued together with windows where they joined.  It was so close, we could see figures at the windows that surrounded the middle seam. This was 1953, and none of us had ever seen anything move like this craft did. It hovered and then it completely disappeared until it hovered diagonally from where we had just seen it. These 7th graders were beside themselves enjoying this unbelievable demonstra- tion of mechanical manuvering. I was awestruck and was sure it belonged to our govern- ment, and how wonderful!  The boys in the group knew it was a UFO, but I didn&apos;t until years later. My friend and I went to the Iowa State Fair, and they announced that there was a showing of a guided missile. I was so excited to see it up close, and when we got there, it was like a stove pipe with a tin hat and nothing compared to the craft we had seen. I asked the military man where the craft was that looked like two saucers with the windows in the middle, and that hovered here and hovered there and disappeared in between times, and he looked at me like I was crazy and said, &quot;Lady, we don&apos;t have ANYTHING like THAT!&quot;  Well, I was so upset to think that what I saw might not belong to America, that my friend and I walked four miles home and I was in terror the whole time thinking how I was so wrong and those little seventh graders were so hep and right.I don&apos;t know how large this thing was because we had nothing to compare it to since it was above us and we were on the top of the mountain looking up. The windows were not clear glass, and we saw moving figures, but they were dim and didn&apos;t seem large-sized from where we were looking. (Years later, my husband and I heard a woman at my Dad&apos;s house in Myrtle Beach, SC, tell how the same type of craft that I saw landed on a freeway where she was driving, and it was enormous in size, and all the people moved to the side of the road and got out of their cars to get a better look. Some teen-ager was behind this woman, and he was so excited, he grabbed her and started jumping up and down and screaming...&quot;I finally saw one!

Sphere.This witness reports seeing a chrome sphere.Witness reports...&quot;I had just stopped in a local tavern after work. Several individuals were going out and coming back looking at something in the sky they couldn&apos;t identify. I went out to take a look, and noticed a chrome sphere hanging in the SE sky at about 40 degrees from the SE horizon. It looked very high in the sky (jet level), but definitely in our atmosphere. The moon was clearly visible off the southern horizon, and the sky was absolutely clear. After watching the object for several minutes a small, brightly lit (glowing) red sphere appeared to the left of the chrome sphere. It flew to the right of the chrome sphere, then disappeared while moving quickly in a southern direction. The chrome sphere stayed visible for about 45 minutes, as other onlookers came and went. The object disappeared momentarily, and reappeared at about 30 degrees to the horizon, in a northeast direction. Holding my fist to the sky, it had traveled about four fist-lenghts. After that movement, the object appeared to be fading very slowly towards the SE horizon line. At approximately 18:45, a rice shaped object passed slowly across the sky directly in front of the chrome sphere. The oblong object left no contrail and had no warning lights. Shortly after this object (traveling from south to north) went out of sight, an airliner was visible traveling in the same approximate direction, but lower in altitude, leaving a contrail.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6/21/2002 5:15 p.m. Gresham, OR. Sphere...drawing submitted by mail.This is the forth report of the June 21st sphere from Portland/Lake Oswego.Two more reports to follow.The OUFOR hotline received another call regarding this particular sighting and a formal report and drawing was submitted through the mail. This witness appeared to be at a vantage point using a telescope so as to better identify the object. This is the drawing that was submitted based on that observation.The witness in this report writes...&quot;It was slightly bulbous (i.e., not round, slightly bottom heavy) and did not seem to rotate because the positions of the dark lines which run from the top of the sphere to the middle of the sphere never changed. The projection at the top was actually at about the one o&apos;clock position in the telescope. This round projection at the top would &quot;light up&quot;, i.e., increase in brightness every few minutes to about ten times it&apos;s normal brightness.&quot; While there was no mention in this report about the dark orbs that were seen from other parts of Portland and Lake Oswego, this could have been due to when and where the object was viewed. It also could be attributed to the long duration time in all of these reports as witnesses were watching the object at different times.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6/21/2002 4:50 p.m. Lake Oswego, OR. (Not far from Portland) Circle.This sighting appears to be the same object seen in Portland at 4:42, 5:15 and 5:45 p.m. The object is described as being a white sphere at around 6000 to 7000 feet. In this short sighting period it was described as being fixed, nailed in place and was the size of a BB held at arms length. The witness looked at the object with binoculars but were unable to determine any surface texture or tether should it be a wheather balloon. The witness called this sighting into the local radio show GroundZero that evening and two other sightings were soon called in to confirm, one with 5 witnesses.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6/21/2002 4:42 p.m. Portland OR.

At that point I ran into the house and grabbed my digital camera. I ran back out to the end of the drive and it was still there in the same position. My neighbor across the street was out in her front yard and I called to her to come look at the object. I asked her if she saw something above the tree line. She replied &quot;Yes!&quot; and asked &quot;What is that?&quot; I replied &quot;I have no idea but I am not going to miss an opportunity to photograph it!&quot; I then proceeded to take the pictures I am sending you. My neighbor noticed that it was not round and that it looked like it had a wobble in it&apos;s movement or rotation. I started to take more pictures when my wife pulled in to the drive. I asked her if see saw the object and she said &quot;Yes.&quot; She also asked what it was. At this time I looked back up at the object and it was starting to move, very slowly, to the East.&quot; The object moved to the east against the wind. There was no noise and as he was looking through the lens of his camera, he noticed the object was ejecting small black objects to the north west...seven total...and then it began to move again.The couple went in the house and returned 45 minutes later to leave for dinner and watched the object from the car.&quot;As we drove across the hill towards Lake Oswego I noticed that I could still see the object and it still looked to be the same size. After dinner I made a quick scan of the sky and could not find the object&quot; the witness wrote. It was estimated that the object was at around 10,000 feet because of scale to passing aircraft in the PDX pattern and angle to horizon.Update: June 26, 2002...OUFOR team member and investigator Cameron Johnson followed up this sighting with some phone calls to the NOAA in Portland regarding weather balloons as well as a local police department for other sighting reports. He found that standard weather balloons used in Oregon are 3 to 4 feet in diameter and are taupe (tan) or red in color. The only place that the balloons are released in Oregon is in Salem and, during daylight savings time are released between 4 and 5 p.m. The balloon telemetry recorded the drift being to the South East from Salem. When asked about the possibility of a balloon hanging at a fixed position for a long period of time, he said that it was not possible because the balloons are in a constant state of ascent and the telemetry corroborated his statement. He gave an official statement that it could not have been a NOAA balloon.The attempt at finding other sighting reports from the police department yielded no results.

It got closer to where I could see it very well, and well enough to know it was not a plane, and it was not a helicopter, and it was not a balloon of any kind. I was alone, and on the phone with my mother when I saw it.

I hung up on my mother, while I sprinted down the second floor steps to the parking lot of our apartment building.  By the time I got to the parking lot to scream out to him to look up, it dove off to the north/east behind the trees very quickly, and it was gone, ALMOST AS IF IT KNEW I WAS TRYING TO GET SOMEONE ELSE TO LOOK AT IT.  The lights were all the way around the craft, and seemed to move around or light up at different intervals. It was very close to the ground, closer than any commercial airliner would be. I am guessing it was around 10 pm and it wasn&apos;t cold out, so possibly summer or spring time, but I didnt log it down, so the details arent as clear as they were. I didnt want to tell anyone for fear they&apos;d think I was crazy, but I am more curious now than anything to see if anyone else saw what I saw.

The area is often cloudless giving a very clear sky My parents were on the terrace, and called me to see something strange. By the time I got to see the group of three star like objects( three lights) moving North very slowly, my parents had been watching the objects for about 10 mins, moving slowly and then stopping. When I saw the object(s), it stopped and remained that way for approximately 10 mins or so. In those days there were no aircraft in those parts, and the only things we were used to seeing were shooting stars or the Gemini or Russian spacecraft occasionally orbiting the earth at a pedesrian pace One of the lights then detached itself from the group, seemed to hover for a few seconds and then accelerated upwards at a phenominal rate. After a few minutes, a second light detached itself and shot upwards in a different direction at a phenominal rate. Finally the third remaining light did the same after a few minutes. They all disappeared, and were not seen again. There was no sound.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At around 9:30pm I looked up in the sky and noticed a really bright ball of light, it was a craft I was sure of that but it was too large to be any type of aircraft or helicopter. It had two flashing lights one on the top and one on the bottom of the craft. The brightness of the craft could have been mistaken for a plane as the main direction of the light was facing west to east, (the way you would see the headlines of a plane.) but the craft was heading north to south at a really slow speed. The size of the craft even though high in the sky seemed to change shape, when I first saw it, it was shaped like an oval, but after a few minutes in turned into a cigar and then back into a on oval. I was able to watch it for almost ten minutes because of its slow speed, but then it went behind a tall building and a group of trees, I waited patiently for it to appear on the other side of the building but it never happened, after about 2 minutes I realized the occupants of the craft must have detected a &quot;believer&quot; had spotted them and took off...", "I believe it was the Air National Guard preparing for deployment.I recently read a letter to the editor form Director Peter B. Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center regarding some unusual events on 6/18/02.  I witnessed the &quot;unusual&quot; event at 9:15 on my way home from work. (I am a police officer) I watched as an aircraft dropped flares approximately every 2-4 seconds.  The aircraft was approximately 1,500 to 2,000 feet above ground level.  I could only see the marker ligts of the aircraft initially.  I watched this activity from my back deck for a few minutes.  I did not think much of it because I routinely observe military aircraft of various types training in and just south of the Sandwich Range (the southern most range of NH&apos;s White Mountain National Forest).  A few minutes later, I recognized a UH-60 helicopter briefly touch down at the Moultonborough Airport (I live next to the air strip). Every so often, citizens of my community become alarmed when military aircraft stray a little south of the Sandwich Range.((NUFORC Note:  A description of this event can be found on the NUFORC homepage.

There was no sound what so ever coming from it. My brother told me if i could see the stars between the lights, I seem too be able to see the stars but it seem blurry when viewing the light between the three point of lights on each corner point. as it moved forward i can tell that the lights on the back (two on back one in front)were close together , to form a narrow type of triangle, not a true pyramid shape.  It disappear, not like vanish but like it went behind something. Like the front of the triangle disappeared first and then the rest followed, like it went into a hole in space slowly passing into it. Then after it was gone we saw another slow moving single light follow it and disappeared in the same spot in the sky. Shortly after that we saw anther light, orange in color, it seem to move erratic, like it was flapping, with wings we watch that disappear in another place in the sky, not like it went out of site it just seem to fade away... I do not know if it was related to what we saw.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was watching what are suspected to be N.O.S.S. satellites, which we believe are launched periodically by the U.

Tonight though, I noticed that something wasn&apos;t right about them.  So I closed the car door and leaned back against the car to see if I could figure out what it was.  Then I noticed 3 stars in a triangular pattern that I could not recall ever seeing before.  I began trying to get a fix on the star patterns.  I knew the location of Polaris and these stars were just left of it.  From my position, I&apos;d say they were North Northwest.  Next I located Cassiopeia, just to my right or North Northeast.  So then I looked back to the stars to see if I could identify them and as I watched them, I thought to myself that they were moving.  At first, I dismissed it as a trick of the light, but after a few more seconds, I used my index finger and thumb to measure the distance from a near by tree.  I was getting ready to take a second measurement when I noticed that I could definitely see movement.  All three &quot;stars&quot; were moving in an East Southeasterly direction.  All three lights were &quot;white&quot; light.  I didn&apos;t notice any color change or flickering in them.  The front light and the back right light were the brightest, the back left light was about half the brightness of the other two.  As I watched, the lights got closer overhead, then they suddenly went out.  All three of them at the same time.  I noticed that there did not seem to be any difference in the movement of the lights, that is to say all three light remained the same distance apart during the time I watched them.  Almost as if they were all attached to one object.  I waited outside for a few more minutes to see if the lights would come back on, or if I could hear some kind of engine noise, but nothing else happened.  About a week later, I mentioned the event to a group of friends and one of them told me that someone who worked in the City of Fayetteville, approx 30 miles away, had mentioned seeing something similar.  Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t get the name of the individual and hav! e lost c ontact with the friend who mentioned it.  I&apos;d also like to add that I served in the USAF for 20 Years, where I worked on Aircraft from the SR-71 to Special Operations Helicopters.

I was to clock on at 04:00 so I thought I would whatch the event myself. My understanding was that the ISS would be passing from the SW.

I was a Naval aircraft mechanic from 1968-1971 and do not believe that this was an aircraft presently in our inventory nor do I believe that we have vehicles that could demonstrate the technology necessary to achieve the air display that I witnessed.There was no sound.

It was an early Monday evening,July 15, 2002. The temprature had been in the low 90s all day. At approximately 19:40 hours, a brief summer thunder shower passed over our area. The heavy rain and thunder and lightening lasted about 15 minutes.

When she stepped outside, she looked to the east, and saw a double rainbow spanning Mount Sentinel, which is almost directly behind our building. She quickly ran inside, and grabbed her Sony Mavica digital camera. She then returned to the parking lot to photograph the double rainbow. She took approximately 24 pictures. On 4 of the 24 photos, we noticed what appear to be several fireball looking objects in the sky. My wife did not notice the objects in the sky while she was taking the photos.

The objects were small, about one foot in length and were plain, no lights, nothing at all.  What was just as strange is that they appeared and then disappeared but we didn&apos;t see them fly in or fly away - they came and then they were just completely gone.  I looked into the other cars to see if people were waving or pointing but no one else seemed to have seen the objects so I kept my mouth shut.  A few minutes later, my friend said, &quot;You are going to think I&apos;m crazy....&quot;  I said something like &quot;Go ahead...&quot;  He said,&quot;Did you see anything strange?&quot;  I became very excited because he had seen them too and our descriptions matched exactly.  These three objects were flying in a V shaped formation and neither of us could explain what they were.  We knew we were near Bradley Airport in Windsor Locks so we kept trying to explain it on those terms, that it was experimental aircraft of some sort.  Then I said maybe they were remote controlled toys - but who would fly them across a busy highway? and why did they appear and disappear so suddenly like that?  I turned on the car radio to see if there was any mention on the news but there wasn&apos;t.  When we got to my parents&apos; house I ran to the tv to see if they were talking about it but there were no reports and there was nothing in the papers the next day either.  I have never forgotten this incident.  Small, wedge-shaped, close-up, dark silver, appeared and disappeared suddenly, at dusk in early spring.

Suddenly all the lights went out.   A power outage.   I quickly decided &quot;time for bed!&quot;  So I went through my new custom of walking throughout the first floor rooms, closing the windows before retiring upstairs to the master bedroom.  Only this time, it was pitch dark.   As I went to the little rear left bedroom, I went to the open window which faced east and watched as the whole area was without lights.   I could see the large light standards near the high school about 1.5 miles away which were the only operating lights that I could see.  I could hear an occasional vehicle go by on Volcano Highway three blocks to my left (Northwest).   I stood there enjoying the wonderful, sultry trade winds blowing directly into my window on this beautiful, mostly clear evening.  The moon had risen to my right (Southeast) Suddenly, slightly to the left (North) I saw a sphere of blue-white light coming in this general direction.   I figured it was a helicopter with a searchlight coming to investigate the power outage situation...maybe to locate a transformer out of commission.   But I have seen MANY helicopters with searchlights, having lived in Pasadena, CA, where the police use them nightly; and in New York City, which has more choppers than any city in the world.   They have a definite beam of light (this didn&apos;t) and, of course, helicopters make lots of noise (this was totally silent).I could still hear the traffic go by on Volcano Highway and this object was &quot;hugging the treeline&quot; as it made somewhat acrobatic moves and an &quot;S-turn&quot; or two.   As I looked at it, I figured that it was no more than 1/4 mile from me and the light source had three distinct &quot;spike-like&quot; beams emanating from it.   Almost like an astronomical image with a diffraction pattern.  One beam went straight up (0 degrees), another to the lower right (120 degrees) and another to the lower left (240 degrees).   As it kept moving, I was aware that I would shortly lose sight of it as it passed behind the outcroppings of my neighbors&apos; properties across and down the street.  So I ran upstairs where I should get a longer view of it.   It took perhaps 6-7 seconds to get upstairs, but alas, it was gone.  I never saw it again.I was anxious to see an explanation of the power outage.   In the Hilo Tribune-Herald of two days&apos; hence there was an article.   At 11:30PM a blown transformer caused a power outage in Kurtistown, Mountain View, Keaau, and the Kawailani section of Hilo.   The Kawailani section of Hilo had its power restored at 11:41PM (which is right after I saw it) and the other areas (including mine) had their power restored around 12:45AM.I have looked for anomalous objects all of my life, and this is the first one that I have seen fairly close by that I really could not explain.  I possess a degree in Astronomy from Caltech.", "Eight objects flying in a modified V formation; seven smaller objects all with one red light, white light on larger objectWhile I was talking to a friend outside one night I noticed in the northern sky behind her, eight approaching aircraft which I estimate their altitude to be 15, 000 ft. to 20,000 ft. These may have been seven spotter or escort planes accompanying a much larger craft in a modified, yet very structured V formation.  The five smaller objects, with one red light each, fanned out evenly spaced to the side and behind the larger craft left wing. The larger craft appeared to have only white light(s).  On the right side of the larger craft were only two other objects (also with one red light each) replicated the same pattern and spacial distance as noticed on the other side of the craft.  The five objects on the larger craft&apos;s leftside (as well as the other two on the right side), each had one bright red light which flashed once (for approximately one second -- much like an airport runway strobe but slower)) in a sequential fashion from the lead object back to the last and then repeated this same sequence as it continued across the night&apos;s sky.It began in the northen sky and seemed to cruise at what would be a normal commercial aircraft speed for that altitude taking appoximately 1min/30sec to cross from the norhern most horizon to the southern most horizon. The sound was a gentle whisper and appeared to defy what might have seemed a normal audible sound for so many aircraft.My friend began watching almost immediately after I spoted this unusual formation.  She did not distinguish 8 separate objects, but felt that it was one composite.  My engineering background and practical mind convinces me it must be eight craft in total, although I could not see eight separate craft.  Is there some practical explanation or answer for this type of formation?((NUFORC Note:  Time was corrected by witness to 22:10 hrs.; we have amended the time here.

But all of a sudden after I was haveing this health problem I was scard of going outside at night. Then one night I woke up and saw my bedroom drenched in light, and heard my dog fall on the bed. I swear I am not joking. I had this weir feeling that I was being experimented on and that was the cause of the bleeding and pain.

I immediately ran to my deck (I was at home)--I also noticed many neighbors on their decks.  The sound was incredibly intense--It sounded as loud as if a plane was taking off right above us--we (my neighbors and I) were all covering our ears and frantically (and we were all quite terrified as well) searching the sky for a low flying plane.  There was absolutely nothing.I mean --this sounded like a freight train--like a jet was about to crash directly into us, like it was flying just right over head---the only time I&apos;ve ever heard anything HALF this loud was in NYC on 9/11 (I was about a mile away from ground zero)--so I just don&apos;t understand what it was.  There was no plane in the sky--there was NOTHING in the sky for miles around.  We all looked and looked.

About fifteen or twenty seconds after they all turned off, there was a white and green flash to the right of where the main light was, even though this was quick it had a shape to it. At the present over an hour after the first light popped on, the process is still repeating itself in a seemingly random manner.

This little forest was about 100 yards by 35.  Also, the church I attended was only about 500 yards west from my house.  (the road i lived on ran east and west) I believe it was late morning when my friend and I went across the road to play in my grandmothers barn.  It got to be close to 1:00 and we decided we should go back to my house.  We walked through the trees and down the ditch to cross the road when we both heard a loud humming/buzzing sound from above.  We both looked up and saw a large boomerang shaped flying object.  I would have to say that it was shaped exactly like a boomerang, with small towers at the three ends or arms that stick out of a boomerang.  There was also one slightly larger tower in the center.  The color was a very light blue, and I remember alot of little flashing lights on the top of it.I would also have to say that it was flying at under 1000 feet.  Probably 700-800.It was almost directly over the church when we saw it.  We then ran back under the cover of the trees and watched it move, very slowly, and also rotate as it moved.It proceeded over the church and kind of circled over it and headed South.   We intently watched it, waiting for it to go away.  It got to be about a half mile away and circled back.  It made another run over the church and went back south.  We watched it until we could not see it anymore.  We then ran across the street back to my house.We did not say a word to my parents, or to his, because we knew at our young age nobody would believe us.  I did not tell anyone until after I was 16.  I&apos;m not sure when the first time my friend told anyone.  Probably waited longer than I did.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I walked out a ways and went to a tree ((deleted)) and looked up at the sky and saw a slow moving, glowing blue sphere.  I couldn&apos;t gauge distance, or size.  It was moving slower than an airplane, but it wasn&apos;t an airplane, or a helicopter, because there was no sound and the lights were different than that.  It wasn&apos;t a satellite because there was clouds that would block view of satellites.  I watched it for five seoncds then thought, &quot;Just what the hell is that?&quot;  Right then it stopped, glowed a litttle brighter, and then vanished.  I stood around for a few minutes hoping to see it again.  Then the hair on my body stood up and i thought i heard sounds like wind in two different points approx thirty yrds out in the woods and got scared and went inside.((NUFORC Note:  May have been the characteristic flare from an Iridium satellite.

I looked up to the East sky and first noticed a light which was moving from south to north.  It looked like a star but it was moving straight and then became very irraticate.  It then disappeared so I looked away and looked again to the East when I saw something very large moving very slowly.  It was totally black and was the shape of a triangle.It had three lights on each side at the wide side of the V.  It was a solid object and there was absolutely no noise at all.  It was going about five miles a hour and was only about thirty to forty feet high.  I tried getting an approximate height by comparing it to our house and the neighbours house.  It came right over our adjoining driveways.  I could see it was black because the street light and our light on the side of our house gave enough light just to reflect light off the UFO.  We have a park behind us but I was too afraid to go to our backyard to see where it went.  When my cab came I told him about it and we both looked for it but it was gone.  I would estimate it to be between 60 - 70  feet across and about 40 - 50 feet long.  I could have hit it with a rock - also the lights were not lit up but were sort of florescent.This was a truly amazing UFO and I am very glad that I can finally share it with other people that have had a similar experience.", "Triangle object, orange, blue and red lights, no sound, high speeds,close to ground.I was over at my friends house about to go night fishing. When we got to the lake we started to fish. After about 10 to 15 minutes, I started to get bored and so I went to the top of a hill to put away my gear. To the left of my eye, I saw an orange bright light circling a spotlight (the ones that shine up in the sky to attract people that goes back and forth). Whenever the object circled around the light at a slower speed it got brighter. Whenever The object circled at a faster speed it got darker. I told my friend to come up to the top of the hill with his sisters. He saw the object and said it is probably a helicopter or something like that. I asked him if he wanted to go to his house to go get his video camera just in case it was a U.F.O. Since his house was about a block away, we had to walk pretty fast in order to catch the object on tape. As we started to walk to my friends house we noticed it started to follow us at a high rate of speed because the object was about a mile away when it was circling the light. My friend, his sisters and I stopped dead in our tracks when we saw it had caught up with us. The object was hovering to the left of us about 300 feet above the ground about 500 feet away from us. Then the object turned toward us. It was a triangle shape with a orange light on the top corner, a blue light on the bottom left corner and a red light on the bottom right corner. Then the object slowly drifter toward us with no sound at all.

After about 45 minutes of watching airplanes and stars, it was a very clear night, we noticed a light in the sky above and to the south of a car that was at the other end of the parking area. It was very low in the horizon and apeared odd because it was yellowish in color and had no strobe lights. We watched it for about five minutes and it just remained motionless. I got out my video camera and tried to get it to focus on the object and it began registering. After a minute or two of trying to get it to focus the car at the other end of the parking lots lights came on and I video taped a very good point of view of what looked like and at what altitude it was. After about a minute the cars lights went off and the camera couldn&apos;t focus on the image so I walked down to the car. The gentelman that owned the car came walking down from the coastal wall and I asked him if he knew what that was thinking that perhaps they to where also star wathching. He did not know what it was and when I told him I had been watching it for over ten minutes he said that seemed very odd and began whathing the object with me. I once agin tried to get the object to focus in my video camera and succeeded in zooming to around 45x and taping the object for over five minutes. In this time it became very bright, changing colors from a yellowish white to red and shades of green and at one point seems to apear as two lights. It then faded so low that I could no longer tape it so I began looking for it. It now was blinking with small soft white and red lights and almost looked like an airplane. The gentelman that was watching it with me had gone to take pictures and came running back and asked if I noticed that it was now blinking and moving. He also said &quot; what a good way to desguise your self&quot;. the object then slowly moved towards the shore slowly and then stoped moving and blinking and got very ! bright a gain. I again tried to zoom in on it and got the camera to focus and then hit record. As I whatced it through my viewfinder I now saw two lights and it seemed to be moving away from me, south, now. I then noticed a third light and the object now took the shape of a triangle and seemed to be banking. It then faded out agin. I looked at it and it began blinking again and had changed it&apos;s direction and was now traveling north and slowly kept droping, like it was making a stair patern, untill it got so low you could no longer see it. I went back to my car and watched the tape. When I came to the point that I had recorded all three lights on the object something must have malfuntioned on my camera and nothing had recorded from that point. I was pretty bumend out because this was the best part of the video and as we sat wondering what went wrong the object appeard again in the same spot it origonally started at, altough it was now lower int the horizon. I began taping as it slowly moved away from us twoards the south and the ocean. I have video of it once again just hovering in the horizon. It got very dim and then slowly moved strait down twoards the horizon and disapeard. After about thirty seconds it lit up again, still on the horizon, and then began to rise. It once agin hoverd. Then a second and third object apeard. They all hoverd for a moment and twinkled brightly changing color from yellowish-white to red and then all slowly lowered down and disapeared when they hit the horizon again. After trying to get my camera to focus on the light show for a few minutes with little sucess other then a few frames that show the lights hovering in the horizon we decided to drive down the coast to see if we could get a better look. we traveled a couple miles down the coast and could no longer see the objects so we turned around and traveled back. We came to another parking area and pulled in and there was now one single light hovering in the same spot.

The couple was driving toward Cresecent City from Manteno, IL. They looked out the window in a northerly direction and reportedly observed a large, dark triangular-shaped object in the sky halfway up from the horizon. The object they described was estimated to be 100 feet in length and had three circles of whitish-orange light (one positioned at each corner of the triangle). As they observed the object, it slowly moved from the north to the southwest. It did not appear to change altitude during the sighting. While it was in the general vicinity, the radio in their vehicle had interference. The witnesses stated they observed the object for approximately 15 minutes and supposedly were able to videotape the object during this time. However, after repeated requests by the case investigator to view the tape, the witness has failed to produce it.

My house faces north across the bay in Bellingham proper. Because of the city light pollution only a few of the brightest stars were out by this time, and quite dim. That is why I saw the object at once, it came over the roof of a house low on the north horizen. It was an extremely bright point of light, yellowish white. As it approached it became brighter. I am not good with the luminosity scale but it was definitly twice as bright as any of the planets or Sirius, and moving across the horizen quite fast. I assumed it was a satallite, although I have never seen one moving so fast, and fenitely never seen one so bright. As the object passed my position and began to move south, I noticed the trailing edge seemed to tail out slightly. The color or appearance did not change--it looked like a very, very bright star, moving very quickly. As soon as it passed over head I ran inside to get my roomate to see what he thought. In the 10 seconds it took me to run inside and get back out with him it was far to the south, still moving quickly. To the south lie mountains, but our view was abscured by rooftops. Before it dissapeared over them the object faded from extremely bright to very dim, and then faded from view. Chris (roomate) said it must have been a satallite, but I am not so sure. It faded from view a fair ways above the horizen. When I noticed it, it was just barely above the horizen to the north across the bay, and was extremely bright. When we saw it fade from view it was not even close to the horizen to the south, of which I am sure; the rooftop of our house is far above it and we were standing out in the front lawn. Perhaps the twilight can explain that behavior. I only make the report because of the extreme brightness and speed, I do not think a satellite could reflect so much light.

As he was driving the boat I looked to the right side(heading south) I saw what looked like alot of birds. (White birds in the sky)  The longer I looked at the swarm of birds flying all over some distance away.  There were 2 white disc shaped white objects futher back from these birds.  They stayed in perfect distance side by side for the longest time and they seemed to be barely moving or at a fairly slow speed.  This Sunday was an exceptionally clear day and the sky was very blue with white clouds in the back ground.  The 2 things never drifted up or down just side by side.  What was so weird about these 2 objects was that as they approached this cloud, instead of going through the cloud they took a 45 degree turn, both side by side.  Then I saw one of the Unidentified things through the middle of the cloud for a second.(This would be the side of it.  It just stayed there for a second, then slowly went behind the cloud again.(Slow motion).  It came out of the other side of the cloud and once again they were side by side, in perfect order.  At one time I thought that they could be a set of planes flying perfectly together like the blue angels, because they flew close together, same height and same distance apart from each other and when they got near the cloud they both turned and I mean turned exactly to the right at such a sharp angle at the same time.  I  had to keep looking because I couldn&apos;t believe what I had just seen.  Even when I first saw these 2 white objects, their were alot of birds flying in front of them that I thought they were also birds. Then I noticed that the front of these things were really birds.  The birds started flying up and down, and you could see their wings go up and down, but the 2 behind the 15 or so birds never went up or down just straight towards this little cloud.(Or so the cloud looked to me from where I was at).  I kept trying to show my husband what I was seeing and he also saw these objects and the birds but he was driving the boat and since we were in the intracoastal canal he had to pay close attention to his driving.  I don&apos;t think he really knows what he or I saw except they were white and moving away from us.  After they came out the other side of the cloud they just continued going away from us until they were out of sight.  There was no sound and no smoke like jets or very fast planes would leave.  I did notice that when I saw them in the middle of the cloud, kind of peaking through the cloud, he seemed to have stopped for the moment.  I think all this took approximately 10 minutes or so and then they were gone. I remember seeing these 2 white disc like things so well, for I always wear polarized sunglasses when I go fishing or wade fishing and the sun was behind me, not to the right of me, and therefore was not in my eyes.  Who knows, but I do know that if I wasn&apos;t planes then what was it, too perfect flying order, just a little strange for me, especially the way they turned, the way they seemed to just stay in that spot for a little while, then just go one about there way.

A couple of minutes later, I noticed a bright, white light moving somewhat towards me from the NNW. I thought that it was strange to see the landing lights of an airplane near my house, as I am not in the flight path of the airport or the Air Force base. The object appeared to be flying at about 10,000 feet and moving at a medium speed.I watched the entire time as it passed just to the west of my home, flying in a SSE direction. The intensity of the light stayed perfectly consistent as it moved toward me then away from me. As it passed, I realized that if those were landing lights, then they would fade as the object passed me, but the light stayed just as intense, so therefore it could not be forward lights on a plane.So then I wondered if it possibly was a helicopter with a spot light, but why so high and there was no obvious beam pointing down, it was just a solid intense light. Then the light disappeared in mid air. At that point it was a few miles south of my home. Then I realized that there were no beacons whatsoever on this craft.I never heard any engine noise, and it was too dark to see if it had a shape. I just thought that it was odd that there were no beacons and how the light just disappeared in mid flight.This was unusual for an aircraft, even a military aircraft, NOT to run its beacons and to be equipped with a light so bright in all directions.((NUFORC Note:  ISS passed over Nebraska at 22:13 hrs. on this date.

My mother, my cousin and I were driving around just outside the city to view the stars.  It was a very clear night.  The object I saw was triangular in shape and left what seemed like a blue/gray smoke trail.  It was moving way to fast to be any kind of plane or jet.  It took only about 6 seconds to move completely across the whole skyk, but it was moving too slow to be a meteor.  It was surrounded by a bright yellow/orange haze.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was starring up at the sky looking at the stars when to my left a triangular shape appeared. I first thought it was a plane and then realized that I never seen a plane like that before. I was able to point out three corners of the craft which did indeed look like a triangle. The front had two green lights at two points and what looked like a red flame in between them. It was moving a bit slow for a few seconds and then picked up speed. We stood up and ran to the front of the house because the house next door was in the way of our view. When we made our way there it had disappeared. It wasn&apos;t a cloudy night so us not being able to see it anymore was a bit strange.((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain anonymous.

It happened again a third time, also a few seconds later.  I moved to the outside porch and watched intently in this area for another 10 minutes but saw nothing further.

He followed it south from the airport where police and other people had gathered. Photographs were taken by the reporter. It was observed from 745-9pm by several witnesses.At 8pm, I left my home to visit the store. In the west I observed a &quot;star&quot; 10x larger than a magnitude 1. I went home and didn&apos;t put too much attention as to what I saw. At 8:20, I arrived home to observe the full moon that had rose out of the west and now was quite high in the sky. In the lower left hand side near the ground, I saw abright flash of an elipitical object, one eighth the size of the full moon take off at a tremendus speed.

We popped in from Terrace just for a short visit, and when we were leaving, we pulled up at the view point by the fire hall. I said to the kids, I wanted a picture of them (Kitimat 1). I took the picture, but they were goofing off, so I said I wanted to take one more. I took it (Kitimat 2), and as soon as I took it, they ran off to play. I walked up to the red flower, and zoomed in a little to get a shot of the scenery (Kitimat 3). I snapped the picture, but did not notice anything unusual in the shot. When I downloaded the camera that night in Burns Lake, I saw the disk shaped object in the middle. The next day after looking closer I saw the second object to the left of it. And after allot of further review, you can see two other spots, but they are very faint. All these photo&apos;s are only about 20 to 30 seconds apart. The thing that amazes me is that nothing is there in the second photo, but there they are in the third. They had to have been travelling at a great speed to get there. I don&apos;t think I noticed anything in the camera because of the speed in which they are travelling. I phoned the Terrace airport the next day (Monday), and the only traffic they had around 2:00 pm was a Hawker (Lear Jet type), and a Dash Eight. Other that that a couple of small planes. No one had reported anything unusual as well. I did phone again on Thursday to see if anyone had reported anything, and still nothing.The photo&apos;s were taken with a pretty good camera (Olympus D-40), 4 mega pixel digital camera. But I have since found out that jpegs are not very good for blowing up images. The more you save an image, the more it gets distorted. I have had the photo&apos;s copyrighted, because originally I thought there maybe some equipment that would be able to blow it up better than I can. With my computer I can make out , what looks to be windows, and another some type of port on the lower left side. It is definitely disk shaped, but with all the light reflecting on it, it looks like a bunch of knuckles around it. I am sending you the copyrighted version, and I am also sending you the original version. I don&apos;t know how clear the original version will be for you, I know when I blow it up with a different program, it is more blurry than blowing it up with my camera software. The problem is I can&apos;t print the blown up image with my camera software, I have to open it in a different program that lets me print the blown up image, resulting in a more distorted view. I do have an email to Olympus, hoping they can help me. If this thing can be blown up with very good results, it will be the best picture caught on camera, because of al the detail the picture can offer. I have since seen allot of other photo&apos;s, and most of them look so plain (like putting two saucers together) they are just all metal, no details at all. The way the light hits it at the of the craft, you can tell the top half is curved up and the bottom half curves down, forming a saucer. the light reflecting on the craft shows allot of detail. I just have to have a clearer image.Anyways, it is just total fluke that I got this thing on camera. I think that these things are travelling so fast, nobody gets a chance to see these, unless they stop, or if it&apos;s at night (if they have lights).((NUFORC Note:  We have examined the photos sent by the witness.  They are high quality photos, but the image of an anomalous object appears to us to be ambiguous.  Our guess would be that the object is a large bird, possibly an eagle, flying away from the camera.  However, the photographer responds that in the original digital photo, it clearly is not a bird.

I still don&apos;t know why I suddenly had the urge to turn and take a picture due south as there wasn&apos;t anything there we could use in our work.  When the slide was processed and I looked at it through an eye loop, I saw the UFO just  above the horizon just right of center.  I have been a professional pilot for many years and knew it wasn&apos;t an airplane.  A close friend who sold million dollar photo and printing eguipment, sent the slide to Kodak labs--the ones that do work for the FBI to have it analyzed to see if it was an error on the film.Their report said it was something in the air flying at tremdous speed.  In the enlargement you can see by the light it was really moving.  My logs showed I was using 25 ASA film and shot the picture at F4 at 1000th of a second.

Being a long time pilot, I&apos;m always looking up to the sky.((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))Dear Mr. ((name deleted)), Thank you very much for the report, and for the photographs. It is very difficult to establish what the light is in the photo.  Given that it is not possible to know its distance from the camera, facts such as the object&apos;s size, velocity, etc., are all not able to be calculated, in my opinion.  I do not know how even Kodak would have been able to determine that the object was moving at a high velocity.Hence, given the information available to us from your report, the object remains just an unidentified light, to the best of my knowledge.Did you note the object at the time of your sighting, or see it later while examining your photos.  Also, was your camera on a tripod, at the time of the shot?Thanks, again, for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))Yes, it was on a tripod. When I took the picture I was unaware of the object.  Kodak measured the light trail and compared it with known flying ormoving objects.  This was not the regular Kodak lab that you have access to.I have in many years of flying all over the world seen many other flyingobjects and about 6 years ago I was driving into town and saw a bright redorb that I felt was over the area of my house.  At this time the cloud layer was about a thousand feet and decending as it ofthen does here in the valley. I was five miles away and having flown thosands of hours I&apos;m a pretty good judge of where things in the air are around here.  I called my wife and she went outside and saw it several hundred yards from our house over new construction on the I-5 freeway.  When I got home it was still hovering in place below the cloud layer.  About twenty people were outsidewatching it.  It was bright red, the light coming from within.  It did not pulse, just glowed.  I called the tower chief at the airport 2 miles away.  The cloud base was 300 feet.  As I pulled off the freeway going north at Market street it was directly ahead of me over the roadway.  When I got home it was directly east of my house. Allowing me to see it from three sides. It stayed there for another half an hour for a total time since I saw it of about 45 minutes.  It appeared to be about the size of a large auto.  It did not fly away, it just seemed to implode into itself. No noise. Just hovered there.  I have seen enough of them in my 56 years to not be bothered by them, I just assume they&apos;re here and have been here for thosands of years.  The first one I saw was about twenty miles south of here in 1956.  It flewover our farm at slow speed.  The newspaper said it was seen all over Oregon that night. ((NAME DELETED)).

These lights were in a line formation, with 2 closer on the left and the other 4 on the right staggered. I contacted other pilots on the UNICOM frquency, 122.80 MHZ, and it was confirmed.

I contacted the local air traffic controller to see if it could be confirmed on radar. They said yes, and that they did not know at first what it was either, but that it was now off the radar screen and they suspected it was military activity. Now, i am very aware that the area i am describing is known for military firings and that it is the likely answer, but what i do not understand is how these objects were able to hover. Because it was a near full moon, a harvest moon nonetheless, i could clearly tell that they were not boats, and they did not have aircraft lighting. Also, there were no boats in the area that they, if they were some kind of flare,could have been launched from.

We were in a Cessna 195 that has a the windshield extending over the back of the pilots head.  There was a flash that cast a white light like a electro welding flash.  The air was filled with airline pilots asking what had happened.  I was looking directly overhead at were the flash had occured.  I saw a pin point of light going into a cloud as if a flash point had occured and was pulled into the main body of the occurence.  It was like a pin sticking out of a hotdog.  The main body was at first white light that turned to green, to blue, to yellow, to orange, to red, to deep blood red and then to black.  The main body of the explosion roiled in such a manner to open and reveal the interior that was burning blood red.  It would close and open in a different place until it finally disapeared.  The end opposite the entry had a like needle of light which looked to me as the remainder of what was left of the object that had exploded had exited the main body.  This event was reported in the Tulsa World and Tribune.  The article stated that the flash had been observed in Dallas and Kanas City.  The event looked to be in outer space among the stars.  It seemed to me that this event was caused by some object that was filled with an explosive fuel that had ignited and blown the object up forming the lead in spike that expanded into a sausage shaped main body and then trailed the exit spike.  This happened in 1956 or 1957.  I have never reported this event and didn&apos;t interrupt the airline pilots chatter with the Tulsa tower.  I was new to flying and an airline pilot was not to be interrupted by a lowly private pilot.  This event should be checkable through the local papers or the tower records at the Tulsa Internationa Airport, if they keep records that long.

The result were not promising.  The event appears to have been no more than 10 to 20 miles above Tulsa.  This would put it well within the capabilities of the armed forces even at that time, 1956-7.  It was probably some military craft blowing up although it doesn&apos;t preclude something from further out.  ((name deleted))Dear Peter:  All I can remember is it was sometime in 56-7.  I&apos;ve lost my log books long ago and have a miserable time with dates.  The papers were full of the report and as I said, the tower at Tulsa International (it was Tulsa Municipal back then I believe)  I tried once some years ago to find it at the Tulsa Trib or World and was unsuccessful.  I wonder if the weather bureau would have something on such an event?  Or some astronomical group might have it.  That&apos;s about all I can come up with.  I&apos;ll try to find more if I can.  The event was way up there in the sky.  The height could be figured by running a line from the center of the earth to Dallas, one to Tulsa and one to KC, then extending the Tulsa radius into space and making a tangent on the Dallas and KC radii.  Where the two tangents intersected with the Tulsa radius would be the height of the event.

The weather changed today from unseasonably hot to cool, so as the front moved in and storm clouds appeared, it became windy.  I noticed a black, circular shape in the sky that remained stationary for 20 or more seconds, so it caught my eye.  My first impression was that the object might be a rather large balloon within a half mile of my position, but oddly it remained stationary in the wind.  I put my caller on hold and looked more closely.  After remaining stationary for about 30 seconds, it began to move slighly, in almost a fluttering way or jagged way, suddenly dipping to the left and downward, and changing shape from circular to more flat.  Then it went up again and a little to the right, again becoming more circular, but also changing shape so that it was periodically circular and then more ovoid.  It headed back to the left and would remain somewhat stationary and then dip further down.  At this point, as it got lower, I could see that there was a lighter colour on top, almost like the reflection of a dome (there was very little sunlight &quot;behind&quot; my position, peeking through stormy clouds).  With that extra shading, the object looked more saucer-shaped.  There is a shopping mall next to my office and as I watched the object, it dipped down until it disappeared just on the other side of the mall.

JULY 7th, Sunday afternoon approx. 2:00 pm esds time while working in my back yard, I heard a distant &quot;popping&quot; sound coming from over my head.  This caused me to look up.  At first I had a difficult time finding the source of the sound.  I looked ahead of the sound - as one does for a jet at altitude - the object was approx. 10 degrees ahead of the returned sound - using 180 degrees from horizon to horizon as the parameter.  The entire event lasted slightly less than 5 minutes.  The object&apos;s heading was WNW to ESE.  It also appeared to roll once - outside loop type - not barrel roll.  No vapor trail was present.  My guess at it&apos;s altitude was well over 30,000 feet AGL.  It was very large and moving at a constant rate.

We were running dogs all night and stopped at the end of a road in the woods about a 1/2 mile or so off the bee line express way. It was early morning around 1 am or so. We were sitting down smoking a cigarette when I looked up and ask my friend what that was in the sky. The stars were everywhere but one was quite bigger than the rest it was blue and had to be four times larger than any other star. I started flashing my maglight at it. For about 5 minutes. Then it just took off and went to the size of all the other stars in a matter of seconds with 4 or 5 littler red lights following it. It just stayed there after that. I told my friend that was really wild . We couldnt see the red ones after they took off but I could still see the same blueish star that was much closer just a few seconds ago. My friend was just blowing it off but I knew anything we had couldnt have moved like that. We sat there for about  fifteen to twenty minutes talking then my friend wanted to go home which was a bout a mile away. So we started walking back I heard a hovering sound I will never forget wasnt loud just different. I turned around and Saw a red shape above the tree tops at the end of the pasture It had a star like light below about 50 feet and it just stayed perfectly still. Then without a change in sound it just moved left then right. It was big It was cigar shaped the light below it moved like it was part the craft but you could tell it wasnt attached. We never heard it approach or seen anything around it just appeared out of no where. I wanted to walk to the tree line where it was but wouldnt go alone and my friend just wanted to get out of there. So we walked through the woods back to his place. When we got to his house we looked over in that direction and you could see a light a little smaller than a dime red in tint with a light just below it. It is very hard to put into words what we actually saw that night but believe me it wasnt right. It took me this long to w! rite abo ut it. but it was like it happened yesterday.

It flew straight north at a high rate of speed, probably 100-200 mph.  It was gone in approximately one minute.  It was probably 3 feet in diameter on the top and maybe 5 feet in diameter at the bottom, this could only be seen from the side, when it was directly south of us.  When it flew over it was circular from the bottom.  It had to fly right over the Wichita airport, because we live 4 miles directly north of the airport.  It was somewhere between 200 to 300 yards above the earths surface, and did not have any noise coming from it.  It wasn&apos;t a bird, balloon or plane.  I, have a science education, geology, and have worked for Boeing and Raytheon in the past (7 years total).  We, myself; and my girl friend whom works directly for another aviation company, have lived here for approximately 3 years and have seen many airplanes, and birds (the sedgwick county park is nearby and is full of ducks and geese which fly over our neighborhood daily).  Furthermore, I grew up on the farm, and have hunted and raised all kinds of birds, I&apos;, 41 years old.  What flew over tonight was definitely not a bird, or a plane or a balloon.  It was flying at a very high rate of speed, and was probably flying under radar, without sound.  I seen it first while I was laying in the pool looking at the beautiful cumulus cloud directly to the south.

It would be nice to talk to him as I was in Ashburton not many miles away and my girlfriend and I saw what I too would describe as a flying wing. It travelled at the same speed as a satelight i had just pointed out to my partner.  the UFO was as described illuminated on the edge with four large lights underneath. Bearing in mind a satelght travels at 18 thousand miles an hour I was amazed to find when the satelght came over again SO DID THE UFO. If it was at the same height then not only would it be travelling the same speed but would have been the size of a city! The second sighting which is more strange was about six months ago. Three of us witnessed what looked like an L shaped building about four storeys high and three times as long again iluminated on all edges flying slowly and about 100 feet up a witness who was underside described a triangle with three white lights and pipes joining the lights at the rear as it flew past.

The rain made it hard to sleep as we were in an old VW camper van and the rain was loud hitting the roof. I had opened a window earlier in the evening for air. At around 1am I woke up from an intense dream where I was in a hospital with bright lights all around. As I lay there trying to relax, I noted that the rain was subsiding, and that the sound of the rapids was being interrupted, as if it were being blocked off, at regular intervals. Then I heard a loud buzzing noise above the van. It came closer, and suddenly I was being absorbed, or I was absorbing, this noise. It was loud in my head, and I tried to plug my ears but my arms would not move. I felt like I was on a fast moving carnival ride, but I didn&apos;t go anywhere. It was pitch black out- no lights, nothing. This buzzing inside my body only lasted for about 5 seconds, then it was outside again. It moved away, and the river still had that odd pulsing sound. Then the buzzing returned, the same as before, starting outside the van, and then inside of me.And as before, it left again. The second time it left, I noticed the river sounds were normal again, and then the rain started pouring down, enough to wake-up my husband. He never heard a thing. The next morning, as we were getting ready to leave, we were approached by another camper (there had been only 3 couples in the campground. Early in the morning, I saw one of the couples leave), and I asked him if he heard any strange noises in the night. He said he slept soundly, but his wife complained of hearing things. When I told him what happened, he said it was similiar to what his wife told him happened to her. At that point, we left.One thing I noted: Before we went to bed, I left a couple of plastic cups on the table by our drinking water. In the night, it sounded like they were on the ground, being kicked or blown around. The next morning, they were exactly where I left them, with rainwater in them. Also, when we stopped for breakfast at a diner not far from the campground, we were told that there had been a lighting and thunder storm over the area the night before. We heard no thunder and saw no lighting, and we were only about 7 miles or so (about a 20 minute drive on curving roads)away.So, what happened to me???", "White spherical light moves in circular path, then irregular path, then turns itself off and on &amp; off like a lightbulb&amp; zips away!I was going to my parked car when I happened to look up and noticed a sphere of light moving above the clouds in what at first looked like a circular pattern. I was looking at the object at first trying to determine what it actually is. As I kept watching it, I was taken aback that I couldn&apos;t figure out what it was. At this point I glanced at the clock on my cell phone and it read 12:10 am. What struck me as irregular is that the object illuminated the clouds below it as you would expect a flood light to do. But, a floodlight does this from the ground up. This was occurring from above the clouds  down to the ground. As I followed the path of the moving object, I noticed that there was no floodlight from the ground up that could be illuminating the clouds in what at first was a circular motion. I watched the object move repeatedly in a circular pattern for about five minutes. I was mesmerized that this object was not a plane, nor a helicopter, nor a weather balloon, or any object that I&apos;ve ever seen in my experience. As I continued to look at this sphere move in a circular motion, it changed its path and now began to move in zigzag irregular path. I had to keep my eyes carefully on the object because it was moving in and out from the cloud cover about 10,000-15000 feet up in the air where one would expect to see a commercial airliner. It then proceeded in its irregular pattern for another 10 minutes. In this time frame, there was an opening where there was no cloud cover and the object would move into this area of the sky and then back into an area where there were clouds. You could see the object through the clouds as it illuminated the area around itself above and below the clouds.    The object then changed its flight speed and slowed down considerably and then would speed up or accelerate and again slow down. The entire time it was doing this, it appeared as a white sphere bigger than the moon illuminating the area around itself with a tremendous amount of white light.  It continued to move erratically in and out and now changing its altitude and appearing to move closer to the ground at about the height one sees an airliner on a flight path to land at an airport. It then stopped in the air for about thirty seconds, the sphere light went out(this in an open space with no clouds around it)and then the sphere lit up with pure bright white light like a flash bulb but the light stayed on for about 15 seconds. Just before it moved away at a fantastic acceleration, the bright light that illuminated the sphere goes out but I could still see the dark shape  of the outline of a sphere exactly in  the same place and standing still in the sky. After about 5 seconds, it zipped up and moved away in a southerly direction  at an acceleration that to me does not seem possible. It just took off and in a second, you could not see it any more. I glanced at my cell phone clock and it was 12:30 am.    I am trained in the sciences and in mathematics. What this object did when it left is something which you would see maybe in special effects in a  science fiction movie but not something that at this time our technology is capable of doing. I have never seen anything like this nor ever seen anything move like this. The entire time I was seeing this my mind was incredulous at what I could be seeing. I&apos;m still perplexed.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness and found him to be quite credible.

They continued to hover and then another sphere with the same dimensions and the same level of brightness as the other spheres emerged out of one of the original bright spheres. My friend had suggested that it was the apocalypse. Out of the first two original spheres came more spheres, again the same size and brightness. Then out of the clones came out another clone. This kept happening until there were about twelve spheres. The clones then started to form the original triangle pattern which the first three spheres were in. I know others also saw the incident because their were many cars all around that stoped to observe what was happening. The spheres were just as bright as they were before and then one of the spheres sort of flashed and disappeared. The rest of the spheres did the same and disappeared in an instant. We couldn&apos;t understand what it was , how they cloned each other and how they  disappeared in an instant. Note: we were observing this incident from a top a hill in manhattan. The incident was occuring close to us within clearly visible distance.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The total footage time is about 20 secs, but I shortened the film so it could be sent via e-mail.  The important parts are included, though.This object was spotted when I was filming dust particles near the sun from my third floor balcony - the sun light reflects off and amplifies flying particles in the atmosphere, when looked from a certain vantage point.  However, this object behaved unusual in the sense that it didn&rsquo;t follow the air currents. All particles in the air fly either in the same direction of the wind, or erratically when there are gusty winds.  This one seemed to have a mind of its own.The object was traveling northeast, then it stopped and came back again, disappearing overhead on top of the building.  It was difficult to determine its altitude, but I estimate it to have been at least 6000 feet.Short after I began filming, I used 20X zoom, which unfortunately made the footage very shaky.

I noticed he was looking up.  As I looked up he said, &quot;Do you see that light, or am I not seeing right?&quot; I looked in the direction he was peering and noticed a star-like light in the sky.  It had the luminosity of Mercury or Mars (certainly not as bright as Venus or Jupiter).  If it had been still it could have easily been mistaken for a star.  However, it was its type of motion that distinguished it from a star, a terrestrial aerial vehicle or a satellite.  It was heading from north to south and traveling quite erratically.  It wobbled on an irregular basis from left to right, sometimes speeding up and sometimes slowing down.  Sometimes the wobble was a long slow move to the right; sometimes it was a quick, short burst.  Sometimes it went a short distance backwards, but mostly it moved forward.  If it had been someone driving a car I would have said they were drunk as a skunk, weaving all over the road.  It did not move in a straight line with a consistent speed as a satellite; we heard no sound and there were no other lights (i.e. wing or landing lights) as an airplane.  Its average rate of speed, although erratic, was generally consistent and not very fast.  It traversed 40% of the sky in 3 minutes, and if one held his or her fist out at arm&apos;s length, it would have traversed the width of the fist in 10-12 seconds.

It was really weird.", "Watched light move over woods for several nights, encountered two small glowing figures, experienced time displacement.Subject: Web report from 10/01/1961 After reading the report about the Toledo sighting, I felt compelled to send this information about an experience I had as a child while living in Toledo, Ohio. Although I did not see the sphere as described in the report, I did have a communication encounter similar to the person in the report.Reading the report brought tears to my eyes and a chill up my spine.Born in May of 1954  (was age 7 as person in Toledo sphere sighting ). As a child time of day and days of a year were not so important as a reference while growing up. Things like school year, summer vacation, birthday, Christmas were more of a reference point for time. I did not keep a diary or journal but one experience around about the summer of 1961 seems to stand out. It seemed to last over a period of several days or even a week or more. The reason it&apos;s not clear is because I believed that my experience was just a childhood dream. It was not until decades later that I suspected my experience was not a dream and that someone or something had given me that impression to remember the experience as a dream.I lived with my mother and father in a ranch style house next to a large wooded area with a small pond and beyond the woods was a large field with a larger pond. My summer evenings were spent sitting in a lawn chair and watching the stars until my parents would make me go to bed. One night as I watched the sky, our dog (who lived outdoors year round ) began barking and tugged on his doghouse chain toward the woods. It was then that I noticed a glowing light (white glow not much different from that of a distant plane) that seemed to be moving over the woods at a slow speed. Soon the light was no longer in sight because of the tall trees. Our dog stopped barking. It was not unusual for the dog to bark at wildlife in the woods at night so nothing seemed to be out of the norm. My father came to the back door to let me know that it was time for bed and I went inside. Thinking about the light, it came to me that there was something odd after all, it made no sound, only a white glow, and no blinking lights like a plane would have.The next morning I went to the woods and walked along the worn path that led to the small pond.It was the same path I had walked and played along with other area children since my parents had moved  here in 1959.As I walked along on that sunny morning, a refection of something in the weeds just a few feet off the main path caught my eye.  I found a rectangular metallic object about 10&quot;x 4&quot;x 6&quot;, it had only a kind of dial with some lines on it, no printed words or letters, no screws. I looked for some way to open it but found none. At this point I carried the lightweight object home and put it on a living room table.Later that day when my mother came home from work and noticed the object she asked, &quot;where did you get the new radio from?&quot; At this point I realized the shape of the object did some what resemble a radio and I replied &quot; found it in the woods this morning&quot; but I don&apos;t think she really believed me and she made a point of telling my father when he came into the room.That evening while watching stars in the sky, I became thirsty and went into the house for a drink. It was then that I heard a strange sound coming from the object on the table and I began to walk toward it when our dog began barking. Turning I went to the back door and stepped out on to the porch. There was the white light moving over the woods just like the night before only this time a feeling came over me that the white glow knew I was watching it. I could still hear the strange sound coming from the metallic box. I watched the white light move over the woods for several minutes until it was out of sight. Once out of sight the sound from the box and the barking of our dog both stopped.The next day would be a changing point in my routine, the last day of summer vacation. A new school year would mean early to bed,  homework and little time for stargazing.  That night sometime before 21:00 (bedtime school nights) while getting ready for bed, the strange sound from the metallic box in the living room was heard again. Within a short period of time, I could hear our dog barking.  I went to the back door and out onto the porch.  There was the white light again moving over the woods as before. The feeling that it knew I was watching came over me again and soon it was gone. Like before the metallic box sound stopped about the same time as the barking of our dog.While getting into bed, I thought that the box found in the woods had some kind of relationship to the white light moving over the woods. Maybe the light was looking for the metallic box.The same situation happened for the next night or two and I got used to the strange sound from the box.It became sort of an early warning system that the white light was near. What happened next is still hard for me to understand. While working on my homework, our dog began barking and barking.He barked for a long time but I did not pay much attention to him because there was no sound from the metallic box. Finally I decided to investigate what was troubling the dog.  I stood looking over at the metallic box and noticed the dial setting had been changed. I went to the box and turned the dial to it&apos;s marked setting. Instantly the strange sound was heard and I asked my parents &quot;how did this dial get moved?&quot; and my mother looked up from her newspaper and said &quot; I must have moved it when dusting&quot;.I ran to the door and out onto the back porch where I was frozen with the sight of two small figures at the rear corner of our yard next to the utility pole. They seem to glow with a dim self-illuminating light and to be just as surprised to see me as I was to see them. I could also see our dog that was no longer barking but hiding in his doghouse. I could not move, speak, yell, or scream (I tried but was unable to do anything but watch). The small figure on the right seem to take a step and in a way floated up the utility pole and landed on the telephone wires near where they attach to the pole. What happens next is even more unbelievable.The next thing I recall is standing in the hallway of our house. I am completely paralyzed but can see my parents on the living room couch reading the newspaper. They are unaware of my presence as I try to call out to them with no avail.  At that point I hear the sound of my father&apos;s table saw in the basement turn on, saw a piece of wood and then turn off. The front door opens and my mother walks in and takes off her wet shoes just as she always has done after moving the front lawn sprinkler. I hear footsteps of someone coming up the basement steps, the basement door opens and my father walks into the room. From my point of view I now can see two of my mother and two of my father but it is apparent they cannot see each other.  It&apos;s at this point where my mind is franticly trying to understand what is happening here.This is when I realize someone or something that I can not see or hear is communicating with me.The most unusual, controlling and overpowering feeling I have ever experienced in my lifetime.The communication went like this: YOUR PARENTS ARE BEING REPLACED, replaced with what? ( I thought), NOT REPLACED WITH WHAT, REPLACED IN TIME, you can&apos;t do this I will tell, I will tell ( I thought), WHO WILL YOU TELL?,  I will tell everyone ( I thought),  YOU WILL NOT TELL ANYONE, THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE YOU, THEY WILL THINK YOU ARE INSANE.The most helpless and hopeless feeling came over me.I woke the next morning in my bed. The metallic box object was gone.I never discussed this with anyone for many years and believed in my mind that it was only a dream.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There were probably 40 or 50 &quot;stars&quot; moving slowly toward the east - they were forming different patterns as they moved (circles, chevrons, orion). At one point a plane flew across the sky below them so they were pretty high.  The movement of these objects was sideways and backwards and circular and they formed patterns.

I was looking at the spot where the suns corona was flaring out from behind the beam and saw a white spot fly at a very rapid speed from south to north in a straight line it appeared to be at a higher elevation than all the jetliners in view and moved many times faster in apparent speed.

At a few minutes after 9:00pm I was approximately 4 miles west of Kewanee on a section of Route 81 running north (near the intersection of Tower Road). On the right (east) are hills and broken timbers amongst pastures and on the left (west) are flat open tilled farm fields. I would have been traveling north. I suddenly noticed a reddish-orange flashing light. At the time, I thought an emergency vehicle or deputy sheriff had suddenly come up behind me. This happened without warning and I thought a vehicle had approached me without any headlights. I had not been drinking or using any drugs. I do recall being somewhat fatigued after a long and busy day. I slowed down and moved the vehicle over to the shoulder of the road. As I came to a stop on the shoulder of the road, I was still thinking I was being pulled over for some reason. I stepped out of the open driver&rsquo;s side door and realized that a large glowing sphere was positioned almost directly overhead. I estimated the object to be approx 50-70ft above the ground and approximately 20-25ft in diameter. It was smooth and glassy appearing on its surface, which was most noticeable between the brighter intensity pulses. I want to emphasize that these &quot;pulses&quot; were not flashes as in on-off but were pulsations of brighter-dimmer, never shutting off completely. I also noticed a strong definite static field that increased in unison with the pulses of brighter light. I could not visualize the surface of the object when the light pulses were at peak intensity. During the less intense/dim phase of the light pulses the surface was clearly visible and totally featureless from my point of view. The surface was very smooth and glass-like transparent and within appeared a swirling, smoky, or viscous liquid type substance against the inner surface. From what was visible to me, I would insist this object was a perfect globe or sphe! re and e mitted light from its entire outside surface. Over the next 1-2 minutes the quality and duration of the bright/dim light cycle changed to a longer bright and shorter dim but the frequency of the light cycle seemed constant. It did not pulse faster, just longer and brighter pulses with shorter dim intervals until it became a constant steady light. I hope I can make this clearly understood. I could feel the intensity of the static field intensify also. I did not move from my position next to the truck between the open door and cab. I had the feeling that something was going to happen with the changes in the light emissions and static field but did not know what to expect. When the light pulses became a steady light, the object very suddenly shot west with a departure so rapid that there was a loud &ldquo;pop.&rdquo; I can only describe it as being like a huge cork violently pulled from a bottle. I was aware of no noise prior to this moment. The object stopped very suddenly in the western sky for a few seconds (3-5 miles away?) then seemed to change direction approximately 90 degrees to due north a couple miles, stopping suddenly again for only a moment then disappearing to the western horizon. My next recollection was the realization that I was sitting in my parked truck in my backyard (approximately 2 miles north of the site described) with the truck pointing west and watching the western sky where the object disappeared. This was not an area where I would typically park. I walked into the house a few minutes before 11:00pm. Evidently, I was in the truck for some time. It was a very pleasant evening and I recall an overall feeling of &quot;stunned amazement&quot;. I do not recall ever feeling fear or apprehension. I realize that some time is unaccounted for.  I have attributed that to some kind of emotional shock. I have remained in excellent health.", "Four balls of light travelling at high rate of speed are chased by 7 high altitude jets.The first two objects (round and blue in color)were detected high in a cloudless sky.  At first sight I thought they were stars, but because it was 4:30 in the afternoon and they were moving across the sky, they couldn&apos;t be stars.  As I informed the other witness to come look at what I was seeing and pointing out the one object that remained in view, (I lost the other behind trees) a third object, much lower came streaking by. This was a blue ball of light with a halo around it and didn&apos;t make any sound. The objects didn&apos;t waiver, they just traveled straight, heading east, out to sea.  A couple of minutes later, a fourth object flew by, this one was the same as the third, but it was a yellow color with a halo and traveled the same low path as the third object.  The most important part of the whole experience is that for the next 45 minutes, I counted 7 high altitude jets (possibly military aircraft) travelling in the same direction as the 4 objects.", "A formation of three black winged objects very high up was sighted on a clear morning.I heard a sound of jet like engines or rushing air briefly from overhead. I looked up with prescription sunglasses into the morning sky.I saw two black winged objects high up, soaring but with no wing flapping at all.  They were flying to the South West.  The interior side of the wings were curved inward.  I then saw a third object move closer in to join the other two just as one made a turn toward the South.They seemed too large for birds.  They slightly resembled the U-2 planes or maybe the B-2 Spirit bomber.  The wings were scalloped on the trailing edge and this was apparent even at the great distance.   I watched them for about a minute until they faded from view due to the high altitude.  The formation flight of the three widely seperated makes this remarkable.  The date is approximate within a few days.  I have watche high altitude birds fly such as Eagles and Condors and Buzzards but these were larger with more streamlined features.", "then it gathered into one light. And then it suddenly disappearedit was about 3am. Me and my friends came outside of the house. I looked up the sky and i saw a very bright flashes making a circle.

I pulled over to the side of the road(now facing east on Beardshill Rd.)to see what was going on if possible.My son and I were watching(facing west)the helicopter.To the north you could see a light airplane practicing flight maneouvers at the Harford Co.Airpark when I happened to look to the northeast and was startled to see a low flying vehicle(disk or saucer shaped)passing over head.I asked my son to look.He acknowledged by saying &quot;What is that?&quot; I replied,&quot;It looks like a flying saucer!&quot; The vehicle was approx. 500 to 750 ft. above us. As it passed overhead it made no noise whatsoever.It was just floating from N.E. to S.W.,following I-95 toward Baltimore. I would say the vehicle was approx.50 to 100 ft.in diameter,domed at the top and bottom with a dark ring around outside diameter.I saw no windows,engines,or wings.The color scheme was that of the space shuttle. The vehicle colors were bone white(top&amp;bottom)and a visibly black tiled ring around the outer edge.You could see the top of the vehicle because as it moved away from us following I-95,it became level with our eyesight.We were standing at one of the highest elevations in Aberdeen.As this vehicle moved away getting smaller,I turned and looked to see another identical vehicle floating overhead. I told my son to look.&quot;WOW!&quot;,he said. We saw six of these vehicles that day. As one vehicle moved out of our sight to the S.W., one would appear from the N.E..They were following each other in an inline group.I would say they were traveling at approx.75 to 100 mph. The next day at work I talked about what I saw but nobody I talked to saw what I did.The Md.State helicopte! r pilot&amp; copilot had to see these vehicles,as the helicopter was facing to the S.E.,and these vehicles would have crossed their &quot;path&quot;.I can say that I do not think that these vehicles were extraterrestrial,but manmade in nature.Unless we truly do have alien technology! They were so close to us overhead that they resembled the same texture of material and color scheme that the space shuttle is made out of.I have stood next to the shuttle at Kennedy Space Center.Except for their shape,they do resemble each other.It was really uncanny.My son dosen&apos;t remember much about what he saw that day except that they were saucer shaped, but I am sure that some others in Aberdeen had to see these vehicles especially those helicopter pilots from the state police.I found out later they were searching for two robbery suspects at that building.Also I must note that I saw these same vehicles on the T.V. show &quot;Sightings&quot; twice. Someone had videotaped these vehicles in 1997 and turned the videotape over to the show.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was in the U.S. Air Force, stationed at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.  I was living off base inside a housing compound, outside the local town called Silvertown.  There was no light in the one roomed apartment, yet when I looked, I could see clearly.  I remember waking up on the floor.  My wife was on the bed to my left and slightly behind me.  My attention was drawn to the direction of the doorway.  I saw a large dark figure standing in the door.  The figure seemed to be wearing a hooded cloak or cape.  I think it was dark grey or black  in color.I sat there just staring at it when it seemed to start approaching me.  It didn&apos;t appear to be walking.  It seemed to glide across the floor.  I tried to back away from it but couldn&apos;t move.  I tried to call for my wife but couldn&apos;t make any sound.Although my body refused to respond to my efforts to move, I can remember thinking that if I could make a sound, the fear, and the figure, would go away.  While I can remember it moving toward me, I don&apos;t remember it traveling the distance of the room to where I was laying.  That is to say, I only remember it moving a distance of about 3 or 4 feet. I can&apos;t recall it ever actually reaching me.  My struggle to move or make some kind of sound seemed to go on for several minutes.  My heart was pounding in my chest and I was desperately trying to call for my wife.Suddenly, I managed to make a whisper/squeak of a noise.  I tried again and the noise came easier this time. Finally, I was calling my wife&apos;s name.  I could move as well, although it was extremely difficult.  I dragged myself to our bed.  I reached up and as I was about to touch my wife, everything was back to normal, if you can call it that.  The stranger was gone. So was the loss of my voice and my inability to move.  However, the room was darker and it was harder to see.  I was still on the floor and my wife was sleeping soundly on the bed.  My heart began to slow down and the pounding reduced itself to a normal beating.I just sat there. To this day, I call still recall parts of this incident with great clarity.  But I&apos;m not sure if it was a dream.  I don&apos;t recall if I had been drinking alcohol that night but it is a very real possibility.  Nor do I understand why I was on the floor instead of the bed with my wife.I don&apos;t know if my wife recalls any of this. I don&apos;t even remember if I ever talked to my wife about this, but through the years, I&apos;ve told this story to others when the topic of strange things comes up.At the risk of coming off as a nut case, other strange things have happened to me as well and are as clear or vivid but may mean nothing.While stationed at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom between 1982-83, I recalled leaving the shop one night to go across the street to another building.  As I left the shop, I was in a direct line of sight to the door that I was heading for.  Suddenly, I ran into a heating fuel containment wall some 8 to 10 feet off the original path I was on.  I don&apos;t know how I got my original course but it did leave scratches on my shins.Another incident at the same base and time frame occurred when I left the shop to catch the bus home.  I left the shop at 10 minutes till 1 AM for what should have been a one minute walk to the bus stop.  However, after I arrived at the stop, I checked my watch and it said the time was 20 minutes after 1AM.  In these two incidents, no alcohol was involved due to the fact that I was just coming off duty.And one morning while in England during the 82-83 time frame, I awoke to find myself inside my wardrode (closet).  However, this one could have been due to drinking, but I thought I&apos;d mention it.While station at Hurlburt Field, Florida between 1991-92, I used to drive a stretch of road every night that was not well traveled or lit at that time of night.  On numerous occasions while driving, I expected to hear a loud popping noise come from the dash of my car.  The expectation was so strong that my eyes where prepared to close the way they do when someone is hammering on something over and over and then they suddenly stop, but your eyes still twitch in anticipation of the next blow.One night late 1996 or early 97, while at work with the Gate Rubber Co in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, I experienced what you would call lost time.  I worked with six presses that cure belts for the company.  On this night, I was waiting for press number 4 to open.  I decided to go check something on press number 1 about 15-20 feet away.  I looked at the timer on press 4 and saw that I had 1 minute and 45 seconds before the press was ready to open, so I turned around to go to press 1.  As soon as I turned around and started to take a step, press number 4 opened up.  I stopped and turned back around.  I wondered if maybe I had looked at the wrong timer, but none of the other timers on the unit were set anywhere near a minute and 45.  It was only a minute and 45 seconds and I didn&apos;t feel anything else was out of order, but I still recall it with great clarity.One day after I had begun working for the University of Arkansas, I experience an incident where I seemed to gain time.  I checked the time that I entered Hwy 412 at the intersection of hwy 530 (old Hwy 71). And began the 20 minute drive to Siloam.  As I entered the City limits, I checked the time again and found that I had made the trip in 10 minutes.  I verified the operation of my watch and the Curise Control that I always used and found them to be in good working order.  I&amp;#8217;ve never heard of anyone gaining time, although I have experienced times that I felt time had past quicker than I thought it should have.I have the standard &quot;Scoop&quot; mark on my left leg that I&amp;#8217;ve heard and read about.  It&apos;s been there as long as I can remember. And in 1999, I noticed that there was a scoop mark on the top of my left hand.  I don&amp;#8217;t recall anything out of the ordinary having happened at the time.*********** Additional back ground information.While I was in the sixth grade, I experienced several incident where there were large scabs in my nostrials.  I remember that my grandmother used to have to use large hair pins to remove them.  This lasted several weeks.Around 1976/77 while stationed at Beale AFB in California and living in the barracks, I got up one night to go to the bathroom.  As I walked past my papasan chair, I saw someone sitting there and stepped around them to go into the hall.  I closed the door behind me.  When I went back to my room, I had locked myself out. I knocked on the door, but no one answered.  I finally had to go outside and break into the room.  No one was there and the next day, when I asked my friends if any of them had been in the room, they all said no.After reading all this, I wouldn&apos;t blame anyone for thinking that I was a nutcase looking for attention.  But I swear that it&amp;#8217;s all true to the best of my knowledge.  It&amp;#8217;s also convinced me that I need to keep a document of dates, times, and conditions, should anything else occur.

I then observed that each of the objects were circling each other. After standing around for about 2 minutes both objects took a complete 90 degree turn and were bombing toward each other at very high speeds. at the moment they were closest to each other, one of the objects blew up into a huge fireball and and kept on going. That object then turned around and started the same routine with circling the other object. Like the first time, they bombed toward each other and at the closest point, one of the objects blew up into a fireball but this time emitting two(2) smaller aircrafts much smaller than that of the other ones. The object that emitted the two smaller aircrafts suddenly dissapeared. At this point, i knew this was unusual activity and that this was no military practice. It looked as if there was a war going on between the aircrafts. These aircrafts were noticeable as they contained constant flashing white lights. After seeing this activity, i quickly sped off  toward home. before i got to where i live i saw 2 other cars stopped on the other side of the road watching and pointing at the weird activity in the sky. ! i stoppe d breifly and was glad to see that the other people in the cars were seeing what i was seeing. I got home and called the Moultonborough Police Department and was informed that hundreds of other people called in to report that they too had also witnessed the strage activity in the sky. I was also informed that there was no military activity in the area and that 2 police aircraft were sent out to investigate but they were too late as the objects quickly disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  A description of this event can be found on the NUFORC homepage.

I saw it through an open window (not through the glass).  It came in from the south at 35 degrees from the horizontal.  It traveled down in a straight line.  It disappeared behind the ridge west of town.  It was a glowing yellow in color.  It was roughly ovoid in shape.  It was the size of my little finger nail held at arms length.  I got the impression (which might not be correct) that it was a large object quite a distance away (maybe 5 miles or so).  It traversed roughly 10 degres of the sky before disappearing behind the ridge.  After getting over my initial surprise, I jumped up and went to the window and observed the sky for another half minute, but saw no further activity.

My first thought is that it was a sattelite until it began to slow down until it eventually came to a stop. Seconds there after, another circular white light, much brighter, started to move towards the first light that had stopped. The first white light then began to move away from the second white light as if it were being chased when suddenly it shot off in a 90 degree angle, unlike any manuver that an aircraft could make. The second white light then stopped again, and began to glow brighter, and then just dissappeared. The event of the two lights took place directly above us around the constellation of the big dipper. Excited and amazed as to what my girlfriend and I witnessed, we decided to stay longer and look for more unusual activity. Approximately 3 minutes after witnessing the first event, I happed to notice another white light, much brighter than the first two on the horizion above hill tops, behind thunder clouds begin to move eastward. It illuminated the clouds it was behind. It to came to a stop behind the clouds, when sunddenly seconds after it stopped, shot out of the clouds vertically towards the direction of the other two lights and dissappeared into the night sky and stars.

We were in the New River / Courentyne River area across from Suriname. At dawn we were awake by the noise of all sorts of animals causing a commotion by the river. we rushed from the bushes to the river and saw a large silver saucer hoovering over the middle of the river. It appeared to be drawing up water in a upside down funnel shape into a iris-shaped opening in the underside. We watched it for about 10 min. then suddenly the water spout fell back down and the craft shot straight up until it disappeared. The others with me were my late father, ((name deleted)) - a surveyor, ((name deleted)), my uncle - a guide in the interior and a Amerindian local guide named ((deleted)). A few weeks later in the same general area, we chased a loud sound overhead in thick forest and managed to get glimpses through the thick vegetation of a shiny object that suddenly disapeared. Our Indian tracker couldn&apos;t identify footprints we saw on a sandy beach we came upon that had a fire burning on the sand. It was just flames in a ball that had no obvious souce of fuel. We threw water on the fire but it did not go out. Eventually, we looked around and left. Things we observed at the &quot;campsite&quot; were that something with three legs was over the ball of fire. There were some fruits on the beach with bite marks in them. Our Amerindian guide could not identify the friut as from around the area. We saw the bite marks as small with round teeth marks. Some of the foot prints appeared to been shoed and others, smaller child sized were barefooted. Nothing was unusual about the footprints, they seemed human but were spaced close as if the person had short legs for the size of foot. Other claw shaped footprints seemed to have been frolicking with the small prints at the waters edge. ((The guide)), an expert in forest wildlife could not identify the claw marks. None entered the water and there were no prints coming to or fr! om the s andy beach. It was as if they just dropped down on the sandy beach or jumped off something in the water. The area seems devoid of wildlife, most unusual, not even insects were around the beach. This existed for about 20 feet in a circle around the beach camp area. Then at the perimeter of the circle life teemed as usual. On our way back a few weeks later, we visited the area again and saw signs that there were fresh footprints, the fruits did not show signs of decay and the area was still devoid of life. At the edge of the perimeter area, we found the carcass of a jaguar. The back legs were outside the area and was decomposing and the rest of the carcass that laid inside the area was still fresh and even the blood from it&apos;s mouth was still liquid. Animal tracks in the sand of the beach area stooped abruptly at the perimeter of a circle that was about 20&apos; round.", "Object tailing military jetPonca City, OK This account is going to be a bit vague because this event occurred sometime back ...In March of 2002, I think, I was cleaning our front yard.  I happened to look up upon hearing the sound of a jet.  The sky was partly cloudy but very clear.  The jet was a fighter with an over all triangular shape but definitely man made like the ones that patrolled New York after 911.  It was a rare site but not so unusual that I was anything more than fascinated.It moved due west and just before going out of site veered slightly north.  The aircraft was perhaps 3000 to 4000 feet up just below most of the clouds.   I watched it until it disappeared behind a cloud somewhat west of straight overhead.  I continued watching hoping to catch another glimce.  I could hear the aircraft with the appropriate delay the whole time.While still looking I noticed another craft of a very different shape apparently following the jet.  Its relationship to the jet was such that it could very easily have been in the jet&apos;s blind spot. It seemed to be lower in the sky and traveling as if to remain in the jet&apos;s blind spot as the jet turned north.It was silent.  I remember listening carefully for the delayed sound.  It was roughly oblong and changed shape to nearly circular and back to oblong.  I presumed this was due to a changing attitude from my point of view.  It had the same dark metallic coloring of the jet. It&apos;s movements were more exaggerated as if cutting a wider arc to maintain in the same relative position to the jet. It also disappeared in the clouds but below the cloud the jet disappeared behind.I wish I had had the presents of mind to record the time and date and any other details noticed at the time.

She at first thought it was an aircraft that was making an emergency landing but then it came to a complete stop and hovered near the Amish house, approx. 100 feet in the air. She watched it for several minutes in disbelief.  Then she started driving toward my brother&apos;s house, a couple hundred yards, keeping an eye on the object.  When she pulled into the driveway she turned around to look at the object and said there were what appearded to be two engines but there was no noise or lights.  It was a charcoal colored craft.

I was on the top bunk in my bedroom when I was awakened out of deep sleep. I then opened the curtain and looked out the bedroom window and saw what appeared to be a white/silver cylinder object hovering in the air. I was scared and facinated at the same time. I had always (and still have) a wild imagination, so I just lay in my bed and watched until it disappeared. I hopped out of bed right after the event ended and got a glass of water to make sure I was really awake. It happened when I was 8 years old (30 years ago) and this is the first time I ever said anything about it. What was odd to me was I expected to hear a news report or hear others discussing it. But that never happened. It was, and is, as if nothing occurred. I am a very logical thinker and not some nutcase.

They looked exactly like a constellation of stars but were moving through the sky, comparable in size to the Big Dipper, and could not be detected with the naked eye.  During the first few seconds of my observation, another white light passed just behind the formation&apos;s path moving northwest to southeast.  This single light moved faster than the triangle formation and continued passed it at a steady speed and direction. My first impression was that the single light was a satelite.

After showering and eating a bite he decided to go out on the back deck of his house and watch the stars.He writes...&quot;I was watching for falling stars when I noticed a star that was fluctuating in brightness. All of a sudden I saw the star move slightly. That really got my attention. I kept watching and the star move, side to side and then up. I got my binoculars out to get a better look and when I found the star, I noticed a hazy object above the star that had a blinking red light above it (it was 12:15 a.m. by this time). These two objects moved together with the lower object seeming to sway almost like they were connected, but they were clearly separate. I then called the police to see if anyone else had seen this and they said there were no reports. I then woke up my son and made him look since I was having a hard time believing what I was seeing. I watched these objects move around for a while (it&apos;s now 12:45 a.m.) parallel to the first star I saw. It was moving at the same time and in the same direction that the other two objects were moving. About a half hour later they appeared to get closer. I could make out the shape of the object that had a red light on it. It was a triangle shape. And the movements of these objects were getting more erratic and moving further distances from side to side, then up, then down, etc. About 1:30 a.m. I thought it was time to get to bed. On my way through the house I decided to step out front to see if it was still there. The objects were still there and after watching for about 10 minutes the objects descended rapidly... So fast that I was alarmed and ran for the door to the house. The two lower lights that were some distance from the triangle disappeared first behind the tree. Then the triangle continued down and I could see it was black. The red light on it wasn&apos;t lit. Then it disappeared and I was waiting to hear a crash but it never happened. They had to have either landed or crashed. When the black triangle went down it looked to be about a mile or two away. At this point I was in a state of shock and sat in my front room for about 10 minutes and went to bed.&quot; OUFOR contacted the Bend police department and confirmed that this witness had called.

It&apos;s shape, as near as I can explain it, was a three dimensional horizontal triangular shape which ended in vertical cylinders in a wide U shape.  The entire object glowed a dull greenish/yellow with no flashing lights, and moved rather slowly.  I didn&apos;t see any &quot;exhaust trail&quot; or anything indicating an engine exhaust at all.

This 3rd object was straight across from the bright white light below the triangle object and a great distance from them. This is when I realized this was an unexplainable object. As a little time went on they were getting closer. And then all of the sudden it descended at a rapid pace.

About 8:46 am I noticed a pure black object in the sky 10 kilometres away to the west hovering about 300 feet above the ground.  I pointed it out to my father and he confirmed visuals.  However, because we were in the north-western end of the city he believed it was a helicopter from Pearson International Airport and dismissed the issue, returning to his newspaper.  As we were traveling at freeway speed, we got closer and I could see some detail that made me think otherwise.The object&apos;s shape reminded me of the torso of the constellation Orion with a narrow bottom, wide middle and narrow top.  It was not curved and the shape was not symetrical.  There were no extensions of wings or rotors and there was no smoke, exhaust, or flame coming from any side of it.  As well, there was no &quot;basket&quot; attachment like a balloon.I kept my eye on the object and it continued to hover as we got closer.  I alerted my father and he took a better look.  He said it reminded him of a large garbage bag with no reflective surface, though- and he agreed it was not a helicopter.I returned my concentration to my driving as there were many other cars on the road and stopped watching the object.  This is when my father discovered the second object, two white discs attached to each other side-to-side.  It was much smaller and stayed about 40 feet away from the black object, higher up and to the north. The 2 seperate objects stayed close together and continued to hover.They made no movement, did not drift, and we saw no wires attaching them to the ground.At 8:51 am, 5 minutes into the sighting, the objects vanished.  We exited the expressway at Pine Valley Drive and headed south on this local road.  This put me on the east side of the car and my father&apos;s window facing the objects.  The objects  were now about 3 kilometres away and we could see them very clearly.Moments after we made that exit the objects vanished, which alarmed by father and he looked franitcally across the sky for signs of them.  I slowed the car to about 30 km/h and looked directly out his window in the direction we saw them last.I re-aquired visual contact about 10 seconds after they vanished and saw only the black object, now 15-20 kilometres away, hovering again.  There was no way it could have traveled that distance and slowed to a hover again.  My father got one last look at the object to confirm the new distance and then the city landscape and buildings prevented our vision.Additonal facts: -Visibility that morning was perfect and the sun was shining -No sound determination because car windows were closed -A 767 was traveling west towards Pearson Airport, about 15 kilometres to the south -The carft were intially hovering near a massive North-South powerline grid before they moved -Other cars did not take notice of the object -the event lasted 5.5 minutes.-Both objects were dull in colour and did not shine light (non-metallic) -They would definitely be on Airport radar at their location (even tower visibility) What intrigued me about this sighting is the lack of wings or rotors on the object, the ability to hover without ANY movement, and the speed at which the object moved from 3 to at about 15 kilometres away to another hover.", "traveling at fast speeds as high as the stars on a clear night then gone out of sightone small light about as high as the stars moving south at a high rate of speed then went out of sight, It was awesome((NUFORC Note:  Witness remains anonymous.

When I decided he had been in the room long enough I went in. As I began closing up the window on my part of the room I noticed a very bright light about half a mile away resting on some trees. It was much brighter than the light that would normally come off of an airplane or from a radio tower with a warning flasher. I asked my room mate if he had seen it and said it had been there for a while and that he had been watching it with his girlfriend. For a while we just watched the constant light; it didn&apos;t appear to move at all. Then it began to float south of us for what might have been a solid minute, moving very slowly and at tree level. It then began to move up higher than the tree level, perhaps 600 feet into the air. It then continued at an extremely slow pace south and suddenly stopped and stayed suspended again for about 10 minutes. It then moved very hastily south and disappeared around the corner of our windows. The whole experience lasted about 30 minutes for myself, but my room mate maintains that he and his girlfriend had seen it at about one o&apos;clock and it was 2:30 when the object left our sight.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at a celestial body.

We drove back to her house and she was filling up the car with gas when I looked up to the sky and saw a bright light reflecting silver/white glow.

She said yes she did and it took her a while because she had to find the keys to get in...I had never heard of lost time during a ufo encounter untill years later. I just thought it was strange. so did she. We started watching the ufo again and as it moved slowly now we walked along to get a better view of it. Through the binoculars it was just to bright.

I was facing west and noticed a Commercial Airliner heading west I&apos;m guessing at about 25k - 30k feet. As it approached the mountains I noticed a small shiny object in the air just south of the airliner and it seemed to me it was hoovering approximately 15k - 20k feet. My wife went to the car and got the binoculars while I kept an eye on the object. There were a few scattered clouds but for the most part it was very clear and bright. I looked at the object through the binoculars and it appeared to be spherical in shape and had a bright chrome like shine to it. It hoovered in the same spot for approximately 4 - 5 minutes and then started moving relatively slowly in an east/southeast direction. I followed it with my binoculars until it was directly above me, unfortunately so was the sun. I lost it in the sunlight and tried to find it again on the eastern side of the sunlight but could not relocate it. It appeared to be gaining altitude as it moved east. At first, before I got the binoculars, I thought it might be a hot air balloon. But when I saw it close up it was just a shiny sphere, no other protrusions or markings. There seemed to be no means of propellsion and there was no noise as it moved. My wife also saw this, but not through the binoculars.When we got back to work I called the Air Route Traffic Control Center @ 2211 17th Ave. in Longmont Colorado to see if they had seen anything on their radar. They told me there had been no sightings and referred me to the air traffic control tower at Jefferson County Airport. They told me they also had seen nothing.

The object was seen coming from the west, in an upward direction and then disappeared briefly.  Then to our surprise, the object reappeared and began to move at a high rate of speed over our heads, flashing on and off at equal intervals of approximately 1 second on and 1 second off, in a straight line in a south-east direction over Mary Lake in near the town of Huntsville in the Muskoka region of southern Ontario, Canada.The flashing on and off of the object was observed as a streak of intensely bright light in the sky, indicating a high rate of speed.  It was very cloudy and the only bright object in the night sky was the planet Venus.  This object had a light intensity that was much higher than that of any star or planet in the sky; I would equate it to the light intensity of a full moon on a clear night, concentrated at a single point streaking across the sky.As the object passed directly over our position, it became much brighter, suggesting it would have been only a few thousand feet above us (not any higher than a commercial airliner would fly) The object flashed on and off about 4 or 5 times before reaching beyond the other side of the lake just above the treeline and lowering in light intensity (as the object was seen just above the treeline, this was a greater indication of the low altitude).  The object then immediately flashed and streaked in a west direction at an angle that appeared to be less than 90 degrees. The object did not have time to slow down, nor did it appear to slow down when it immediately changed direction approximately 1 second later and moved east (in the opposite direction) at a high rate of speed.  The object then made yet another immediate change in direction approximately 1 second later, streaking across the sky, just above the treeline in a west direction.  It then made one final immediate change in direction approximately 1 second later, streaking east and then dissappearing below the tree line following this final streak of light.The only possible explanation of what was seen as the object flashed east and then west four times in immediate succession would be four completely different meteors entering our atmosphere at equal intervals of time, in alternating directions and with the same angle of incidence into our atmosphere (as the object moved or &quot;streaked&quot; back and forth at incredible speeds it seemed to retrace its previous path; in other words, the streak of light created was always parallel with the surface of the earth and the same height above the treeline).  The possibility of this object infact being multiple meteors in the specific formations witnessed is an extremely unprobable occurrance, thereby strongly suggesting that this object was not of this earth or of any physical phenomena that we could scientifically explain.", "huge moving star like lightthe first night i saw it was 7-11-02 it was about 22:00 in th north eastern sky it was about ten times larger than any star not moving at all the it moved at a medium pace into the s. eastern sky stoped and shot straight up until i could no longer see its light then i saw it again on 7-12-02 at the same time but in the dirrect western sky we wached it for 45 min. it was mostly just hovering then it slowly set like the sun until we couldn&apos;t see it any longer", "the triangle moved slowly above the trees moving from west to east.the object did not make any noise.My fiance and I had just returned from out of state and we were unpacking the car.Iwent back outside to retrieve the rest of our belongings when I noticed a triangle shaped object.

He gets up every night between 4:30 to 5:30 and goes on the computer in the kitchen. I told him to come back to bed it was about 05:10 AM. After calling him numerous times he finally came to bed in our bedroom which is in the rear of the house. As he laid down a bright flash of light came in the window. It was a bright light on the side of the house strobing then went out. We both looked out the window and did not see anything. We have a privacy fence that you cannot see through as well as a wall that is the side of the neighbor&apos;s house, we live in zero lot line houses, and our yard which is fenced in so no light from the streets can get in. I stayed awake for about 1/2 hour and watched out my window for anything strange. About 6:00 it flashed again. The light was not in the rear only on the side. We went outside to look and found nothing. We went in the front of the house and looked in the sky and saw nothing. I would like to note that about 2 weeks before in the evening about 4:00 am I saw small lights in the yard around the pool and palm trees. We have about 150 palm trees surrounding the pool. The foilage is dense around the fence and pool.I seen 2 lights about the size of a small flashlight in the trees about 3 feet from the ground.Another was in the top of the palm on the opposite side of the yard. I woke up my husband and said look at these lights in the yard. They flashed like they were flying like large bugs across the rear yard. The bugs would have to be about a foot long to produce a light of that size so I assumed it was not bugs. We watched them and one flew over by the window that we were looking out of and went straight up in the sky over the house. The other two were still in the bushes . He decided to go outside on the screen patio, our pool is not screened in, to see up close. He was 3 feet from the bushes outside the screen patio and wanted to go out. I advised him not to because maybe something would zap him up if he approched it. He called to the lights and they went around the back of the bushes and both went up into the air. We told a couple of people but not many because most peoople do nto believe you when you hear strange stories.  That is why when we seen the flashing light we said I guess it is the aliens again.

This camp is right on the Straight of Juan de Fuca. I went to the bathroom before going to sleep and on my way back I was following a trail through a wooded area using a small maglite when suddenly there was an extremely bright halogen-like light shining on me, which I thought was some other camper&apos;s obnoxiously bright flashlight. I stopped sort of blinded and surprised by how lit up the area around me was(like a spotlight or spaceship landing on TV! very bright)  and looked up to see what could be described as a &apos;close-up&apos; shooting star, as far as what the speed/motion of the object was(very fast, like when you see a shooting star the moment is so short that you barely experience it!). I didnt hear any sounds. This lasted a very short period of time, ten seconds at the most, I&apos;m guessing. Noone was there afterward with a flashlight as I suspected, we were probably the only people still awake. I walked out to the water to check out the sky, it was a very clear starry night but I didnt see anything else(shooting stars, planes, etc.) There was alot of off shore boat activity earlier, fishing?? I asked my girlriend if she saw anything and she said she thought someone flashed a flashlight on our tent when I was gone. The dog didn&apos;t act weird.

The object appeared to be 100 feet above the mountains flying up and across. When I first noticed it it appeared to be in the shape of a box and not very big (about the size that a small private plane might look at that height). As soon as I saw it it tried to show it to my family. As I was pointing where to look (taking my eyes off of it for a moment) it changed shape (from its movement I believe) to a round bottem cup shape without the handle (the round section being at the top). I lost sight of it after looking away the second time to try and point it out to my family. The sighting only lasted about 30 seconds. The craft(?) was not in a hurry really but seemed to be just crusing around. I don&apos;t know how it disappeared (fast or vanished) for I lost sight of it after looking away for just a second. I am a Baptist Pastor and do not believe in little alien dudes with buggy eyes and green heads...However I do know that what I saw was not anything I have ever saw or heard of in my 42 years on this planet.

( approximately 20 miles south west of Richmond, VA) I was driving in the east bound lane on highway 360. I spotted this cluster of yellowish orange lights with a large red pulsing light from a distance of about a mile away. The most peculiar thing about this, at that moment in time was the distance of the red pulsing light to the cluster of lights. The red pulsing light was hanging below the cluster of lights. This object/craft was heading west(towards us). I had the video camera with us in the truck. The model is a Sony TRV520 digital video camera with a 20X optical zoom. So, I found a good spot to pull over. My girlfriend and I both got out of the truck.  I grabbed the video camera and she grabbed the binoculars. After realizing that we still had the lens cover on the camera I was able to get the craft focused and zoomed in on it. This is the most bizarre craft I have ever seen. It flew under a star, and as it did, you can still see the star. Transparent? The craft is a cluster of small lights in a hexagon formation. There is a triangular portion in the front from which the large red pulsing light is affixed.I have video of the craft. I will be submitting still images which are video captures to Peter Davenport/NUFORC((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the video and the stills, and some object apparently was captured on film by the witness.

We were driving from New Orleans over the spillway around 4AM.  There was no traffic at that time.  We both commented on how empty the roads were at that hour.  As we drove on we noticed a bright white light on the other side of the spillway (the higway is seperated and elevated).  We decided to stop as the light was so unusual and unexpected.  It seemed to be sitting in amongst the trees.  We got out of our car to get a better look and it dawned on both of us that there was no sound.  There were no frogs croaking, no bird sounds and no sound at all coming from whatever that thing was across from us.  It appeared to be silver and round.  It had large white lights at intervals all around it.  The lights shown down.  My husband and I stood looking at the thing in the dark just mesmerized.

My husband and I both just looked at each other and almost together we said &quot;let&apos;s get out of here&quot; and we did.  We never talked about that.  Every so often I would bring it up but he never really wanted to talk about it.  I&apos;ve told friends about it when talk of UFO&apos;s come up.

I just had dinner at the Courier Cafe&apos; aroound the corner. I had not been drinking. I looked forward and up and noticed the light because it was unusually bright. I thought at first that it might be a planet because of its brightness and orange-amber color, though it seemed closer. Watching it as I walked, I noticed it was moving. As I walked past my building and headed down the hill, I saw two men standing at the entrance to a parking lot talking to a man in the passenger side of a stopped car. A woman was driving. I stopped to talk to them. They were all also looking at the light. They pointed me to the northeast where I saw two of the same lights moving off into the horizon. They said the lights had flashed bright white a few minutes ago. The two men walked away and the car drove ahead to the liquor store. I watched the single light continue moving. It flashed a bright white for a few seconds then returned to its amber color and kept moving. I watched it until it was disappearing into the horizon (then proceeded to walk toward the store). In the parking lot, I saw a friend who was leaving the store. He said he&apos;d seen the lights on his way to the store. I went inside (the store) for about five minutes. When I exited, I looked to the southwest and saw four more lights emerge one after the other from the horizon in a line. They seem to be equally spaced apart from each other at first then the first light strayed a little from the line formation. The rear one in the line did the same flashing activity as the first had done. I slowly walked back towards my building. As I watched, one or two others in the line did the same flashing. I watched until they reached the horizon. Once home, I called another friend in town and his girlfriend had seen the same lights fifteen minutes ago. All of the lights appeared the same. All of them seemed to maintain the same altitud! e throug hout their path. They moved in fairly straight lines. If they wavered or altered course, they did so gradually.&quot; In summary, this witness first observed the &quot;lights&quot; in the southwest and last observed in the northeast. The objects were observed approximately halfway up from the horizon. The witness could not begin to estimate the distance of the &quot;lights.&quot; The sighting duration was estimated to be 5-7 minutes in length (from horizon to horizon). The orange-amber lights appeared to be one and a half to two times the size of a star. No sound was discernable.

It went from 60 degrees (southwest)  to 30 degrees (west)  in the duration of 20:15 to 22:15.  The white throbbing brilliance and shape varied in randomness. The shape separates into 2 circular light and then unites.The starlike object is moving steadily closer (the size of object gets bigger and luminosity increases- my estimate is that it hovered over southwest of Manhattan -at least 3 times). and backs away at unbelievable speed. During these times at about 21:00, I noticed an increase in military surveillance planes fly by. At least there was more than 10-20 aircrafts/jets with surveillance capability flying by in increasing regularity. At about 21:20 I called my male neighbor, to validate what I was seeing. He saw the steady starlke object descend and ascend. He also noticed that it cannot be a manmade object because of the fact that it remained stationary for a long period at a time compared to our constantly moving military aircraft hovering around it. The wife of my neighbor joined in at 21:35 followed by another woman neighbor. They all saw the the starlike object move toward us (from west to east) and backward at tremendous speed.  We witness a light display (luminace) and (color shift - red blue yellow and white) and shape morphing. The luminace of the starlike object penetrates through cloud covering.There were 3 or 4 military aicrafts passing by every 5 minutes coming from south, north, east and west by 21:35 to 22:30.  There were 3 times that the starlike object shuts off its luminace and hides behind the clouds in the heightened pursuit and surveillanc by military aircarfts. It was an amazing display of light and flight technology by the starlike object. I was also glad that I have 3 eyewitness to validate the spectacular air show.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object probably was a celestial body.

I was driving along the coast highway at dust. Suddenly we all noticed a motionless hovering white ball of light, shining a cone of light on the beach. After approximately 10 seconds the ball of light shot off toward the horizon - west over the ocean - at an incredible speed. The cone of light remained, slowly becoming dimmer and assuming a &quot;smokey&quot; apearance while maintaining the cone shape. It gradually faded away. I do not know the time of the event, but it was dusk. It was a clear day and little if any clouds. The first impression (dictated by logic) was that it must be a helicopter with a searchlight, but try as we might, there just was no helicopter (or anything else) there - just a ball of light. The distance from us to the light is difficult to estimate, but in order to provide some context, I would guess it was between 70 and 100 yards away. The size of the ball of light is also difficult to gauge, again I would guestimate approximately 3 feet in diameter. The length of the cone of light was approximately 30 feet. We stopped at the next town (heading south), Gold Beach, Oregon, and reported to the police what we had seen. They told us that a lot of people had been reporting UFOs recently but what we saw was a meteor(!).

My first thought was that it was an airplane and the sun was reflecting off of it, but as it came closer, it seemed to be rocking back and forth because the light seemed to be pulsating.  It looked so unusual that I continued to watch it, expecting to hear an airplane engine or some sound at any minute, but there was no sound coming from it.  As it passed over the house, it was still very bright, but I could see it well enough and could not see any wings.  At about that time, I heard an airplane engine, but another airplane came from the north and was flying south. I ran out into the front yard to continue watching the object, and once the object was between me and the sun, I could make out a very distinct disk shape.  (I was looking at it from behind).  It was still rocking back and forth as if in slow motion.

Location: Gilford, NH, west-shoreline of Lake Winnipesaukee.We were viewing the last beautiful moments of light looking across the lake when my wife exclaimed, &amp;#8220;Look at that!&amp;#8221;  Looking to where she was pointing a glowing yellow light was visible.  It appeared somewhat stationary, though slight movement to the right and to the left was occurring.  The underside of the cloud that the light was in front of appeared illuminated within close proximity to the emitting source.  It lasted for about 2-3 seconds and then disappeared.  I kept waiting for it to emerge from the cloud but to no avail it did not. It was about the size of golf ball, relative to a softball sized Moon.We next witnessed the &quot;Orb&quot;, for lack of a better word, in front of the next cloud over to the right, which was fairly close to the first yet separated by a light bluish, slight turquoise hewed darkening sky. I never saw a shape depart the first cloud to get in front of the second. The sight was more or less the same, a glowing yellowish Orb that lasted for about 2-3 seconds.  We witnessed this again slightly to the left of the first sighting.  It was then that the first of several &quot;Linked Orb Movements&quot;  appeared.  The light was ON and then OFF and when it came back on it had moved approximately 10 times the width of the object to another position.  In a skipping fashion we watched the Orb turn OFF&amp;ON each time moving a segment of length across the sky.  We now refer to this type of sighting as a &quot;Link&quot;, representing the skipping movement that appeared to be in a set of connected links.We most definitely now felt that we were being treated to a spectacular visual occurrence.  From the nearby Laconia airport we heard an airplane approaching.  It was &quot;healthy&quot;  to hear this plane because we then knew that what we were witnessing was indeed noiseless and NOT A PLANE.  The propeller driven small plane, clearly visible in the sky was climbing, having just taken off. Upon approaching the spot of the second Orb sighting in front of the cloud, another &quot;Orb&quot; illumination flashed just below and to the left of the small plane.  This Orb was slightly larger than the others and appeared to be almost doubled, as if two of these Orbs were present with one being slightly behind the other.   The lake area was absolutely noiseless with the exception of the sound of the propeller from the plane.  We were both startled that there was not a collision.  It was very close.Afterwards we saw one of the Orbs in a stationary position and then it simultaneously emitted in perfect-arced unison, four distinct other Orbs.  At no point was there a trail of smoke or cloud associated with any of these sightings. The intensity of the light was constant and the arc formed one quarter of a circle. There was not a trail of light from any other place other than from the Orbs.  Once again all was noiseless.  All of the Orbs had the same yellowish hue.  We witnessed two more of these types of occurrences as well as two or three more of the skipping&quot;Links&quot;, one of which made seven distinct links across the sky, and appeared to be moving towards the South West, across the lake.Lastly we saw to our left (looking westward) two single sightings as well as the last of the emitting type, of which two Orbs were emitted, once again simultaneously.With that the event was over.  At about this time a boat was traveling up the lake and once again it was &quot;healthy&quot;; to here a sound.  It was loud, certainly identifiable and indeed affirmed that WHAT WE WITNISSED TRULY MADE NO SOUND.  We remained at the lake for another 15-20 minutes with the hopes of seeing something else. We did not.Sound travels well over the relative flat surface of the lake.  Given the size of the objects that we saw the biggest mystery to us other than their incredible movement has to be the complete silence that was associated with all visual sightings.  These without doubt were not flares, helicopters or jet planes.I am a licensed private pilot, completing a B.S. in Meteorology and very much believe in the scientific method.((NUFORC Note:  A description of this event can be found on the NUFORC homepage.

After realizing it was not a plane I got a pair of binoculars. Once focusing in on the object I quickly realized I was looking at a silver, metalic saucer spinning in place high in the sky. The disc also had a pair of lights spinning around the outer edge of the disc at a very rapid rate. After watching it non-stop for about 10 minutes I got the impression that it was at least 30 to 50 thousand feet in the air and the saucer must have been as big as a football field.

The memories of these events seem to come in a few vague,foggy memories at a time. I remember a room that is probably the size of an average size living room 30&apos;x 40&apos;,it&apos;s all metallic. There is a table in the middle of the room with an instrument of some kind above it. The walls of the room are a weird kind of composition because when it is touched it is like a weird soft gel like substance. I can&apos;t remember any experimants that are done to me (THANK GOD) but I do have pains in the back of my neck and  genital areas. I also seem to have a strange shape on my right hand in the shape of a triangle that is composed of three little dots and sometimes my hand will have a pain in the area where this shape is at. I don&apos;t know if anyone will believe me but I am telling the truth. I don&apos;t know how to stop this. I feel like I am not in control of my life here. CAn someone please give me some advice on this.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At first we thought it was a plane but it didn&apos;t move and after 10min. of staring at it the light became larger and brighter and continued to increase in size until it took shape.  We took binoculars and it was surronded by 6 white lights and one large orange light in the center.  Then it disappeared out of thin air. We called the ranger station afterward to see if anyone saw what the both of us did, however none of them went outside the biulding.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I wanted to request further information.  I really am curious to see if anyone else has reported anything similar to what I saw.  I&apos;m not convinced it was a craft but for the fact that the light couldn&apos;t have been traveling through the cloud from the ground, I would have seen the light path as it passed through.  Secondly the circular clound surrounding the event and the chill as well as the silence and then the sudden disappearance (though I didn&apos;t witness it leave) convince me that this was more than just an average light or cloud.  If not a UFO what else could it have been?  I was being facetious about the alien contact comment.  It was late and I was rather ashamed of myself for getting so scared.  I&apos;ve looked through numerous entries on you site and others and haven&apos;t found anything quite like it.  And though I distinctly remember reading something about UFO&apos;s hiding in circular clouds I cannot find anything confirming this.  There are numerous UFO sightings in the Tacoma/Lakewood area.  One night several years ago my daughter, a ffriend and I saw lights streaking across the sky betweem Tacoma and Puyallup, then they hovered and took off again, we all agreed it could not have been a plane and that was confirmed when we listened to the rradio, numerous people called the station and saw what we saw.  Interestingly even though we are near an airforce and army base there were no aircraft in pursuit.  We see planes all the time in this area, of all types.  This did not appear to be a plane.

I estimate the height in this way because that is what I thought the objects were, a bunch of private planes, i.e. a local flying club, out for a night flight around town (although I did not see any particular form or shape to the objects).  They gradually veered away from me (for them, they would&apos;ve been making a right hand turn).  They may, in fact, have been gradually veering away from me from when I first saw them (being at night it was impossible to accurately determine if they were proceeding directly across my line of vision and then veered away, or if they had been gradually veering away from me from the start (moving laterally diagonally across my line of vision) and then veered &quot;more sharply&quot;.1) I say &quot;in formation&quot; because all though all the lights appeared to move in concert, or in a pack, there was smaller movement between some of the lights, like individual objects speeding up to keep up with each other and/or slowing down to avoid getting to close.2) That the objects didn&apos;t make a sound, I attributed to their being down wind of me, i.e. the wind blew the sound of the planes away from me.3) That no small plane I had ever seen before at night had ever been lit up like this and, in any event, probably wouldn&apos;t be if they really were out for a night flight, i.e. out to see the city all lit up at night, strange as this sounds, I didn&apos;t think anything of it.4) In retrospect, I guess the only thing stranger than the sight itself, was my nonchalant reaction to it.  I certainly wasn&apos;t frightened, but neither do I remember being particularly awed, I seem to remember thinking: &quot;Oh, that&apos;s neat&quot;.((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the witness for his having submitted such a nice report.

A woman called me over to witness it as she has sighted it just before I arrived.  There was a very large bonfire going on one area of the fairgrounds and there was lots of music and activity.  She viewed the object over the bonfire and was watching it move over the main stage area when I arrived.  I watched with her as it moved over the fairgrounds.  It headed out towards the hills and I assumed it would vanish over the hill, but it actually went into the hill, thats when I determined it had been traveling very close to the earth and was pretty small.  It floated over the treetops on the hill for a moment then decended in to the wood.  The glow of the craft remained, on the ground for a moment then went off.

As we got closer I coud tell that they weren&apos;t aircraft but looked more like the stadium lights at FIU (Florida Int&apos;l University).But as we approached the intersection at 107 Ave., I realized that stadium lights were much farther.  When we finally gor to the intersection, I stopped my car, got off and directly above me was this huge bright and white cigar shaped light.  It didn&apos;t make any noise whatsoever.  Suddenly, a small green light started blinking and it silently began to descend as it drew away from us.  In ended up hovering above some bushes about a block away.

PD))Here is an unfiltered account of communications and interactions between a teenage human and a group of ET&apos;s.This happened 25 years ago  during a well documented UFO flap in 1977 in Gisborne New Zealand and the Waimata Valley near Gisborne.What I experiences seems quite different from what people talk about but this is how it happened., nothing is held back.I&apos;m free to talk about it now as this information is publicly available in space so it may as well be publicly available here too.Here it is, complete with spelling mistakes and typos.&quot;Here is what I wrote on an sighting report this year about the ET&apos;s experience with me:  they had the misfortune of trying to control a highly excited, disobedient teenage boy that was loose on their spaceship. It was fun for all of us and probably put the ET&apos;s off having human teenagers as children.I didn&apos;t need hypnosis to recall this. The ET&apos;s memory erasing methods didn&apos;t work on me, which also meant they couldn&apos;t control me while I was with them like they were used to controlling humans. By time they learned that is was too late for them to do anything about it.Please write an account of what happened This can be CSV delimited for your database.Date, 1977 Location, Waimata Valley NZ - I lived there on our family farm.Event Circumstances, It Happened during a UFO flap that centred on Waimata Valley and Gisborne at the same time UFO&apos;s were filmed from a plane over the South Island of NZ.Main Event, I was a guest on a scout UFO and was taken into space for urgent medical attention on a larger space ship when the operation in my nose went wrong.We&apos;d had UFO sightings reported for over 2 months along Waimata Valley Road near our house So I decided to sleep with a torch and the next time one flew over our house I&apos;d get out my window with the torch and start signalling it.One flew over our house and I jumped out the window and began signalling it.There were two ET&apos;s in a window looking down at me. I could read their telepathic conversation to each other, one was saying lets carry on, this is of no interest and the other said to wait, this could be of interest. At this point I was flashing the torch and waving at them like any excited kid and I thought &quot;yes - I&apos;ve won them over&quot;.The one that said this might be of interest immediately telepathically told me I had not won them over and next thing I remember I&apos;m in a corridor on the scout ship jumping up and down going it&apos;s true! it&apos;s true! you are real and there were at least 2 Et&apos;s just standing there looking at me trying to get a handle on the sight of an over excited teenage boy in pyjamas going off in front of them. What was of interest to them was that I could read their telepathic conversations to each other. I also learned they have ways of telepathically talking one on one and ensuring on ET nearby can listen on to the one on one chat.Once I&apos;d calmed down from hyperactive to just animated the tall one walked asked me why I had been unsure if they were real and why was I out there flashing my torch at them.  I replied that we&apos;d been told they weren&apos;t real and others were saying if they were real they were here to harm humans. I said they&apos;d been over our house for the past few months and I was still fine so obviously they were not here to hurt us so I decided to attract the attention of the next one that flew over our house.The tall one asked who was saying they were here to harm them and I said - the Americans said this all the time but I stopped believing that when they&apos;d been over our house for a few months and we hadn&apos;t been harmed by this. The Tall one was not happy to hear that I&apos;d been told ET&apos;s were here to harm humans. The tall one told me they&apos;d met humans and had not received a friendly reaction from humans. Humans had not made them feel welcome on Earth. I said well on behalf of humans they were welcome here. I think the Tall one and short ones were trying not to telepathically laugh at a human child welcoming them on behalf of humanity but I was so excited and I&apos;d blurted it out as I really wanted them to feel welcome.They told me the Russians were just like us and that I had to like the Russians as well as the Americans as we were all one species. This freaked me out and I had a stand up argument with them saying the Russians were not our friends as they were communists and if they were our friends why were they building so many more weapons than they needed and the Tall one kept saying we (communist or capitalist) must get along as we were all the same. I just couldn&apos;t accept this concept so we dropped the conversation and went to a room.A some point they put me in a trance to keep me in one place while they went to another room. I snapped myself out of the trance and went wandering around the corridors. A little ET spotted me and was surprised as was the Tall ET but the tall ET told the little ET I was safe so to let me look around. The little ET followed me everywhere during this phase. Then my time for medicals began so I went back to the room and got on the table/bed.There the tall one told me that they had not been offered much co-operation from Humans and it would like my assistance, by this time it was standing over a bench in the corner of the room preparing some hand held instrument and I was lying on my back on a body temperature metal or plastic table. I said I&apos;d be happy to help it, it could take off an arm if it wanted as long as it didn&apos;t harm my ability to think as that was important to me. It was touched by that remark and laughed that it didn&apos;t need an arm but would do other things.It did whatever it did then began to put a powered instrument up my nose. I said it looked like it would hurt me and it said if I liked it would stop any pain and I said yes please so it gave me the image of a moth crawling up my nostril while the instrument went in. While the instrument was up there doing whatever it did the ET dropped their guard and telepathically I picked this up so I seized the moment and jerked my head back violently with the instrument still active deep in my nostril. The ET was quick to stop the instrument but the damage had been done, it had sliced me up wherever it was inside my nostrils. The ET asked &quot; why did you do that&quot; and I said now you&apos;ll have to take me with you, you won&apos;t be able to fix that in time. There was a mini conference with the ET&apos;s in a corridor and the scout ship bolted to space.I was allowed out to watch as I felt the motion and I was over the moon as I felt this meant I was going with them to their planet. I saw the big ship as we approached it and was transferred to it to be repaired. Sometime during the repairs I realised I was to be returned to home and I was really upset by this so I tried to persuade them my parents didn&apos;t love me and I really wanted to go with them. They said I couldn&apos;t live with them and wouldn&apos;t explain why I couldn&apos;t then they showed me footage of my mother panicking in the house as she&apos;d gone to my bedroom and couldn&apos;t find me. They used this to show me my story about not being loved by my parents was not true as my mother was panicking so I had to be returned to her.I accepted defeat and went back to the scout ship to be returned. I asked them if they&apos;d visit us and would they please come for dinner and meet my family. The tall one asked if we would cook vegetarian and I said we had vegetarians but they were not normal, we all ate meat. The Tall one was not impressed with meat consumption. They said they would definitely be back.They dropped me off in daylight just in time for me to go to school.While wandering around the scout ship I&apos;d pocketed a small item. I&apos;d kept it with me and the little ET knew I had it. The big ET one either didn&apos;t know or pretended not to know that I had it. As I was being let out the door of the scout ship the little one said to stop me as I had an item of theirs. I was asked to stop so I did, no force was used. There ware about 4 of them grouped around me in the corridor and the tall one came over and said &quot; have you got anything&quot; I said no an the tall one immediately flashed me a telepathic warning that the others couldn&apos;t hear which said &quot;this is important - hand it over&quot; so I conceded defeat and handed it over and tried to justify it by saying &quot; I had to do it you know&quot; then I was transferred back to my bedroom.My father saw me being returned and wouldn&apos;t touch me until Mum made him. My mother was in the house.Unusual observations? Movements, sounds, lights, odours, etc Nothing unusual, it was a metallic disc that hovered quietly and had windows which I could see into when I was standing below it and I could see out of when I was in it. There were no surprises in the interior, it had corridors, separate rooms, a flight control area which was ergonomically correct for a 16 year old and which would have been relatively easy to learn as it looked conventional and uncluttered.The temperature was normal and the furniture was functional for humans as well as ET&apos;s. Any human would feel comfortable inside it.The ET&apos;s each had distinct personalities. The tall one who did the nose operation on me in the scout ship was very familiar with humans and was relaxed around me. I could chat telepathically with it and it loved talking, it was very enthusiastic about humans and their potential and was surprised humans had not been as positive in their attitudes towards ET&apos;s.There was also a short ET that was a bit shorter than me. It didn&apos;t trust me and kept following me around. It nearly freaked when I wandered into the flight deck and was leaning over the instrument panel/console. I told it when I grew up I was going to fly these (I meant planes as a pilot but it thought I meant fly UFO&apos;s - it dismissed the idea of me flying UFO&apos;s when I grew up as ridiculous). The short ET had very limited experience with Humans and felt we were barbarians - not to be trusted. It was watching me to learn more about this human species that it had been warned about but had not had not seen first hand before. That&apos;s the impression I was getting from it. I didn&apos;t help improve it&apos;s attitude as it caught me trying to steal a souvenir and it kicked up quite a stink when it looked like I was going to be released with the souvenir still in my procession.Describe your location relative to the sighting When the ship stopped above me it was say 10 - 20 metres above me and in front of me so I could easily see into it&apos;s windows and see the 2 ET&apos;s discussing me. It never landed I was in one spot one moment and in the ship in the next moment.Other people? Names, contact details Here are other events reported on the web concerning the UFO flap at the time 1. THE U.F.O. BBS - http://www.ufobbs.com/ufo  Originally dated 5 Aug 1993, 17:29 In the Waimata Valley, New Zealand, Decemebr 2, 1977, a farmer was awoken by his dog barking and, upon investigation, saw a landed &quot;flying saucer&quot; on the ground.  Two humanoids were carrying one of his dogs between them and moving towards the object.  They were 143 cm tall and wore close fitting, metallic silver overalls and white, opaque helmets.  These overalls were gathered at the ankles with elastic cuffs which extended over red glowing boots.  On the entities&apos; hands were large silver gauntlets with flared arm coverings extending half way up the forearms.  The white helmets were rounded like large motorcycle helmets and extended from shoulder to shoulder without any markings or openings.  Alarmed my this sight, the farmer fired a shot and apparently winged one of the entities for the two beings dropped the dog and the wounded one ran off into some nearby bushes while the other ran into the craft which took off at speed.This happened to a near neighbour a couple of miles up the Waimata Valley road from us. It happened about a week or two after the encounter the ET&apos;s had with me. We knew of it at the time and can believe is as both the residents and the ET&apos;s seemed comfortable with each other.The residents accepted the UFO&apos;s crop circles and occasional dead cow as &quot;just another day at the office&quot; and left the ET&apos;s alone and the ET&apos;s were quite cheeky with the frequency of their daytime as well as night time appearances and the evidence they were leaving around.The farmer probably shot the ET as he&apos;s shoot anyone who was stealing and hurting his dog.A story that went through Waimata Valley as that a couple of days after the event a distressed ET stepped on the road to flag down one of our neighbours as she drove to town. The silly lady floored it and left the ET by the roadside rather than stop and offer assistance. She missed an opportunity there 2.(1. Original investigation by Bryan Dickeson. 2. Retrospective investigation by Keith Basterfield &amp; Bill Chalker. 3. Dykes, M. (1981). &quot;Strangers In Our Skies.&quot; INL. Lower Hutt. pp46-49.) Three women were involved in an abduction case in the midst of a large UFO flap near Gisborne which began in 1977. One night they were lying on a hillside watching the skies, and felt that a period of &quot;missing time&quot; occurred. Shortly after the event a regression hypnosis session was arranged and an abduction scenario revealed. In 1989, during a retrospective investigation by Keith Basterfield and Bill Chalker, a regression session was conducted with one woman. This revealed an account of being drawn up a beam of light; of seeing one of the other women inside the UFO, and of talking to a male entity. All three women were then back on the hillside.I haven&apos;t been in touch with the above organisation but I probably know the girls involved in this report.3&quot; In late December 1978, air freight pilots reported seeing unusual bright lights hovering over Kaikoura, N.Z. Two weeks later, in January 1979, the mysterious lights returned and were videotaped by Australian and New Zealand TV news agencies.Following the sightings, the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RZNAF), the police and the Centre Observatory in Wellington cooperated in an investigation, the results of which were stamped Top Secret and lodged in the National Archives in Wellington.Calling the report &quot;a whitewash,&quot; Hassall was quoted by the New Zealand Press as saying, &quot;They discussed how to deal with the problem of (UFO) reports and they all agreed to cooperate and investigate... but not tell the public they were exchanging information. Secretly they were trying to figure it out. No one wanted to deal with the problem of UFO reporting. They didn&apos;t know what to do about them, partly through a lack of resources to adequately investigate them", "greenish white egg shaped light in the sky, moving towards the ground.we were sitting in the car and then out of no where, this greenish white egg shaped thing flew accross the sky. it moved too slowly to be a shooting star, and too fast to be a plane, it sored downward to the ground, in almost a round line; like a semi-circle.((NUFORC Note:  This was the date that the gentleman, billed as &quot;The Amazing Kreskin,&quot; predicted a dramatic UFO sighting would occur over Nevada.  On June 07, 2002, he retracted, and stated that the &quot;prediction&quot; had been a hoax, designed to show how gullible human beings can be regarding the UFO phenomenon.

I only recall what happened or thought of what happened a few years ago, I remember walking to the house and the next thing I remember is sitting in my fathers car back at the first house where we originally started from wondering what I was doing there , I started the car and drove to the other house, where I looked for my cousin and nephew, everyone there asked where I had been, because they(my cousins and other family peers)had gone out to look for me. On my way out to go and find them, they st walked in, shouted me for leaving without letting them know and that was that.

At that time the owner commented that he had heard the formation may have been discovered by others as early as Friday July 5th but that he did not personally know of its presence until it hit the news on Tuesday July 9th.Investigator Carol Pedersen from The Center for Crop Circle Studies has been out to the site to collect samples for Michigan biophysicist, Wm. C. Levengood. Levengood has been examining crop circle plants and soils since 1989. To-date, three papers presenting the research findings have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, as well as more than 100 lab reports on individual crop formations in the U.S., Canada, England, The Netherlands, Germany, Australia and Israel. These scientific papers and laboratory reports outline the physical abnormalities discovered so far in the plants and soils, clearly indicating a causative agency other than human-directed mechanical flattening of the plants, suggesting instead an energy system which emits microwaves and associated unusual electrical and magnetic field. Although some instances of the phenomenon known as &ldquo;crop circles&rdquo; are apparently created by people, scientific analysis of the affected plants and soils indicates that slightly more than 90% of formations tested have a more interesting&mdash;and more complex&mdash;causation.Tuesday July 16th update...Oregon UFO Research has received a preliminary report from the main investigator in this case, OUFOR consultant Carol Pederson of The Center for Crop Circle Studies. The findings she observed while in that formation along with new witness testimony strongly suggests this formation may in fact be authentic and casts serious doubts on the sole testimony of 17 year old Logan Richardson who claimed that teens he was acquainted with made it. Not one of the teens has come forward to identify themselves and the day they were supposed to have done the formation is later than the actual discovery date.A few items of interest that should be noted.1) A witness provides testimony that the formation appeared as early as Friday July 5th...this pre-dates when the teens were supposed to have created the formation.2) No one has personally admitted to making the formation.3) Another witness reports seeing the formation on Sunday the 7th of July. This witness had some knowledge of the phenomenon and looked for a trail leading in...none were present. Monday morning, July 8th she noticed a path leading into the formation.4) Wheat heads were intact during the investigation and spilled out when walked on.5) Stalks were bent but not broken.6) Elongated nodes were observed but no blown or bent nodes.7) Lay pattern indicates the swirls were made from the outside in.8) The formation was aligned exactly N-S by compass reading.9) It should also be noted that this formation is very similar to one that appeared in Washington State in 1993.With the exception of the Hillsboro Argus newspaper, most of the media reported that this formation was a hoax based on one teens testimony minus anyone admitting to it. The press also attempted to make a connection to the upcoming Mel Gibson film &quot;SIGNS&quot; as a possible reason for it&apos;s appearance without any evidence to prove the Forest Grove circle was a hoax. While a hoax is always a possibility, some of the information gathered during the investigation points away from this and we should all wait until the samples come back from the Laboratory of Michigan Bio-physicist W.C. Levengood before making any final conclusions. Past analysis have shown that 90% of formations tested gave positive results of being authentic. We are also grateful for the hard work and dedication by Carol Pedersen of The Center for Crop Circle Studies. Carol has worked for many years investigating formations in the state of Oregon and is the best in her field. We at OUFOR have our hats off to her detailed investigative talents and are fortunate to have her as a consultant for Oregon UFO Research.We will post more information when the tests are complete regarding the authenticity of this formation.To view three photos from KATU channel 2&apos;s Jet ranger 2, go here... http://www.oregonuforeview.com/recent.html ... and scroll down to 7-05-02((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Eric Byler and Skip Schultz, of Oregon UFO Research, for following up on the case, and sharing the information with NUFORC.

When I got closer to it I could see that it was too close to the ground and too big to be an airplane and I thought that maybe it was a blimp, but it looked too big to be a blimp.  Also I saw huge white lights on it that where in the shape of rectangular windows and I saw a blue flashing light underneath the object.  The object was flying west.  I was near a tollbooth when I saw the object and by the time I got to the tollbooth the object was moving slowly west away from I355.", "I thought it was a shooting star.Around 1:30 am est. I was at the Cottage restaurant and bar in Huntsville Ontario for the long weekend. My group were all out on the patio having a drink, when I looked up to see a shooting star. I was travelling at the same speed as a shooting star, but it was two round, orange, objects heading west. The circles were almost flying together as in a formation. They then split up and headed upwards in seperate directions through the clouds, into the night sky. It happened so fast I didn&apos;t know what to make of it. I have never seen anything like that in my life.", "approx 100m long x 30m at back, pointed at front. it was soundless and moving approx 10kph. the only way that i can explain it is to say that it appeared to be discharging what looked like molten metal from the rear of the craft which seemed to disapate before reaching the ground. it was also dead silent.  Approx. 15-25 minutes after loosing sight of the craft i observed a single military aircraft going in the same direction at a similar altitude (maby 500 ft.) at a very high rate of speed on what I can only assume was an intercept course.", "Slowly moving cigar-shaped object with unusual flashing lights seen in Salem, OR in 1970&apos;s.I was walking with my boyfriend late at night.  We looked up and saw a cigar shaped object slowly moving overhead with a humming sound.  The lights of this object were most unusual.  There were approximately a hundred lightsof various colors around the &quot;equator&quot; of the object (parallel to the ground).  These lights would blink off and on making it appear that there was a continuous circle of light moving around the &quot;equator&quot; of the object (like might be seen with an advertising sign or a carnival ride).  We watched the object for awhile, but quite frankly we were more interested in each other, and so eventually stopped watching this slowly moving object.  Eventually it was gone, but I don&apos;t know how.The only aircraft that would be similar to this object would be a blimp, but I have heard that blimps don&apos;t travel at night.  Also, the lights were very unusual.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I went out &amp; saw a huge saucer -about the size of a football field- hovering just above the woods. We lived in the county about 3 miles from the small airport. The UFO was huge, made a humming, vacuum sound, domed on top &amp; bottom with rotating lights around both domes &amp; around the middle, except the lights around the middle didn&apos;t rotate but seemed to flash randomly. I felt no fear, just awe. I ran into the house &amp; got my mother so she could see it &amp; she did. Being mechanically-minded I focused on the sound of the craft to try to determine its power source &amp; was very conscious to pay attention to details of appearance. I took a Polaroid picture after getting my mother but it didn&apos;t take. The photo background was brownish-black with 3 scarlet red smears in the center. I don&apos;t know what happened to the photo but now think the red smears were heat indicators. I&apos;ve drawn this craft several times over the years &amp; keep one with me in case I run into someone who claims to have seen the same thing. I was intelligent &amp; didn&apos;t use drugs. I saw this craft, I am not crazy, &amp; I have been trying to figure out its power source for 29 years. I am a technical mechanical engineer by trade &amp; now have a pretty good idea about the craft&apos;s power source. I believe there&apos;s a reason some of us see these things &amp; some don&apos;t. I don&apos;t know what that reason is but I know that my life changed when I saw that UFO &amp; feel there was a purpose for it. Maybe submitting this report is the reason. If anyone from this area also saw this, please submit your report.

The bus was coming from the east end of the street, so I was looking towards that direction initially. then out of no particular reason I turn around and looked up and this strange looking object floating there: it was a longish object like a cigar of a tube, white in color, with red lights glowing around it by which I mean I can see clearly where the red lights ends. At this moment a passenger plane was climbing from my backward uper left hand and flew past that object. and I thought at that moment the people in the plane must also have seen the strange object. Meanwhile I made some comparisons between these two: I could see clearly the wings, tail, the marks and even the potholes on the plane; and i knew it was climbing because it was flying at an upward angle and there was airport nearby. But with the object, I couldn&apos;t see much of it except that it was about the same size with the plane because they were at about the same attitute from my position and it had no wings, no tails and no specific characteristics to tell me that this was something I have seen before. I didn&apos;t take it very seriously at first. I thought that if it was ufo or something, the people in the passenger plane must have seen it and perhaps many other people have seen it too, cause that day was a briliant cloudless day and besides that the people working in the nearby airport with radar and everything must have seen it too. So I thought there would be some reports on next day&apos;s newspaper, and I didn&apos;t find any next two days. So on 7th, I called New South Wales UFO Investigation Centre(POBox W42, West Pennant Hills, NSW2125; phone 02-94844680).

I looked up into the sky and saw a bright light.

I was the first to spot the object, it was difficult shape to configure at first, it had a dull crimson beam, there was a dinstinctive hazy mass serrounding the light, it was traveling northward at sea level. I immeadiately pointed out the obscure object to my friend. He saw it as well, we immediately realised that it traveling at an enourmous speed.Our Location distinguised how fast the object was traveling, I saw it pass the port of Outer Harbour (located 30 Km away) within 2 minutes! I made an estimate that it must of been traveling at 1200 kilometres per hour to reach outer harbour in that short period of time. The object momentarily disapeared, a military aircraft followed in persuit, but obviously lost its coordinates and flew in a circle. After five minutes the aircraft left the scene. In Adelaide we have the largest airforce base and armed forces research facility in Australia known as the &quot;RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) technology and defence facility located 25km north of Adelaide. So my collegue and I were very suspicious as we knew that this was more than an unusaul craft to catch the secretive atentiveness of RAAF. Coincedentaly as the RAAF servailance craft left the scene, the undentified craft reapeared and began ascend southward north of outer harbour, then it veered Southeast closer to the shore, within a minute it was within a kilometre from us, from there we were able to define the ahape of the object, it had dark tansparent haze with a cylindrical shape but rounded dimentions like a piece of m&amp;m candy. We then noticed 2 more objects of the same nature following it further out to sea! , they t oo possesed the crude crimson lights.Within a 30 seconds these other craft disapeared. The original craft then sped southwesterly out towards the open sea, it came near the oil tankers and its lights dimmed in 20 seconds then the object vanished from our view.

Well, I was outside taking a break loking about the stars. Next thing I know, there was this pulsating light moving in a straighter north to south direction. It was a bit closer parallel to the west. I know it wasn&apos;t a satellite because they don&apos;t have lights. I also really don&apos;t believe it was a standard aircraft because they have lights other than white. they have red and/or blue  lights. Furthermore, even IF they did have just a white light, it wouldn&apos;t pulsate nor would it be semi-dull, bone marrow white as such what I witnessed.I know it seems crazy that I saw two sightings 23 hours apart, but I know what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed on June 18, but the ISS was visible from California at approximately 21:13 hrs.

As we got to Kalamazoo I noticed this light in the sky towards the west.  The UFO had lights all over it although it was pretty far up, the lights looked to be red, white and a bluish-green color, I also noticed an orangey color.  There was no noticeable sound. It looked like other smaller craft were maybe coming out of it or beams of light were shooting off.  It seemed to speed up as I sped up and slow down when I slowed down on the highway.  It pretty much stayed with us for about 2 hours.  As we neared Muskegon it looked as though it was going towards Lake Michigan and we lost it, it just got smaller and smaller and disappeared by the lake.  As it got smaller it looked orange to me.  Then the next night we spotted the same thing at my fathers house in North Muskegon.  My father had told me that it looked like the same thing he saw 30 years ago, he saw 2 of them and one of them shot like a laser or something and hit the other one, then they both disappeared.  The one we saw the second night though was in a different part of the sky.  This time it was in the South almost by the moon.  Well since the first night, we have been seeing the same thing, by the 3rd night we were watching as it just twirled around and moved a little but mostly stayed in the same area, a plane came over us and it left but later that night as we were back at our home in muskegon we saw it again, this time with more of them....we saw what looked to be around 3-5 of them, we looked through telescope and saw like 3 circular things under it twirling in a clockwise motion, almost like balls of fire.  Last night (6/26) we went to Lake Michigan by Rothbury/Montague area and spotted 2 lights on the lake that seemed to be hovering just over the water. Dark clouds spread over us, due to stormy weather so we went back up towards the woods.  I went back down to see if they were there and they were gone.

First only one appeared in the sky (Sky condition thunder and lightning, electrical flashes)He stated the first one was a single whitish light which divided into three lights, twirled in a spiral pattern then returned to regroup into the single light. I asked him to time the occurrance and he said 20 seconds. About 10 minutes later he said another identical phenomenon appeared, so that two of them were in the sky simultaneously. I asked him to try to interpret them as the electronic billboard of a commericial blimp and he said that it did not seem to him that that was it.  I emailed another person who was in Warminster PA online at the same time and asked them to look into the sky but they said they saw nothing. My friend said that the occurrance &quot;faded&quot; into the electrically charged sky. Total time of occurrance about 20 minutes.

They would come together and meet in the middle continually moving and then branch out as if pushing away from one another. They stayed a certain distance from eachother as if coming from four corners of a diamond. I was talking at the time to a friend in the same building. I asked him to hang up and come up to see. He observed the movement for over five minutes. I then reported this to the police. A car was immediately sent out and it patroled right under where the lights were spinning.

Dawn was imminent and the sky was bright and clear with an intermittent light high cloudiness. The jet was in sunlight, I was not. I was noticing the contrail was made by four engines (wing-mounted), a little more unusual to see these days. So, probably a large airliner or military transport. As I was working this out, I noticed a steady bright spot just east of the contrail, approximately due east of me. Only Venus or maybe Jupiter would shine so brightly, but this was roughly 40 degrees above the horizon and perhaps just a tad larger than Venus at its best. Besides, it&apos;s been all over the media that all the bright planets are currently grouped in the west just after sunset. I noticed the object did not seem to move, so it wasn&apos;t an airplane or satellite (Later I checked with the Starry Night planetarium program, and no bright planets or stars were in that part of the sky. Any satellites that showed up in the program were moving much too fast.) I noticed the contrail was drifting eastward, toward the object, which appeared stationary. I ran in and grabbed a pair of 20x50 binoculars. By the time I returned, just a few minutes (3?) had passed but the contrail was now east of the object, drifting and spreading. I had the impression the object was much higher altitude than the contrail, but did not witness the one cross the other. The object had not moved. If it were moving as a star or planet, it would not have moved far enough in the short time to be noticeable, however. I leaned against my car to help steady the binocular image. Focus was consistent with a very distant object. It was still small, but not a point source, and appeared to be somewhat rectangular, or possibly a cylinder if it were oriented roughly NW-SE and pointed down about 60 degrees toward the northwest. It was bright white, I assumed by reflection of the coming Sun, but there were two much brighter round spots on the north, lower-facing side. These were so bright they must have been bright lights or direct specular reflections of the Sun. The light was not colored, appearing white. I watched it for a total time of at least ten minutes, during which time I did not perceive any motion, neither gross translation nor wobble nor spin. Angular size was very small, perhaps 5 arcminutes. I returned about an hour later, after the Sun had risen, but between the bright sky and a slight overcast, was unable to reacquire the object. If I had to guess, I&apos;d say the jet I saw was roughly 20,000 feet altitude (did not appear to be on approach to PDX, of which I see plenty), the high thin cloud layer at roughly 25,000, and the object high above the clouds at 45,000 feet (which would make a 5 arcminute object around 65 feet long). Surface winds were still, but according to the weather service winds flowed west to east at 40 knots up at 37,000 feet, slower at lower levels (surface calm, 5,000&apos; &lt; 10 knots; 10,000&apos; 10-20 knots, all W to E).

I would guess it was roughly  the size of a very small airplane compressed and traveling steadily at about the same speed as a small plane.  I was stunned and thought it had something to do with being the 4th of July and at first thought it looked like it was following the airplane.  We were also to be on high alert for terrorism this day.  I watched it for about a minute with nobody else to yell to come see.  I thought about calling 911 but thought they&apos;d think i was nuts.

The object was flying southward down the valley above state highway 26 from I-70 toward the town of Morrison.  The object was glossy red on top and black underneath, about three feet long &amp; two feet high.  In shape and color it looked vaguely like a giant ladybug flying without it&apos;s wings.  The object was roughly at eye-level when observed from the hiking trail on Dakota Ridge, flying about 150-200 feet above the valley floor.The object was silent and flew at a constant speed of roughly 30MPH, perfectly straight and perfectly level, covering a distance of more than a mile while observed.  Despite erratic breezes, the object moved in an absolutely rock-steady manner with no shifting around or any changes in speed, direction or altitude.   Although breezes were generally blowing in the same direction that the object was moving, the wind&apos;s direction was erratic and it&apos;s intensity was inconstant during observation.

Weather conditions were quite clear, beautiful stars and a nearly full moon just rising.  There was some humidity in the atmosphere that gave a slight halo to the moon, as well as to the object of interest soon to appear.My girlfriend and I took an evening walk, looking at the stars, waking east, with the moon just peaking through the silhouettes of trees ahead and to the right a few degrees.  We were discussing the large amount of water/ice just discovered on mars. I was just commenting about how the prospect of life on other planets would affect many people&apos;s religious beliefs and how it would shake up the world &hellip;when my girlfriend called out for me to look up &hellip;and said that she had just seen a big pulse of light! I looked and saw a very bright star or planet, brighter that any object in the sky with the exception of the moon.  It had a small visible halo, the only planet besides the moon that did, and was basically a very brilliant single white or yellow/white light.  There was no blinking or movement. At first I thought maybe this was the ISS reflecting or a possibly very large satellite. From the time I saw it, the light sat frozen in place for what seemed at least 5 seconds, then suddenly it began to move.  Its intensity began to dim quickly, the halo vanished, and then it then appeared more similar to a satellite in motion, except that it reduced in size very quickly, so quickly that in approximately than 5 seconds it was gone completely. To the eye it appeared to be going away very fast from the earth&apos;s surface.Specifically, I was facing east and the object was positioned overhead and forward some, maybe 10 degrees East from directly overhead and slightly to my left or North, surrounded by a group of stationary stars. It moved diagonally toward my right and forward or in a generally southeast direction slightly, and at the same time outward very fast. It was positioned near a small cluster of stars, maybe three or four fairly bright ones, but none comparing to it in intensity.  They were my reference for the object&apos;s motion.

My sons called me to their bedroom to see what they said were weird lights in the sky over the lake. What I witnessed at first was a series of lights on the clouds which at first I took to be spot lights from the ground illuminating the clouds a not uncommon experience. My opinion of this changed when one of the twisting rotating lights in the clouds suddenly got to the edge of the cloud, when it did it was brighter than the sun to look at. This went on for over an hour with the lights wiggling and constantly appearing at the edge of the cloud as these immensely bright spots of light. A second storm was rolling in from the west behind us, there were some huge flashes of lightning inside the clouds which of course illuminated the entire sky as these took place it was obvious that there was a very large triangular object in the clouds, the repeated flashes and the blocking of light (shadow) that this thing caused made it obvious that it was indeed solid. From one flash to the next it had moved horizontally and had got smaller indicating that it was higher. After about 6 or 7 lightning flashes it was no longer visible. I went back to looking at the lights spinning through the sky above the lake. They started to slow down and remain in one place but always glowing, there was a sort of illuminated grid pattern (hard to explain) but like a rectangle with square dull lights in a grid pattern like a an old fashioned multipaned window is as best as I can describe it. This was evident for only a matter of seconds, when it disappeared the lights started squiggling in a sinuous manner, this they would do as they darted across the top of the clouds, constantly they would appear at the edge of the cloud and sparkle from blue white to an intense amber colour. I left to answer the call of nature, when I came back only one light remained, constantly lit and very bri! ght. The others had (this according to my two adult sons) moved in a wobbling and sinusoidal way out of sight to the south west. The last light remained in place very bright for over ten minutes, it then moved up into the clouds getting fainter until it completely disappeared. I am aware that alot of folks will think that we observed a simple thunderstorm, what we saw has nothing to do with any storm. It was remote from it, intelligent and from what we saw obviously solid in nature. I have seen some of these things many times now, and I am becoming convinced that there is some form of intelligent control of this phenomena.

Education-BA Liberal Studies and an MA in Educ Avid back yard astronmer and ufologist for over 15 years.  This report details the sighting of 3 anomalous objects.Date of report: 6/1/02 Preliminary information: On May 29, at 10:32PM (three days ago), I was at roughly the 6800ft elevation in the California mountains up along highway 108 in California, north of Yosemite past the Dardanelles, near a resort called Kennedy meadows.  We were staying at a private cabin and I was using a 4&quot; refractor telescope and binoculars to view the crystal clear, high country night sky.  It was moderately cool with no haze or weather -- a great night for viewing.There were only two of us.  As we spotted a number of clusters, a couple of distant galaxies and nebula, we also concentrated on counting satellites that silently trekked across the sky.  We also spotted what ostensibly was a military craft flying quite a bit higher than the commercial planes that occasionally went by.  I figured it was military because it flew like a plane but did not display the standard red and green wing tip lights.  this presumed military craft had a single white strobe that blinked about once only every five seconds.  Satellites are uniquely different from other objects in the sky.  They are distinctive since they are small spots of light, obviously very high, even beyond the high-flying military craft and soundless. Satellites also move quickly across the sky and should appear to move more slowly since they are further away, yet due to their high speed, they are still noticeably faster -- orbital velocity is roughly 17,500 mph.  Not all satellites however travel at the same speed -- some seem to be faster than others but this may be attributable to the altitude of their individual orbit -- some are further out into space than others and apparent speed becomes difficult to discern.  They also often change their light intensity since they are so high, reflecting sunlight that shines from far over the horizon.  If they are spinning, they will seem to slowly flicker as their surfaces reflect light in different directions, or their trajectory might not be conducive to good reflectivity of sunlight.  To the best of my knowledge, satellites don&apos;t emit much light of their own; this is something I need to confirm with someone who knows.  The altitudes and trajectories of satellites vary greatly, yet they all share the same features of being small, fast moving, silent points of light, well beyond the altitude of other craft.Sighting details: After spotting over 12 satellites, most travelling in a north to south or south to north orbit, I spotted another.  It was noticeably bright white, more so than most of the other satellites but I didn&apos;t think it unusual since it had virtually all  the features of satellites previously described, with a few exceptions.  I would rate its brightness to be roughly between a magnitude of 3 to 4 (using star magnitude rating). To compare it with something familiar, it was about as bright as the star Orion, (even though I don&apos;t know Orion&apos;s specific magnitude rating).  I noticed the object&apos;s intensity was constant and I thought &quot;this is a good one&quot;, since often times satellites can fade quickly or come in and out of view based upon their reflective properties and surface features.  Again, it was in the same area of the sky that we had spotted many others and nothing seemed odd.However, within about two seconds of spotting it I saw two more flying behind it adjacent to one another.  They were all the exact same intensity and the three formed a perfectly symmetrical triangle.  Their exact position to one another could not be determined due to their distance from me and the effects of parallax, but I quickly went to my scope and was able to spot the lead light.  I was using a high quality 19mm eyepiece that provides about 50x magnification with my scope.  I tracked it briefly then held the scope still.  The following two lights flew right through my field of view.  They were all shaped identical, somewhat like orbs with a slight teardrop shape to them.  I wouldn&apos;t call them disks though.  I wasn&apos;t getting any significant resolution to determine specific details.Their speed was faster than some of the slow satellites we saw earlier in the evening and slower than fast ones.The entire sighting seemed to last about 4 minutes -- longer than usual satellite sightings.  I did have enough time to repeatedly track them using just my eyes, the binoculars (regular 7x35), and my 4&quot; telescope.  My companion also saw the objects both through the binoculars, and with his bare eyes.The formation was perfectly symmetrical in that, they moved as one unit, in the shape of a triangle, however it is important to note that the space between them did not occlude stars behind them as a solid object would do.Therefore, it can be inferred that they were three distinctly separate lights moving together as one, hence, flying in formation.The amount of sky occupied by this formation can be described as such: Hold your arm out at length, close your fist and hold up your thumb (as if you were giving a &quot;thumbs-up&quot; to someone).  Place the lead light on the tip of your thumb and the trailing lights at the base of your thumb and separate the trailing lights by the width of your thumb -- this forms the size and the triangle of their formation.  At the apparent distance of these objects, this would constitute a formation that was considerably wide apart, yet they maintained perfect symmetry from one another and continued that way with the same heading (north to south in this case) throughout the sighting.After they finally moved low enough to the horizon, they became occluded by trees, however it is important to note that they maintained their intensity of white light throughout the entire sighting. The area of the horizon into which they disappeared, was a region that no satellites were spotted.  Every other satellite heading south disappeared long before this area due to lack of direct line of sight with the sun.As we speculated about that which we had seen, we continued to watch for a few more hours until about 3:30am.  We were particularly vigilant for the next 90 minutes after the initial sighting since, if they were satellites, we might have caught a second glimpse and dismissed the event as ordinary satellites -- (they should have reappeared as they orbited the planet once again) -- however, they never reappeared.Are there any &quot;ordinary&quot; satellites that have been placed into a synchronous orbit with one another, so as to move in perfect formation through their orbits? No other unusual lights were seen throughout the rest of the evening or the next night of viewing.End of Report((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was watching what are suspected to be N.O.S.S. satellites, which we believe are launched periodically by the U.

You certainly are a very good witness, and you have reported the event excellent well, I believe. My suspicion is that you may have witnessed the U. S. Navy&apos;s N.O.S.S. satellite trio, which has been reported to our Center since approximately July 1996.  Although the Navy will not talk about them, they were first investigated by Dr. Terence Dickerson, an astronomer (I believe), who writes for the Toronto Star.  He had received many reports of three &quot;satellites,&quot; which appeared to maintain formation over the course of several weeks&apos; time, and which exhibited characteristics of typical man-made satellites. There are many such reports of the phenomenon, which can be seen on our website.  Interestingly, most of the reports seem to be from the summer months. We will post your report in the near future.  Thanks again for sharing the information with our Center! May I forward your report to another investigator, Linda Howe, who has been interested in the phenomenon?? Cordially,Peter((RESPONSE))Dear Mr. Davenport,Thank you for your swift reply.  I knew the sighting was odd, but could not say for certain that they were not satellites.  Thank you for clarifying; it sounds that they may indeed have been the N.O.S.S trio of which you wrote. I would like to know more about them; the mysteries seem to be unending.I noticed that the lead light of this trio had a small protrusion of red light pointing downward towards the horizon.  It was constant, in that it was not flickering, flashing nor did it have any strobe-like modulation in any way, and had no visible means of connection to the main sphere.  However, at such a great distance, I doubt any support structure could be seen, even through my telescope.  I intentionally omitted this aspect from the report since I only caught a brief glimpse of this feature and could not described it with any accuracy other than what I just mentioned.  Yes, you may use my report and/or forward it to Linda Howe -- I am quite familiar with her fine work.  You may also include my contact information thereby allowing her to contact me if she deems necessary.You are an exceptional and dedicated Ufologist and I have had the pleasure of listening to many of your contributions to the Jeff Rense program.  I wish you continued success, and you can be assured I will be listening in the future as I have been for so long.  If I have the fortune to see anything of interest in the future you&apos;ll be the first I contact.  After 15 years of studying the subject and scouring the skies as an amateur astronomer, this recent event is the first legitimate anomalous sighting I&apos;ve ever had.  Hopefully, we&apos;ll have good reason to speak again sometime.best regards,sincerely,((name deleted))((END))", "Low flying square ufo seen over Lemington, England,  passed over twice and had a main beam.My freinds and myself were standing outside playing soccer, when we saw a  squareish object fling towards us at quite a low altitude and quite slowly.It had four lights on the four corners and a main beam like car headlights in front.

It was about 2am and I decided to sit out in a large park overlooking a large part of east vancouver. Looking above stargazing/finishing a can of sprite i noticed 4 stars moving in formation. After a closer look I noticed the outline of a triagle shaped craft. It had 3 brighter lights on the points of the triangle and one dull blue light in the centre. I did believe this to be an airplane or I was just plain going nuts. It lasted for nearly half an hour until i saw the lights spin in an almost 180 degree turn.

PD))", "Hovering light pattern under cloud cover in otherwise clear night skyI had been up late working on an art project and stepped outside to shake off the clay dust that had accumulated.  The flashing light in tthe sky caught my eye, and at first I thought they were spotlights shining up from tbe ground as they do sometimes for movie premiers or grand openings.  I thought it was such a foolish thing to do at 3AM.  The more I watched the more interested I became.  At first I was attracted by the pattern the lights were making, then I realized the lights were not emenating from a completely stationary source, and at about the same time discerned that the beams were not in fact coming up from the ground.  I was sure of this as they were shining through the only cloud I could see in the sky.  the cloud itself was interesting in that it appeared to have a clear though pitch black center and was itself approximately circular shaped.  The lights themselves repeated a pattern; they would efveidently &quot;cluster&quot; (for lack of a better word) around a center slightly forward and to the left of the cloudless center and then would shine or fly outward in four or five different directions, evenly spaced apart, forming a circle.  If the spacing of the lights was any indication of an object behind the clouds, the thing would have been huge!  The more I observed the more certain I was that the beams of light were not seperate from an object, as individual light objects forming a pattern and flying independently, but were from a fixed point though I couldn&apos;t quite track a beam through the clouds.  That could be explained as lights shining down from the bottom of something moving along a &quot;track&quot; and going back to a center point.  I can&apos;t think of an analogy.  I bbecame aware tthat the lights were getting closer and that they could actually be coming from something quite low to the ground.  I got scared and went inside.  But I heard one of my neighbors come home and went out front to the parking lot and pointed the lights out to him.  We watched them for a few minutes and he said he had seen them! before, that they were a secret government project &quot;designed to make us look crazy&quot;., mind you he&apos;d been drinking, so I don&apos;t know what to make of his comment.  I looked up again and the lights had again shifted towards the side of the building that the parking lot is on and seemed to be coming closer.  I again went inside.  I was scared an excited and ddidn&apos;t know what to think.  The only thing I could hear when I was outside were crickets, absolutely nothing else until my neighbor&apos;s car pulled in.  I realized my cats were still outside and stepped out one more time, it was still there and this time started moving closer right away and was almost directly overhead.  That really shook me up.  I debated calling the police or the news but didn&apos;t want to sound like a nut.  I was afraid that by the time anyone offical checked it out it would be long gone, it had already been there for at least a half hour.  This time I went on my computer and instant mesaged a freind that had come on line and told her what I was seeing.  After 15 minutes I decided to look and see if it was still there.  It was gone, so was the cloud, and the night was suddenly warm whereas before it been decidely chilly even though the weather forecast had called for a relatively warm night (finally).  I seem to recall reading something about ufos creating clouds but couldn&apos;t find any descriptions that matched what I saw.  Especially the distinctive pattern of lights.  They were all white, no other colors.  So are there any logical explanations other than a UFO?  Are these the nice ones or the meanies?  Should I step out and greet them the next time?  If there is?((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM SAME SOURCE, SUBMITTED JULY 27, 2002))Previous report and update plus one several years agoI reported the sighting already on 5/28/2002.  I wanted to request further information.  I really am curious to see if anyone else has reported anything similar to what I saw.  I&apos;m not convinced it was a craft but for the fact that the light couldn&apos;t have been traveling through the cloud from the ground, I would have seen the light path as it passed through.  Secondly the circular clound surrounding the event and the chill as well as the silence and then the sudden disappearance (though I didn&apos;t witness it leave) convince me that this was more than just an average light or cloud.  If not a UFO what else could it have been?  I was being facetious about the alien contact comment.  It was late and I was rather ashamed of myself for getting so scared.  I&apos;ve looked through numerous entries on you site and others and haven&apos;t found anything quite like it.  And though I distinctly remember reading something about UFO&apos;s hiding in circular clouds I cannot find anything confirming this.  There are numerous UFO sightings in the Tacoma/Lakewood area.  One night several years ago my daughter, a ffriend and I saw lights streaking across the sky betweem Tacoma and Puyallup, then they hovered and took off again, we all agreed it could not have been a plane and that was confirmed when we listened to the rradio, numerous people called the station and saw what we saw.  Interestingly even though we are near an airforce and army base there were no aircraft in pursuit.  We see planes all the time in this area, of all types.  This did not appear to be a plane.  So though a long time skeptic, I&apos;m becoming a believer.  Aliens?  I don&apos;t know, but I&apos;d love to find out.  As long as I knew I was safe that is.", "Five circular bluish-white objects moving north to south, 3 first followed by two more in a vertical pattern.On the evening of Saturday July 6, 2002 at about 9:45 pm 3 objects were seen traveling in a nearly vertical pattern (the topmost of the three was lagging a slight amount).  They were moving from north to south at an inclination of about 35 degrees from the horizontal.  There was no sound heard, they stayed in the same relative position to one another as they traveled across the sky.  Their size was hard to determine, if a star were 1/8 inch, these were about an inch and a 1/4.  Their color was a bluish white with a brighter halo about 1/16 inch (using the same relative sizing) of a brighter and bluer color.  They moved southerly and then seemed to go further east and upward until they were lost to sight.  A glance to the north found two more identical objects which followed the same trajectory as the first three.", "May 5, 2002 on a ranch about 15 miles south of Sand Springs, a 2400 pound bull worth $2,000 was found in a shallow crater not far from the water trough. His owner, Fritz Morrison had been at the water pump at 12:30 p.m. and his bull was laying beside the trough chewing his cud, seemingly well and content along with several cows. But when Fritz returned only three hours later at 3:30 to do more work at the pump, he found the bull dead, stiff and the left eye had been removed and was &quot;bubbling&quot; moistness from it. Fritz then returned home to retrieve a chain to pull the animal away from the side of the road so as he wouldn&apos;t have to look at it as he drove by each day. When he returned around 5:00 or 5:30, he found that a complete mutilation had occured on the dead bull while he was gone. The tongue had been excised deep within the throat, the testicles and shaft had been bloodlessly removed leaving penis stretched out on the ground, and the rectum was cored out. One ear was also missing. Three days later, Keith Bumpass, Deputy Sheriff of the Lake County Oregon Sheriff&apos;s Office was contacted and an investigation was launched. Keith was put in contact with Dr. W.C. Levengood of BLT Research, a consultant for OUFOR. Dr.Levengood suggested looking on the animal for signs of small dark particles of dried blood. Although the bull was black, the Deputy Sheriff found a small amount around the rear of the animal. Those samples were sent to Dr.Levengood in Michigan and the results of the preliminary tests are that they are probably pure hemoglobin particles, indicating a processing of the blood had taken place during the mutilation process. Bovine Hemoglobin is a component of blood. The presence of hemoglobin indicates that a processing of the whole blood has occurred. The usual procedure for isolating hemoglobin from whole blood is rather complex. It involves separating red blood corpuscles from the lighter plasma components by centrifugation. The plasma is siphoned off and ether is added to the corpuscle paste, causing the cells to burst. Another centrifugation removes the ruptured cell envelopes and leaves a clear red solution of hemoglobin. With mutilated cows, every other component of the blood is totally disintegrated with the exception of the hemoglobin. It&apos;s turned into its elemental form. Assistant Director Eric Byler of OUFOR spoke with Deputy Sheriff Keith Bumpass the morning of May 21st and it now appears a second cow has been found. The Deputy Sheriff found the animal the day before and went out to take pictures and further investigate. He said that it appears that the animal had been dead for several weeks and it was thought that it probably went down around the same time as the first animal back on May 5, 2002. The cow also had all of the signs of a classic cattle mutilation including the tongue surgically removed at the base of the throat, the utters missing and the rectum cored out. Cattle mutilation expert and OUFOR investigator Jean Bilodeaux has been notified and will be workin! g closely with the Sheriff&apos;s department on further cattle finds in this area of South Eastern Oregon. Byler was also in contact with Colm Kelleher of The National Institute for Discovery Sciences and a top priority of securing a veterinarian to contract out with NIDS was discussed.  The owner has agreed to turn over any future Bovine to OUFOR that is found and verified as being alive 24 hours or less before being found. The animal will be brought back to Salem for extensive necropsy work as paid for and contracted out through NIDS. As a side note, we at OUFOR are very pleased and appreciative of the combined cooperative efforts of the many outstanding organizations who have come together to work this case as it unfolds. Those organizations include the exceptional data gathering talents of Linda Moulton Howe, Colm Kelleher of The National Institute for Discovery Sciences, Dr. W.C. Levengood of BLT Research, cattle mutilation expert and OUFOR team member Jean Bilodeaux, and most of all the work done by Keith Bumpass, Deputy Sheriff of the Lake County Oregon Sheriff&apos;s Office who took the incentive to ask all the right questions and sent samples to the right places. We look forward to working with this talented investigator for Lake County in case of future animal mutilations that may come within the next few months.

I began to notice that a certain cluster of stars i was trying to patternize were not cooperating. From then i observed that there were specificly 3 &quot;stars&quot; that were in motion. they moved at different speeds and didn&apos;t appear to make any specific pattern in their movement but stayed within a certain area. i went inside to look for my binoculers for a better look. it did seem that the quickest one was &quot;in-charge&quot; and the next quickestwas withit but the one that moved fairly slow didn&apos;t seem to fit in but the other kind of gave it space and yet didn&apos;t go to far from it. the binoculars didn&apos;t help much but the lights seemed to all be in a &quot;teardrop&quot; or &quot;triangular&quot; shape.They stayed in sight for about the next 20 minutes and then quickly took off. they seemed to move in a blurred speed and motion but they also seemed to go in slightly different directions and then head the same way.i also notice a slight change in color as they sped away,they now seemed to be an almost redish-orange like if they were burning. I tried to take a grip of what i had seen considering i hadn&apos;t been drinking or anything and wasn&apos;t tired. I never saw them again but do feel strongly about what i have seen considering that a couple months later i was watching the show sighting and a man had video taped a similar occurence in another state.i also checked with the local weather station to see if there were any reports of a metor encounter but they told me that there was no weather report of any metors to have ben seen at that time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I just remember my friend and I being outside (this happened about 5 years ago) and there was a big white flash in the sky, definitely not lighting, so we looked up and immediately saw a giant white streak go across the sky. Unlike a shooting star, the tail remained and slowly faded away. There was the flash, a shooting and then the thick and bright white tail that lasted a good 10-15 seconds before disappearing. We didn&apos;t really see any particular shape, but it was definitely not lighting followed by an asteroid. It was much larger and slower than something burning up in the atmosphere.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The flash was reminiscent of a comet image.  It moved in a direction from south to north (left to right) at an incredibly rapid rate.  The sky was cloudless, and the weather warm.  I was driving about 70 mph in the middle lane, with a tractor trailer truck driving 5+ car lengths ahead of me.  The flash surprised me, and I hit my brakes as did the truck in front of me.  I began searching the sky for any indication of the object, or flash, but found none.  I simply witnessed this flash of brilliant light.  It appeared to me to be too &quot;thick&quot; to be lightening.  It also moved more horizontally than anything else, but again was headed north and angled slightly towards the sky.  After the flash, I saw nothing else. Having seen both man made, weather and astonomical natural phenomena before, I can safely say that this did not appear to be like anything I have ever seen.  If I were to wager a guess, I would say that the streak was perhaps 100-500 feet off the ground, and perhaps 1 - 10 miles away.  It moved at a rate that no man-made object that I am aware of could possibly reach.  I am assuming that the reaction of the truck in front of me, hitting the brakes when I did, and slowing down, was due to the same occurance.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There are 2 instances that night while shooting a local commercial spot (I&apos;m not sure of the exact date by the way.)  One video clip shows a very small cigar shaped object similar to one I&apos;ve seen in other video clips. It is maybe one inch long or so and pops into the frame at what seems to be around 60 in/sec (2 or so in into the frame if measured from the bottom, may have come from the top.)  Unfortunately this sighting is only one frame long (1/30 sec.) as it is the last frame of the shot.The second one is a little bit more valid.  As I was going frame by frame in another clip to find where I wanted to cut it I found one frame with what seemed at first to be a pair of headlights in a window reflection until it dawned on me that it was only one frame of video.  There were two very small round objects about 1/2 - 3/4 in apart apparently white in color.  What I found strange was that 1 sec 8 frames later the same two round objects, the same distance apart flashed again only for one frame about 6 inches or so away and once again 1 sec. 7 frames later about another 6 inches, traveling left to right across the screen before disappearing into the lights.  there are a total of three one frame (1/30 sec) flashes with a definite trajectory all equal in time and distance apart. The objects also stay the same ditance apart from each other. The rate of travel is not very fast (less than 1 foot/sec)so my guess is that these are very small spheres of light emitted from something even smaller than they are.  These spheres are too small to show any kind of detail even with a pro quality camera.((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to submit still images to NUFORC, and we will attempt to identify them.

The ufo flew to the left in a straight line for about 10-30 seconds, then went up, left two black marks in the sky which looked like skid marks, and completely disappeared. We sat there amazed and asking each other exactly what the other saw. About five minutes later we heard the same noise in the distance. It got louder and we looked back to see a futuristic-looking car flying over the trees not too far away. It was very close and you could see it&apos;s details easily. It was blue, had white headlights, and blue and red lights (the same color as the diamonds).. Also there was a weird oval around it that was transparent. A force field or something I assume. It flew very slow as we watched it go past the lake, a tree strangely bending over, then bending back up, on the other side as it passed over it.

I was headed north towards Springfield, MO and was very close to the MO border. The sun was setting and the craft was in shadow at the northern edge of a field below me. The beam of light turned into the visible exhaust of an engine. As the craft ascended vertically the rocket-shaped object turned north-northeast so that I could see that the engine emitting exhaust was a central engine surrounded by five or six other engines that were firing intermittently. The craft seemed to be a mat black in that as it got to tree top level (and was flying horizontally by this time) the sun did not reflect on it at all--even though the sun was SW of me and the rocket was north. It had been standing upright at the edge of the field and as it rose it turned on it&apos;s side and also rotated slowly. I could see, as it turned, that it had no FAA regulation lights or markings of any kind. The only lights on it were small white non-strobe placed at various points so I could determine the shape of the whole object.It flew over the trees and disappeared beyond them traveling very slowly--between 20 and 40 mph it seemed--moving in a NE direction.I noticed the time--it was between 5 and 6 pm. I did not &quot;lose&quot; any time. There was no traffic on this stretch of the road even though there was before and after the sighting. There were houses up on a ridge to the right of me and I saw no one observing from any of the houses. I checked my engine--it was on--but everything was quiet enough to realize the craft had made no noise whatsoever.As I drove on to Springfield, hoping to stop in time for the 10 o&apos;clock news, there was one &quot;report&quot; on the radio when I heard a woman call in to a sports talk show on AM and ask for advice to reporting the sighting of the craft. She was agitated and confused and the host and guest on the show (talking about the Houston Atsrodome) did not know what to say. After some silence, the host reminded her that she had called in to a sports talk show and asked if she had a question about the dome. When she said &apos;no&apos; he put her off the air.I arrived in my motel room at 10 pm and watched the news [I don&apos;t recall the station Id. any longer] and the very last piece was a video a farmer had sent in that evening that showed the craft flying over his field. While the anchors laughed and joked about the video, they relayed that the farmer has said that he was doing some night plowing and he jumped off his tractor when it seemed the craft was so low it might fly into the tractor. The video showed the same object I saw still flying slowly and horizantally in an east-north east direction. The anchors reported that the object had been seen along the Arkansas and Missouri border that evening [and a few other states that I no longer recall]. However, when the station checked with the nearest military base they were told that radar had detected nothing and that what people were probably seeing was lights from the burning debris of a Soviet satellite that was re-entering the atmosphere.It was quite obvious from my observation and the video that what we saw was not any kind of satellite and that no satellite [that looked like a rocket?] would have been able to fly above treetop level, below radar, maintain a constant speed and not crash anywhere. The debris from the actual satellite burned up upon entering the atmoshpere, was miles up in the night sky and looked momentarily like a falling star--as reported by other news sources.", "I was in the park one night. I go here every night with my friends. It was just like every other night but most people went in early, which was strange. There was only me and 2 other friends left. We talked for a while. After 15 minutes had passed I noticed something up in the sky, as we were looking at the stars. At first we thought it was an airplane or some kind of air transport, so we took a closer look. The craft moved silently down from the sky. It was very high up and moved far too quickly to be a plane. It stopped, and then moved around a bit more. We could now see that it was an oval shape and had blue and red lights round it. Out of nowhere another craft appeared, the same as the other one. They way it moved explained that it couldn&apos;t be any kind of our air transport. The two crafts stopped and hovered. They started flashing to each other; it looked like a kind of Morse code. Suddenly a beam of light shot between them both. It only lasted a fraction of a second. A third craft appeared. It also moved about a bit then sped of at a high speed until it got so fast we could not see it. The second craft did the same. We watched the first craft carefully as it zigged-zagged across the sky. It moved in a triangle shaped then moved quickly across the sky, accelerating as it went, then disappeared. We didn&apos;t know what to say to each other. We all decided to go home our separate ways. When I reached home, 10 mins later, my brother was in. He thought something was wrong, as I was as pale as a ghost. I explained and he believed me because I wrote down what happened and drew a picture of where the crafts were, my friends also did this and the stories matched. I didn&apos;t think much off it until a week later. My dad was sat in the car listening to the radio. When I got into the car he said there had just been a special on UFO&apos;s as people had been phoning in all week with sightings all over the area. I phone up and explained what I saw. The next day there was a report in the newspaper. I thought, great, It wasn! &apos;t just me that had seen them. A few days later there was another article in the newspaper saying that the things that everyone saw were meteorites! Bullshit! I thought. Since when did meteors have blue and red lights and can control which direction they go in, and hover and move around in circles. I don&apos;t care what anyone else says. I know what I saw. I will tell anyone who wants to know about it. As they say. Seeing is believing((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to obtain the newspaper article the witness alludes to.  PD))((NUFORC Note:  This is one of a flurry of reports we received from Ventura County, CA, following three telephone calls we received on May 18, 2002, from a raucous student party.  The reports seemed to us to be not convincing at the time of the call, a fact which we shared with the callers.  Shortly afterwards, approximately a dozen reports were submitted from that area.  We have no way of confirming any of these reports.  PD))", "i was at a trailer park by the edge of the K hill call the K hill because it has a K on it for kanab. I was getting my 7 month old son out of his car seat I just happened to look up towards the K hill and I saw this enormouse green ball of some what looking flames. But yet the green coming offf this ball left behind light pink trails .I have seen objects in the night sky before that I had no explantation of. But this one I was so close to I watched it land ,crash, fall not exactly sure, but it looked like it went right into the K hill. After it desapaired I jumped in my car I had to go tell someone what I had seen and see if they saw it to. I dont know how thw whole town didnt seeit . The next day I was talking with this guy who worked with my husband. I told him about what I had seen the night before. He began telling me that his sister and some of her friends where up in angel canyon which is about 41/2 miles away from Kanab. He proceeded to tell me that his sister had seen this enormogreen light, ball ufo whatever you want to call it", "it was a large triangular objectI was driving home when a dark triangular object flew past me (going extremely fast)it had about 3 orange lights on it.

PD))", "It was a clear night, the fireball was huge and you could almost hear a rumbling. It shot across the sky from left to right at an incredible speed. It was most definitely on fire. The shape was quite round and there was a thick, very grey smoke with deep orange flames all around it almost like a volcano eruption. As it sped across the sky it broke up into about 8 pieces with one larger piece continuing it&apos;s journey where it disapeared as we could no longer see it. We all saw it very clearly, none of us had ever seen anything like this before.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

One of the lights maneuvered erratically as they moved across the sky at a high rate of speed.  The formatin steadied and the lights disappeared to the north west. Because we are adjacent to DFW airport we are accustomed to seeing aircraft at night.  These lights were not like any of the aircraft lights observed in the past.  My wife was the first to notice and called me outside to observe.", "Oval object accidentally photographed with APPARENTLY large antenna on one side and fighter jet slung beneathThe &quot;Antenna ship&quot;  Hello, Has anyone seen an object like this? Attached are two scans of a photo of a bizarre object I unknowingly (at the time) photographed. I wouldn&apos;t have noticed the object except for a relative (who has better close up vision) pointing it out to me.PLACE: Ryazan, Russia, c 250km SE from Moscow.DATE &amp; TIME: May 9th 2001, c 9:00 (May 9th is the &quot;Day of Victory&quot; over NAZI Germany holiday in Russia, as this photo was being taken Ryazan&apos;s military were preparing for their parade. Ryazan is Russia&apos;s West Point or Sandhurst) PHOTOGRAPHY INFO: Kodacolor Plus 200ISO film with full automatic camera focussed on the tree below the object (i.e. at infinity).The lighting is sharply from the left, from the morning sun on a clear, Spring day.PHOTO BACKGROUND: Taken from the 1st floor (1st above ground floor) bedroom window of a flat in Ryazan.The block of apartments on the left is about 15 stories high.SCAN 1: Highest magnification scan I can achieve. This is a 600DPI scan of an enlargement I got at the local photo shop. Zoom out about three times to see it clearly. I have tried to get some more detail using Paint Shop Pro&apos;s photo enhancement tools to enhance contrast.SCAN 2: the full frame original photo scanned in at 200DPI.OBSERVATIONS ABOUT OBJECT: I could not say either the distance or altitude of the object from the photo. It appears to be stationery. For what it MAY have been doing hanging there see NOTES ON MY LIFE below.However IF that is a MiG31 / F15 size fighter slung underneath (see below), then the craft is about 25-30 meters from &quot;prow&quot; to stern, and would be about a kilometer away. This would put it over another residential area of Ryazan.I have seen many photos of UFOs but nothing like this. This is a very odd object, and to my amateur eye looks like either a HUMAN device or an alien / human hybrid device.I say that because of the large antenna dish apparent on the right hand side. That just looks very terrestrial tech to me. This dish would also be incredibly un-aerodynamic. There may be another on the right of the high dome (above the command center with windows?) at top of the craft.I cannot see how the craft could travel at any speed with these large dishes hanging out unless a) the dishes could be retracted during flight or b) the craft utilizes some form of trans-dimensional drive or c) it just flies very slowly.Also there APPEARS to be a twin finned military fighter jet slung beneath the object (!) like a MiG31 or U.S. equivalent.Note the ship like &quot;prow&quot; on the craft and the bump above that which reminds me of the active sonar array on the prow of some submarines.In the 200DPI scan a light &quot;aura&quot; is visible around the craft. I only have &quot;High Color&quot; on my PC and can&apos;t say if this is an artifact.I can&amp;#8217;t help but wonder that IF this is a human piloted craft, whether it is being run by Russians (it is on their territory, but I have suffered &quot;phenomena&quot; that may be associated with this craft in many other countries), or if it is being run by Americans, doing a test of their ability to &quot;penetrate&quot;  Russian airspace &amp; influence people in that country with the phenomena listed below.NOTE ON MY LIFE &amp; RELEVANCE to this PHOTO: To my conscious knowledge I only once SAW a UFO from the outside with my own eyes on one occasion prior to photographing this, but that was during a period when I didn&apos;t WANT to believe in any such thing and I went inside ignoring it, possibly under a form of mind control.My son and ex-wife had seen UFOs of the saucer type and also a sharp, black, isosceles triangular craft in the years before this picture was taken near my flat.I was the subject of an abduction experience when I was six years old. Prior to this I was a very happy, lucky and socially successful person.My memory of the abduction experience is one of being taken to a round &quot;theatre&quot; like room by a strange, large, being from my bed in our family holiday house. I felt an intense EVIL from the being who abducted me, and a projection of that evil onto me, such as some assaulters project on to their victims.There were several other similar aliens in the craft. I have no memory of physical examinations. But I do remember they &quot;judged&quot; me and came to some decision about me.&gt;From that night on I suddenly lost all my good friends. Many were physically taken away. From then on I have lived under a regimen of: constant, strict isolation. The only relationships I am allowed are negative, painful or abusive towards me; despite coming from a very well off family I have been forced to live in poverty, always about 10% below subsistence no matter what I do.People associated with me are subject to mind control that puts the most awful negative ideas in their heads about me. Those who resists this and wants to be with me is PHYSICALLY removed by various means, often involving third parties interfering.I have continued to live for the interests that I had from before the abduction: studying the meaning of life and working to help humanity. It is something of a family tradition coming through my father.WHAT IS RELEVANT TO THIS PICTURE is that during the year before this craft was inadvertently taken, I and the two other occupants of that flat in Ryazan, were subjected to a massive program of attacks: direct energy attacks, such as uncontrollable itching, attacks of needles all over the body, uncontrollable coughing with no infection, incredibly disturbed digestion (including constant flatulence), extreme knife like headaches  just for starters.I never experienced such a &quot;full spectrum attack&quot; since the months after I had left my original home at age 18, several decades ago. That was in another continent away from Russia.I HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THESE ATTACKS, just not as concentrated as when I was 18 and in Ryazan, IN EVERY CONTINENT (except Africa and South America where I haven&apos;t been). These attacks have followed me wherever I have gone around the world.I have been assessed by numerous psychological experts and they can find no abnormalities of the mind, except evidence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from the horror I have faced since I was six. I am now middle aged and my health is very badly affected.POSSIBLY identifying this bizarre craft may shed some light on what has been plaguing my life for so long.All the best to all who seek the truth,((NUFORC Note:  Both photos forwarded to NUFORC look like a black splotch in the sky.  The photos are ambiguous, we feel.  PD))", "Check this meteor out!I was helping my wife but mostly keeping her company while hanging clothes   she had washed. My kids were outside also. I love to search the heavens and   look at stars and planets. What I believe I saw this night was either a meteor   or an asteroid. Nothing uncommon about that except.. It was pretty darn big.Later that week I read in the newspaper that we had a close shave with an asteroid.    The paper described it as being 120 yards big and got as close as 75,000 miles   which would be a third of the way to the moon. There is no way my eyes could have   seen that. If I held a nickle at arms length above my head that is how big this   meteor or asteroid would have been. The shape of it was kind of squarish at the tail side. the way I saw the shape was of the greenish color that you would see   as in shooting star. But this was pretty faint. As though it was barely skimming the atmosphere. Which is what, ten miles? As soon as I saw it I pointed towards it and said, excitedly, LOOK LOOK LOOK trying to point it out to my family.    And it was gone that quick. If this was indeed an asteroid how big was it? Did anybody pick this one out?    Was I the only one who saw this? I pretty sure I know what I saw!

I was looking out my bedroom window when I saw a white light streak accross the sky. At first I though it was a meteor because I see them all the time, but I knew what it was when it blinked out and then suddenly blinked back on. It did this three times, in perfect rythym before disappearing over the horizon. It was bright enough to be one of the jets that circles over from the Air National Guard in Martinsburg, however those jets don&apos;t go as fast as this object was going and it made absolutely no sound. It couldn&apos;t have been a meteor because, obviously, they don&apos;t blink out and then suddenly blink back on. It was moving in an east/southeast to west/northwest direction.OK, backround on me.

The craft&apos;s disappearance from the sky was like a blurr.In June of 1957, I was an eleven year old and playing softball at a local El Paso, Tx southside park.  It gets hot in El Paso, Texas, so we started the game around 9:00a.m.  I had been designated to play shortstop and therefore was facing North towards the local Franklin Mountains (part of the Rocky Mountain chain).This was a beautiful clear day with no clouds whatsover.  At approxiately 10:00 a.m. as we were out on the field, I  was distracted by a huge flying craft that &quot;hovered&quot; momentarily over the southern tip of the Franklin Mountains.  This circular disk was metalic and stopped in mid-air for about 2 or 3 seconds.  The craft had flown in from the Northeast area of El Paso.  After stopping in mid-air, the craft departed from the mid-air stop and disappeared in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds into the Northwest sky of El Paso.The game was finished around 11:00a.m. and I did not tell any of my playmates about the flying object.  The whole episode seemed so unrealistic!  As I started walking home after the game, I noticed an Army Green Weather Ballon flying from the Northeast part of El Paso.  The Northeast El Paso area houses parts of Fort Bliss (Army base), McGregor Range (missle testing grounds, and further north of these installations, White Sands Proving Grounds (missile testing grounds), and Holloman Air Force Base.  Even as an eleven year old kid, I knew that I had seen a &quot;flying craft&quot; that others more mature than myself had also witnessed.I had never publicly acknowledged this incident, however, 3-4 years ago, I saw a movie called &quot;Independence Day&quot;.  The huge mother ship in the movie resembled the flying craft in appeareance only.  The size of what I saw  was not that big.

As we both watched the object move, it appeared to have stopped; almost like it knew we were watching it. It then appeared to have stopped moving in that direction (west to east) and it appeared stationary; however a few moments later, the craft which I will say had a hull of a hover craft and a canopy of a stealth fighter, was hovering about 5 to 10 feet above the water, at a distance of 100 feet. It had white lights around the perimeter of the hull and made a horrific constant sound that I cannot even describe.

The object appeared transparent, but had points of red lights on corners of object (maybe 8-10 lights).  Not sure if they were blinking.  The object was moving very slowly, emitting no sound whatsoever.  We commented about the fact that we could see through the object.  Nothing solid.  Almost like a group of toothpicks put together with pin-points of red lights on each connection.  The object may have been less than 1000&apos; high.  Hard to tell, but it was definitely not a formation of several objects higher in the sky.  This was very low in the sky.  I reported it to the Sheriff&apos;s department and they denied any other reports.  In 2001, another man described having seen the same object that night, and described it the same way to us.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two reports from same source.  Please see other report from Ocala, FL, for 23DE87.  PD))", "triangular object with a light in each corner traveled soundless across the skyThis object was observed briefly as I was watching the stars with my bare eyes during a cloudless night (Approx 22:30). As I was looking at a blinking star vertically above my head, I picked up a shape mooving South west to North east. The object covered about half the sky during it&apos;s travel in about 4 to 5 seconds. It was more or less following the ST-Laurence river at about a mile from the shore.My first impression was of a plane at low altitude since it travelled quite rapidly (more common at low altitude about 1000 ft). The unusual shape and lack of sound convinced me that it was not a plane (I&apos;ll talk later about the shape).Then I tought it could be a few large birds. Again I could not see any wing moovement and at that time of night large birds do not fly in my area.The shape of the object was triangular with the tree corners glowing. The glow was 3 circular lights and were not bright. The glow from the light (not blinking) was not at the tip of the triangle but slightly inside. The object had no contrast or defined edges. I could tell it was triangular because the shape sometimes overlapped the surrounding stars (during it&apos;s travel) revealing the shape. Basically the dark triangular object with glowing circles travelled smoothly without a sound.The object travelled smoothly without stopping in the night.The size of the object was hard to define since it was not very bright and I did not know at what altitude it travelled. Hold 2 fingers one inch apart and hold your hand above your head, This was the approximate size of my observation of the object.I work in the aircraft industry and I know a lot about them. This object could not have been a plane of the sort I know.Thanks for reading my strange sighting.", "Observed two lights moving fast and near miss to aircraftWhile sitting on my back porch, I observed a single light with the brightness equal to that of Jupiter on a southwest to northeast track. The light was a blue-white light, like a star or planet. There was no sound. I followed the light until it was obscured from view by trees. Compared to commercial aircraft that fly over my house, on a southeast to northwest track normally, this object appeared to fly about twice as fast. Also, there was no strobe activity, and it seemed to be lower in altitude than commercial aircraft that fly over. Approximately 10 minutes later, I observed a commercial aircraft on a northwest to southeast track, with strobes flashing. What appeared to be above, and on a perpendicular track, was a single light similar to the one I saw earlier, only not as bright. The dim light actually intersected the path of the commercial craft, but it seemed at a higher altitude. I also followed this light until it was obscured by trees.", "Shining sphere speeds accross sky towards Southeast.I was laying on a hammock in the back yard watching hawks circling overhead when I saw a bright, shining sphere moving Southeast at great speed. I got up to watch the object and was able to see it until it went behind a house on the hill behind Me.There was no visible trail and no sound from the craft as far as I could tell. The whole incident lasted about 45 seconds.Approximatly 2 years ago, Myself, my 2 sons and three people next door witnessed a similar object stationary in the sky just South of the airport. This sighting was verified by a friend that worked at air traffic control tower at the airport. He said they had been tracking this object for three days.", "Small red and white light travelling in odd directions.I wrote this down on August 25/95, but noted that it was &quot;a few nights ago&quot; so I&apos;m guessing early in the morning of the 23rd.  I was looking out into my backyard, and a large red light, with a smaller white one (neither flashing), slowly travelled from the west to the east.  After coming into my view, it passed behind some buildings (about half a kilometer away), then seemed to be travelling north, stopping (from my point of view) behind a tree in my backyard.  It immediately reappeared from behind the tree and travelled back the way it came, repeating this 4 or 5 times.  It wasn&apos;t making any noise, and didn&apos;t seem to be moving in any way that a plane would move.  It was travelling about as fast as you&apos;d expect a plane to travel, though.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I saw 3 stars move and fly into deep spaceI was on a mountain looking for a cabin. I was low on gas. I decided to turn back.Before going off the mountain I was amazed by how beautiful the sky looked. I got out of my Chevy Blazer and climbed on the roof to lay back for a few and check out the sky. The stars were beautiful. I stoped on a certin star to look at it. There were all kinds of stars in the sky but I stoped at this certin one. The star had a few stars about the same size around it. All at once the stars around the one I was looking at started to move. They moveed to gether but not perfect. They moved down away from the one I stoped on. They continued to move for about a minute and one of them broke away from the others and flew into another sorounding star. It looked like they were flying in a triangle pattern. They looked like they were far into space with the stars that didnt move. Eventualy the other 2 went deeper into space and vanished. I know they had to go deeper because thier light slowly dimmed until they were not visible to the eye. I now no there is life in space.. or angels...The reason I say angels is because I prayed to God that he would show me somthing in the sky that night and 1 min later, I saw those stars move if they are stars.Today is the 28th its 230 in the morning. Yesterday or last night. I saw it agian.This time I saw one of them it lasted for about 30 sec. It vanished also. I am trying to conceve what I saw. Its hard to accept but I have to. I seen it with my own eyes. I am a smart sain person and Believe in GOD and Jesus. I have no reason to lie and cant profit from this in anyway. There is no record of what I saw. nobody will be able to say that what ever I saw that night and the night after wasn&apos;t real. It was so amazing! I am so happy now. It confuses me because I didnt belive that there was life other than whats on earth. If anybody was looking in the same spot I was, with or without a telescope they must have said something or seen something. Take it from me and believe that we are not alone in some shape or fashion.Those thing were alive and bright as a star.

About 50 feet from the road. The craft was about 40 feet across. It had flat sides that were about 4 feet thick.. and looked to be made of metal, a dark none-metalic looking in color, with a lot of tubes and stuff all over it. There were three bright white lights, one on each corner, with a bright silver metalic colored ring around each light that was spinning. The rings had slits in them. There was a small red light in the middle that floated down to the ground and back up. There was a strong blowing wind or breeze.. but no sound at all. Other people were pulling off the side of the road to watch it. We left as soon as we discovered that it wasn&apos;t anything we&apos;d ever seen before. I was only 17 years old, and my boyfriend at the time was 20, it scared as to death. The next day it was on the local radio.((NUFORC Note:  Date in March 1984 is approximate.

Two of us watched as a &apos;star&apos; began to move erratically, first in one direction, then another, then would stop, then move again, in a small pattern of triangular motion. After a few minutes of this activity, the light moved away quickly, accelerating at enormous speed and disappeared over the horizon. The entire event was maybe four minutes.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate.  PD))", "Whisper quiet hovering craft.I saw lights flying in the same direction as the van i was driving, but about 2 miles to my right.  They got closer to me as i approached the town, and we met just about 100 yards into the first street of the town, opposite a golf course.  The craft hovered above a row of trees adjacent to the main road, so I stopped and got out.  What amazed me most was the lack of noise, with just a very light motor noise similar to a hairdrier or vacuum cleaner, but at 2am I expected it to be more of a disturbance.  My experience of attending airshows as a photographer meant that I was aware of helicopter noise and other aircraft noises.  It was a year later that I first stood near a Harrier vertical take-off fighter jet, and the noise was deafening.  That&apos;s when I knew I had seen something spectacular.  I did not report this sighting, indeed I have told only a few close friends for fear of being ridiculed, but I feel that your site is for serious reporting so I am entrusting this to you.  The date I entered is approximate as I am unsure, but it was definitely early hours Sunday morning and definitely summer 1977 between March and June when I drove the vehicle I mentioned.  Most likely May sometime.  Visually it was difficult to tell shape because all I could make out were four lights arranged in either a square or a cross depending on what the body of the craft actually was.  It hovered at about 200 feet, a height I estimated from being about 4 times the height of the trees, and I estimated them at 50 feet being the exact height of the local rugby football club goalposts.  After about ten minutes, the craft seemed to edge away slowly in the direction it had come, and then accelerated to a fantastic speed back in the direction of the local airport about 10 miles away.  I racked my brains to think what type of craft it could be, and at that time my best guess was a Harrier fighter jet until I saw my first one in the flesh a year later.  What I saw was not a Harrier, not a helicopter and not any type of aircraft I hav! e ever seen in time as a photographer at airshows or a member of Air Training Corps on Royal Air Force trips.((NUFORC Note:  Date in summer 1977 is approximate.

At first glance it seemed like an airplane but the more I looked at it, the more I kept thinking that it was something else.The object was EXTREMELY high in altitude and was moving at a great rate of speed.  Much different then an airplane would move in the sky, and much higher then I had even seen any aircraft.  There was no noise, no jet sounds, no sonic booms, just this object traveling in a straight line.  It had 3 colored lights, red white and green.  These lights from left to right would alternate flashes.

I noticed three white lights that looked like big stars, but they were way too low to be stars. They were in the fog, about ocean level, so I thought they were three ships. Then they seemed to go away and come back, which I attributed to fog. It was weird because the lights didn&apos;t fade in and out with the fog. So I started paying attention since I see UFOs now that deliberately look and I know what to look for. Then the one on the left silently took off in a zigzag to the left at about 150 MPH, which is something boats can&apos;t do. The other two just vanished a few minutes later. It&apos;s okay to watch them when they&apos;re there, but when they disappear that means they could be sneaking up to abduct me, so that&apos;s when I hide.

We had passed Moss Hill and were traveling toward Cleveland.  I noticed a white &apos;strobe&apos; light through the tops of the trees North of the Hwy.  I just thought it was a radio tower strobe, and didn&apos;t pay much attention to it.  Then I noticed that with one of the &apos;strobe&apos; flashes there were about 6-8 bright lights &apos;attached&apos; to the main &apos;strobe&apos; part extending in an arched pattern (like 1/2 of a parabola: from 0,0 to 3,6).  I thought it was strange, but continued to think it was a radio tower.  I didn&apos;t even wake my daughter up.  The next time the &apos;strobe&apos; lit, I didn&apos;t see the &apos;tentacle&apos; lights.  Then on the 3rd or 4th strobe, the tentacle lights were there again, but this time they were vertical to the main &apos;strobe&apos; light.  I thought this was odd, so I kept watching it.  Also, the &apos;strobe&apos; was directly in front of the road, not behind the trees.  I could see it without any interference from the trees.  I still thought it was a tower.  A few more &apos;strobes&apos; and then the &apos;tentacle&apos; lights were visible again- this time arched to the left of the main &apos;strobe&apos;(again, 1/2 of a parabola: -3,6 to 0,0).  The main strobe was now located to the left (SW) of the Hwy.  I began to think this was odd because (1) I was driving at 70 + mph and the tower lights stasyed in front of me and (2)it was a fairly straight road and now the &apos;strobe&apos; was on the other side of the road from where I had first noticed it.  I slowed down, woke my daughter and told her to look at this.  By this time I had reduced my speed to about 40 mph.  The &apos;strobe&apos; could be seen through the very left of the drivers windshield and the drivers window.  My daughter saw the &apos;strobe&apos; too.  Although we didn&apos;t stop, we seemed to have &apos;passed it up&apos; because we quit seeing the &apos;strobe.&apos;  It was strange but we decided that it must have been a tower.  We were running late and t! here was still not much traffic, so I increased my speed back up to 70 mph.  A few minutes later, we saw the &apos;strobe&apos; light again.  It was still on the left side (SW) of the Hwy but just out in front of the vehicle.  It continued to &apos;strobe&apos; with the tentacle lights showing up about every 3rd strobe ( it may have been every 4th or 5th strobe - I didn&apos;t think to count, but it seemed to be at regular intervals).  In the main part of the &apos;strobe&apos; the light was not all the same intensity.  It was bright when it &apos;strobed&apos; but there were duller sppots in it.  Unlike the main &apos;strobe&apos; part, the tentacle lights were all the same intensity - very bright.  We continued to watch it as we drove until we &apos;passed&apos; it up again.  We wondered if the other drivers saw what we were seeing?!  We kept driving on 105W and began to look for the &apos;strobe.&apos;  We didn&apos;t see it for a few more minutes.  Then we picked it up - this time to the right (NW)side of the Hwy.  It seemed to be closer than before.  My daughter said that the bottom of the main &apos;strobe&apos; had small yellow &apos;lights&apos; around it.  Actually, she had a better view because it was outside her window and I had to devote some time to driving.  She was beginning to get frightened, because it continued to &apos;strobe&apos; along side the car and we were traveling pretty fast.  We were approaching Cleveland,it was getting to be daylight, and traffic was increasing (we were meeting 4 or 5 cars at a time instead of 1 or 2).  Then the &apos;strobe&apos; light went out and we never saw it again.  We had the radio on (not loud) and never heard any static.  Also, we did not hear any noise, even when my daughter rolled down her window.

Instead of taking me home the usual way, we drove north down Route 68 towards Hubbardston.  I remember this night clearly, ----- was driving his mothers 1962 Thunderbird, we were just gabbing, laughing and having a good time.Route 68 was not heavily populated then, as it is now.  The road was and is a very long, straight and wide paved two-lane highway.  There were not very many houses back then, just a few scattered here and there.  It was about five or six miles until we would arrive at the junction of Route 56 and Route 68.  My house was located on Route 56 in Rutland and we would have to back track south on 56 for a mile to reach my home.Having driven roughly 3 miles down Route 68 past the Rutland town line, heading towards the town of Hubbardston, while I was looking at the clear night sky through the passenger side windshield, I noticed a very bright star; only this star was getting larger with every passing second.    I yelled at ----- to look up, quick!  By that time it was huge and very bright.  He said, &quot;What the H--- is it?&quot;  I couldn&rsquo;t even speak at this point and just kept watching the object, until it was huge and hovering over the treetops approximately 3 tenths of a mile away in front of us.It was no longer a bright white, but had turned to a radiant pulsating red.  I am sure that it was saucer in shape, but looked much like a huge cigar, floating in a falling leaf like movement, gliding from left to right, then up and down and side to side again and so on, altering from red to a blazing blue hue.  This went on for about 5 minutes.  From our perspective the size of the object appeared to be the size of a large Greyhound bus.There were maybe three or four cars behind us that slowed down when we did.  We pulled over and stopped on the soft shoulder, then got out of the car, as a couple of other cars passed us.  But two or three vehicles stopped in back of us and were watching, also, no one said a word, we all just watched.  So there were other observers, but I don&rsquo;t know who they were.When it finally stopped hovering the object turned intense white again and flew off at an incredible speed into the night sky, until it was only a speck as when I had first noticed it.There is one thing that I took note of; the place where the object was hovering was directly over the power lines that cross Route 68.It was so odd, no one that I can remember said anything, and everybody just got back into his or her cars and drove off, slowly.  ----- and I talked about it a little, but when I saw him the next day, he did not want to talk about it at all.  A few years later when he came to visit my husband and me, I brought our unidentified flying object experience up to him and he almost denied ever seeing such a thing.  I know I will never forget, not ever! In case you are wondering, there was no alcohol, or drugs of any kind involved.Thank you for this Web Site, I sort of feel relieved after telling my story.  I don&rsquo;t fell so crazy after reading some other peoples experiences.  This is the first time that I have ever reported this event.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate.

When I came closer I noticed it was about 20 feet over the road. It was static and looked light a huge bright light. There seemed to be a circular shape around it. I was so scared I just wanted to get home. When I drove under it it dissapeared.There was no colours in the light and no noise that I heard I am a down to earth farmer who is in no way fanciful. In fact I didn&apos;t tell anyone except my wife untill recently.This happened on a country road and as far as I know nobody else saw it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

She said it was about the size of a small airplane, but made no noise, moving north bound at about  10 km per hr. it would have been no more that 15 feet away from the window which is on the 3rd floor of the building which has 20 ft ceilings. She watched it for about one minute then turned to see if I was watching, which I was not, and then it was gone.", "I saw an object with white lights and a white trail behind it as it flew...I am a very skeptical person, and I have been told stories about sightings that I don&apos;t completely believe... But last night (very early in the morning) I was sitting outside, talking on my cell phone and contemplating the sky as I did so, and I saw two white lights (kind of like a dumbell, like 2 headlights would look, but closer together) flying toward the east. My first impression was that it might have been a plane, but it was flying too fast and smoothly. It moved in a straight line, with a tail of white smoky light behind it. The lights were purely white. It looked much, much larger than a plane, I wish I could calculate the size but I cannot tell. It moved about 6 times faster than a regular airplane. It dissapeared into some hills, that was as far as I could see from my house.", "White dim lights in formation similar to constallation.On the westside of Wichita I observed what I believed to be a small formation of stars.  These stars/lights were very similar to the shape of a constalation.  I noticed, however, that these lights were very close to one another not spaced out at all.  The lights were white and slightly dim, like dimmer stars, and could see about 8-10 of them.  I kept staring at the object(s). It was static and did not move for a moment.  I looked at the clock and noted that it was 12:37.  Then the object(s) started to glide slowly to the ground.  I told the driver to start driving faster because the ojects view was lost behind some trees.  As we followed it, it looked as if though either the oject was rotating from left to right or as if the light formations were moving.  I noticed at this point that it seemed a little darker than the sky. I call it an object because the lights seemed to be in sync with each other. as it slowly descended, it quickly disappeared.  And then as soon as I couldn&apos;t see it anymore, I thought to myself &quot; I want to see it again&quot;  instantly, there was a line of light overhead that was white and very thin.  similar to a shooting star, but instead just a line not a streak.  we had pulled off of the road at this point.. we waited but it didn&apos;t return.  I did not hear any sounds or feel any strange sensations.. we both dismissed this as some sort of military base test.  I have never seen anything like this before in real life.", "Spherical object seen in Speonk (Hamptons area)In 1990 I was 20, and living in Speonk, NY. Speonk is a tiny little town in the south east part of Long Island, right next to West Hampton. I had been out visiting some friends and was on my way home. It was about 2 or 2:30 am, and I was driving down Old Country Road. Old Country road is well named - it&apos;s long and windy, with long stretches of nothing but trees or open fields, broken up by the occasional home.I was tired and taking Old Country faster then I should have (the friends I had been visiting lived about 45 minutes to an hour away, so I&apos;d been driving tired for a while), and so I was annoyed to discover very slow moving traffic ahead of me just as I was getting close to Speonk. I was forced to slow down to about 10 or 15 miles per hour, and follow grumpily along behind the 3 cars ahead of me. I was actually just about to stand on my horn when I discovered why they were all driving so slowly - outside my driver&apos;s side window, on the north side of Old Country road, we were passing an open fiend, and hovering stationary in the field there was an object.It was dark, so I never saw its exact shape, but there were blue, red and white lights seemingly affixed to its exterior, and bright blue cone shaped lights would occasionally fire out from underneath it, to scan the field below. At first, I thought it was a helicopter, but I couldn&apos;t hear the propeller noise, or feel any wind even though if was relatively close to the road (maybe 200 feet away, and slightly lower then the nearest treetops). I rolled down the window to get a better view, and to better hear any propeller noise, and that&apos;s when I noticed that it was rotating end over end (it HAD ends - even though I couldn&apos;t see it well, I had the impression it was spherical), that it to say vertically, and slightly horizontally as well. This removed any question from my mind that it might be a helicopter - I&apos;d never seen or heard of a helicopter that while stationary, could slowly rotate upside down, while also turning horizontally and shining beams of light down at the ground below. Once my window was completely down, I also noticed that there was absolutely no sound whatsoever coming from the direction of the open field, and the UFO. Me and the rest of the strange 2:30 am traffic along Old Country crawled along, staring at the object in amazement until it was obscured by the reoccurrence of trees along the side of the road. We all just sped up and wend home, without ever saying a word to one another. The next day, I gathered some of my friends who lived in the Speonk/Hampton area, and told them what I&apos;d seen. They laughed at me, and one of them reminded me that Calverton military base is just a few towns over. Those of us who live in the area have always been sure that the military is doing some thing over there that they don&apos;t want the rest of us to know about. There are signs on the fence surrounding the military base that say things like &quot;Do not stop&quot; (you&apos;re car), and such. He suggested that maybe the military was testing some new secret military aircraft. Maybe so, but I&apos;ve never seen anything befo! re or si nce that day to suggest that the American military has aircraft that can do that.In case you&apos;re interested, I&apos;m the Senior Systems Administrator for a Long Island Technology company.", "Huge, motionless craft hovers silently above an army baseIt was approximately 1:30 am on a clear summer night and my boyfriend was driving me home. We took the usual route, which is right alongside an army base which is surrounded by a thick border of trees. We were on the right side of the street and the army base and trees were to my right. I was looking up at the sky through my (passengers) window as we drove along and out of nowhere, I spot a huge disc-shaped object. It was hovering, motionless in the field of the army base at just the right angle and height above the trees for me to get a good look at it. The top portion was dome shaped and appeared slightly lighter in colour than the bottom and did not have any lights on it&apos;s surface. The lower portion of the object was shaped like a saucer but had some thickness to it. It was dark in colour and the flat bottom was encircled with red and pale yellow lights at it&apos;s edge. There was a long, rectangular ramp extended from the bottom part and I could see a cable or something cable-like, holding this ramp in place. The ramp was not in contact with anything else in the sky, it was just there and the light inside the object was light grey, almost misty. I started to yell &quot;what the f*ck is that?!!!&quot; and kept telling him to look and asking him if he seen it too. I kept repeating &quot;it&apos;s in the sky, above the trees!&quot; and he tried to lean over to see it, but the roof of the car was obstructing his line of sight. I was too excited to think of getting him to pull over, even though the streets were almost empty and we probably could have done so safely. For the next few seconds, I just watched this huge, silent object hover in the sky, and as we kept driving, I lost sight of it. I told ((name deleted)) to turn pull a u-turn and go back, so that he could see it.

My three year old son pointed to a military craft flying and leaving a vapor trail. I turned around and indeed saw the plane, but something else cought my attention. Flying in fron of this plane was something else. It was barely noticeble but it was there. It left no visible trail or disturbance. It was traveling at a nuch higher altitude (I assume) and at a much greater speed. I saw it outdistancing the military jet. Both were flying in an easterly direction.After we competed our shopping, we left the store and proceeded south on Rt 130 to the local Wendes. Halfway there my 11 year old daughter and I saw two football shaped objects, flying at a high rate of speed in an easterly direction.

I then went into my house to get my camera, I had figured since my eyes wern&apos;t so good I could get a better look with my zoom lens.

I stood up to look closer because there was no sound or flashing lights which all airplanes have. It just disappeared. Then about a week later my nephew and I saw the same lights, this time there were two, at a distance and both slowly came on for 5 seconds and slowly went out. They had to be about a mile apart yet they both did this at exact the same time. They did it 4 times then they were gone.

Then it came on and before it went completly out another one would start coming on beside it and before it went completly out another one would come on beside it and so on. There were 5 of them. At first I thought that it was just one light moving accross the sky but then realized that before the first light went out the second one was coming on. Greenvalley is west of my home and to the north is an AF base. After I saw the lights on the 25th a small plane came from the direction of the AF base and flew around in circles over Greenvalley for 30 minutes then returned to the base.

I was facing due south and the light was approching from the SE to NW. As it came closer, within 100 feet, I looked up and saw a green object not very high up in the sky. The light was intense and green. The object passed overhead and while still in sight turned bright red for an instant and then appeared to break up. There were distinct pieces visable.

My father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, my niece in the back driver&apos;s side, and I in the right back passenger side of the car.The object was in a position of about 1 o&apos;clock (To my right, SW), hovering at about 200&apos;, over a vacant corner lot, on a busy city street, in the midst of tall office buildings.  It&apos;s altitude was below some of the tallest buildings, so that it should have been seen by anyone looking in that direction, either from the ground level or out of any of the buildings&apos; windows.  It must have been casting a shadow directly beneath.It was a highly polished, aluminum-looking disc-shaped craft, round, about the size of a third of a city block (it covered the entire vacant lot).  The best way to describe it would be that it had the appearance and proportions of a fat silver dollar with rounded edges, but absolutely smooth.  There were no extraneous antennas, wings, tail, propellers, insignia, doors, windows, etc..  It hovered motionless, without sound that I could hear (my window was open).I watched it for about 6 seconds, thinking, &quot;Oh, there&apos;s one now.&quot;  In other words, I was very calm.  There was no question in my mind that this was an extraterrestrial craft.I turned my attention to the interior of the car and asked my family, &quot;What&apos;s that?!&quot;  Unfortunately, at that exact moment, a small private plane was buzzing the freeway, very low, right in front of us, from right to left (from the direction of the craft).  Everyone in the car said, &quot;It&apos;s a plane.&quot;  I said, &quot;No, not that!  That!&quot; and as I turned to point to the object, it was gone.  No one else in our car saw it.  I do believe that the people in the small plane came close enough to call it a near miss.  Maybe that was why they were so low over the freeway; they had spotted it and came down for a closer look.Since it had just disappeared, or had taken off straight up (the only two possibilities, considering the close quarters it was in amongst the tall buildings), I looked up and down in every direction (as much as possible from the back seat of a car) for miles.  The sky was absolutely clear with only one small cloud to obscure any view.  I watched this cloud dissipate, as they do in the desert, trying to see if maybe the object had flown into it.

This green beam was stationary, just above the clouds, facing NNE.  The beam was horizontal to our ground and a high pitched, pulsating hum could be heard over the common city noise.  This hum caused the several K-9 dogs to bark and howl uncontrollably from their pens. Holding my hand up to the sky, the beam/glow of deep green light would have been relative to the size of my thumb.

As I sat at a stop light after buying my lunch at a local grocery store they seemed to be playing intricate game in which the smaller balls of light performed corkscrewing and spiraling manuevers of the like I have never seen. I have been to hundreds of airshows and familiar with every type of aircraft known to be in use by military and civilian air forces and company and these fit no description or executed manuevers impossible to human aircraft.

I had been playing with my friends that lived 3 doors down from us and had to go home to use the bathroom. Upon returning,  as I reached the corner of the wooded lot a circled craft came over making not a sound and just at the tips of the trees.  I stood frozen watching it go over and and could not speek a word to ask the other kids do they see this. I looked at them and they were playing not even seeing this.  It was small,  about 8 to 10 feet around and had what I would call today as chaser lights of different colors flashing around the whole paremature of the craft. I watched it as it crossed the homes and just as it was out of sight I was finely able to yell to the other kids if they saw it. Of course they said no.  I ran home to tell my mother and she said that it was a weather balloon. I know it was not.  It was almost flat and circuler with the chaser lights running around it. I moved about, I would guess 5 mph. Very slow and quiet.  The trees did not sway a bit and it was almost touching the tree tops. I was a silver color and looked like it had a darker circle in the middle of the bottom of the circle. Like I said we only lived a few miles from the Atlanta Airport.

The distance I noticed it fly equated to streaching my arm out, and spreading my thumb and index finger by approximately 5 to 6 inches.

When leaving the park the next day, we could see that the area where the lights were , was a big field.We have been thinking about that ever since.

Thank you,", "I was standing in the backyard (house is double - built facing west) when i obseved pigeons on the roof.  I made jestures in an attempt to scare them off when a light/for silver/white object caught my eye as it passed the roofline moving across the clear blue sky at an usually high rate of speed with no vapor trail and not any sound being emitted. At first I thought it might be a high flying bird like a seagull using the thermals, but when i saw the straight line and the distance it covered i just watched it go straight west to east until out of sight from a tree. I have never seen an object traveling at that speed and cover the distance in my life and i have no idea what it was, but if I had not been looking at the roofline of the house i would never have dectected it otherwise on such a clear and bright day.", "two girls  13 years old have seen during the night in  belgium; a triangle with 3 lights, one was red and the shape was glowing into the sky, he move verticaly to the sky ,desepear...and come later from another place in the clouds and desepear again..we would like to know if somebody else saw it? is it a special plane from the army? or a meteorological thing? thanks to give us an aswer", "TOO MUCH ACTIVITY OVER NOTHERN CAL.

I saw the two lights to the left (north) first. I focused on them and then noticed the two lights to the right (south). I have worked the area for four years and never seen them before so my attention was drawn to them. I should also note that the lights were due east of my location and appeared directly above Memorial Stadium. I was unsure what the objects were at first and I thought they may have been a reflection or new lights on the stadium. I also did not think much about them initially because of that reason. I had been scanning the other Police departments in the area (radio traffic) and heard several other officers talking about unidentified objects they were seeing. I then realized the objects I was seeing was probably related. The closer I came to the stadium also made me realize the objects were several hundred feet above it. The four objects hovered in place. I did not see them move or do anything else. I lost sight of them when I turned northbound onto First Street and was close to the base of the stadium. I realized the lights were further to the east and the stadium blocked my view. Later that night, I telephoned METCAD (a dispatch agency) and learned that several people, including other officers, had reported seeing up to ten unusual lights in the sky. Some believed the lights were from skydivers or parachute flares. Others believed it was the military doing some type of menuevers. I also learned that some buildings had been lit up with spotlights from these objects. Another important point that I forgot to include was that maybe five minutes after my sighting, I received a computer message from our front desk personnel that (said) someone from an apartment at 308 East Armory (3 blocks north of the stadium) called-in to report ten airplanes using orange running lights to communicate to each other in morse code. I am unsure of the loca! tion of that sighting. One last point, METCAD advised during my previously-mentioned telephone conversation that they had called the local airport (Willard) to see if they could provide any information on the unusual sightings. The airport&apos;s reply was that they knew of nothing going on and had nothing on their radar screen. Nothing further to report at this time.&quot; (Case investigated and submitted by Illinois MUFON State Section Director, Vic Connor)((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Victor Connor and MUFON/Illinois for sharing this report.

I was 4 years old and was walking back form our mail box  on a cloudless evening when an orange shere appeared over top of a pine tree which was about 100-125 feet away. The object had come from the western horizon and moved to it&apos;s position over the tree at an incredible speed. I would say that it took 1/2 second or less for this to occur. I immediately turned to my left (north) and gazed at the object. The sphere had no discernible features other than the color orange. In fact it it almost seemed to occupy only 2 dimensions like a projection of light against a flat surface. As I stared at the light I felt as though I was being observed. After perhaps 3-5 seconds the thought occured to me that the object was going to leave heading east. No sooner did I have this thought than the light sped off eastward (and out of my view as our house blocked my vision) at the same speed as coming out of the west.  Within 3 seconds I had another thought, that the object was going to reappear from the east. Again, as soon as I had this thought the orange sphere reappeared out of the east (as quickly as it had departed) and hovered over the tree again. Once again I felt I was being watched. The object then disappeared eastward and I ran to our house to tell my family. (being only 4 I was not taken seriously and the incident was dismissed. I have never forgotten it.) Also, this object was absolutely silent and appeared to be a little larger than the moon appears to be at its zenith.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

My buddy was lying down below trying to catch a quick nap, so I kept an eye on things (making sure we didn&apos;t get runover by some freighter or something). After, roughly 5 minutes went by I saw a glimmer of something again, this time I kept looking in that direction but couldn&apos;t make out anything, but I began to hear what sounded like a faint hum. NO lights, just an object or something off in the distance. I started getting paranoid at this point and decided to turn on our nav lights just in case another boat was coming, but really couldn&apos;t hear anything outside of a faint hum. I woke my buddy up, and told him what was going on, then told him to help me look for something off in the distance, because I knew something was there. My biggest fear was that another vessel was coming straight at us and we just couldn&apos;t see the lights yet. Finally, to the SouthEast of us we both saw what we thought at the time was a freighter coming because of the size, but we both remarked about that in the probably 10-12 years we&apos;ve been fishing together,we have never saw a large ship at night with NO nav lights on.  I started to grab my VHF radio to call and see if anybody knew what the hell was out there when all of the sudden there was this loud screaming sort of sound, not like a jet engine, but like a low pitch whine of a... I really can&apos;t think of anything, maybe a firework rocket inside of an empty dome stadium, sort of.It came right at us and over us by only maybe 30 feet or so, but it happened so damn fast that it almost gave us a heart attack. We stood there, both of us dumbfounded, we could almost hear each others heart beating we were so scared. After, about 5 seconds or so we both looked at each other and yelled &quot;What in the F--- was that.&quot; When we finally turned around in the direction of whatever it was went all we could see was that faint glimmer again, but suddenly the faint scream and the glimmer were gone. We radioed out to see if any other boats might have been close enough in the vicinity to see or hear anything, but naturally NO!  Shape and exact size are hard to tell, when it came at us I could barely tell, but it was tapered looking and it did have a metallic type look but not shiny. If you can picture a small airliner buzzing you at about 30 feet thats sort of how it was. Not a terrible amount of wind to speak of as it came by, about like a car coming by you on the side of the road, enough to feel it, but not like it&apos;s going to knock you down or anything. Why didn&apos;t we report it sooner, I don&apos;t know. We both tried to come up with everything imaginable to explain it, and yes, we did consider telling somebody about it, well, we did tell a few people, but nobody of an authoratative type nature, but when my wife came home one night after a PTO meeting and she told me that somebody remarked&quot; ---- been seeing anymore UFO&apos;s lately?&quot; Well, I kinda let it go. I really don&apos;t say to much about it anymore except to my buddy, when he suggested that I go look up some stuff on the net and low and behold I found this sight. So I figured what the hell?

I observed a bright, and what seemed to be very high-altitude object overhead.  The sky was still too light for stars or planets, but it was similar to the size and intensity of Venus. I knew it wasn&apos;t Venus since it was directly overhead.  I ran into my house to grab my 8x25 power binoculars.  When I returned, the object had drifted slightly but was roughly in the same place.  I got on my back and observed the object through the binoculars.  I have very good eyesight and focused on the shiny object that seemed to be ovoid.  I then observed a small point of light revolving around the ovoid at a 7:00 to 1:00 attitude/orbit in a clock-wise direction with a frequency of about three seconds.  I ran back in the house to grab my cell phone and call a friend to describe what I was seeing.  When I returned, the object had drifted slightly to the southwest.  As I was describing my observations to my friend on the phone, the object suddenly and almost instantly separated into a group of approximately 20 to 30 small points.  There were no flames, colors or smoke to indicate any explosion.  It just seemed to separate.  Approximately three of the smaller objects were brighter and easier to see than the others, but it was now a distinguishable group of drifting objects.  I observed that the one piece that had been revolving around the ovoid was still in somewhat the same motion, but no longer around any object.  At first I thought it was falling, but then realized it was just drifting.  A few moments later, an object entered my field of vision approaching the group from the west and stopped.  It was about the same brightness as the original object but seemed to be triangular.  I thought it was a fighter jet, but it stopped.  Immediately, another triangular object of the same size and brightness approached the group from the north and stopped opposite the other object so as to surround the group from the east and west.  Just then, the group of objects d! isappear ed, and then the western triangular object disappeared.  The sky became hazy, and completely obscured the one remaining eastern triangular object.

Since it is very strange to see a star in broad daylight we watched at it.  Then we realized there were about 50-100 dim pinpoints (stars) of light.  They seemed to be partially behind a gray haze (cloud) and some of them kept fading in and out behind the haze. I think the objects were producing the &quot;haze&quot; as a camouflage.

Watched as object very slowly moved North, then through a cloud, reappeared, then went through a larger cloud and NEVER appeared again.Have never seen an object like this in size, shape, color, flight pattern, etc. Do live by an Air Force base and commercial airport, but still have never seen anything like this. This is the first time that I have ever reported a sighting of an unexplained object in the sky. I was moved to report this as it was so very unusual. So...a military aircraft or other man made object?", "40.00 NORTH  23.59 EAST STRONG LIT OBJECT  HOVERED FOR A MIN. BEFORE DISAPPEARING SOUTH EAST", "Landed triangle flyed over us.It was a dark windy november night 9 years ago, but this vision still obssess me. I was 16 back then and was in the forest with a friend, we were dressed in camo and having some fun. At our usual fire spot we saw a couple of lights through the trees,I thought they were from a road near by but not sure. My friend fired 6 shots of blank starter gun in the air and, suddenly the lights started to ascent over the trees, now near panicking we saw that the lights were from a big black triangular object. It then hovered just over trees and flew over us very slowly and very silently, the wind stopped,it seemed that this thing &quot;created&quot; silence. Now panicked we started to run like crazy when in a clear spot we were spotted by a kind of searchlight, it was the object , it had spotted us, camo in a forest. We ran a 45 min. walk in less than 10 min. We are convinced that our camo suits kinda &quot;protected&quot; us from being abducted. The next day there was a couple of army copters flying very low over the area it happened. This is the first time I file a report fot this, no one believed us and we were afraid of the government. Very bizarre.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

These star-looking objects would then change into triangle-looking craft and move slowly up and to the south, gaining speed as they went. On that evening I must have seen at leat 20 of these form and move off.

Just after leaving a development area near Banks, the man noticed two unusual lights straight ahead just left of the road and hanging low to the ground. The brightness of one of them really stuck out. As the highway curved slightly to the right the lights stayed to the left side of the road the whole time. After driving for over ten minutes having these two lights within sight, the witness reports feeling as if the objects may have been as much as a mile apart from each other.The witness writes...&quot; The light I could see looked huge for the distance I saw it from. The white light was facing me and appeared to be heading in the same direction I was driving. It did not blink. I didn&apos;t think it was a plane. After passing the Texaco on my left, I got to the Hwy. 47 turnoff to Vernonia, pulled onto the Hwy. 26/47 intersection and out of the car. I could still see these lights right next to a street light in front of me. The brighter light was brighter than the street lamp. To get an idea on the distance between these two lights, I put my arm all the way out and they were two fingers wide. I then got out my binoculars for a closer look and was amazed to see the brighter light was red toward the top. It also looked flat on it&apos;s right side, and was pointed on the left side. It looked like it was divided between a top middle and bottom section. I couldn&apos;t tell if the brighter light was connected at all to the one two fingers away to the left of it. I couldn&apos;t see the same details with the light on the left as I did with the brighter light on the right. I took several pictures with an HP215 Digital Camera (it has 1.3mega pixel resolution).&quot; This witness has agreed to share what pictures he has and we will post them with this sighting when we get them.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Eric Byler and Skip Schultz, of Oregon UFO Research, for following up on the case, and sharing the information with NUFORC.  PD))", "Single bright white light observed in eastern sky of northern hemisphere moving from south to north approx. 40-45 degrees off horizon.While Moon gazing observed a single bright white light moving in a straight line from south to north in the eastern sky, approx 40-45 degrees off the horizon.  Observed light with naked eye for approx 5 secs, then with pair of small 8x power field binoculars for approx 10 more secs.  Observed light for approx 5 more secs with naked eye and then light simply vanished as it neared the constellation Cassiopeia.  No flashing lights, such as strobe or navigation lights were observed at any time, nor any high altitude contrails associated with engine exhaust.  No sound emitted from the light nor were any aircraft observed in the area.  After light vanished, monitored sky for approx. 10 minutes for light to reappear with negative results.  Conditions were clear sky with almost full moon.  Monitored sky the following night (07/21) from 2200 - 2230 hours to see if light would reappear.  Effort resulted in negative results.  Have 26 years experience with military (Air Force) and very familiar with aircraft operations.  Also have amateur experience skywatching satellites in orbit.  This object was far too bright to be a satellite.  My vision has been tested at 20/20.  The single most important factor that drew my attention to this sighting was the brightness of the light.((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),Thank you very much for the excellent report!  Your credentials with the USAF appear to speak for themselves.One of the tests as to whether the object might have been a satellite is the amount of the sky the object traversed in the time you were looking at it.  Can you estimate the angle it covered, measured in degrees, it covered during the 20 seconds you watched it?Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center!Cordially,  Peter Davenport((RESPONSE))Yes, I would estimate the light travelled approx 55 degrees.  I base this estimate by using my arms as a reference; by facing due east and stretching out my arms to point due north and south, the distance  between my outstretched arms would be equal to approx 180 degrees.  I first viewed the object about 20 degrees to the right of my head and then tracked it to a point about 35 degrees to the left of my head when the light vanished. ((name deleted))((END))", "It was a bright circular object with mullti-colored llights in the center in the western sky over the Straits of Juan de FucaWe saw a bright llight in the west and thought it was a large plane with its landing lights on.  After 10 minutes or more it did not move.  It was not a planet or star, as it was too bright  for being almost above where the sun had set earlier (it was directly west over the Jaun de Fuca Straits).  We have a home with a view and own a spotting scope.  When we looked at the bright llight with the scope we could see multi-clolored lights apparently within the white light: red, organge green, blinking in no particular pattern.  After 30-45 minutes my wife and I went to bed, as the object was getting smaller, as it it were going west, or  just diminishing in size.  I am a retired clergyman, and  my wife is a registerred nurse.  Neither of us have ever seen anything llike this before and we would not be described as &quot;believers&quot; in UFOs.", "Uneven &quot;V&quot; formation of white and red lights, trailing ones flashing red, with trail extending over time of a minute or two.About 30 degrees elevation, starting in north east, ending in south east, travelling slowly (about same speed as small prop plane). Observed from back yard (regular family venue on summer evenings). Almost full moon rising to the south east. Vehicle started as single white-ish ball of light; I thought it was a satelite (almost same speed as a normal 90-120 minute orbit satellite of which we see several a night). But mentioned to wife &quot;can&apos;t be a satellite, too low&quot; (would have been in umbra as eastern aspect).  No other navigation lights seen (we see many small planes and I know their signature well).Then, as we watched it travel southward over the San Fernando Valley, it started to develop a long &quot;tail&quot; of red flashing lights, which grew ever loger, such that by the time it stoped extending, there were about 4 or 5 high intensity flashing lights , like ultra-bright plane red navigation lights, extending at about 45 degrees backwards from the parent white-ish ball.   By the time it disappeared from view (buildings), it was underneath the Moon&apos;s location. Overall shape by then was a chevron of lights, with one or two dimmer red lights above and back from the (now) two diffuse constant white-ish lead lights , then back wards for the 4 or 5 trailing lower red flashing lights. As the Moon subtends an angle of about 0.5 degrees diametrically, the extent of the object would have been about three Moon diamters, or about 2 degrees from upper tip, through the middle white, back through the extended red light trail.  There was no sound whatsoever while this was hapening, whereas several minutes later, a small plane in the same region (by elevation angle and navigation light brightness) was easily heard by its engine sound.About half way through the event, I called to my son, who was inside, to join my wife and I on the patio, and he brought his binoculars which he had nearby (just returned from a touring vacation).  Binoculars are 8x23mm.  I played them on the object(s), but could discern no solid connection betweenthe lights, nor any additional &quot;navigation&quot; lights, even though by then the object was close to the full Moon, and any wing structure would easily have been visible. (Confirmed later by observing a few small planes to demonstrate what should have been visible).I am perplexed, with many years of aeronautical and astronomical observation behind me, this is the first time I cannot even start to explain what I saw. The only things that come to mind to mimic the phenomenon are: 1) A &quot;V&quot; formation of Canada geese with red flashing nav lights and flashlights on the head birds.   (ridiculous of course, but would match the &quot;no connecting structure&quot; item) 2) A large silent low-flying air-refuelling tanker with its refuelling probe slowly extending as it flew, whose probe was illuminated with red flashing nav lights, and said tanker was making no engine noise, and having its wings directly in line with my line of sight all the time, and having no wing-tip nav lights.  (very unlikely).I have no real idea how big the thing was, but by its low elevation and light brightness, it could not have been more than (guess) 5 miles away, or the evening haze and bright Moonlight would have washed it out. Also, its silence indicates it was probably more than a mile away (?). This would make the overall &quot;structure&quot; very large, much larger than a long-winged plane, for example.((FOLLOW-UP TO ORIGINAL REPORT))This is  a follow-up to my report sent in today 28 July 02:     After I finished my report, of a triangular formation of lights, I went back to your web-site, then called my family to the screen. There, with a drawing from the observation in Iowa, was almost exactly what we had seen on the 23rd !  The hair on the back of my neck started crawling !   The only difference was that the reporter from Iowa said he saw a triangular dark shape conecting the lights.  This was not the case for me, as I could not discern , even with binoculars, any connecting structure between the lights, but the shape, elevation above ground, and general features were identical !((FOLLOW-UP #2))Chevron/triangle formation of lights (central white, trailing red flashing) travelling north-south over San Fernando Valley; silentThis is an addendum report to the one filed over the weekend by this resident of West Hills, Ca. re: chevron/triangle formation of lights at 10 pm local on 23 July 2002.Having filed my report, two things happened which casue me to add this addendum: 1) Today 29 July, you updated your files of reports from last week, and I have noticed that there were many other reports identical to my sighting, all at the samr time on the same day,all dscribing a large formation of lights travelling slowly north to south, with the first report from Tehachapi, and the last from Santa Monica.  All these reports (including those between these two extremes) were indicating a straight north-south passage.  This is significant (i.e.I&apos;m not apparently crazy!) 2) On answering your questions and on reflection with other witnesses in my family, we DID see two fast military planes travelling the same path about 15 minutes behind (single-engine jet noise from high altitude, clear view of wings and nav light in bimoculars, my guess F-16&apos;s.  I thought nothing of it till today, as in my mind I was using the mil jets as reference data to compare the other object with.  In restospect, they may well have been scrambled to intercept.One reporter  (from Reseda) said he got video.  I would very much like to see that record.  From my relative size observaion (rel to Moon diam) and now knowing it flew right over Reseda, 5 miles east of me, I geomatrically calculate a MINIMUM (depending on flat plane tilt angle) dimension of center to one trailing edge of: 150 yards.    I am dumbfounded.((END ADDENDUM))", "Sphere object with flashing lights falling at a slow pace, apparently on fire, no indication of crashing impact, lost sight of object.Driving home last night I saw a small spherical object similar to a star at first, but with some flashing lights on it which I thought was odd. As I got closer it became apparent that it was definately not an airplane or anything I&apos;ve seen before, and it was falling slowly, apparently on-fire. So I immediate think it might be some sort of incredibly slow falling meteorite, but the flashing lights lead me to believe otherwise. Also, I waited and watched in the night as I continued driving past the vicinity where I believed it was falling to, and heard no explosions. The sky also did not light up to indicate some sort of fire or crash. I have no idea where it went. Alien or not, I dunno, but it was definately a UFO.", "Ball of flashing, sparkling multicolored lightOn the night of January 25, 2001 I awoke and had trouble falling back to sleep.I got up and went to the kitchen for a drink.  It was a bright clear night and I glanced out the kitchen window, where an unusually bright star in the southwest sky, perhaps 40-45 degrees above the horizon, caught my attention.I had never seen such a sparkling, colorful star before! Red and blue light flashed from it, in a way similar to the flashing lights on police cars.  I watched it, fascinated, for a short time and then ran for my binoculars (I don&apos;t have a telescope) but they revealed no details.  The object looked like a ball of glowing light emitting sparks and spikes of colored light.  It didn&apos;t move at all during the approximately 30 minutes I observed it, but a couple of times it appeared to fade slightly and then brighten again, and it was still there when I finally went back to bed. I haven&apos;t seen it since. I was prompted to submit this report after I read of a similar sighting that occurred in Telford, Pa., which is about 30 miles from Prospect Park.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))"]
