Mr. Kwong is an engineer and lives in San Jose.  I did not get a written report from his 12-year-old son, Michael, but will send it to you if he writes one.  I believe that the reports from Mr. Kwong and myself should be thorough enough.  The only difficulty in writing our reports would be regarding the order in which we saw everything happen.  This is due to the fact that we saw up to five UFO&apos;s (four to five in the air at once).  We were not always looking at the same UFO at the same time.  Since there were several UFO&apos;s in the sky at once during our sighting, we didn&apos;t always focus on the same UFO&apos;s.  Anyway, the following is my accounting of what we saw.  Also, please note that I may have incorrectly given you the time of the sighting as being between 10:30 AM and 11:00 to 11:15.  The time was between 9:30 AM to 10:00 or later.  It was definitely for at least a half hour, maybe an hour (I began teaching my tennis lesson at 9:00 and noticed the first UFO at about 9:30.  When I arrived at home, 2 min. away, it was about 11:00 but I don&apos;t recall watching the UFO&apos;s for more than 45 min. to an hour at the very most -very minimum was a half hour).To whom it may concern:On Saturday, July 22, 1995 at 9:30 AM I, along with Michael Kwong (age 12), and his father (Ben Kwong), had a UFO&apos;s sighting which lasted for at least a half hour (to 10:15 AM or later) over the sky of Santa Clara, CA, from the Marina Playa Apt. complex tennis courts located at 3500 Granada Ave. and Lawrence Expressway (El Camino is a close cross street of Lawrence Expressway).  The sighting first began at 9:30 AM when I was teaching Michael Kwong a tennis lesson.  Michael was practicing his serve and was tossing the ball in the air.  I looked at the ball toss as it went up and noticed that the moon was out.  I also noticed an object by the moon which I took to be a star and appeared stationary like a star.  I looked at the object again and thought it might be moving slowly.  The object appeared to be moving slowly at a very high altitude, perhaps just within the atmosphere or at least at a very high altitude.  I spoke to Michael and began to say things out loud like, &quot;What is that?  What the heck is that?  It&apos;s not an airplane.&quot;  Michael looked up at it as well.  I stopped the lesson out of curiosity to watch this object.  I walked over to the fence and yelled to Ben Kwong, who was sitting in his car reading the newspaper.  I asked him to come out of his car to get a look a the object so we could figure out what it was.  He stood down below the tennis courts, looking up at the object as I and Michael were too.  Then Mr. Kwong came up to the court and all three of us continued to watch the object.  The object looked completely round and whitish in appearance (perhaps due to the altitude or even entering the atmosphere?).  The object slowly moved away from the moon and then curved a slowly headed back toward its original position, and then it appeared to hover and then start to move slowly again.  We watched this object for a few minutes and then we saw another object which looked had the same appearance as the first object.  I don&apos;t remember if Mr. Kwong or I spotted the next object first (Mr. Kwong&apos;s son is near sighted, so he had a harder time seeing).  I believe we watched until finally we saw at least four of the whitish objects in the sky.  At one point it appeared like they were hovering and moving slowly in four corners of the sky.  When they were closer to us, they appeared metallic, sort of a metallic, silver to silver-blue in color.  When they were higher up they initially appeared to be more whitish in color.  Anyway, we continued watching several of these objects as they moved slowly, stop, and move in bizarre paths, unlike airplanes.  They were very high but left no exhaust trail.  They moved and changed direction, unlike weather balloons or satellites.  At some point, after watching the (I&apos;ll call them silver, or metallic-silver/blue) objects, Ben and I noticed a red UFO, completely round like the others, but a metallic-red in color.  We then both observed a silver UFO and the red UFO in a staggered formation, with the silver UFO leading in front to the left of the red UFO (doing what appeared to be the same speed).  We noticed another red object at a lower altitude slowly moving up into the sky (not metallic, but more of an all orange to orange-red in color).  I didn&apos;t, nor did Ben, take much notice of this object as it slowly went up into the sky.  It could have been a balloon and didn&apos;t have the metallic look of the other objects which were very high in the sky.  At some point, the silver UFO&apos;s would just disappear from sight.  I don&apos;t know where they went, maybe out into the upper atmosphere,  Then sometimes one would come back into view.  The red UFO really caught my attention next.  Ben had lost sight of it (you really had to &quot;track&quot; with your eyes without looking away from the UFO&apos;s or it would take a few seconds to find some of them again).  Anyway, I told Ben that I could see the red UFO again.  I saw it moving very slowly up in the sky and then it suddenly shot through the sky at an amazing speed.  I said, &quot; There it goes! There it goes! Look at it go!&quot;  Ben kept saying that he couldn&apos;t find it.  We watched some of the other UFO&apos;s until it seemed that there were no more to see (they had all gone, but we didn&apos;t see them leave).  We had about given up on seeing any more UFO&apos;s up there when I caught sight of the first or perhaps another red UFO.  I told Ben to look up as I pointed to its location.  Ben said he could see it.  Suddenly the red UFO shot across the sky at an amazing speed, much much faster than any jet or rocket could fly (we were watching regular passenger jets crawl across the sky every once in awhile as we watched the UFO&apos;s.  The passenger jets, and some jets which may have been military from Moffet Field, were at a much lower altitude than the UFO&apos;s, a testimony to the speed of the UFO&apos;s).  I kept pointing at the red UFO as it sped across the sky.  We were both in awe, and were both speaking out loud in our amazement of the speed of the object (&quot;There is no way that can be a jet.  Nothing is that fast.  Look at it go.&quot; -etc., etc.).  As I was moving my finger across the sky, tracking the object (in what would take a jet several minutes to travel, I followed the object across the sky in less than ten seconds.  It was still at a very high altitude as well), Ben said he could see a silver UFO right next to the red one.  I said I only could see the red one, but just before the red UFO completely went out of sight, I could see another UFO, a silver one, very close to the red UFO or joined to it.  We were then completely convinced that we saw UFO&apos;s, things which are not man-made.  We didn&apos;t see any more UFO&apos;s for a few minutes, so I resumed my tennis lesson, although I had a very hard time teaching.  We stopped a few minutes later.  I looked up again and saw one lone silver UFO (up so high that it appeared white).  It was hovering and then started to move slowly again.  I told Ben and Michael that there was another one up there.  At this point, we already saw the most exciting part of our sighting (the red UFO &amp; silver UFO shooting off).  Our necks were tired from the strain of looking up, almost straight up at times for over a half hour (possibly an hour or more, as Ben stated, although I can&apos;t be sure).  We really didn&apos;t take much notice of this UFO and we didn&apos;t see it disappear from sight, but it did a couple of minutes later.  We parted between 10:30 and 11:00 AM.  I went back to my apartment and called some TV stations to see if anyone had reported anything (I really thought SOMEONE would have witnessed what we saw and would report it.  The TV station personnel said nobody else called in, plus they seemed rather skeptical of my story.  That annoyed me a bit.  I then called the Air Force in Santa Clara County.  They switched me from command post to command post.  I gave my story up to three times perhaps.  They asked me at what time I saw the UFO&apos;s, took my story, and then said they would transfer me to another command post and to just tell them the same thing (that I told the first people I contacted).  Finally, the Air Force gave me the phone # of the National UFO Reporting Agency (for whom I am writing this report).  I, after giving my story to Peter Davenport, was made aware of the fact that another person in California reported seeing up to five UFO&apos;s on the same day I had my sighting.  This was my first time every seeing anything like this in my life (I&apos;m 29-years-old, teach tennis and am also a computer specialist teaching elementary school.  Ben, like I said, is an engineer.  So I believe we are both credible people).End of ReportI&apos;m waiting to get my grandmother&apos;s written report of her two sightings and my mother&apos;s report of a sighting (these all happened many years ago).  I was afraid to mention their sightings because I thought it might make my sighting less credible.  I indeed immediately felt I had something to share with them and also wanted them to retell of their sightings as well.  My grandmother&apos;s sightings are of particular interest to me since she saw a UFO in the Almaden area of San Jose, CA some 58 years ago.  I teach in this area and my ancestors first settled there in the 1860&apos;s.  Someone emailed me who lives in Almaden to tell me she and her daughter &amp; 14-year-old son had sightings in Almaden.  She said that her son saw one hovering over the school that I teach at.  This was before she even knew that I teach at this school!  Anyway, I don&apos;t know how many people you can believe on the Internet re. sightings, but I know what I saw, and that&apos;s good enough for me.  The only other strange thing I observed in my life was described to me by someone on the Internet as being &quot;ball lightening&quot; or something like it.  I was twelve-years-old at the time.  I don&apos;t know if that is UFO related or not.  Is it just a normal phenomenon.  It happened indoors.  It went under a cot.  The cot shot straight up in the air, about five feet, and there was nothing underneath the cot!  The object was indefinable in shape, just grayish/white, and swirling.  It seemed to react to me as I entered the room and skimmed across the floor.  Any ideas?Sincerely,William D.

Sheriff had received many credible reports about red and blue &quot;roman candle&quot; like objects shooting down out of the sky to the ground.

One red object appeared to be the largest; green ones were smaller.  They were reported to appear to be descending to the earth slowly, at which point a huge white flash of light occurred. Subsequent reports by investigators suggest that some kind(s) of officials were in the area shortly after event, requesting that local and state officials say nothing.((NUFORC Note:  To the best of our knowledge, this event was not only dramatic, but quite bizarre, as well.  We were first contacted Saturday night, January 7, 1995, by an Operations Officer in TEMA, who reported to us that the event had occurred, and that their offices had been activated, as a result of the strange event, and subsequent explosion.  The latter was so dramatic that a member of the local aviation community, who had witnessed the event, immediately following the explosion, drove to the airport and took off in an aircraft to search for what he was certain had been an airliner that had exploded in midair.  TEMA contacted the U. S. Air Force, apparently informing them that a possible UFO event had occurred, and inquiring what TEMA should do.  According to the TEMA official we spoke with, TEMA was informed by the USAF to contact the National UFO Reporting Center.  TEMA did contact our Center by telephone, and faxed to our offices a seven-page document, written by a Warren County Deputy Sheriff, in which that officer describeded the explosion, according to eyewitnesses. We express our sincere gratitude to TEMA for their effort in sharing the information with our Center.

At this point, he summoned his wife, who also saw the object as it passed directly overhead.  they both agreed it was less that 500 feet above them. It was not a helicopter, and it was too slow for an aircraft.  The two lights were on the bottom, and they were glowing.  They could see an outline of the object as it passed overhead, and it appeared to be &quot;pie-shaped.&quot; They both heard a really low hum as the object passed overhead very slowly.  The object suddenly disappeared approximately 2 seconds after it had passed overhead.  The caller added that he and his wife have three cats, one of which is an &quot;outside&quot; cat, and two that are &quot;indoor&quot; cats.  After the incident, all of the them were gone, and they did not return until approximately one week later.

Sighting of a UFO which appeared to land,  a UFO chasing the car some 50m behind, and the sighting of a man which was extremely unusual looking.The first event to happen was the sighting of a &apos;roadwork&apos; man sweeping the highway.  Whilst driving along the highway, an extremely bright light suddenly appeared in front of us. At first we thought it was a truck coming towards us - common on the highway-but as we drove towards it we realised it was a stationary truck with a bright light attatched to the front of the grill. Upon getting closer to the light, it was that bright and blinding that we had to slow down to 10kms just to see the road and where we were going. Half the road was closed and suddenly we were able to see a man. There he was sweeping the road at 21:30(approx) 200kms from the nearest roadhouse. We slowly drove up to him to explain that we could not see the road due to the light and essentialy could not see him. We now believe that not being able to see him was what he wanted. The man hardly showed his face and what we did see - he had an extremely high forehead and very wide set eyes. He was approx. 7 fee!t tall and of stocky build. He did not want us talking to him and made every attempt to get us to move on quickly. As we drove off the light slowly disappeared - which is what got us thinking. Due to the cloud cover that night, a light of that intensity would have cast quite a bit of glare i.e. we would have seen the light from quite a distance, however the light suddenly flashed on and we were not descending or ascending a hill! My questions at the time were who was he, what was he doing that far out of town at that time of night and what was he sweeping off the road?Eventually that passed as we drove along the highway again.Approximately 30mins after this happened an extremely bright light came up from behind us - we had not passed a car since the roadwork man - to within 50m of us. It followed  our car for about 4 seconds before disappearing. The lights intensity was similar to that of a cars high-beam headlights and was orange-yellow in colour. Neither of us said anything - we were starting to get spooked.As we were driving up the road we were heading into a storm. As we got closer to the storm I was checking the stars to see where the storm cloud started - it was that black that there was a definite black line where the storm cloud startes. As I was watching the stars I noticed an extremely orange star. As I continued watching it moved forward so it kept up with the car, not falling behind like the other stars were. From where we were this &apos;star&apos; was about 5-6mm across. As I continued watching the light moved on a diagonal path towards the horizon and was now in front of the car. This light continued downwards until it reached a point slightly above the horizon, if not on the horizon, and that is where it stayed until the blackness of the strom blocked my view.Among these happenings we passed a military style vehicle with no insignia which was cruising up the highway rather slowly. We could not see the driver as we passed the vehicle.The storm that we drove through was extremely active for about 2 hours until we actually reached it. (there had been continuous lightning for these two hours). Yet as soon as the light was blocked out by the clouds all lightning stopped. As far as we know a storm does not just stop suddenly.As we neared Coober Pedy, a white 4WD suddenly pulled out from the side of the road and forced our car to slow down considerably. In the back window of this car two shapes could be seen moving and I can tell you with all honesty that they did not look like dogs or humans or any other animal but I did not get a very good look at them so I cannot accurately say or judge what they were.We eventually made it to Coober Pedy and were relieved to see other humans.The whole event really spooked both me and my fiance and we have vowed never to travel on the highway agein at night. (the highway runs directly from Adelaide to Alice Springs and continues to Darwin, passing through townships and roadhouses.It passes through some of the most lonely land in Australia).As we checked out of our motel the next morning we metioned these events to the receptionist who just smiled and said oh well you wouldn&apos;t be the first to talk about things like that. That was all we could get out of her,she wouldn&apos;t talk anymore.For my fiance, it is the second time that he has witnessed events of a &apos;supernatural&apos; kind - he is in his late twenties. I have witnessed other happenings including metallic cigar shaped objects and other orange lights resembling stars but moving otherwise to indicate that they were not a star.

I pulled over to check the cargo and found everything secure. We all took this opportunity to stretch our legs and while facing away from the highway and looking in a southerly direction,I noticed six pairs of strobing red lights. They were located on a east-west plane and seemed to be evenly spaced. A large mountain stood in the distance andI later learned that it was Virgin Peak. What caught my attention readily was the very slow strob speed of the lights. I looked for other color patterns and none were visable. It is almost impossible for me to determine distance or height of objects, and no shape patterns were visable due to impending sunset.There was no noticable noise at the onset of sighting. After viewing objects for approximtely 2-3 minutes we noticed the sound of jet aircraft. Suddenly from a north-west direction two F-15 fighters flew over at a tremendous rate of speed. I would estimate that they were flying at approximately 500 feet and as they passed the ground reverberated with the sonic boom. We all watched in awe as the pairs of red strobbing lights moved tremendously fast to the east and suddenly in unison changed course to the south-east and raised altitude until they vanished. This all took place within a matter of seconds, and the pursuing fighters had no chance what so ever to catch these objects.

When they arrived at their destination, the father informed the others that he had seen another object &quot;on the other side of the mountain.&quot;", "Seattle UFO investigator called to relay two sighting reports from her mother in Arizona: 1)  Her mother observed two very bight, yellowish, balls of light in the sky over Scottsdale, AZ, to the north2)  Her mother, in Snowflake, AZ, had just witnessed a light blink on, move to northwest very fast, then blink out.  Witness telephoned her daughter to report it.", "SUMMARY:  I witnessed a UFO which may be of the Lazar&quot;Sport Model&quot; variety when I was leaving work to drive home.The UFO was circular in shape, with three distinct propulsion units on the bottom,and several red rectangular lights around the perimeter.  I witnessed this UFO when I was leaving work to drive home.  It was travelling in straight lines, forming a triangular pattern, approximate airspeed was about 150 MPH as far as I could tell.  I had the impression that it was of the type described by Bob Lazar, UUP/element 115propulsion. After approximately 5 minutes,the UFO sped away to the north.  I believe that I was in some kind of mental contact with the occupants of the craft at the time,as the triangular course seemed to circle directly around me also. I am currentlyworking on some sketches of the craft, bu tI thought it important to report the event as soon as possible.  I will email the sketches in JPEG format as soon as they are complete.Perhaps they were interested in this location because it is in proximity to several of our National Guard military installations.", "SUMMARY:  I saw a HUGE ball like flash grow and then&apos;erupt&apos; while looking out of my windowfacing SE. It was not lightening. I love towatch the weather. Especially adverse weather.The ball was at least 300ft high if it waswhere I believe it was. It was acompanied byno sound of thunder.Sorry if this sounds like it is not important to me, because it is very important to me.I have been waiting for any kind of sighting.This is my first actual sighting of something and I would apreciate any kind of response.I was sitting with my friend on the computer while on AOL. We were just talking to a friend and watching the snow fall whensuddenly there was a blue light outside. Itwas quite bright from where we were. And itseemed to be coming from some distance away.the start of it was like a huge blue floodlight was on in the SE corner of Reno. Thenit &apos;erupted&apos; into a huge ball of light. Overapproximately 2 seconds it grew into anapproximate 200-300 feet in diameter. At thatpoint it just seemed to explode into thesky. There was no visible body or mass. Andno sound. The thunder around here can be heardquite well due to Reno&apos;s Geological features.It is a valley surrounded by very largemountains. Making the sound travel factorvery high. Regardless, I have never seenany kind of light or fire work or lighteningstrike even remotely close to this.Thank You For Your Time,Brannon G.

They first spotted the object to their left as they drove back to the city on 39th Avenue just before they reached Highway 26.  The object has &quot;massive flood lights&quot; on it, which &quot;pointed down.&quot;  The object passed within &quot;1-2 football fields&quot; of their position, although at one point, the caller reported that it &quot;went across (them).&quot;  The husband could see a peculiar &quot;shadow&quot; around (?) the object. He reported that he had never seen a UFO before, although quickly qualified it to say that he thought he had seen one 10-11 years prior.

I peeked through my blinds and saw a red light through the trees.  I went to my deck where I could see unobstructed and the red light was about 100 yards high.  It was a light that looked like a ruby with light coming through it.  It moved 2-3 degrees left and then right and then it disappeared.

They were golden in color. The middle light dimmed, then disappeared from sight.  Then the second object disappeared, then the third. She will submit a written report.", "Man called to report that he, together with three other observers, had been witness to a an occurrence involving four aircraft, three of which appeared to be conventional-type military aircraft, and the fourth appeared to be an unusual, triangular-shaped object with non-conventional lighting. The observers first noticed two aircraft, which appeared to be flying a parallel course directly south, in tandem formation, at the same altitude, and separated by only 1/2 to 1 mile.  The apparent close proximity of the two aircraft is what first drew the observers&apos; attention and caused them to conclude that they were military aircraft, as opposed to commercial or private aircraft.  The individual who called and who submitted the written report stated that he and the other observers are familiar with the general flight characteristics of aircraft flying out of Roanoke, VA, airport, and they invariably maintain greater separation than what they observed for these two aircraft that had drawn their attention. Suddenly, the observers became aware of a third &quot;aircraft,&quot; which was directly ahead of the first two aircraft.  The observers immediately developed the impression that the third &quot;aircraft&quot; was being pursued by the first two they had witnessed.  The third object was less well illuminated that the first two, and its lighting pattern consisted of three red, somewhat &quot;subdued&quot; lights, arranged in a triangular pattern. Its size was approximately that of the other two aircraft. Approximately 30-60 seconds after the observers had spotted the first two conventional aircraft, they suddenly noticed that a third aircraft was flying from the northwest directly toward the triangular aircraft, apparently on a &quot;collision&quot; course with it, closing from the starboard side of the triangular-shaped aircraft, and flying at a somewhat higher speed that the triangular ship exhibited. Within seconds of sighting the fourth aircraft, the observers realized that none of the conventional aircraft were able to keep up with the triangular craft, all of them beginning to fall behind at the latter apparently began to accelerate.  The third conventional aircraft fell behind the triangle, and began to fly parallel to the other conventional aircraft. The incident was reported to the FAA in Roanoke, VA, and to Andrews AFB.", "Young man calls to report sighting a &quot;green gaseous&quot; object that flew from north to south in the northwest sky.
