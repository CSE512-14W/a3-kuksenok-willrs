["A strange flying triangle shape object moving silently at extreme speed in the night skyOn starry night on august 15th around eighth o&apos;clock in the evening My wife and my cousin sitting on the front lawn of our house. As lied down on the lawn  and looking toward the roof of my house and watched the stars suddenly a cluster of three light stocked together to a shape like a rounded cornered triangle suddenly appeared in the dark sky moving at a very high rate of speed from the  SE toward  NW direction without any sound. We watched  and wondered what it could have been......? I&apos;m an airplane and space enthusiast and I can say with certainty what it was not !! It was not an airplane, it was not a satellite, it was not a commit, or not any kind of falling space junk. This is the first time in my life I can say with absolute certainty that I could not identify a flying object.......I would hate to say it was an alien craft because I don&apos;t believe in Intelligent extra terrestrial visits at all ! I was flying at a high altitude I would say as high as a! commercial airplane perhaps 30-40 thousand feet.silent completely for the duration we witnessed it. We were amazed of the speed and the strange shape....I would guesstimate the speed maybe twice or three times the speed of a satellite . So this is my story.", "Blue lights over escondidoIt has now been 2 times in 2 months that i have seen a blue light object coming in from the north moving south then stopping and after many minutes it ascends up.

With no clouds and with the sun out of my camera lens, I took the opportunity to take a few pictures. For a time the photographs weren&apos;t even glanced at and they were merely taking up space on my phone&apos;s meager memory space. Many months after the vacation I finally looked at my pictures. Two pictures stood out more than any others.  One of them was just an ordinary picture of the mountains; however, the second one, which was taken mere minutes after the first picture, showed six white ovals flying in tight formation over the mountains.

The UFO flew completely, eerily silent, at a low altitude probably around a few hundred feet, and at an unusually slow and constant pace. The object was dark with three large bright white lights in a triangular configuration on its underside, one toward the front, two in the back. It was somewhat difficult to make out the exact shape due to its angle, and the prominence of it&rsquo;s lights although it appeared to be flat and triangular, with each white light close to each tip. The size appeared to be around that of a large helicopter. There was one faint, small flashing light towards the front on the side of the object which seemed to emit multiple colors of w! hich I remember green, white/yellow, and blue.

It would be about 10 second intervals and then light back up again.  This occurred for 10 minutes.I can tell you that it is not a plane or helicopter.  First of all, the light was vast.  I have seen many planes fly behind my house and their beacons and strobes are green and red like most all planes.  It would also stop in the air for about 15 seconds and then continue its circular pattern.  It was also right over this field in the country.  I would estimate about 2-3 miles out due NNE. I would also say that it was 10 degrees above the horizon.  It made no noise so it definitively was not a plane or helicopter.  I hope you guys look in to this. Thanks for believing.

It moved over the Salt Lake valley. It was at about 4,000 feet off the ground. At first it was moving fairly fast and slow down.  It was slowing turning northward as it traveled. At times it almost stopped as it moved more northward. Once it was over the northern part of Salt Lake City it just disappeared.  We also viewed it with 2 pair of 10x50 Bushnell Binoculars. My Sony Handy Cam would not record it, but I could record some stars that were not even as bright as this object. Perhaps the orange color is not as recordable?

Also the next door neighbor joined us too, but became so scared she hurried back inside her home. The big Craft hovered for about an hour with 4 other orange , white and multicolored lights moving about also winking out totally at times. We viewed these objects with 10x50 binoculars and with my telescope. I put a high power lens in the telescope and the picture attached is what it kind of looked like.

It was located over the Mountains as you drive on Veteran&apos;s Memorial Parkway heady out of town.  The object was darker than the hazy afternoon sky and appeared to be square in shape.  It had definite lines and was not a cloud.  When I first saw it I thought it was a kite or something caught in a power line as I tried to judge my depth perception.  As I continued driving I watched it sitting motionless.  It became more apparent that this was actually something in the sky above the mountains and not some sort of optical illusion.I watched the object as I was parked at the stoplight at Boulder Highway and Veteran&apos;s Memorial Parkway.  I was anxious to get a better look at it by getting on the highway.  Before the light changed to green the object start to move.  It moved away very smoothly and disappeared into the hazy cloud cover.  It gradually disappeared almost like fading away.  It was moving towards the Las Vegas valley when I lost site of it.

After disregarding this one as just the usual plane, a few more appeared and they were up higher. They didn&apos;t seem to be moving at all. I went back out later and they were still there.

The moon was not yet showing and there were no clouds in the sky. I saw a brightly lit object in the sky several finger widths above the horizon and wondered which planet it was since it was too large to be a star or if I was actually seeing a satellite or the space station.  To the right of the object I saw what I thought was a plane flashing a very intense green navigation light.  I say intense because it was &ldquo;starring&rdquo;. As I watched it, the green flashing changed in color and flashing pattern. The color changed from a light green through the color spectrum to a purple between flashes or it glowed a few seconds changing colors.  The flashing pattern wasn&apos;t steady. I studied the object several minutes perceiving that its flight path was stalling, then changing course by several degrees, then correcting to its original course.  To make sure I wasn&rsquo;t seeing things I went inside to ask my brother in law to look at it as well.  I thought I was seriously seeing things.  As he came outside it was still very high in altitude but closer to us.  We both stood in my driveway looking at the object continue to change: color, light intensity, speed, and minute direction. Its general course was to the Northwest. At this time we had been watching it for 9 minutes and it was just past directly overhead.  I was expecting to see the red navigation light or an anti-collision light but there weren&rsquo;t any.  It stopped and hovered at a very high altitude for several minutes. About this time a neighbor was coming outside to get in his car and drive somewhere.  He paused for a moment looking at my bother in law am I staring at the sky above us.  Then he looked up through his windshield and promptly rolled down his window asking us what that was that we all were looking at. He said, &quot;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a plane.&quot;  To which we both said, &quot;Not sure yet, but it could be.&quot;   As we said that it started moving directly to the south.  It didn&rsquo;t make a rolling turn.  There was no normal aircraft movement in that you would normally see.  Even a fast break with speed flaps does not turn 140 degrees to the left instantly.  It continued on the southern course and a much faster rate of speed and appeared to be getting smaller.  Then it suddenly disappeared or stopped flashing.  As it did so, the stars in the area started to all blink in unison.  They blinked like this for several minutes then did the normal blinking from atmospheric condition if you will.

I am not sure that what I saw for a second heading west was also the same object but since I was keeping a careful eye in the sky was also able to catch that brief sighting.  The entire three or four second event (including three seconds from south to north and one or two in the west)was an object very high in the sky the size of satellite.  However, it was differentiated by the speed.I am an educated woman (Smith College graduate) who studied astronomy and has visited numerous observatories. I was taught by my Smith College astronomy professor to identify satellites from the Smith observatory on top of the science building.

So it was a particularly dark night, but with the brightest stars that I have seen since I was a kid growing up in Monticello 60 years ago.The objects in the sky first started appearing about 8:30.  They would first appear just over the horizon in the SW.  They approached at the speed of a high flying plane.  They were always in pairs of two, one following in the path of the other, and each the same size and shape as the other.When they got to a vertical height of about 60 degrees above the horizon, they would gradually turn black and disappear.  Moments after they would disappear another pair would start appearing over the distant horizon.  There were five sets of two that appeared this way, and then they was a time lapse, and then 3 appeared at once.  Their general appearance to the naked eye was that of a ball of fire. The shape changed when they neared the height of their visible flight.I was able to zoom and get six pictures of different sets at various stages.The 5th picture in particular, shows the degree of similiarity in size and shape between the two objects.I have no idea what they were, but I would definitely categorize them as &quot;Unidentified.&quot;", "Space Station ConfusionIt was early July, not sure of the exact date.  I came home that night and when I walked in my grandfather said that they mentioned on the local news that we would be able to see the space station tonight at a certain time. (possibly 10:55) He said last time it was in the area it passed right over our house.  So we proceeded to walk outside, we saw my uncle and his friend were across the street waiting for it as well.  So we&apos;re waiting and waiting, watching the blinking lights of a few planes, when i see a bright white light (non-blinking) heading towards my house, I said to my grandfather there it is!..  I was instantly shot down by him saying no thats not it as he points to the south of where I was looking, it was another light, bright orange moving very fast.  This orange light seemed to be a larger light than the one I first saw, probably because it was closer.  So my grandfather, my uncle his friend and I were all fixed on the orange light, convinced this was! the space station.  When my grandfather looks to where I first pointed and it was that white light I first saw now cruising right over our house, he said then oh there it is.  We all decided that was the space station, but then moved our eyes back to the bright orange light having no clue what it could be.  My gramp was in the air force for years and he said he&apos;d never seen anything like that, It then move out of our view over the tree/city line.The space station and the object were both moving from Southwest to Northeast. All of this occured within a few minutes, and there was no sound. The orange light was constant, not blinking or changing in appearance whatsoever.Later that month there was a news report from a town maybe 20-25 minutes Northeast of us, about a reported UFO sighting, and the report had pictures.  The pictures were of a bright orange ball.  We didn&apos;t think until we saw the news report that it could have been a UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.

This sighting occured on july 4th as i was taking my early morning walk. i had already walked a short distance when all of a sudden, up in the sky directly in front of me was a bright star.  But i noticed that the star seemed too bright and close to earth for that time of the morning which was at approx. 6:30am. still walking and looking up,this &quot;star&quot; seemed to be moving. i stopped walking to observe it, it looked &quot;put&quot; or &quot;still&quot;.  i started walking again, again it seemed to be moving slowly. i stopped walking again and i could see that indeed it really was moving. Then like they alway do, it changed. It went from a simulated star to a bright light that was yellow and red in color, like the color of fire. I stood there watching it as it seemed to just scurry away.

A small dim light, very high in the atmosphere moving steadily across the sky as I&apos;ve witnessed other satellites do.  The light changed color to a vivid blue then brightened and expanded to at least 3-4 times the original size, all while moving at the same steady speed.  This lasted for about 10 seconds, then the light both dimmed and went back to it&apos;s original color.

My wife and I were returning home from my sister&rsquo;s house about 20 minutes ago with our children asleep in the back seat when we saw 3 circular lights in the sky that were moving relatively quickly. We stopped the car, put on our flashers and exited the vehicle to get a better look.  There was a procession of approximately 20 to 25 of these lights that seemed to be travelling from the southwest and moving northeast across the night sky in clusters of two and three at a time with short intervals in between. They were definitely not airplanes or helicopters. They were clearly visible, yet there were no distinctive markings. The color seemed strangely ambiguous. They seemed both white and red at the same time, yet not flickering. That was my personal perception, although my wife seemed to perceive a faint flicker. They each disappeared off into the clouds one by one in the sky northeast of us. There was absolutely! no sound at all. We both witnessed this event.  Neither one of us could come up with a logical explanation of what we were viewing.  Although several cars passed us, no one else stopped or slowed to take notice of what we were looking at. I doubt highly that there is any connection of significance to the fact that we heard consistent gunfire in the area, but I will state it here as a point of fact.  We are in an area where there seems to be frequent recreational gunfire. We called my sister to describe what we were seeing, but she did not see any activity over her house roughly 30 miles away. We live in the town of Greenville, NY 12771. We share a zip code with Port Jervis, NY and obviously are very close to that town. We did not feel threatened or scared by what we saw. It was a spectacularly uncommon site. If there is a logical explanation for it, we&rsquo;d be curious to know what it is. If not, we feel very fortunate to have viewed such a unique event.", "White irregular light appears in Irish skies.East cork area, Ireland, a bright contained light developed from a pin point in the sky, moving in an easterly direction, developed into an irregular spherical shape then dissapeared instantly.

The sky was very clear and the stars were bright. We could see the Milky Way and observed a satellite going over traveling south to north, and a jet airliner with red and white lights traveling northwest toward Calgary (3 hour car drive northwest).  We saw a couple of shooting stars to the southwest.  We then observed what appeared to be another satellite &ndash; but it was traveling what we noticed was kinda the wrong direction - north to south/southwest.  We thought it seemed odd.

We stood there watching for a while, bemused. A few minutes later one appeared and disappeared then another right beside it, which seemed to move horizontally in the sky. Then we saw two come on at once, then the left one would disappear followed by the right. This pattern repeated itself with the lights, never losing altitude, though one looked like it shifted at a 45 degree angle downward and to the east, stopped for a moment, and then disappeared.

We saw a very large triangle shaped UFO. we were driving down a dirt raod, and saw a bright flashing light. we were in the middle of nowhere, when driving down a dirt road, when we saw a flashing light.  we had seen objects here before, and our intentions were to look for ufo&apos;s, this is a hot spot. people who live in this area have been chased in there cars, seen objects on a regular basis. It was 10:30pm, we went off road behind some mountains, no sooner had we come around the moutain, we saw the large flashing light. All of us were scared, but at the same time curious. my friends girlfriend was crying and telling us to turn around. we got withing 2 to 300 yards from the light. It was the size of 3 football fields. it was triangle in shape, and windows around it. it was about 3 stories tall, and about 30 feet offf the ground. we flashed our lights and it flashed back, in the same sequence of flashes. my friend James and I gout out and walked closer. the closer we got, the better we could make out what was standing in the windows. there were small big headed aliens, and then 7-to 9foot tall aliens. we based this off the size of the windows. some of the windows you could see through, the other windows were dark, but then the dark windows, cleared up one by one, and as they went clear more and more aliens appeared through the windows. James was video taping the whole time. it was a sureal expierience. i was terrified, but excited at the same time! we walked closer and had to stop because the heat coming from the craft was so intense. the craft hovered and then landed. a large pannel at the bottom of the craft opened, and then two aliens proceeded to walk out. this absolutely terrified us more, but we couldn&apos;t move or talk. i remember trying to scream, and say run, but we couldn&apos;t move, or talk. Heather and Jamie were in the car honking the horn screming to come back, but we couldn&apos;t respond or move. the a! liens wa lked up to within 20 feet of us. one of them was very thin and tall, bout 8-9 feet, the other one was about 3-4 feet. we stood there in amazement, shock because we couldn&apos;t move or speak. Then a calmness came over us they were speaking to us telepathically. they were saying not to be scared they weren&apos;t going to harm us. i remember asking why they were here in my head, and they heard what i was thinking. this conversation went on between the 4 of us for 15-20 minutes. they said they were here to help us, so that we would not destroy our planet, and that there was a horrible event coming soon, that it had to be stopped. james asked if it was something like 911, they commented no bigger, and it would come from the middle east. I was thinking to myself like I had been in this situation before, and the tall alien heard my thoughts, and repeated my name. he said yes henry you have been visited like this before, and he told me. when you were 6 in deming new mexico, you were in the desert exploring, and we talked to you then. I had blocked this out, but it all came back.  they said they new we were coming, and wanted us to warn people of global warming and what was to come if we didn&apos;t start taking care of our planet. visions of disaster entered our head, as if to show us what was to come, if we didn&apos;t warn people. the taller alien walked closer, and held my hand, and I was no longer scared, neither was James. He said that he would see him again soon, and to warn people about saving aour planet, to both James and I. James was recording the whole time. they turned returned to the craft, and it was gone in a split second. when the craft left, we both fell over like weak, stood up and made our way back to the car. when we got there Heather and Jamie weren&apos;t crying anymore, they just hugged us. when we got in the car, it wouldn&apos;t start. so we sat there for a minute, and then it just turned on, by its self. like if things couldn&apos;t have gotten any wierder. as we started to drive away, three military helicopters apper! eaed, an d were shining light on us. then  5 military hummers showed up, and a chased us. I told James to hide the camera, Jamie and heather started crying. LUke airforce base is about 10 miles away from where were at. I tried running, but over a speaker they told us to pull over or they would be foreced to shoot at us. we pulled over, and military soldiers surrounded the car. Two men dressed in black, opened the door, and asked us to get out. One of them looked like I had seen him before. He asked us to get out and both men in black questioned us, while the military personell searched the car. the men in black asked us what we saw, how long we were there, what we were doing there, if we had any contact with the alien craft. the size, shape, what we saw, if they communicated with us. we answered no to everything, and then one of the soldiers found the video camera. The men in black reviewed it, and said we were not to speak of this. they took the camera, and took me with them. James, heather, and jamie asked where they were taking me, and they said don&apos;t worry about it. I left with them and they questioned me in the car. I kept looking at the one man dressed in black because i had seen him before. He asked why i kept starring at him, and said do i look familiar, scared I said no. they questioned me more, on what they said to me, and if I had ever seen or expirenced this before. I said no, and the at the I-10 highway, by the tonopah joes resturant, they let me out and then they were gone. i called James on his cell phone and they picked me up. it was a crazy night, but i had to report this. if anything happens to me James, will contaact someone, at your facility. our evidence is gone, but this really happened. we questioned people who lived in the area this morning, and they all saw the craft, and all the military soon after. this morning while questioning people who lived in the area, they all said that the military helicopters were flying over early in the direction from where they saw the craft. we drove down t! he I-10 to where we turned off of and there were military soldier who had the road blocked off, and helicopter flying to and from that area, so we aren&apos;t crazy, and there are 4 of us who wittnessed this, along with the people who live in the area who saw the craft. we talked to 15 people who lived in the area and all, but one saw the craft, the other one an old lady said she was asleep, but was woken up by the mititary heleicopters, and they have been going back and forth since midnight last night. I hope my story opens peoples eyes, and they see we are not alone, and the aliens are just trying to help us save our planet, and live peacefully.

As i was looking up in the sky the flash happened again but very low on the ground and it looked crisp white and rectangular in appearance. It actually looked like a camera flash from about 250 feet away. There area that this flash occurred is an old garden plot grown up in weeds. A big clear field behind that. No houses for 1/4 mile. I saw it flash bright one more time and I went to the bedroom and told my wife there was a a strange light in the backyard and I was going out there to see what it was. She got up and went to the window and I heard her say, &quot;I just saw it too, what is it?&quot; I told her I didn&apos;t know but I was getting my flashlight and going out there to see. I walked out through the back yard and pointed my light all around. There was nothing , no sound either. Then as I ! was shining the light out in front of me my wife said, hey did you see it. I said no, she said to your left, and I pointed my light off to the left. Nothing. Then she said can&apos;t you see that? I did it again, same spot. Nope I didn&apos;t see any flash. About that time my hair stood up on the back of my neck. I began walking back to the house and I saw the flash reflect off the house. By this time my daughter had awaken hearing her mom talking in the dark bathroom out the window to me got her curious. She saw it also. I then walked back out toward the flash and it looked like it was now right next to the ground as I could see the outline of the weeds in the light. It flashed twice right next to the ground. Then a few minutes passed and I saw it flash but this time it was like a beam that pointed up in the sky away from us. Then it flashed again but very dull. Well, I had had enough of guessing what it was and decided to get in the car and drive around the block to the back of our! property and shine the car lights out there. My daughter went! with me and she stayed in the car and I got out with my flashlight. I walked all over the area where we saw it. Nothing. I drove back to the house and it had stopped flashing. My wife and daughter went to bed. I continued to watch out the bathroom window and for about 45 minutes nothing happened. I had given up and just as I stepped out of the bathroom into the hall it flashed two more times. And then two more times after that. That is when I came to the computer and wrote this out. I saw it flash 11 times.", "7 bright orange glowing lights in a steady formation going NW.My husband and I came home after picking up groceries late that night. As we were getting everything out of the car I noticed seven large low bright orange glowing balls flying in a uniform formation.There were three in a line, side by side with three in a line with one light below them in a triangle shape. It may have been separate objects or lights on one very large circular or oval shaped object--- it reminded us a lot of the phoenix lights- just glowing orange.There was no sound or &quot;jet trails&quot;.  They looked similar to paper glowing air lanterns-- but I do not believe they were because the wind was blowing in the opposite direction, and the objects kept their shape and stayed true.They were moving in a northwestern direction, traveling at a speed similar to geese flying.I can&apos;t believe someone else saw this too I blogged about it and received no response.

I was traveling easterly and the object appeared stationary and slightly to the north relative to my point of observation.  The size of the light was larger than normal planet observations and I believe in the wrong part of the sky for any common astrological phenomenon that I am familiar with (please note that I do not have a background in astronomy).I pointed the object out to my wife and son (daughter was asleep) and we tried to figure out what it was.  We all continued to watch the object while completing the remainder of our trip home (~1/4 mile). Shortly after turning on to the access road to our condo complex we all realized that there were multiple objects of the same size and basic characteristics described earlier.  My wife passed our point and shoot digital camera to me and I began to take video footage while finishing the drive home (hand out the window, very shaky).After we parked we continued to observe the objects along with several neighbors who also noticed the activity in the sky.  As we watched there were at least 24 of the objects traveling in pairs along what appeared to be the same flight path (traveling at relatively low altitude in a southeasterly direction toward Easton&rsquo;s Point, then ascending).  When the objects reached a similar altitude they disappeared.None of the observers present could readily account for the origin or purpose of the lights.General Background: Weather Conditions--mostly clear skies, ~70 F, low humidity, near full moon.

I was not wearing my watch, so the time of 11:00PM is only a guess, but I judge to have been in bed about an hour, having retired about 10:00PM. We were on the fifth (5th) floor of the hotel; our room faced west, facing the ocean, and the drapes were partially open to allow a cool breeze to enter the room.The sky was clear, as it had been most of the day, because I could faintly see stars. I was lying in bed and looking out the door to the balcony. I had a clear view of the sky, though somewhat narrow because of the doorframe on one side and the edge of the sliding glass door on the other side, perhaps 4 feet in width. The room was dark. There suddenly appeared a long, bright light that appeared to be on a parallel course with the coastline and heading north, then suddenly made a sharp, 900 right-hand turn without slowing down and headed inland. I am not a good judge of altitude, but this thing was either flying low or it was very large.I am red-green color blind, but the object appeared to be a bright green in color. There was absolutely no sound whatsoever, only the faint sound of the ocean, but the object remained very bright for the short amount of time I was able to observe it. The bright color trailed behind the object, much like a long tail on a kite. I couldn&rsquo;t see any more than that because my field of vision was obstructed by the doorframe. The object appeared cylindrical but with no clearly marked back end to it. I observed this object for about 3 seconds before it disappeared to the east. I am retired from the security industry as a Field Supervisor, and during my twenty years I learned to be very observant of my surroundings, and to look for details. Prior to that I was in the U.S. Navy stationed aboard an aircraft carrier. During my years of watching jet aircraft of all types, I do not remember seeing any jet make the kind of maneuver that resembled the one I saw this object make. Nor do I recall seeing any jet aircraft of any kind travel at such an extremely high rate speed.", "Deep-Orange Pulsating Object flying slowly over a suburb of PittsburghWe were approaching the cemetery, taking the back road to a friend&apos;s house and I looked to the sky and saw what looked like a low-flying plane at first. The light coming off was a solid deep-orange, but also pulsated. The object was coming in our direction maintaining its height, and stopped almost seemingly noticing it was being watched. The objects color disappeared and a solid black sphere could be seen. The sphere moved back and forth a bit, slowly, and began to faintly light orange. Then the object stayed the black color, and traveled the opposite direction from which it came, seemingly flying lower as it traveled off. I also tried to take a video of the object but my cell phone would not pick it up!", "spots in the sky that appear suddenly and disappear just as suddenly ... photographedOn 1/3/09 I was photographing a sunset and noticed a white spot appear in my camera below cloud level that hadn&rsquo;t been visually preceded by anything in that part of the sky. It didn&rsquo;t appear to be a plane due to the absence of blinking lights or any lead up to its appearance. It clearly didn&rsquo;t seem to be a satellite since it was below cloud level.The event became more peculiar because then a second bright spot appeared next to it for about a minute and then one of the two disappeared (a hard thing for a satellite or plane to do, if that&rsquo;s what they were.)  After three minutes, I lost view of any spot in the nearly dark sky.The reason I decided to report this is because I photographed a series of eight very clear images of that three minute span and continue to be baffled by looking at those pinpoints of light below cloud level.If viewing the images is deemed worth your while, I need some guidance as to how to do so.   The fact that there is such precise time related data on the camera further prompted me to write a report", "yelow/orange light  quite large, no noise and got smaller until it vanishedMyself, my husbad, son and his girlfriend were sitting outside when my son noticed an yellowy/orange coloured light in the sky.

My husband and I went outside in the parking lot to smoke.  An acquaintance was outside as well and alerted us to a flaming red/orange light in the shape of a long, narrow, lateral rectangle in the southern sky, moving slowly and horizontally on a very determined smooth course, being the size of a nickel at arms length, and at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet.  The object as it headed due north reaching closer to the horizon made a steady incline, yet it did not become smaller as most aircrafts would at an incline-it just disappeared.  It was proceeded by three more on the exact same coarse as the first from south to north.During the time of these sightings, several other people came out to witness.  There were a total of nine witnesses including a confused government contractor working for the Department of Homeland Security&apos;s Transportation Safety Administration.The next round of objects (three total) originated from the west to east (toward us) then veering off to the north. Heading in the same northern direction as the other four. Directionally as they headed toward us they appeared as round flaming red/orange balls, but as they veered their coarse to the north we could then see the rectangular shape.The night sky was very clear and there were no trails from these objects. It was obvious They had a definite, intelligent flight plan.The next day the phone system of the entire Motel was out of order.", "Star-looking object beneath the clouds stopping and startingLooking into the sky almost directly southwest of my location I noticed a far away object that resembled a large star or planet- not terribly different looking from the appearance of Venus under good conditions.  The sky was fairly overcast at the time of sighting and the object appear in front of very thick clouds indicating it was not any form of celestial body. The object was completely stationary for a short period of time but started moving West.  The movement was slow and first then the object proceeded to accelerate  and slow again somewhat sporadically.  The movement was unlike any aircraft I&apos;ve seen.  The movement was not perceived based on the movement of clouds; I was tracking it solely based on it&apos;s position relative to the moon. After moving for approximately thirty seconds to one minute it stopped again and was completely stationary.  As soon as it stopped, I went inside to get my phone and look up the number for the hotline.  I place the call less than two minutes later and it was still visible and still stationary. The object was perceived to be at the same altitude as the clouds as it would disappear under very heavy cloud coverage although it still shone bright even in lower cloud coverage that blocked most of the light from the moon.  As heavier clouds moved by it, I saw for a split second what could have been a second object that appeared slightly further West and visually lower than the first.  I was not exposed to the second object to rule out the possibility of it being a celestial body however I do not recall seeing it in clear skies as I did the first.", "Silent, erratic, ultra-fast tour over Missoula area of 3-5 copper-colored craft.Completely silent and faster than anything I&apos;ve seen fly-- circling the city from northeast to west clockwise, out of sight within a minute or so.

This was probably around mile marker 65 on I-35, but at the time I didn&rsquo;t think to check my exact location.  Around 8:40 pm, a light was visible out the front window of my car, but toward the right side.  I&rsquo;d estimate it was approximately 30 degrees right of straight ahead.  This means it was probably approximately straight west of my location.  The sky was dark.  I saw a white fireball descending diagonally as it moved from right to left.  It looked to me like what I would expect a meteor to look like, and initially it moved in a straight line.  It produced a white light and had a tail of &ldquo;sparks&rdquo; behind it as it moved, like a comet.  It looked something like certain kinds of fireworks I have seen that carry a flare and trail sparks behind.  From time to time, it appeared that a burning chunk would break off and fall behind into the tail because the main light would flare up a! little bit and a brighter portion would then be visible moving into the tail portion.  So far, it appeared to me to be a meteor.  However, after it descended traveling from right to left, it leveled off and proceeded to the left while climbing again.  Once it had climbed again, it appeared to stop in the air for a while before moving down and to the right.  It moved around several times, remaining visible for what was probably 2-3 minutes.  Finally it rose up, stopped trailing its tail, and became small and indistinguishable from a star in both size and color.  It was then obscured by some trees I drove past and I wasn&rsquo;t able to determine if it was still there after that.  I didn&rsquo;t see it move again.", "Two bright lights flying very low and very close togetherI was driving on Rt. 5 in Wallingford with a friend when I looked to the east and noticed two lights in the sky. I determined they were stationary because after only 30 seconds of driving down the road they were almost behind me. Also they were flying extremly close together and very low. I only find this odd because tonight was completely cloudy, you couldnt see a single star at that time. Strangely these two objects looked like stars, flickering and very bright. Once again let me stress that there is absolutely no way that these objects were stars, it was just too cloudy.

While sitting in our lawn chairs, facing due east, we  were scanning the sky but no really looking for anything.  It was relatively clear night with just a few low level clouds.  After a short period of time (15 minutes) a bright object was observed traveling in a south east direction.  The object appeared to be twice as large as Venus, moving very fast (twice as fast an airplane) and dimmed in brightness as it&rsquo;s distance from us increased.  We assumed it was the ISS with the docked shuttle Endeavor.    This initial sighting was approximately 30 minutes after sunset.From that point onward we observed multiple lights exhibiting various levels of brightness and speed.  Our observations lasted until approximately 10:30pm CST.  We assumed that the lights we saw were satellites in orbit.  If this is the correct explanation what explains the variable brightness, speed, and the large number of objects?  The path of the objects appeared random.  Some traveled directly north, while others traveled east, south, west, and varying combinations.  More than one object exhibited brightness variations even though the sun had set one hour before.The objects were star like and fast.  In one case a commercial airliner was flying due west and was overtaken (as viewed from our perspective) by one of the star like objects flying in the same direction.  Our interpretation was that the smaller object was at a substantially higher altitude ... possibly low earth orbit.  At one point we saw four objects moving in separate directions.((NUFORC Note:  ISS sighting.  Satellites are different sizes, and have different albedos.

The loud booms and lights in the sky were fireworks from a nearby racetrack in Kennedale, Tx. at 10:30pm to 12:30 am.

In this case it should be very very easy to confirm the same sighting, because a formation of 50-100 objects in such a shape is very very unique. On the local web sites, news papers etc.  I found nothing.On youtube some videos: &quot;Lots of UFOs in Vienna on July 9.&quot;   But those are single points or maybe 2 points moving in the sky.  Could be anything.Final line:  I was unable so far to get a 2nd person on a different position to confirm the fomation flight, to do a triangulation.I found on youtube one Video (UFO footprint on moon) which represents a similar ARC as I saw. Recorded in July.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qen_C6aYSKMSo, my question to you is:  Do you know a European good reporting site, where I could post the sighting, and where others could respond then?Unfortunately there is so much trash in the net about UFOs; 99.9% is unusble, and wasted time to read. (and very timeconsuming)  In case I get a 2nd person to confirm the sighting, I will let you know. Greetings from Austria((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM #1))((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2))Peter, no problem for the short message.I will just let you know what is the current status and how it continues.1.

Visibility of the formation from my position to the west is unlikely, because it UK/London it is at 9:00pm local time too bright. And the objects have been too small.3. Hot Air-Baloons? A German specialist from CNAP told me: that these objects where just those chinese burning baloons. (definitively not because -4. Asked at the ZAMG (Central Station for Meteorology and Geological Dynamic in Vienna) about wind direction and speed on 7/9/09 22:00. It was 9m/s in 1200feet, direction from 270Deg (WESTWIND) (Baloons, Paragliders etc. do not fly against the wind)5. US-Army Jet Fleet from Iraq to UK. Very unlikely that 100 Jets, in 60.000 feet (where they do not make much noise).PENDING: I am checking, at which elevation at 22:00 local time Geographic position 48N 16E, the sun is still visible. I beleive, since the stars where visible, it should be above 50km (150.000feet). In that case, 100% NO for Jet transfer. They travel max. at 25.000m6. I expanded the trak of the observation now to the EAST. (286 Deg was the heading).7. The track crosses exactly the Black Sea, north of Turkey.8. My colleague in Istanbul told me, that he got in tough on June 15. with lot of People of the UFO-Conference in Istanbul (Erik v. Daeniken, ... and many others)9. My colleague will forward the immage I reconstructed to those people. He said, that since Jun 15. they observed a massive amount of objects above the black sea! Same as in 1999, where a large earthquake killed 60.000 People in North or Turkey. (official numbers are 20.000).10. 1999 and July 22. Solar Eclipse causes with very high likelyhood heavy earthquakes. This is in relation with UFO observation. Final line:In case I will get any confirmation of this unique observation, I will let you know.  It could be the largest amount of UFOs observation in a single case ever. Worth to continue.I have attached a reconstruction how the sky looked like. See the many tiny dots in the middle of the picture.Sorry for the lengthy email. With kind regards  ((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM #2))", "Rectangular UFO sighted on I-75 in Florida8/2/09 As I was traveling North on I-75 in Florida at approximately 10:30 A.M., between Mile Markers, 270 and 276, I observed a rectangular object that was charcoal in color traveling from the East to the West and was very clearly visible against the white clouds.  It was fairly low in the sky.  I first thought it to be a sign pulled by an airplane, but as I got closer it was obvious that there was no writing on it.  It was somewhat transparent but charcoal in color.  And I would say the dimensions would be similar to a tractor-trailer or train boxcar.  It was perfectly rectangular in shape. I took some pictures with my I-phone but was traveling approximately 78mph and taking them with one hand while driving.  This is a low quality camera and I do think  I can see the object in a couple of them.  I would like to discuss this event with anyone who has seen a similar object.I am a retired Tool Maker, sixty year old Male.", "Extremely bright flashing orb seen directly overhead.On the evening of August 20, 2009, my mother and I were out on our deck at approximately 9:50 pm with the porch lights off to look for satellites.  I was facing almost directly west, looking up towards the Big Dipper, when I saw a bright flash out of the corner of my eye.  I looked where I had seen the flash, in the constellation Hercules, near the star Sigma, and saw a reddish point of light traveling south through Hercules.I stood up, watching it, and said &ldquo;What the **** is that?&rdquo;  My mother looked up where I was pointing, and as she did so, the object flashed again.  The flash was extremely bright, and it charged up first, flashed bright enough that it almost hurt the eyes, and then dimmed back to the reddish color again.  It proceeded to do this 2 more times as it traveled through Hercules, past the stars Eta and Epsilon, and then continued without flashing until it faded from sight.  I can&rsquo;t imagine that anyone in the area looking at the sky that night didn&rsquo;t see it.About an hour later, I was outside by myself smoking a cigarette, and a small reddish light that I believe was the same object came back through the sky going the opposite direction, coming from the southwest, curving around Vega and then continuing northeast until it passed behind some clouds.  A flash was seen behind the clouds, but I can&rsquo;t be sure that it wasn&rsquo;t lightning.", "UFO sighting in the eastern night sky over very populated area.A few nights ago I was in my front lawn around between 2am and 4am smoking. I was gazing into the sky and saw what looked like a very bright star. I knew it could not be a star because it was so close and the color of the sun. I went online to see if there were suppose to be any visible planets that night, which it said there was so I figured it was a planet. Last night July 12 2009 at 4am I was outside again and saw the same star object in the same place so I assumed again it was a planet in the eastern sky. What caught my attention this time as I was gazing at the planet/star it was moving. I was startled and confused to what I was seeing. It was the same object as I saw before a few weeks ago round bright orange and kind and a lower point to it but not exactly sure, but this time i saw it kind of swaying back and forth. This time I knew what I was seeing was not a planet or star and was not a helicopter because it was way to big to be one. My step dad was here asleep and I decided to wake him thinking maybe he should take a look at this. I woke him and had him follow me outside to show him what I was seeing and it was gone! I told myself planets do not disappear in five minutes and they do not sway back and forth. The night was a clear night, no sign of clouds and this sighting was over a highly populated city. Now that I have seen this object twice I am going to set up a video camera and hopefully will get the chance to get this object on camera.", "Twinkling light  (not moving) in part  of sky where no stars normally are at that time of the morningI was outside briefly to have a cigarette and happened to look up to the NNW, fairly low in the sky, when I saw a twinkling light..as bright as Venus. Do not know how long it had been there. Since there are no stars in that part of the sky at that time of the morning I waited to see if it would move...but it did not. After about 5 minutes I went to go back in and again looked in the same direction, but alas it was gone!!!!((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))I sent a report earlier re: twinkling light.The other night, a plane was coming in for a landing at the local airport and was exhibiting the same characteristics.  But this time I witnessed it turning.So please delete the first report....as it was also probably an airplane.Thanks((END ADDENDUM))", "Very bright object aprox 1000ft agl, steady west to east course, suddenly dims to complete dark.

The lights were flying sincronized, keeping distance of aprox one meter away from each other and fade away once they crossed the road.  I was driving and was about 50 meters fron lights crossing.", "At least 7 high speed lights seen over Tuscaloosa/Hillcrest, ALI went outside to have a cigarette on my balcony (which faces east south east) and saw strange lights moving in a pattern which no airplane could.  I counted at least 7 but there could&apos;ve been as many as 12.  The lights would come and go like fire-flys.  It looked like bee&apos;s swarming around a nest.  They were all moving at incredibly high speed doing loops and rolls, but not like an airplane could.  All the turns were incredibly tight.  It&apos;s been about thirty minutes and its still going on.  I wish I had a camera.", "2 Bright Red lights moving in opposite directions (South and North) very slowly just below the clouds. No sound.", "Very loud slow moving equilateral triangular aircraft with 3 white lights on bottom connected by red/peach colored linesThis happened on 8/3/09 around 23:34.  I was in bed when I heard an extremely loud grating engine sound.  It didn&apos;t sound like any aircraft I&apos;ve ever heard before and I actually thought it might be a plane about to crash into my building.  I live in an apartment in an industrial building and have no other neighbors, so as far as I know I am the only witness.  My building faces an open field on the edge of a bay and a marina to the left/north and also another industrial building across the street.  Beyond the bay is an oil refinery of which some of the lights are visible above the roof of the building, those lights are a steady orange.  I got out of bed and went to my window to look when it sounded like it had passed overhead.  All my lights were out so I was able to see fairly decently in the dark and what I saw was a black equilateral triangular aircraft flying overhead going east.The points of the triangle were pointy, not rounded.  If I had to guess at the dimensions, I&apos;d say this would be approximately 40-50 feet long on each side but I confess I am not spacially adept.  I saw a plane flying in the same area heading north the next night and in comparison to this aircraft the plane is  tiny.  I was only able to see the bottom of the aircraft so I have no description of thickness or what the top or sides of it looked like.  I can&apos;t estimate very well how high up it was but I might say a few hundred to 1000 feet above my building.  It seemed to be moving more slowly than a normal airplane would be flying.  The aircraft was solid and each point of the triangle had a large white light and the lights appeared to be connected by thick red/peach colored lines.  There were no lights in the center of it and no other lights that I saw.One of the points of the triangle was pointed toward the direction the aircraft was headed.  So, looking at the back end of the aircraft, the light on the right side of it was flashing in a steady rhythm, maybe 1 flash every 2 seconds or so, it was the only light flashing and only in white.  While the other two lights were not lighting up, they were still visible.  After a couple of minutes, the light at the front of the triangle began to flash white just like the other light and the two lights alternated in a steady rhythm.  I watched this fly in a fairly straight path until it was almost to faint to see, I never saw the third light flash.I do live 30 miles from a military base and considered it might be something from them but I don&apos;t know what aircraft out there is triangular.  I also live in the flight path of helicopters from our hospital and know this was not a helicopter. I spent some time looking at images online the next day and know this wasn&apos;t an Aurora or a stealth plane, nor was it an Osprey based on the pictures I found.  The object was solid and didn&apos;t have any wings.  It was literally a flying triangle and extremely loud, unlike any other aircraft I have ever heard or seen before.  I&apos;m extremely curious to know what it was that I saw!", "Orange square lighted object with a dot in the middle.It was a square lighted object with a light in the middle.  Orange in color.  Went right over me in a straight line with no sound.  Lasted about 5 to 10 sec!!!Bizzare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Huge black triangle seen traveling in North East direction in BangaloreI am not very sure weather it was 28th or 29th of Jan 2009 but sure about the timing.  My house is in suburb of Bangalore and area is not densely populated.   Around 8.15 pm myself and my brother-in-law who had come to my home went out get some ice creams.  We were walking back to my house and we are looking at the clear sky and discussing about stars.  We saw a slow moving black object appeared on top of us moving in North-East direction.  For a second we were shocked we ran to my house  which was about 20 feet away and I called my wife out, three of us went to terrace and saw triangle move away slowly, after about a minute and half it disappeared from our view.  Since the triangle passed right above us were able to make out that it was a triangle, it was completely noiseless, moving as if its cruising.  It was moving at very low altitude i would guess not more than 70-80 meters from the ground. It had one red light in the centre of the triangle.  It was huge prob! ably size of a football stadium.  I am a guy who follow aircraft and aviation industry very closely and none of the know aircrafts come any where close to the triangle in terms of shape, size or cruising.  We did not discuss this with any one else as UFO phenomenon is not so common in India nor there is any established reporting centre yet in India.  I was debating weather to report or not.  Finally I decided report incident.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Bright white light headed east, dissappeared when aircraft 5 aircrafts headed towards itStepped outside to smoke a cigarette, I looked up at the sky seen a light like a star..  It was heading east got brighter then i seen to the west a aircraft headed straight for it along with one headed from the south changing route into the lights direction then another headed from the north diverting direction towards the light as well.. Then the light was completely gone then the air crafts, headed straight east.After that about 1 hour later the light reappeared and was headed west this time and shinning brighter as if it was closer. I tried to get video or picture of what all happened but do not have a proper camera for the job.", "craft was a silver circle with 6 distinct lights (2 green, red and white)My nephew commented on a roaring sound, it was a constant white noise.  A few seconds later my son cried out, &quot;What is that?&quot;.  Looking up into the sky I saw a circular object with 6 lights near the edge.  As I recall there were 2 red lights near the front, 2 white lights near the middle and 2 green lights near the back.  The craft was moving from east to west and I was facing north. The craft appeared to be white or silver and was maybe 400-500 feet above us (guesstimate).  The craft was moving at a steady pace/quickly across the sky.  I was baffled as to what the object was and went to get my sister.  The same type of craft was seen again at approx. 21:45 but at a higher altitude.", "Fire orange sphere moving towards my town/ Unusual northern lights like a full moon risingJuly 21, 2009, at 10:30 pm I was out side watching the stars.  It is a common thing I like to do, I noticed a small light above the Cascade mountians coming towards my home town.  It was fire orange moving at a pretty good speed.  I know it was no satellite because it wasn&apos;t very high in the sky.  As it got closer It began to slow down.  I was so exited to see something way out of the ordinery.  As it got to be a mile and a half away I could see it much better.  Its flight pattern was not exactly a straight line,but more zig-zag or wavey.  It was perfectly round and very bright fire orange. as it drew near my town it began to dimmer into a smaller size light and zipped away in a very fast manner. After that I turn to walk back to my house and noticed something else that was going on.  Unusual northern lights to the north,the sun went down a few hours ago and there is no moon this time of month.  I got my wife out of bed to tell and show her what just happened she said that it looks like the sun is going rise from the east like a morning effect,but it looked like moon light....((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were about 10 people in the street watching.The highest craft had two bright white lights on it, and the craft appeared to be hovering, then moving a few feet, and then hovering again.Beneath this craft was a second craft that had two very bright neon-blue lights. It made wide circles about 100 feet under the other craft.Both craft made small changes in altitude and direction, but generally stayed in the area above our neighborhood for about 15-20 minutes or so.A third craft (with blinking red and white lights on it) started to close on the higher craft, and this one looked more like a conventional aircraft.At one point it flew between the two craft (below the higher one and above the lower one). At that point the lower one (with the bright neon-blue lights on it) began flying in a fast semi-vertical circular pattern.The third craft continued on, and eventually the higher-flying craft began to fly away in a northwestern direction.I ran to my house and got my camera, but by then they were all gone.  I checked, and no else had a camera to take any photos.I called the Modesto Police Dept. to see if anyone else had reported seeing the lights.  I was told that someone else had called in, but no record was made of the call.  Nor were they interested in making one of my call.", "falling white light stops then travels nwi was laying in bed when my girlfriend spotted out of our N.E. facing window what looked like a shooting star falling but it was traveling much slower then a meteorite but faster then a plane, i ran outside and it stopped horizon level just long enough to continue heading NW traveling the same speed. white ball of light. i know the space shuttle reentered today but this was traveling away from florida. the time was 2:40. did not hear any noise from the thing.", "burning fireball in sky mistook for moon!Last night my girlfriend and I came home from dinner and we went outside to have a cigarette.  Right as I stepped outside I looked to the lower northern sky and noticed something very piculiar! at first I thought i was looking at the moon due to the shape and size that it normally would have been.  But it looked to be glowing or burning?  The first thing I said to my girlfriend was,  &quot;Hey, look at the moon, it looks like it&apos;s on fire!&quot; She turned around, and we both looked in amazment as the burning sphere in the sky shifted its light source within itself.  At first the entire object was a red/maroon color. over the next two minutes the object seemed to transform the light within, shifting it downward and then upward within the sphere.After a few minutes the object dropped in the sky and we could see it through some trees approx. 3 miles from us.  After that it seemed to fade away and disapear.So, am I crazy or did anyone else see what my girlfriend and I know we saw?   Very interested in knowing!!", "I was in the backyard with my girlfriend when we saw bright green glowing ball which seemed to fall at a 60 degree angle.  It disappeared behind some houses, but it was an illuminating green color that emitted radiance like a green glow stick.  It was huge, not like a falling star.  It had a short tail and appeared in the west sky.  It was partly cloudy, but the object could clearly be seen.  It was so bright and close that it grabbed our attention and made us stop what we were doing.", "New Mexico  bright light and many pods flying aboutIt was around 12:40 am.

Then I saw another flashing red, white and blue light .I lay down on my chaise lounge and looked up with my binoculars and saw what appeared to be a fuzzy white type of sphere much larger than the lights or stars move from east to west and then it suddenly started flashing the red , blue and white lights right in front of my eyes.  I called out my fiancee&rsquo; who also watched these lights move from one area of the sky to another, mostly in the south now.  My son came home and watched with us and we all saw two of the strange lights follow an airplane heading southwest&mdash;same direction.

I saw many airplanes and could distinguish the difference.

My partner and I were seeing off friends in our back yard and while looking looking into the sky towards the south I noticed a slow moving bright orange object moving from the south-west towards true south .We are located at Launceston, Tasmania and the object was initially travelling from south-west towards south-east and then seemed to turn right heading south and also climbing away.  My partner suggested it was an aircraft but I was sure it wasn&rsquo;t as there were no red or green flashing navigation lights and I also believed it was not in a viable flight path area as it would have created a problem for normal Launceston airport air traffic . Launceston airport is south of the city of Launceston and the position of this object was at high altitude but seemingly directly above the airport .The object being at a high altitude was of only the size of a star but distinctly bright orange in color . There was scattered cloud and as the object climbed away the intensity of brightness began to vary until eventually we could not see it .I would like to say that I am an astronomy enthusiast and often gaze at the night sky whilst having a cigarette in our back yard and try to identify sky objects such as planets and various stars and sometimes see sattelites . I am certain I have not mistaken this object for a normal aircraft and while I would be thrilled at the prospect of proof of alien visitors buzzing around our world in spaceships , I would never generate a hoax or false claim of this nature . I was going to run inside to grab my digital camera but I realised that the object was going to be out of view within seconds and at best a photo would have only shown a faint , starlike object .From Launceston , Tasmania((NUFORC Note:  Could not have been the ISS, which was visible from this location only during morning hours on July 17, 2009.

The object first appeared to be higher than the hills but soon completely dropped out of view, only to then go vertical, and then change directions again going left to right and then right to left at a very high rate of speed.The object appeared to be the size of a star, with light colors ranging from mainly white to red as well as green.

It was like a mass of lights all bunched together.  I couldn&apos;t tell the shape of the craft, and the lights were all different colors and blinking.  I looked, couldn&apos;t figure out what it was, and sat back down.  Then I got up a couple minutes later and looked again and it was still just sitting there.

The UFO was a white dot it kind of looked like the international space station does when it goes over. It had no blinking lights like the jets. It looked peaceful, moved slowly it looked to me as if the jets were escorting it somewhere.We live close to the airport and it has an air defense base, I heard jets take off about ten minutes before, they were heading north then turned east, when I saw the two jets following this craft side by side they were head south west.I remember the time being 9:03am because that is when I twittered about it.", "Black Triangle over Louisville Ford plant.I was driving along LaGrange Road, between I-265 and the watterson, when to my left there appeared to be a triangular shaped aircraft traveling very slowly. It appeared to be moving over the Ford plant. The craft seemed to be about 300 feet off the ground, judging by the trees. It was an equilateral triangle, made up of 3 white lights with another in the center. Two other flashing lights that switched from red to white were between 2 of the points of the triangle. It appeared to be moving left to right. I was unable to judge the size because of a lack of reference points.

I immediately showed the person next to me as we watched it fly off in a chaotic zig zag. It moved very fast and had extremely sharp turns to think it was a plane.

The star like object made a short, slight awkward movement downwards, then accelerated about 5 inches to right in the sky according to my perspective.  After accelerating very quickly to the right for a short moment, it disappeared from view.  No flash or anything, just disappeared.  The object appeared just like a star in the sky, white and twinkling.  I am a recent college grad and interested in the ufo phenomenon.

My father was driving, we were just driving through Victorville, Ca on Palmdale Rd. As I looked into the sky, I thought about a cousin who once shared with me her UFO sighting experience. So I thought I might just get to see one. I had seen a few shooting stars but remembered how my cousin told me about what the light looked like.I was looking at the big dipper and looked at the North star and all the other bright stars. I looked again observing The Big Dipper and suddenly I saw what appeared to be a circle. It was orange with some red. The light was solid, not blinking, no color change. I had never seen a star like that&hellip;..at the same time I saw an airplane and its light blink red and blue. I tried reaching for my camera but not taking my eye off the object. I knew then that there are no orange stars, not normal. I asked my dad for the time, 10:35 pm.The orange circle then began to move slowly side to side but in a circular motion. It visually wasn&rsquo;t to far from a star. It then began to move fast past the star. The circle seemed to be as far as a star but I knew it was in our atmosphere. It then began to move higher into the sky and it quickly hit a right and suddenly stopped. Right before my eyes the light just got super small and disappeared as if it bolted at lightning speed.It is Friday, July 24, 2009 and I cant believe that I had that experience. I don&rsquo;t know what to think of it. I know what I saw is real. I always believed in martians. I feel weird. I now want to go out late night and observe the sky.

I approached me from the East as I awaited it to change course to the South West, the norm, as it never did I suddenly realized it was something different! The clock was 9:14 Luppini time, only found in Jessup, PA.After stopping for the Stop sign, I traveled about 600 feet and pulled off the road just as another car passed me. I was across from an inspection station garage.I got out of the car as the Orange Ball was descending toward the ball park&apos;s high tension power lines that cut right through the middle of the complex three fields plus.I could hear an electronic type crackling noise very similar to a continuous mosquito zapper as it approached closer in the near still quiet! A sliver in the clouds opened up leaving me with a clear overview! The Orange Ball was headed toward the top of the high tension electrical lines for sure! My immediate view was now looking straight up under it as if it were an ultra-lite type aircraft.It was stepping downwardly by first floating forward and slightly upwardly in a jerking type motion going out about 50 feet or so with four or five jerks then dropping down sharply at a very steep slope rapidly coming to a stop (similar to a mountain climber descending a steep incline) It then repeated this over and over again step by step coming down slow but surely and cautiously! I seemed to be aware of my presence as may have been the reason it was so cautious. I observed this for about 8 to 10 downward steps now having descended about 800 feet and still coming down! I immediately rushed back into the car to dig out an old 35 mm camera in a box in the back seat and tried to get a shot using the camera setting in place as it was dark and I had no light! While doing this I missed the low point of the Orange Ball as it was already stepping upwardly reversing steps and I only got one shot because as I rewound the   sudden down pour of rain was unbelievable.The clouds closed up and in upon the Orange Ball as I dove back into the car all wetalong with the camera! It should be noted that when first sighted the size appeared to be about half the)size of a car (elev 2000&apos;)and about the size of a car at its lowest point(elev 500&apos;).It&apos;s apperance was multi colored 1) black nose, 2) then dark red behind the black, 3) then red behind the dark red, 4) then dark orange behind the red, 5) then  bright orange behind the dark orange, 6) then bright white light behind the bright orange.The Orange Ball made no noise with exeption to the electrical crackling and zapping as it moved very slowly in a floating like motion! I think it was gathering the lose EMFs from atop the high tension electrical power lines like maybe rechargin itself! Last fourth of July two groups both before and after the fire works display observed the Orange Ball! Over the last 40 or so years many have reported white blob type sightings usually under 200 feet.It acted like a timmed animal when being fed some food off the back porch as it was so-so cautious as it knew it could not come in contact the electrical power lines and unable to see clearly in the low lyng rain clouds, but!probably needed to recharge or die! If only I had my binoculars as at its lowest point (400&apos; elev) I could have really seened the detail.I then went down Hill Street to the Convient Mart to see if the local Cops were on their coffee break but no one was around! I then proceeded to Frank&apos;s in Simpson for a late dinner another place were some type of UFOs come and go up the Lackawanna River Basin toward the headwaters in Arart, PA, their  apparant area of interest when traveling through!

We had just changed places when I looked up and saw a large, slow moving, circular object moving from North to South about 1000 feet away and about 500 feet in the air. I was looking at it as I was facing Southwest. It is not possible for me to guess how large it was. It did not move as fast as a plane and it was much larger than a helicopter. It had red lights all around the perimeter and they all blinked in unison. That is what caught my attention. Airplanes usually have red and white lights blinking at different times.I ran into the house to get our camera, but by the time I came back out, it was much to far away to photograph. I have always wondered why no one gets a good photo of these things &ndash; now I know.  I also did not have my glasses on and as the object got further and further away, my view was blurring. I ran upstairs to get my glasses, but by the time I got back downstairs, I could not longer see the object.My husband didn&rsquo;t see it--he had his back to the object and he thought I was kidding when I said there was something weird in the sky overhead. I said I thought I was looking at a UFO and he didn&rsquo;t believe me. I kept telling him to &quot;turn around, turn around, turn around or you will miss it!&quot;  By the time I convinced him to turn around, it had already moved quite a ways away.He did not get a good look. He said he thought it could be an airplane, but that it didn&rsquo;t look like any plane he knew of. Unfortunately, he didn&rsquo;t turn around soon enough to get a good look. It was all over in two to three minutes.Airplanes do not have dozens of lights in a circular pattern all blinking in unison. This object was flying about the speed of a small single engine plane or a bit slower, but it was a huge object. I am pretty sure that what I saw was not an airplane.It moved very slowly for its size and was not high enough in the air to be an airliner. It was not shaped like an airliner. It was either oval or circular in shape. It made no noise as it passed over.We live about 30 miles from an air force base. That could explain it.", "glowing circular object warps across the skyI went outside for a cigerette...i looked up and saw a glowing circular object going really really fast...faster than any plane I know of....then it spaid up and just disapeered i dont know what it was, but it was defnitley not a plane", "8 extremely bright objects, red in color and slow moving objects seen. Flying in co-ordinate formation then breaking formation and slowly fading into nothing before our eyes.On Friday night July 19 at about 00:10hrs, in north London, I noticed a very bright light through my closed Venetian blinds. As there was no sound I realized it could not be a helicopter and therefore pulled the blinds up to see what it was.To my surprise I saw 8 lights moving roughly as high as a Helicopter would. They were brighter than any light on a plane and were static with no blinking what so ever. The objects were spherical and unlike a plane or helicopter of any kind.The way and direction they were traveling was very odd. They were all moving horizontally at very slow speed, in what appeared to be an organized formation. They were in two groups. A group of 3 led and a group of 5.After watching these crafts for a couple of minutes, they seemed to individually break formation and start moving higher up and away from us. The once extremely bright spheres began to slowly fade away right before our eyes until it they completely gone!  There were no clouds in the sky at the time and no obstruction of our view. It was a dry night and no other terrestrial aircraft were in the sky. They simply vanished into nothing.The objects were observed by me and my partner. We are both professional people and parents, who do not drink or indulge in any recreational substances.We are (were) both skeptics until now!", "Hazy blue then bright white darting lightBetween 22:20 and 22:40 Sunday August 9th I and my partner witnessed a strange light in the western sky in the vicinity of the Big Dipper.  Initially it appeared as a blue hazy star, and simultaneously we both commented that it was oddly blue and had never seen it in that part of the sky.  In comparison to the other stars and the Big Dipper constellation it appeared to be very high and a star rather than an airplane.  We live in the vicinity of Dulles International Airport and regularly see the headlights and beacon lights of approaching and departing planes following regular paths and intervals.  This light however was distinctly higher.  For the first few minutes of our observation we thought it could be the headlight of an oncoming airplane as often airplane lights appear bright and stable when they are approaching head-on before turning; the steady blue haze created by the humidity.  However, no other airplanes approaching from the west or departing from! the east had this glow.  After approximately 5 minutes of observation, the light became brighter and white, with an aura of blue circling it then red.  The bright white light would disappear, as if an airplane turning course away from you, but then would suddenly reappear, with a broad swatch of bright white light from left to right as if an airplane with lights across the breadth of its wingspan.  While this light pattern was changing back and forth from bright white to blue/red haze, the position of the vision also dramatically changed.  It appeared to get closer rather quickly, and also much lower in altitude, while moving right and left.  Using the approaching and departing airplanes lined up as a reference, the light moved faster to the right and then to the left than any of the airplanes in their flight pattern.  Also the light descended and ascended quickly, faster than any helicopter I have ever seen.  Its movement from right to left, up and down came in abrupt sta! rts and stops, seemingly without building momentum or slowing ! of momen tum.  The right and left and up and down movements gradually lead it closer to the ground or horizon, still the size appearance of the light making it look quite off in the distance and not a small craft up close.  As it approached the horizon it seemed to descend very fast.  If it was travelling away from us it was at sudden great speed, if it was descending for a landing, it was straight down and at a descent much greater than any vertical landing craft I have ever witnessed.  After approximately 20 minutes of viewing it was not longer in sight.  We spend an additional 10 minutes viewing the area of the sky and horizon but it did not reappear.", "me and my friends decided to go camping because we did not do any thing on the fourth so we went into the woods where we had built a cabin.

The dot of light floated there for about 3 seconds before it started to fly away.  It accelerated extremely fast and within halfa second was going at least 5 times as fast as a plane and just kept getting faster.

Myself and two other house mates were outside enjoying the view of the sky.  The sky was partially cloudy but quite bright due to the presence of the moon which was slightly bigger than half full.At approximately 10:05 P.M., our attention was drawn to a high flying jet aircraft travelling from west to east.  It was low enough for us to hear the faint roar of the engines.  I lowered my gaze and noticed a dark shape with lights drop from the sky approximately 5-8 miles south of our position over Okanagan Mountain Park.  It began to move slowly over the park in an east to west direction. I alerted the rest of the group and they all turned their attention to this object.  As it reached the outskirts of the city it changed direction and started to move south to north, towards us.  At first we thought it might be an aircraft except for the fact that most aircraft in the area fly an east west route.  Kelowna has a relatively busy airport and we were used to oberving aircraft arrivals and departures.  I was formerly employed as a Ground Specialist at the Ottawa International Airport and was familiar with most aircraft including those at air shows.  This was something I&apos;d never seen b! efore.We first observed the object as a dark triangular shape silhouetted against the bright night sky.  We could not hear any noise from the object as it proceeded slowly towards our position.  A soft white glow emanated from what appeared to be 3 portholes, one at each corner of the underside of the object.  The colour was flat black.  The size was equal to that of a 737 jet aircraft viewed from 500 to 700 feet away at it&apos;s closest point.  As the object approached a position to the west of us it seemed to change its course slightly to the east for 5 to 10 seconds then turned back to its original course.  At this point its apparent size was that of a football held at arm&apos;s length.  The object proceeded north and gained in altitude as it approached the western spur of Knox Mountain (where the mountain meets the lake) and passed over and out of sight.  The entire sighting lasted approximately five minutes.We don&apos;t know what it was but we are absolutely certain that it was not a conventional aircraft.Years later, after I&apos;d moved and gotten married, I mentioned the incident to a neighbor of mine.  He said he had a friend who lived a block to the west of our original sighting position who saw a large triangular shaped object fly right over his house.  I asked my neighbor to speak with his friend and enquire about the date and time.  He did, and though he was not sure of the exact date, the time was right and it was early June 1998.  Other than that he really didn&apos;t want to speak about it because as my neighbor put it, &quot;it spooked him&quot;.  He never reported the incident.", "Fire In Sky-- Baton Rouge, LAResponse to below (08/09/09) Baton Rouge, LA  We saw the exact same thing that the post below describes.

It was inclining at a very slow speed. After about 30 seconds of it&apos;s presence, I ran into the house and got everyone outside to view what I was seeing. Moments later it started declining, and resembled a plane on fire going down. It split into 4 pieces which appeared the same size, and the fire disappeared. You could see dim red lights which led us to believe that an airplane had exploded. A few seconds later, the remaining pieces flared back up and started weaving in and out of each other in a horizontal fashion. They slowly dropped towards the skyline, but the whole sighting lasted about 3.5 - 4 minutes.

These objects were high enough above the horizon that I could see them but not high in the sky from my vantage point which leads me to believe these objects were a good distance away from where I observed them.  If an aircraft were to drop a flare right above you it would seem high in the sky, but if you were 10-20 miles away the flares would seem low on the horizon because of the distance which is how I could describe it.  These lights to me didn&apos;t seem like flares because they did not appeare one after the other.

PD))", "Two objects over north GA emit strobes then moved away.Conditions: Very clear night, no clouds, very little light pollution.Details: As I often do at night, I was sitting in the hot tub looking up (usually looking for satellites or meteors). I noticed a bright double strobe of light in the N-NW sky about 80 degress in altitude. I dismissed it as nothing but kept looking at the &quot;star&quot; in which it originated. It double-strobed again. About 2 seconds later, another object about 10 degrees away to the south appeared to give a &quot;reply&quot; double-strobe. Both objects were stationary and had a magnitude of about 2.0 when not flashing. Immediately, both objects started slowly moving toward the SE. The lights faded to dark within 10 seconds and I didn&apos;t see anything else. The amount of distance covered when both objects faded to dark were not consistent with normal satellites moving into the earth&apos;s shadow. This means that the object&apos;s light source was not created by the reflection of the sun at that altitude. I assume the altitude was very high since none of the stars in the direct path were eclipsed by the ! object. At the presumed altitude, the objects went from a standstill to the speed of an orbiting satellite in under a second. I have no other supporting information of this sighting nor were there other witness.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We saw 4 bright WHITE lights hanging in the sky NW of our home in the distance.   They were equally spaced in a horizontal formation tilted up from bottom left to top right.  The lights faded in and out several times.  They also circled around one another several times, before going back into a horizontal line formation.  At one point they all came together in a focused point.  They fanned back out into the horizontal slanted formation.  Then, as though you were shutting off the lights, they disappeared one after another.  The height of the lights was a &frac12; a story above the sight line of the closest home, approximately 200 yds. away.  I&rsquo;m not a UFO believer, but I can&rsquo;t think of any rational explanation for what I saw.  Cloud cover is extremely low at ~1000 feet.  Of note, the Dayton air show IS in town and toward that direction, BUT the ended today at 5:00 p.m.  Amanda I noticed 4 bright lights in a line.  They remained in a line approximately 15-30 seconds after I first noticed them.  I was looking North/Northwest from the deck that is approximately 12&rsquo; off of the ground (ground is elevated from a pond).  I noticed the lights begin to move and seemed to orbit around one another when I mentioned that to my friends.  The lights began rotating around and additionally, starting to move in a non-linear pattern.  The lights started flashing.  Specifically, the farthest light from the front and/or on the right began flashing on and off.  This lasted approximately 1 minute.  The lights moved further west and then they began to flash on and off in sequence; each one time on and then off.  At the very end, the lights flashed off, one light at a time until all the lights were off.  The lights were bright and resembled a street light without the aura around it.    My name is Cheri F and I live in Lebanon, OH. I was sitting on my back deck tonight (Sat, July 18) when we noticed 4 odd lights in the distance, northwest of our house. They were the strangest things I&rsquo;ve ever seen. When we first saw them, I ran inside and grabbed the camera to take video. They seemed to move in a snake-like formation. One would fade away and then reappear on the other end. I&rsquo;ve been to numerous air shows and come from a history of air force veterans/pilots and these didn&rsquo;t move like anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen before. They kind of floated/hovered but seemed to move very fast when they did move. They didn&rsquo;t twinkle or flash, they were just solid orbs of light. There definitely seemed to be a &ldquo;leader&rdquo; among the lights. We watched as they moved into the distance, converged into one, broke back out and then disappeared one at a time like lights switching off. RJ S On the evening of July 18th, I was at my friend Andy&rsquo;s house in Lebanon, Ohio.  I was on Andy&rsquo;s deck with him and his wife Cheryl and my girlfriend Amanda.  Amanda noticed something in the sky and directed our attention to it.  At first glance, it appeared to be airplanes.  I know that the Dayton, OH air show was today, so I assumed that it was just some planes from that event.  However, upon further observation it didn&rsquo;t appear to be like any plane or formation I had ever seen.  There were four &ldquo;planes,&rdquo; each having one bright white-ish light (pretty sure that most planes have lights on both wing and the tail).  They traveled in an &ldquo;S&rdquo; formation in a North-Northwest direction, with the back &ldquo;4th&rdquo; plane&rsquo;s light slowing dimming to &ldquo;off&rdquo; and then turning back on.  The &ldquo;planes&rdquo; were traveling faster than typical planes and seemed to be flying low in the air &ndash; there have been a lot of clouds in the sky today and the planes were well below the clouds.  As the planes flew away, the first plane&rsquo;s light disappeared, then the lights from the second, third and finally fourth.  They didn&rsquo;t turn back on after this point &ndash; as if the planes just disappeared.  I observed the planes for probably 2-2:30 minutes before they disappeared.", "Triangular craft, 5-6 red lights on edgeI stepped out the back door and looked to the left (westerly) and noticed 5 or six bright red lights (in a row) just hanging in the air above an antennae with a  white strobe light (strobe light on the antennae).I pointed it out to my wife and she did the same thing I did. She first said it was an airplane, then when I mentioned it wasn&apos;t moving, she said it was a helicopter.As I was thinking about getting my camera the object began to move. It came toward us, then turned to our right. It made a sweeping turn then began to decend. It did this without banking.The red lights were not fuzzy on the edges, they were well defined, and they all moved as one solid object. As the object began to move I noticed partial green lights above the left 2 or 3 red lights. Also as the object turned to the right, and later to the left, it didn&apos;t bank as a normal aircraft would.The lights seemed to have a perpindicular dark color in the center, and faded to a lighter color on the edge, but the edge was still a cherry red color, the green appeared to be the same type of lights...(my wife said she did not notice the green lights).After reporting this strange observation, I must also include the following information: 1. The Union County Airport is in the same direction as the object appeared to go, and I haven&apos;t had the chance to follow this possibility up. (I will do so in the morning...08-19-09).2. I have not taken photographs of the area where the sighting took place..(Again, I will take daytime and nighttime photos).3. Each light on the object appeared to be approximately 1/8 inch in diameter, for a total of 1+1/4&quot; in width.4. The only reason I am reporting this without having the opportunity to &quot;investigate&quot; the possibilities is that when I asked my wife what she saw, she said, &quot;It was triangular...&quot; and then she talked about the red lights.", "a plane like light made a 90 degree angle and bolted off into the horizonOn July 16 2009 at 12:00 at night my friend and I were fishing on the Erie Canal towpath when we saw a bright light that looked like a plane. After about thirty seconds it stopped and made a 90-degree turn and bolted off into the horizon", "Silver Water (Canada)     ON    Unknown  2 mins  Linear pattern of 3-4 huge bright round amber lights, flashing in sequence.My partner and I went for a late night swim at our cottage in a remote area, on the west end of Manitoulin Island, Ontario, Canada (Silver Water, ON).  I spotted it first, then she looked up as well, so we both witnessed it.  It was a linear pattern of 3 or 4 huge bright round lights, amber in colour.We could not detect the shape of the craft, all we could focus on were the lights.  It was hovering to the south-east of us.  The lights were lit up, then they went out one by one, in a sequence pattern from left to right.  They lit up again, then went out again. The light sequence happened about 6 or 7 times.  It was hovering, but moving towards the west, in what seemed to be in spurts, always lighting up in sequence.  Suddenly, it started moving south, then it disappeared within seconds in the distance.It&rsquo;s the most amazing thing I&rsquo;ve ever experienced.  I was never a believer of UFO&rsquo;s until this day.  I will never forget it.  Neither one of us was under the influence of any drug or alcohol.It happened at approximately 10:20 pm, Thursday, August 13th, 2009 in Silver Water, Ontario, Canada, above Silver Lake.", "Circle of Orange/Red light flying over Kettering, Northamptonshire.It was a normal Saturday night, I had put my kids to bed and had not been drinking alcohol.  I went to get something from my car that is parked just outside my house, but before I reached my car I looked up at the sky as I saw a bright orange/red circle in the sky, at first I thought it was a firework and waited for the bang but as I watched it for about 20 more seconds I couldn&rsquo;t identify what it was so called to my husband who was in the house to come out, he watched it for about another 20 seconds and also could not explain it either, I asked him to film it on his mobile phone as I know he always carries it with him!  He recorded it for 1 min and 1 sec until his camera could not pick it up anymore but we watched it until it went out of sight!!  It looked like a circle of solid orange/red light, bigger than a aeroplane light or star, I could not see any mass around the light, it was just the circle of light.  It went across the sky under clouds at the same speed , at the same altitude and in a straight line.  It was not an aeroplane, helicopter as there was no noise from it as all! Something travelling at this speed should have some kind of noise to it!  The next day we were still trying to find some explanation, we checked to see if it could have been the international space station but that was over New Zealand.((NUFORC Note:  ISS passed overhead at 21:24 hrs..

About three miles away from where I was, on his porch, there was a bright (almost as if it was a headlight) blue sphere in the sky.  It was probably two football field lengths distance away from the top of the houses.  It was foggy out at that time so I could not make out specific details of the &quot;object&quot; but the fog had a blue haze from the sphere.  I&apos;m not speculating whether or not it came from Mars, but it was a very odd event to witness.  After about one minute the sphere immediately disappeared and the blue haze with it, although the fog remained.  It left me feeling a little nutty because the object was so bright and had form to it and then it was like you blinked and nothing was ever there.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I asked my friend to look, and he too saw the object in the distance. I looked like the object would have be directly above 5th street near Piedmont Ave, but from our view was still close enough that we were able to clearly make out the shape, individual lights underneath, and the color of the lights was white with a slight bluish hint. It moved in a fluttering pattern like a feather would if you drop it. We watched for a couple seconds until it eventually drifted out of view behind some trees.Other people would have had to have seen this object as it was just a little after 9 PM on a Saturday in central Atlanta. Tons of people were out and about.", "Two bright, non-moving lights in the sky, brighter than the stars.A friend and myself were standing outside of his house, which is in a subdivision.  We were looking in the sky attempting to identify constellations, studying for an astronomy class.  There is a significant amount of light pollution in the area.  I was looking north or northwest, and my friend was looking southeast.  He mentioned that I should look where he was looking.  I looked southeast. We both observed two extremely bright points of light.  One light appeared vertically above the other light.  They were not moving at all.  My first impression was that they were just extremely bright stars, and I looked into my book to try to find them.  I looked back up a few seconds later and they were gone.  There was no sound.  Both points of light were the same brightness, and appeared to be much brighter than any star in the sky.", "Blue light in the sky between the moon and a bright star to the east.Last night I was photographing the Moon approximately 3:00. In my photos I found a blue spot just to the east of the moon. My photos were not very good so the spot only showed up when I tried to enhance the photos.I have chased UFOs in the past, and found them ether undetermined or something neat. One UFO I chased was on a cloudy night. I was travelling from Shelburn Ontario Canada to Mount Forest Ontario by the back roads when I spotted these coloured lights in the sky. They were fuzzy and dull and looked as if they were moving. I decided to see how close I could get to the lights and I started to follow them. After several miles of following the lights in the sky I could see a cell tower through the trees. The cell towers lights were the same colour as the lights in the sky. When I got to the base of the cell tower I could see that the lights in the sky were the lights from the cell tower reflecting off the clouds in the sky. The clouds were moving and it was the moving clouds that made the lights look like they were moving.Any way has anyone been photographing the Moon lately? If you have did you spot the blue light east of the Moon? There was a bright star to the east of the Moon and the blue light was between the star and the Moon. The blue light was not visible to the naked eye it was only when I tried to enhance the photos it showed up on all of them. I spotted it on July 9 2009 at approximately 3:00 am.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the person might have photographed Jupiter, which is near the Moon, currently.

I&apos;m sure this event took place over the Ocean.  I distinctly saw four lights, that changed Colors, these lights made acrobatic moves that no plane I&apos;m aware of could make.  that is what grabbed my attention, really.  I have seen Jets fly at night, these lights were Flickering and changing shades of orange and flitting about the sky gaining altitude and then they all came together in some sort of Diamond pattern, one then two lights disappeared, then the other two.  I couldnt sleep after that, and approx. 30 minutes late I saw what I thought were the Lights again, but I strained to hear two Jet Fighters Flying High from South to North out over the Ocean?  Rare to see them, even that high.  Strange stuff indeed. I gotta get a high power camera.", "Daylight observation in Stavanger, NorwayThe following took place in the city of Stavanger, located on the southwestern tip of Norway. Time: April 19th 2009, at 12 o&rsquo;clock, noon. The weather was warm with no cloud and no wind at all. I was at a friends house in the outskirts of the town, drinking coffee. From my spot on the sofa in her living room, looking out of the windows at the clear blue sky I noted that the contrails left by high flying aircraft didn&rsquo;t move and were left hanging there, crisscrossing the sky and slowly spreading. I figured that the contrails would eventually turn this sunny day to an overcast one as they seemed to bloat over time in the perfectly still air and did not go away.This was the reason that I had my attention at the sky in the first place.At this point I noticed a bright light moving fast towards us from the left. It looked just like the landing lights on an aircraft but without the aircraft. This soon separated into two light sources spaced close together and I could just make out that they were connected to a solid object. At this point I called out to my friend: What is that? What the heck is that?! And I got to my feet.We both ran over to the windows to have a better look. At this point the object was rather close and it soon scooted in front of the windows and disappeared over the roof, out of sight and obviously moving so fast as there was no point in running through the house to have a final glimpse of it disappearing on the other side of the building.We were both very shaky after this and we started right away to try to find a rational explanation.  As of yet we are at a loss.  The object looked like nothing I have seen before. It didn&rsquo;t have wings or a tail (no control surfaces whatsoever).  The closest thing I can compare it with is it had the general shape of a hat with a very tiny brim on it.  The two lights were on the upper half of it (or at the very top) and they shone with a bright white light (just as normal landing lights would).  The colour of the object itself was dirty gray or black.  I could not detect any further details as it was moving so fast. I noticed that the sun reflected off the top of it.  I estimate the size to be about 8-10 feet at its base and about 6-8 feet tall.It moved very steadily in a perfectly straight line with no wobble at all, in fact, it was almost as if it were moving on a pair of (invisible) rails.  I estimate the speed at around that of the sound or slightly below (much like when fighter aircraft fly past the crowds in air shows, just under the speed of sound).  There was no sound whatsoever (not even a swoosh), and the windows were open because it was a hot day.  Also I noticed that the leafs on a big tree in the garden did not move as the object streaked just a few feet above it.  The windows should have rattled when an object of that size moved so close at such a speed and this fact puzzles me more than anything about this experience.My friend saw it pass overhead, which I didn&rsquo;t because of the angle in which it moved in relation to the windows and she said that it had a purple &lsquo;hazy&rsquo; colour on its &lsquo;back side&rsquo;.I read the local newspaper thoroughly the next day but there was no mention of it.  The course of the object was NE which would lead away from any built up areas.This is the only experience of this kind any of us have had.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This is my fourth time seeing it, always after 11:30pm PST... Many people thought I was making it up until they got to see it too! (yes, I ran and got them so I wasn&apos;t alone starring at it.) Tonight my parents finally witnessed it! I ran through the house and woke them up. I rarely look to the skies at night searching for strange lights or objects, but it seems that when I check out what I think is Sirius (the brightest star I can see from our crappy smog infested, light polluted skies here in SoCal.) late at night,  lately I have seen this object... I just happen to catch this Orange object sometimes when I look towards that star. It flies higher than a normal plane would, has NO blinking lights, it sometimes changes from Orange/Amber to Red-ish color then back to Orange/Amber, and then blacks out for a few seconds then lights back up. The third time I seen the thing, it was hovering and flying lower than the second time, it change from like a round bar shape... to a perfect circle, (It would help to mention that I ran into the house and grabbed the binoculars before hand, so I was lucky enough to watch it change shape.) The object (if it is the same one over and over again?) has no wings, makes no noise, and moves in different directions and sometimes hovers in one spot for a little while.  I was so glad my friend ran to my house to let me know it was back out in the sky, because THIS TIME I could grab my parents so they don&apos;t think I&apos;m nuts anymore. I know this won&apos;t be the last I see of it, because it&apos;s been 4 times already in less than 6 months and I&apos;m not searching for it every night... There has to be someone else out there besides us who have seen this thing... especially over Huntington Beach area where it seems to fly over sometimes. Once, it dropped/emitted 2 bright blue-ish white objects from under it that fell straight towards the ocean water, yes, it had to be over the water, it was far far out there. I was NOT the only person to witness that, and we both were like, did you see that!? What ! did it s hoot out?! It seemed like it shot out the bright objects because they looked like they went downwards faster than a falling object. It was fast... We were on my roof at that moment trying to get a better look at it through binoculars.  No noise... this thing was quiet as can be and when it would pick up speed, still no noise. I&apos;m not saying aliens, but it&apos;s for sure not a satellite because it moves in different directs and hovers, it&apos;s not a plane, it hovers and has NO blinking lights and no sound for the speed it goes, not a helicopter, flies way to high and fast with yet again, no noise..., not a balloon, not a chinese lantern, and not a blimp, NO WAY, I&apos;m familiar with all of those.  If you don&apos;t believe me, I suggest if you live around my area of Orange County,CA., you check the night skies from around 11:00pm &apos;till 1:00am every now and then, your bound to see it if my neighbors and I have already seen it four times, and two out of the four were just this month alone. From now on, I&apos;m going to check every night around 12:00-1:00am... I wish someone could tell me what we keep seeing. At least I&apos;m not the nut who seen a UFO now, now my neighbors are right with me on this one! ...relief, but still very curious as to what I have seen more than once.

Thanks...", "bright object hovering in sky during lightning storm Phenix city, AlWe were experiencing a really strong  lightening storm. My husband stepped out onto the porch  and after a couple of minutes he called me to the porch. The storm was really bad and no light should have been viewable in the sky other than a plane.He pointed to the  eastern sky and ask me if the bright light was moving. I watched for a couple of minutes and  we both agreed that what ever was in the sky that night was not moving. It was a large bright light just hovering  in the middle of the storm.I went and got the binoculars and  we took turns looking at the object. Through the binoculars you could see that the object had  a rectangular shape with orange lights running down both sides. We knew that no helicopter would be just hovering in one spot during such a powerful lightning storm.As the storm grew worse the object became brighter and still sit hovering. It hovered there for about 56 minutes and suddenly it was just gone.We have no answers for what we saw Tuesday night. It was a frightening , yet intriguing site.  I am afraid of bad storms but  even I could not resist watching this object during the storm. I am wondering if anyone else happened to see this spectacular site on  08/11/09 between 10pm and 11 pm.", "Craziest thing i&apos;ve seen in my life, truly unexplainableMe and my brother were camping in a friends backyard.  We came into the tent around midnight or 12:30 and my brother pointed out the light in the sky and said that light was here last time we came in the tent (which had been about 2 hours earlier).  So we layed down in the tent and watched the light for over an hour and a half, and during that time the light seemed like it just hovered way up in the sky. We watched it make distingtive shapes in the sky but no matter what shape it made or direction it flew it always went back to the same spot in the sky.  Later on while still watching it we turned on a lantern in the tent and the only light visible in the sky was the one we had been watching.  And eventully the light would get dim then bright and it did that for a little while.  We looked away for a minute and when we looked back up it was gone.", "We were driving on I-10 west from Jacksonville to Tallahassee. My fianc&eacute; said what is that? I looked up and saw a triangle shaped aircraft flying extremely low. It was moving unlike any aircraft I have ever seen, approximately at the same height that a helicopter would fly. It had one blinking light at the nose so I wanted to believe it was a military plane but I just don&rsquo;t see how it could be. It was a very distinct triangle. No wings, no noise, and it looked to be gliding instead of flying. When I looked directly above me through the sunroof, I saw that it was clearly a triangle, and it was something I never saw before. It was hard for me to say it was a UFO at first, and actually I really wanted to believe it was a military jet (especially since there is a big naval base in Jacksonville), but it just didn&rsquo;t seem to be one. Looking in my rear view mirror we saw the light for another minute or so just gliding away from us. I never thought I would one day en! counter something like this and now that I did, I see why so many people can&rsquo;t explain some of the things they have seen.", "Silent, round object over Mason, OHI saw the object coming from the west quite a way off in the distance.  What caught my attention was the red light seemingly on the bottom of the object.  it wasn&apos;t clear like an airplane or other craft.  The read light was &quot;fuzzy&quot; to the best of my description.  As it got closer it appeared to be flying right under the clouds and the red light appeared to move location on the object.  Also, the red light was getting dimmer then went out completely as the object was overhead.  I heard no sound and the object was round and black or dark.  It seemed to be traveling at a good rate of speed, possibly a little faster than a small plane.  Like I said, it appeared to be several hundred feet in the air right below the clouds.  My wife saw it also but dismissed it as a plane.  She said that she saw the red light as it moved away towards the east.

I can only guess but if these objects are in fact landing the only place where there is any cover to the north within that &quot;corridor&quot; is a large forest preserve - Busse Woods which is about 15-20 miles to the north.

It was moving low to the ground and moving slowly.  At first I thought it was a helicopter and just kept watching it because it stuck out in the air over the open fields.  Then it started moving very fast in one direction and then back in the same direction it just came from.  When I say fast I mean very fast.  It did not accellerate it was instantly moving fast. It did this for about half a minute going back and forth in the sky.  Then it stopped moving for a few seconds all together and was stationary in the sky.

Our home is more or less in the country, so we do see many stars but this particular object sat directly between a group of trees.  We discounted this as an airplane due to the fact that there is a small rural airport and of course the Air Force base.

It was strange because it was darker than the few other clouds in the sky that were lighted from behind due to the setting sun.  It was also much, much lower and a had a very distinct full shape as opposed to the other clouds that were high, thin and flat in the sky that are typical in Oregon on hot summer days.  We both saw the object and began to discuss what we thought it was.  At first we thought that maybe it was a cloud, and then maybe a helicopter, but it was difficult to decide at first.  As the object got closer we realized that it was distinctly changing shape.  It would be wide and round and then stretch and thin out.  Then after about 5 minutes of watching it, the object distinctly began moving away from us.  It headed north, which we were already travelling 70 mph in the same direction, which shows that it was! moving at a significantly high velocity.  Then over the span of about 5 seconds the object disappeared.  It did not move out of sight due to distance but faded or dissolved from sight from the edges in. This was very clear and when we realized that what we saw was not normal and not anything that we could identify except as extraterrestrial. As a skeptic I never thought I would ever see a UFO, however I cannot explain what I saw in any other manner than something beyond this world.  I have tried to find others who may have also seen this because I-5 is a very busy freeway and was so close to the city of Albany.  If we had not both witness this strange experience then I may have not believed what my own eyes had seen.

I could not make out any shape of the object. The lights were the same size and the same color, white. My guess is that the object was about 1/2 mile straight up but what was so odd was the rate of speed it was travelling and the fact that there was no noise. The object cleared the western horizon to a point on the eastern horizon where I could no longer see it in less than 30 seconds. I did not give this a whole lot of thought until the object reappeared from the western horizon at approximately 10:45pm. It was travelling about 10 degrees further north this time with the same trajectory and appearance, again crossing the space from horizon to horizon in less than 30 seconds.

Again, the flashing lights were not that odd but rather the speed and the fact that there was no noise at all. No chance that it was a satellite as the object was way too low.

My wife asked me about what looked like a star in the west. Then she told me she thought it was moving. The light was amber and looked like a landing light on an aircraft except for the color of the light. As it got closer the object seemed to get lower. We started to notice blinking lights of an orange, red, and green. We thought it was still a plane at this point. As it came over top of us however, we noticed and unusual pattern to the lights. There were light in front back and sides, not the pattern of a plane or helicopter. As it came closer still, it passed directly over us. I could make out a dark shape something like a 6 or 8 sided octagon-like shape. The amber light was in the middle, lights close together in front, spaced on the sides, and spaced to the back. Another shocking fact is that there was absolutely NO SOUND! As the object moved to the east and across the Ohio River, I gained ! perspective on it&apos;s size and speed from the time it passed over me until it moved between and over the hilltops on the other side of the river.

My mother, older brother, older sister and two young nephews were all present.  While playing the game, my older brother said &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; and we thought he was trying to be funny (he had previously seen and reported a UFO sighting with additional family members approximately 2 years ago; I had not been present at the time of that sighting).  He said he was serious and we all looked and saw what he had noticed.There was a ring-shaped object in the sky that, at least twice while I was viewing it, rotated on its axis to show its top.  When showing the top of itself, it could be viewed that the center was completely open, allowing an unobstructed view of the sky behind it.  This object appeared about the size of a dime (to make a relative size comparison) and was approximately 45 degrees from the horizon.  It was about 6:30PM, the sun was behind us and the sky was slightly cloudy; the object appeared to be no more than 1000 feet off the ground, well below cloud cover.  The object appeared black but when it would rotate the top would appear to be silver.Accompanying this ring shaped object were 2 dark circular objects.  They were roughly a quarter of the size of the ring-shaped object and one was positioned directly above it, I&rsquo;d estimate 60 degrees from the horizon; the second was behind and off to the right of the first.  Admittedly, I did not pay much attention to these as I was concentrating on the ring-shaped object.As these three objects moved out of sight range (they never became obscured by objects, they just became too distant to see; this took about 5 minutes from the time we initially spotted them) I happened to look back in the direction the objects had come from and saw a fourth object.  This one was kidney shaped with the curve to the front and wobbled a lot as it moved.  The curved section appeared to be white or a light color, the rest of the object was black.   It went in the same direction as the other objects.  This kidney-shaped object I would also estimate at about 45 degrees from the horizon and moving at approximately the same speed as the other three craft.None of these four objects emitted any noise or contrail or exhaust of any sort.  I could not notice any visible lights on them.  They all moved slower than an airplane or helicopter would.

It looked to be over HWY 31 about 3 miles from our house.  I instantly thought of an airplane.  Then my husband brought to my attention that planes only flash red and green lights.  This object was flashing red, green, blue and orange lights.  Not just dull versions of those colors but the most beautiful vibrant version that you can ever imagine.  Also it wasn&rsquo;t moving except for the occasional sway from side to side. I had never in my life been in such a state of awe.  My husband ran and got our camera and binoculars.  Of course my camera wouldn&rsquo;t catch the object but when we looked through the binoculars you could see clearly that it was the most perfect circle ball shape ever.  It stayed hovering in the same spot for the hour that we stayed out there watchi! ng it.At one point during the hour, 3 smaller versions of the light circle also producing the same vibrant color flashes came to the left side of the larger color circle and disappeared.

At first, I laughed at thinking a plane was offering me an illusion it was coming from space. As seconds rolled past, I noticed it appeared to drop into the atmosphere and was coming closer and fast. In addition, the vessel had no blinking lights-just solid ones. I remember thinking no plane could travel that fast, for it had flown from the comet to a distant plane distance in less than one minute.The spacecraft quickly dropped to just above the vast forest behind the house, quickly slowing down and coming my way. As it approached, it looked like a plane with solid lights, maybe two lights. I had time to think it through that this slow ship just sped in from space.To my surprise, the spaceship dropped to just above the trees and passed in a straight line over my head.  It passed so slow that I watched the nose go over my head. It was not very wide, and it was almost silent.  All I could hear was a low roar.  The trees did not move from the wind. The body kept getting wider.  I was looking straight up at the dark colored spaceship. It could not have been more than 200 feet in the air.  I kept telling myself to be calm.  I was exhilarated with curiosity.The wing I viewed as the right wing spanned across the house and yard.  The left wing spanned over the neighbor&rsquo;s yard.   As the wings passed over, I noted the wings were a smooth part of the ship and pointed slightly forward.  As the spaceship revealed its back, I saw a large and brightly lit rectangular window with rounded edges.  All I could see was a wall of something at the back. I kept thinking it was a computer wall or something similar.Then, what appeared to be faster than when it sped in, the spaceship left.  After the ship passed, it made a sudden jump into the sky, curving NNE and then NE and the East and shot over the Chesapeake Bay into space.  In less than five seconds, I saw the ship jump out of the atmosphere.I immediately drew pictures and started researching.  I wanted to report the sighting, but I stopped talking about it, because when I did, I faced ridicule or ignorance.  I never reported it until now. Was this ship observing the comet, and did this ship take a side excursion to Earth because we were so close?  How could a ship travel so fast, quietly slowing to the speed of a slow car quietly, and speed back into space?", "Silver triangle shape - SilentI hesitated to report this, as we only saw this for a short time.  We live in the Sierra Mountains about 4,200&apos; elevation.

What is unusual is we live under a flight plan for Fresno - Las Vegas &amp; back.  These go north of our home.  This craft appeared to be 1 mile or closer and low, almost equal with our elevation.

Intrigued I watched the light proceed west in the direction of the small plane. I assumed it was a commercial plane on approch to SEA-TAC international. So I continued to track it until it started to flicker behind the trees. So I waited to see if it would continue on it&apos;s flight path to the west. It did not reveal itself so I ran to the street for a better view, to find this bright orange light (once the size of a pinky nail, then the size of a small orb) within seconds it had accended to breaking the atmosphere to exit east of the original sighting.

The best way to desciribe it, is a small meteor with a tail but it wasn&apos;t coming, it was going, then gone.This whole experience took place within a matter of seconds and I had no time to get a witness or a video recording. So I hope my testimony is enough to explain this very strange happening.For the record, being an avid fan of airplanes, means I know what type of aircraft are in the skies these days including possible (top secret) activity so I know exactly what I see in the sky 100 percent of the time... until now.", "Disappearance of object and vapor trailAbout 13:30 hrs on July 15th 09, I was sitting on my deck reading a book facing south.  My upper body was at a 45 degree angle.  When I went to turn the page I briefly looked up and saw an object pulling a very large vapor trail behind it.  The only reason I started to watch the object was because the object seemed to be traveling faster than a jet would at such a high altitude.  I know that means nothing unless I knew the exact altitude.  But, that&rsquo;s not my story..as it moved north it passed in front of the sun so I put my hand up to protect my eyes and waited for it to emerge from the other side of the sun.  It never reappeared.  Then, I looked back at the vapor trail and it was gone.  I watched a vapor trail today  ,07/17/09, that was in approximately the same spot at the same time and it just floated away in the upper atmosphere wind. It didn&rsquo;t vaporized, just floated away.Whereas the one I saw the day before just vanished within maybe a few seconds.I know this is not very exciting but thought I would report it in case you are trying to accumulate sightings to use as fodder at some future congressional hearing.", "I witnessed what is most likely a very bright green fireball or meteorite heading S SE above athanum ridge around 12:45am while driving up S 16th ave toward AMPM on Washington Ave.", "A Stealth oval over the woods in Litha Springs.I was just taking a walk to the store and I saw a flash of light out the corner of my eye I looked up and dident see anything.So I flashed my camra and it shows up on a picture.

However, we could recall it moving sideways for it quick duration. Not two minutes later it passed again, but this time we were looking in the general direction from having interest. Again lasting only a second, it was very far away and was seemingly very large, or was extremely bright. We could both describe it as if someone was shining a flashlight on the clouds, except there were no clouds, which left us obviously baffled at what we just saw.

On the ride down I stopped first in a place called &ldquo;Area 101&rdquo; where I spoke with a number of UFO enthusiasts about the contact movement&rsquo;s program of interacting with the intelligence (presumably ET) behind the UFO phenomenon. From there I headed south and met with a young man who described his having positive interactions with what he identified as ETs throughout his life with numerous sightings that he claimed had an interactive component. After I explained to him a term that I have coined called &ldquo;prime contactee (reserved for individuals who can request a sighting and actually have one occur)  he thought that he definitely was a &ldquo;prime.&rdquo;   At my Mom&rsquo;s house in Koreatown I brought my luggage up to the second floor and looked out through a screen window. It was 1:45 AM. The lights of the city reflecting off the overcast skies lit up the neighborhood. The silhouettes of palm trees graced the horizon. I gazed out to the west and immediately noticed a blinking stationary red light about ten degrees above the rooftops of the surrounding two story homes. For many years I have looked through that window on visits to LA and can never recall seeing such a light in the sky before. It was difficult to judge its distance as there were no landmarks behind it. It was relatively large, about a finger breaths wide at arms full length. In trying to figure our what it was my first thought was of  flashing red lights on a radio antennae array some 3 miles to the west.  They are not visible from my Mom&rsquo;s house and besides this light was solitary and far too large. As I had this thought the light began to slowly move horizontally to the north. This was no stationary aircraft beacon sitting on an antenna. Police helicopters routinely patrol this part of central LA and the light was not part of any fixed or rotating wing aircraft. At this late hours all was quiet in  this heavily residential neighborhood. The red pulsating object, circular in shape moved behind a tree. I waited for it to emerge into view on the other side. It did not. I wait! ed and scanned the sky and listened intently for the sound of aircraft. None  could be was heard.Was this just another &quot;random sighting?&quot; Or could it have been a consciousness mediated show of support for my networking efforts among the UFO experiencers that I like to call &quot;the contact underground?&quot; My guess is that it was a show of support because the next day I got a call from a contact team leader who told me that her skywatch team had a sighting of a round red UFO at midnight the previous night. It was less than two hours before my sighting. Coincidence?

It was about 700ft above the ground and about 1 mile away from my car. Then the object flew off south bound down the highway and into the distance, quite quickly. I continued south down US 95 and pulled over for some gas, after a quick fill up continued back on the highway and saw the object again; still twinkling its white lights. it had flown about 4 miles from the sight i saw it rise so i concluded it could not be a toy plane or helicopter ,especially going as fast as it ! was and as far from its point of origin.

I noticed a very bright light in the sky kind of a giant headlight. I noticed it kept getting closer to us as if it was traveling north. Then it began to separate into two lights as we drew closer.  This went on for about 5 minutes.Soon I could see it was an enormous object in size so I asked my office manager to pull off an available exit. As we watched then it was over a mountain and looked like a tower because it had a red flashing light on top.So I asked her to pull back on the highway. We had been in a large dip so when we pulled up it was just arriving. I asked my office manager. So what do you see, is that a UFO? She studied it as it approached us at what seemed like a fairly slow speed, it was like floating for a few seconds, by now it was very close and you could see whatever it was it was enormous. It looked like at that point a giant car floating through the sky with headlights probably 20 or 30 feet around that turned with the craft.It was swooping towards us so I said &ldquo;pull over&rdquo; as she whipped out of traffic traveling at 80mph with lots of traffic that had to be witnessing the same thing.  My wife pulled over behind us as she was following us. I was jumping out of the truck as she was slowing,. By now it was beginning to pass us overhead but it slowed to nearly a stop, like floating as I stared straight up at the bottom of it. It nearly blocked out the sky from where I was standing. I quickly measured it with my eye in comparison to the width of the freeway and decided that if it were to land there that it would cover the whole freeway both sides and probably hang over both sides by 2 or 300 feet.I estimated it to be about 600 feet or more. I have 30 years in construction so I usually have a pretty good eye. If I were to have held out my arms to the sky I would guess they would be at about a 45 degree angle.I was so wrapped up in getting every detail that I couldn&rsquo;t take the time to take a photo with my cell phone.It looked like two huge pontoons on each side of a disc or saucer shape and all over the bottom I could see like rectangle windows (or what appeared to be). Each window was surrounded with a very soft light that I would say was a glowing greenish light. And the whole perimeter of the bottom seemed to be outlined with this light.It was probably 500 to 1000 feet above me as it slowed to almost a stop over my head.I noticed I could not hear any sound at all. The pontoons were hard to make out other than I could see the shape how they blocked out the stars and they also had white corner marker lights. In the very bottom of where the saucer came to a point in the bottom there was almost like a slit where it looked like a door would be. Underneath everything seemed to be outlined with that soft greenish light.As it flew over it started to gain speed and elevation still heading north only probably about 10 miles from Norad and slightly veering to the east as it disappeared I could see again its enormous size and the white marker lights on all the corners and also one red light in the center of the peak of the saucer.I got back in the truck and we pulled out onto the highway and I noticed there was another one that was approaching on the right much smaller in size probably about 1000 feet or so in elevation and about 1500 feet to my right. This one however was completely different; it seemed to be more like a cubic shape by the marker lights that were all white, except a large blue light in the center.No red light on this one, it stayed on  the west side of I-25 as it headed north, where as the other one crossed over the freeway still flying quite parallel to the highway. I thought this one was skirting Fort Carson for some kind of security for the large ship.In comparison to the moon this craft was probably about the same size as the moon at it closest point. It seemed a little larger than a large military helicopter but it seemed more awkward. Although it seemed cubicle it also seemed to have other cubicle dimensions.I am doing some drawings of what I saw but I am In the mountains and away from my scanner and will be scanning them in and sending them in the next couple of days.", "TWO STRANGE LIGHTS SEEN WHILE WATCHING SPACE STATION - ONE IN N.W., ONE TAILING STATIONIf this seems a little odd, it&apos;s because I typed it up not as a report to give to someone, but for my own blog.:   What was to be an exciting night of photometry was interrupted tonight when we had our first ever telescopic view of the International Space Station.  Another object was seen about eight degrees behind the station, following in its orbit.  And, an unusual light was seen in the northwest about two minutes before the Station passed over, which has left us puzzled.Things were not looking good for astronomy Friday night.  Though the weather forecast was for clear skies, clouds had been passing through.  We planned to try and get a telescope on the Space Station, to see if we could make out any details.  The pass of the Station was scheduled to start at 1013pm ET, and to last for about two minutes.  The important fact was that it would be around 50 degrees high, which would be high enough to see from our observatory, but low enough to make pointing easy - for pointing a telescope right overhead is a chore!    About 1005pm, clearing was seen to be moving in from the southwest.  We opened up the observatory and turned the dome west.  The Station was scheduled to appear just to the right of west, and to move left toward the south before disappearing.  As we were turning the tube on our 10&quot; Newtonian to bring the eyepiece to the proper angle, we noticed a light high overhead, heading northwest.  The light was orange and quite bright, perhaps magnitude 0 or brighter.We watched the light head down into the northwest, and by slow speed and appearance it was assumed to be a satellite. It was viewed with 15x70 binoculars and appeared only as a bright orange light.   The light stayed the same brightness as it went along, and we were wondering what satellite might be so bright.   Just then, at an altitude of about 25 degrees, it made a sharp turn left to a heading of roughly south.  At that point, we were a little more puzzled. But, the object disappeared behind our maple tree which sits due west of the observatory.  Maybe it was a helicopter, but we heard no noise and the light appeared exactly the same down low as when high overhead, which does not suggest a directional light like a landing light.By then, it was just about time for the Station to appear.  On schedule, it appeared above the maple tree, and we got the telescope on it.  By positioning the telescope ahead of the Station with a reticle finder, we were able to pick up the Station and move the scope by hand at a power of about 30x. We&apos;d move the scope, look for a second as the Station passed through, and jerk the scope ahead a bit.  We lost the Station after about fifteen seconds, and when we went back to the reticle finder to reposition it, we looked up and saw the other object trailing the Station.   We now think it is either a new module which was launched toward the station today, or a resupply vessel which was cut loose from the station a few weeks back.Whatever it was, the excitement of the night will make this a night to remember.  Actually, the light we saw before the Station pass was most memorable. It floated along silently like a satellite, and it remained the same brightness and color the whole time we saw it.Anyhow, when viewing the Station through a telescope, it looks bigger than expected.  It is very bright yellow, almost fiery looking, and the major components can be seen. It is hard to make out very much when manually pushing the telescope to stay on the target, however.", "3 orbs in triangle shape passed over an airplane, headed NW across Minot, ND.My wife and I were having dinner, and I decided to finish the night with a drink and a smoke.

Around 23:00 3 orbs traveling together like a triangle passed over the sky headed NW. The triangle of orbs passed over an airplane traveling the same speed and keeping the same distance. The orbs (each) were 3 times bigger than a commercial airline (like the wings and the under light mesh togeather) at high to maximum altitude.

The discs were situated approximately 25-40 miles from the area of witness and clustered at the north and west coordinates in small groups, sometimes stacked on one another.  Near Mount Shasta and in the general vicinity of highway 5 is the most prominent location for these discs in the last 3 weeks.  They have also been seen due west over the rugged mountains of Trinity County at approximately the same distance away from the witnesses.  A rough estimation of the distance away is 25-40 miles and elevation above the ground is estimated at 10,000 to 25,000 feet.  All sightings have occurred right around 01:00 hours and most have persisted until 03:00 hours or later with the witnesses all having seen their fill by that time. It is the duration of constant hovering combined with the entirely unusual colored lights that! makes a very convincing argument the objects are not helicopters or airplanes. All four witnesses were satisfied with this conclusion and have agreed their is no &quot;normal&quot; explanation for what has been seen.In particular about the craft, they look to be rotating discs oriented horizontally or sometimes tilted at an angle of around 30 degrees. The discs emanate four flashing colors of bright light identified as green, orange, red and blue. The lights flash in a rotation around the perimeter of the discs in an obviously attention getting and unnatural display. The discs have been best described as &quot;Simon&quot; electronic games in the sky rotating. The &quot;Simon&quot; is a game that is still available and consists of four colored lights arranged around a circle that are hit in succession to form a pattern. Surely most people can recall one of these from a television ad at least and visualize the same four colors flashing around the edge of a disc hovering in the night sky.There are sometimes but not always accompanying craft but normally one flashes more brightly than the others or the others seem to hover near or above a main disc.  The discs do not make fast movements but have been seen to move drastically in the sky in a period of only 15 to 20 minutes.  Witnesses would see and identify the disc, then go indoors for a short while and come back out to see the disc had moved a hand&apos;s span in the sky in only a short time.  There has been reliably one disc in the northern sky near Mount Shasta and also similar discs in the western sky over Trinity County, a bit south of Whiskeytown reservoir.  One of the first sightings involved the disc in the northern sky moving in very small rapid circles side to side but maintaining the same altitude.  Almost like the tip of a pencil drawing small curly-Qs over and over in the same place.  This was much more pronounced than the usual &quot;shimmer&quot; of a star in the sky that results from the atmosphere refracting! the light. The discs were definitely making rapid circling movements while rotating their flashing lights constantly.These sightings are complete textbook UFO instances, lasting so long that one has plenty of time to view the object and make a very detailed observation.  These objects are definitely not standard aircraft and resemble nothing seen before by any of the four witnesses.((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.

Ft. Myers, Florida, I observed an illuminated phenomenon high in the sky which was so very distinct and unusual, i have felt compelled to report it.  I have never before seen anything of particular interest in the sky. The atmosphere was particularly clear at the time, and the moon barely halfway rising to zenith.  I originally noticed a light to the north, which i initially assumed to be the lights of a large aircraft coming in to land at our local international airport, which happens here frequently.  But when i focused clearly on it, what i saw was so unusual that the image was simply confusing.  It moved in a perfectly striaght line, horizontally, from N.N.W to S.S.E, on a trajectory not far below the moon.How far away from me it was is difficult to say, however, i would guess from my judgement of its depth of field for it to have been approximately level with the bottom of an average summertime cumulonimbus cloud, although it could have been higher.  It moved very rapidly, far faster than any jet-plane, but not nearly as fast as a meteor.  I estimate that i saw the object, which was originally quite far away, for perhaps 10 seconds.  It was coming toward me, passed in front of me, and then my view was obscured by tall trees nearby to the south. The object (or objects)are difficult to describe.  The closer it came, the more complex and strange it seemed.  I would have to describe it as a long ribbon of translucently glowing light, much like a chemtrail illuminated by moonlight, which had imbedded within it, a series of very bright lights, perhaps a dozen or more.  The lights were brighter than the moon.  The appearance of this thing reminded me of notes on a musical staff, and as the various closely spaced objects moved along together, they left short luminous trails, with all the objects in perfectly placed  rows, yet spaced apart from each other horizontally at irregular intervals.  Their trails connected directly to the ones traveling behind them.  Two were especially large, and the others of variously smaller sizes.  They were moving very quickly, and seemingly perfectly horizontally to the earth.  It appeared there were more forming as they passed by.  There was no associated sound. While this may not be of help, from my fully extended arm, if i was to hold up a ruler (and i&apos;m of average height, 5&apos;8&quot;),the entire object or phenomenon appeared to be approximately 10 inches long horizontally, and 2 inches high, so it/they was very large.", "object flying right above a sedan vehicleAbout 3-4 AM in the morning on my way back home from a family party with a couple of my friends (2)  dropped  off one of them and on the freeway coming back on the 60 east going towards brea canyon from pathfinder in  diamond bar before we hit the ramp a figure as big as the car shaped like sting ray without the tail color all gray  looked kinda like sheet mettle just maneuvered a couple feet right above us going the opposite direction.

I was woken up by something really bright--saw three bright lights in the Eastern sky, evenly spaced, but absolutely not moving.  They seemed to me to be too low in the sky for a satellite, plus they were stationary.  The spacing, at that distance, seemed too bright for any manmade object I am familiar with (geosynchronous orbit).  After ten minutes the three lights began fading and glowing randomly, and continued doing so for over thirty minutes. When it went dark you could still see a sort of halo around the area, then the lights woud pulse back on--but not all at once, they sort of followed each other in their pulsations.   I went to sleep, too tired to continue watching.  I initially thought it might be the space station, solar arrays rotating in the sunlight, but then I found out later the space station orbits the earth and would have been moving--this held position! .  My wife and kids saw the whole thing, and my daughter saw it again the next night.  If I had to guess at a location it would be 60-80 miles south of Atikokan, ONT.  Still, it could have been a man-made object I suppose.  But it was unusual enough that I have been doing a little websearching on this subject and now I am not so sure it was man-made.  I did hear a commercial jet aircraft fly by at the time north of my position.  Maybe they saw it too.

Also there were white lights around on the craft. Can&apos;t remember if lights were blinking or not.  Seems to me that the lights were steady.  We could not tell the shape of the craft as it was dark in color against the night sky. We did not here any sound from the object, but there was a diesel generator running nearby. It was definitely not an helicopter as the object was to big to be one.  It could have been some type of military aircraft but It sure was strange looking.  The &quot;wings&quot; if it had any, did not have and green &amp; red strobe lights on the edge of the &quot;wings&quot;. it may have had white steady lights though.

The object appeared to be over the Gulf of Mexico.  I live in a small town just north of Tampa called Weeki Wachee  I was by myself and at first I thought that I was seeing a very bright sparkly star throwing off a lot of light, mainly blue, red and white.  I looked at other stars in the sky to see if it was just me and I looked back at this one bright star.  I was definitely different.  With my naked eye, I could clearly make out a red, blue and white light, flashing like night aircraft lights.  I questioned myself and thought, this has to be a plane but it did not move.I was outside at the time, so I came in and looked through a strong pair of binoculars.  How I would describe the object is as follows; the object was quite some distance away from my home over the Gulf of Mexico.  It appears to have a shape similar to a box kite.  Two rectangles, one at the top and bottom and some kind of connecting piece, thin, between the rectangles, just like a box kite.  The red and blue color flashes switched between the top and bottom rectangles while the connecting piece remained a bright shining white.I was able to witness this for at lease 10 minutes before the object went behind the clouds and never reappeared.  I did not see the object again until last night, 8/31/2009 at 10:30 pm EST.  It appeared in the same spot in the sky, mid way up on the horizon.

We had gone outside to look for falling stars as it was a very dark and clear night.  The moon wasn&apos;t very bright and I don&apos;t think it was anywhere near where we were looking.We were talking about UFOs and such, all of a sudden in a completely coincidental and serendipitous moment, a triangular object came into our field of vision.  We were standing close to the house, so it appeared to come from over the rooftop and then flew in a straight line from south-east to the north-west.   I was only able to see it for about 5 seconds as it flew over the tree line behind me.  There were tall pine trees all around me and the object was about 2 to 3 times the height of the tree top level.There were no visable lights and it was completely silent.  At first my brain thought I was seeing a falcon gliding or a hang-glider, because of the speed, height, and smoothness of the way the object was flying.  but we quickly realized it was a large object like a craft or something.  It was too slow to be plane, too fast to be a blimp.  It appeared to defy gravity.  It was so quiet i could hear everything around me. the slight hum of the street lights, etc.   You WOULD NOT have seen this thing unless you just happened to be looking at the exact spot that we were looking at at that exact moment.  It was a one in a trillion shot!   It was so dark, as was the sky that night, so it was very well camoflauged.   I say triangular, but i could only make out 2 sides of the triangle in the dark sky, so I don&apos;t know how the back of the object was shaped.  It could have been a triangle or a diamond.  The back was just too dark to see anything.I had the feeling it was a top secret military craft that was maybe on a test flight just to see if anyone would report seeing something that night.  I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if I was the only one in the city to see it that night.  I just happened to be looking for something at just the right time in the right patch of the sky.  But it had white or light-colored markings on the underside, they were on the left and the right side.  They were symetrical, about 4 or 5 white spots or streaks running down the left and right side.  They seemed to defeat the purpose of hiding the craft, but they were on there non-the-less.

I watched it for about 10 seconds because I had never seeing anything like it before and was trying to figure out what it was. Then, it slowly faded away.  I thought maybe it was a plane hitting the sun at an angle that made it disappear.  About 20 seconds later it appeared in the same area again.  It traveled upward again very gracefully and then disappeared.  I did see some birds in the sky, but they were much lower.  This could not have been a bird - it was way to high.  It disappeared and reappeared 4 times.  I was driving where there are many high hills and twisting roads so I eventually lost track of the area it was.  I concluded that it could not be a plane because a plane travels upwards and forwards, this was just t! raveling upwards.  I am a mother of two and a teacher.  I would not make this up.  Maybe it was some sort of reflection?  In appearance, it was not at all like the stories of UFOs I have heard of in the past.  Hmmm . . . . . ?", "Group of bright lights maneuvering at very high speedDate:  15 July 2009  Location:  3 Miles South of Greencastle, PA  Time:  5:30 AM (exactly)  Lighting Conditions:  Generally dark with a hint of dawn on the extreme eastern horizon.  There was a large, bright half-moon that was very high in the sky (~80 degrees of azimuth) to the Southeast; several bright stars were visible although most were obscured by scattered high-level cloud cover.Weather:  Generally clear skies with very light clouds between 20,000-30,000 feet and a second layer of scattered clouds higher up (~50,000-60,000 feet).  There was no significant wind at ground level but the scattered clouds above were moving briskly towards the southeast.Other Aircraft Visible:  A large commercial jetliner (737,757, 767 scale) was visible at a bearing of about 120 degrees true at an estimated 35,000-45,000 feet in elevation.  The aircraft&rsquo;s structure and contrails were visible to the eye as were the white strobe warning light and red &amp; green running lights.Observers Background:  I am a retired Navy Commander who served in the Navy for 21 years on both submarines and surface combatants.  I have been involved in both nuclear power and nuclear weapons and maintained security clearances above the TOP SECRET level.  My most senior assignments were at Fleet Forces Command (U.S. Atlantic Fleet HQ) NAVSUPSYSCOM as Director of Supply Chain Management for all Navy and Marine Corps conventional ammunition. My educational background is in chemical, mechanical and petroleum engineering and I hold a Masters in Business Administration.  Currently I work as General Manager for an industrial manufacturing company.  I have excellent vision, am taking no medications, have never had delusions or mental illness and am not a stereotypical &quot;UFO fanatic.&quot;  I have a significant knowledge regarding aircraft available in the current military inventory and have observed aircraft exceeding mock 1 in relatively close proximity.  I have observed a night-time launch of the space shuttle when my submarine was in Port Canaveral, FL.  I have not observed a definitive UFO or made a UFO sighting report previously.Sequence of Events:  Initial Observation:  I existed my front door at exactly 5:30 AM to start a typical 5-mile walk.  I always check my watch to verify my start time.  It was still fairly dark outside with only a faint hint of sunrise on the extreme eastern horizon.  I immediately noticed a very bright group of lights to the southeast at approximately 140-degrees true and about 10-degrees above the tree- line.  These lights caught my attention because I had never seen anything like them before as they were extremely bright.  To my naked eye, they appeared as three glowing balls that were close together or perhaps touching.  At first I though I must be seeing the moon through clouds but as I glanced up I could see a very bright half-moon well above and to the left of the object.  I also noticed several stars were out and that there was a large commercial jet at about 100-degrees true and very high up (~35,000-40,000 feet) that was traveling east-to-west.  As I glanced back at the three lights I observed that they had traveled a significant distance in just a few seconds and seemed to be moving at great speed.  I couldn&rsquo;t see any typical aircraft lights (white strobe or red/green running lights) and had a gut feeling that this was an unusual event.  I bolted into my house to get a pair of binoculars.  This initial observation took 5-7 seconds.Second Observation:  I had a pair of 10 power binoculars readily available for an upcoming hunting trip and it took me no more than 10 seconds to retrieve them and return to my front porch.  I relocated the object in the sky at about 190- degrees true, about 15 seconds after first seeing the object.  Obviously it had moved from the southeast horizon to southwest very quickly.  I observed that it was about 25,000 feet in altitude &hellip; about the same height as a few light clouds that were close by the object.  I also estimated it was 2-3 miles to the south from me horizontally.  As soon as I looked at the object in 10-power, it was clear there were 6 distinct bright lights.  I looked hard for any visible structures (wings, fuselage, etc.) but saw nothing, nor could I see any typical aircraft lights (white strobe or red/green running lights).  The lights were circular and arranged in a symmetrical pattern of a circle or an imaginary hexagon with each light being centered over each of the corners (see diagram).  The lights were all the same size and color (white &amp; yellow) and were moving together.  It could have been six objects moving in formation but my impression was that the lights were located on a single object.Not seeing any distinguishing features, I put down the binoculars as I wanted to try to gage the size of the object using any available reference.At this point, it had been about 20 seconds since I first saw the object.  It had continued moving west and was at about 220-degrees true and still at ~25,000 feet.  I quickly estimated it had traveled about 10 miles in 20 seconds.  This computed to 30 miles per minute or 1,800 MPH.  Clearly it was moving at 2-3 times the speed of sound and confirmed my impression of extremely high velocity (I had directly observed military aircraft at supersonic speeds below 500 feet in elevation in the past &hellip; the military can do this on the open ocean just not over populated land).I then compared the object to the half-moon still to the southeast and above the object.  In comparison, the object would have covered 25% of a complete FULL MOON in size (see diagram).  It also equaled the half- moon in brightness when seen with the naked eye.I also remembered the large commercial jetliner to the southeast and thought to compare size with this as well.  The jetliner was still plodding along at 500MPH or so and had moved about 10 degrees to 130-degrees true.  I could see the jet&rsquo;s structure clearly and estimated that the diameter of the object with 6-lights was approximately 2.5-3 jet-lengths or 250-300 yards across--obviously very large.I had a thought that perhaps I was seeing the international space station or Hubble telescope and that I was catching a reflection off of solar collection panels as sunrise hit one of these orbiting structures.Final observation:  I had been observing the object for about a total of 30-35 seconds at this point when the object came to a rapid stop, or at least stopped moving west.  I then looked through the binoculars again and picked up the 6 distinct lights in view.  After 2-3 seconds all 6 lights rotated about 30- degrees to the left, like a door knob that was being turned.  The object then began to climb vertically--it was no longer moving west, just up, straight up.  I also observed that there were definitely clouds above the object telling me that it was not in fact in orbit around the Earth but in fact in our atmosphere and between cloud layers.  It appeared the object was accelerating quickly, as within 4-5 seconds it looked to have shrunk to less than half it&rsquo;s original size.  Within another 3-4 seconds I observed it breaking through the upper cloud layer and it immediately shrank from view.Comments:  The total observation period was about 50 seconds with a 10-second break while I retrieved the binoculars.I did not hear any sound from the object (like a sonic boom) but I also did not hear the commercial jet when it passed overhead about 2 minutes later.  One possible explanation is that higher level winds were moving briskly to the southeast and taking acoustic energy away from me.  Also, there was a loud freight train about a mile away that was generating a significant volume of low frequency rumbling masking noise.This object was definitely moving at a high rate of speed, appeared to be substantially larger than man-made aircraft and was maneuvering.  It moved from the eastern horizon to the western horizon in about 25 seconds and then straight up and out of site within another 10-15 seconds.  Initially, it was somewhat below the commercial jet (also moving west) but the object was moving much faster.  It took the jet 2-2.5 minutes to traverse the same distance that the object traversed in ~25 seconds.The brightness of the 6-lights was so intense that it was impossible to see structural details beyond the glare.The object was definitely between cloud layers and not in orbit around the Earth.", "Moon shaped object in western sky glowing orangeOn the morning of August 1st, I had just finished watching a movie with my daughter and was getting ready for bed.  The time was approximately 1:30 am.  I climbed in bed and closed my eyes, when I noticed a bright light coming from the west.  My bed is beneath 3 large windows facing south.  The light was shining on the blinds and looked as if it were car headlights.  I moved the blinds slightly to see if I could get a better look, and was only able to see a bright orange circular light, behind the trees.  To be honest it looked like what we would call a harvest moon.  It seemed odd coming from that direction at that time of morning.  I got up and went to look out of other windows that I may have a better view of the light and possibly the source.  I finally went into a bedroom facing west and looked out the window and saw the bright &ldquo;moon&rdquo; in the sky.  A new cell phone tower had just been put up in town.  The light seemed to be behind it somewhere.  I went back to bed telling myself it must be the actual moon, not really believing it.  The light lasted for about 30-45 minutes and then as quickly as it had appeared, it was gone.  I did not see it leave or how it moved.  I heard no noise.  I just noticed the light was gone from my window.  I have waited for it to return, but it has never been back.  If it returns, I will be getting pictures and video.", "Light travels in sky, accelerates and then disappearsAt approximately 10 pm on a 07/11/09 evening, 3 of us were sitting around the campfire overlooking Dowling lake in Douglas county WI.  We saw what we at first believed to be an aircraft coming from the south, right above the tree line.  We even made the comment that it was about time for the 10:00 flight from Minneapolis to be making an arrival.About five minutes later we notice that the light did not appear to be approaching at the right speed, it was still pretty far out. It was almost like it had been moving ever so slowly.  Shortly after, it seemed to pick up speed and appeared to rise higher into the sky -- then, just seemed to vanish.  It was almost like someone hit a light switch -- it just, went out.Very strange, the three of us talked about it all night!((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS at 22:10 hrs.

The light was white and moving fast and what appeared to be very high, as high as the satallites.  The light would get bright and dim very slowley and seem to disappear but only got dim.  You could still see it through the binoculars while it was dim.  Then as it got overhead we were both surprised to notice at the same time there where more than one and all going in formation and all getting bright and dim at different times.  No noise, no trails and thay kept going north until thay disappeared in the sky.  At that point we saw two aircraft lights coming from the west (Fargo) and head north as if looking for something.

Many sighting from many people across many months.Something is going on in Eugene Oregon.If you read the reports for Eugene/Springfield, Oregon, many people are reporting the same type of sighting.  These reports are spread across many months/years.I saw the UFO last night on a walk in west Eugene.   Was a bright light moving across the sky from west to east.  This was about 5 miles south of the Eugene airport and directly in the landing/takeoff path of aircraft from the airport.  If you look at a map of the airport you will see the main runway runs north to south, so this UFO crossed directly across the path of normal air traffic.  I haven&apos;t see an airplane ever move in an west to east pattern this close to the airport.Craft details.  I have no idea how to judge the height or speed of the UFO.  It was much too bright and moving to slow to be a satellite.  We did see satellite about 10 minutes after the UFO was gone for comparison.  The craft flew directly over head and was completely silent.  As it moved east, it finally sped up and was not visible any longer.About 30 minutes, we either saw the same UFO or one that looked exactly like it.  It was moving south to north at a rapid pace, but was far to the east of us.  An airplane with blinking light was moving in the opposite direction at the same time, but the UFO was much quicker and appeared to be at a much lower altitude.I also believe we saw this UFO on July 4th.  We were north of the Eugene Airport by 10 miles.  The light appeared to be south of the Airport and stopped hovered for about 10 minutes.  Then disappeared.I would assume this UFO is some sort of manmade device, but it is very hard to speculate on its speed and height as there is nothing to use as a reference.  It also does not follow the normal traffic pattern of aircraft that frequent the airport.", "UFO Santa Ana ,CA 01/11/09On January 11,2009 I went to throw the trash when a bright object caught my attention,look like a big star in the sky but not until it moved very fast across the sky like a comet with a small glowing tail and then stopped. At this time I started yelling to my wife to come outside and then my folks woke up thinking something had happened ,when they came outside my reaction and there reaction was shock. It looked like one of the brightest star in the sky moving vary odd and very fast from one angle to another. When I called my older brother and told him I am seeing a UFO he told me I was on drugs but I just had to convince him to come see it for them self, meanwhile my folks were very nervous and exited at what they were witnessing.The object looked oval and very bright but when my brother arrived he was wordless he then immediately took his camera and we stared filming the objects they were moving so fast that it was hard for us to zoom in so we had to go on ! top of the roof were we can get a better view,we filmed it about 35min but whats weired was that when we filmed it there was two oval objects that you can clearly see in the video and they seemed to be following each other, after some attempts to call local news we saw and heard helicopters and or local helicopters. When the helicopters got close to the objects they seem to dive down and never came up again.But they showed up almost at the end of the video witch we later posted a 3min video of the UFO objects .To this day it was a unfortgatable occurrence.", "single bright amber colored light hovering over the ocean for a duration of time before disappearingOn a boardwalk on the beach at Jaycee park in Vero Beach Florida at 21:30 hours on august 1st a friend of mine and myself walked up to the boardwalk to take a look at the ocean with a few other night walkers crusing the path, when we noticed a substantially large amer colored single light out over the ocean, it was about 10 degrees above eye level and just kind of motionless , if it was moving it was moving extremely slow northward. But it was an amber colored light with  the radiant light beams coming off of it due to the salt in the air, I thought it may have been a plane or helicopter but it was borderline motionless and the light color was very strange and far off, a cloud went infront of it once and the light beams were still protruding through the cloud structure.

It was at a low altitude (approx. 5,000-10,000 feet)and moving at a high rate of speed and with no noise.  I followed it visually until it passed out of sight behind the tall hedges at the rear of my property. I doubt it was a meteorite since I have seen plenty in my time.  The trajectory was all wrong for this altitude since it was travelling across the horizon rather than downwards. I have also witnessed a natural fireball fall to earth and this lacked the material (&quot;sparks&quot; and flames) trailing behind it. I have seen countless types of aircraft (military, private, commercial) travelling at all sorts of altitudes, at all times of day and in all weather conditions.  This was not an aircraft.

You see, this man looked &quot;exactly&quot; like an older President John F. Kennedy.  We both saw it for ourselves.  But that wasn&apos;t what shocked us the most.  The man had a long scar running all the way down the right side of his face and into his skull.  This &quot;whatever&quot; had been shot or injured with a huge wound all the way around the right side of his skull.  The scars were there to prove it, and he had been sewn up with many stitches.  We were both shocked and stunned to say the least.  The man passed us and then I finally said to JM, &quot;Did you just see what I saw?&quot;  And JM said, &quot;Yes, but I don&apos;t believe it.&quot;  We then went looking for this man and he was simply gone! in an instant.  We saw an individul that day who was an older! JFK, a spirit, MIB, or an alien.  This President John F. Kennedy man combed his hair the same way JFK did, had the visible scars on the right side of his head were positioned the same as JFK&apos;s were after he was assassinated on November 22, 1963.  I have seen some of JFK&apos;s autoposy photograhps.  The facial features were exactly the same too.  He looked at us both as if he wanted us to notice him.  I hope you will not think that we are &quot;cooks&quot; of some kind.  I have seen several UFOs and other strange things before, and I &quot;did&quot; see this too.  The UFOs are real, and I have seen the proof.  I wasn&apos;t looking to see anything strange that day either.  I am a Christian, and attend Church regularly and I believe in Jesus Christ.  We know for sure what we both saw that day and it still lingers in our minds.  As a Historian, I have heard several stories about JFK and his knowlege of UFOs.  This man, whoever or whatever he was, makes me wonder.  This is a very true and accurate story-it really ! happened.  I do wish to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution at seeing this!((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the time of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "bright white light moving erratically leaving light trailsLast night I saw a very bright white light in the SSE sky.  It appeared to be moving or jumping, so I took my binoculars out to observe. The light was very high in the sky and moved erratically in all directions while staying in one general area.  The object left light trails, so it looked like light squiggles. The object continued to move like this for about 10 minutes, when it started to move further away and became fainter. It was moving erratically the entire time until it disappeared into the distance.", "Bright at rapid speed in NE corner of CalforniaThe nights of July 16th and 17th were lovely warm and clear summer evenings for watching the stars and looking for satellites. Prior to the time of UFO sighting I had sighted about six satellites and multiple high altitude aircraft. I had been laying on the ground for about one half hour in a way that no ground based lights were visible. My body was positioned in a north to south direction.  (Location Coordinates  41&deg;37&apos;45.18&quot;N  120&deg;12&apos;50.27&quot;W).  Around 2330 I noticed a bright white light traveling west to east from a point starting on a line about one half of the distance between my north horizon and the North Star.  The light felt like it was shining from a beginning distance of 15 to 20 miles to the north of my position which would be in the neighbor hood of Mount Bidwell (Coordinates: 41&deg;57&apos;57&quot;N  120&deg;9&apos;56&quot;W).  The light reminded me of a brightness of an aircraft landing light except that it felt like it was too far away and was traveling at an angle away fr! om my point of view.  No navigation lights were visible at any time around the light.  The light did not appear to be directional like a landing light. The path of the diminishing size indicated possible travel away in an east north easterly direction, with the light fading and extinguishing from view prior to my north east horizon.  Transit time was in the range of one minute.This path would be consistent with possible travel for a military night training flight from Kingsley field in Klamath Falls, OR (LMT), to the Hart South MOA. However, the transit time across the horizon and perceived distance appeared much too fast for a jet not in afterburner and under the speed of sound. The night was still and no sound was apparent. My position was slightly east of airway V 165 and high altitude aircraft are regularly visible transiting north to south both west and far to the east of my position.  I have never seen a light maneuver like this one, nor have I ever noticed any other flying object that I did not feel could be reasonably explained.This location is in a sparsely populated region of California.  Documented cattle mutilations have occurred in the past on local ranches. I am a former Navy and commercial pilot flying such aircraft such the C-130 in the Atlantic and Pacific regions so am familiar with aircraft and landing lights.", "2 round balls of fire hovering over Saginaw BayMy dad and I go duck hunting on Saginaw Bay every year.  We leave our trailers in a state camp site a few miles from the Bay.  One evening around late October 1994 we saw what was by definition was a UFO.The campsite was deserted but for my dad and me and a friend who had gone to sleep in his trailer.  The moon was bright and we were standing outside listening to the geese and ducks being loud and obnoxious.   I noticed a white light about 30 degrees off the horizon.   I told my dad it might be a planet, but it stayed there, and as our eyes focused it flickered like a flame.   He went to get binoculars and I went to the observation stand which is about 20 feet higher.   Thru the binos it looked like a white flame flickering over open water, you could clearly make out the shoreline with the moon light.   We watched it for a few minutes; my dad speculated it was a gas well, then maybe a reflection of one.  I told him there were none there.He walked down and woke up his fiend in his trailer.  Thru the binos I could see a white mass that appeared to flicker like a camp fire from a distance.   Dad&rsquo;s friend joined us on the observation tower and was clueless as to what it was, then out of nowhere a smaller light appeared next to it, they then started moving back and forth along the water line.  My dad said they might be helicopters looking for someone.  But helicopters don&rsquo;t make pin point turns like that and have spot lights which look like flames.  After only a minute or two of that, they started heading out over the bay, we lost sight as they took a high speed route straight away from us.Sometimes now we mention it and pause and some says, what do you think that was, but no one knows more than the other.  It was an unidentified flying object, that&rsquo;s all I know.((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD))", "Please note that my knowledge of flying aircraft is enough to be able to clearly identify most military aircraft openly used, commercial aircraft for air cargo/passenger usage, private aircraft, and kit /ultralight  aircraft used openly today.  Having said that, what I and two other people, saw last night was clearly a UFO as it&rsquo;s flight characteristics, shape, engine, and course defies normal know aircraft. Also note that  I&rsquo;m former military, Commercial Law Enforcement, and of sound mind and body with Pilot vision with corrective glasses on (I was warring my new prescription glasses).  The below state of events is true and factual to the best of my knowledge. The tempture in Yamhill County during the day was in the lower 90&rsquo;s and where I live about 3 miles north of the town of Yamhill on State Hwy 47 the wind was picking up and I decided to go outside and let the dogs play and water some plants, a new maple tree, and some rose bushes while letting the house cool down for the night.  I had just completed watering the tree, my landlord&apos;s son had some guest come by earlier and they were leaving.  As they were leaving I walked to the west corner of the front porch and began to water the rose bush.  It was a beautiful night, not a cloud in the sky and all the stars were shinning bright.  I looked up and toward the west hills of the small valley where I live and saw a bright white sphere shaped object moving across the sky at a low altitude and making no sound.  Now you have to understand aircraft of all types fly over the house all the time and some at low altitude and in all directions.  I&rsquo;m close to the McMinnville Airport, Port of Portland Hillsboro Airport which can both handle jet liners (up to 747-100 @ McMinnville and  757 @ Hillsboro)  plus the house is on the glide path for final at the Portland International Airport.  I can see their tail markings without the use of binoculars.   When the jets come in on a PDX vector it&rsquo;s south to north and their landing lights are on and at night the lights project forward.  This object was not projecting light forward.  It was making no sounds of any kind and when it moved from west to the east it wasn&rsquo;t a smooth glide it was jagged.  I stepped back as it started across the house so I could get a better look.  I kept saying, &ldquo; what the hell is that thing.&rdquo;  I called out for landlord&rsquo;s son as loud as I could. When he came out of his home I just said,  &ldquo; look . . . . . . . . !&rdquo; and point up in the sky at the object. I then said, &ldquo; listen . . . . . . no sound.&rdquo;  He agree and about a that time is when his wife came out to see what all the commotion was about and he pointed up and said, &ldquo;look at this.&rdquo;  His wife said, &ldquo; It&rsquo;s not flying to straight is it?&rdquo; I replied , &ldquo;no it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo; Now the object was not flying over the house, north of the home. Within a few minutes the craft was over my landlord&apos;s son&rsquo;s house and still heading east.  This is when I notice a regular aircraft, flying higher than the object (at least 10,000 feet higher) and in the same direction and that gave me some distance reference and scale as that aircraft was at about 33,000 feet or higher and the object was much lower than that.  Still moving without sound and in a jagged direction, the object cleared the landlord&apos;s son&rsquo;s home and was heading of the west hills of this small valley.   As it crossed over it disappeared (vanished) with out any type of marker lights from behind it.  I stood there with the landlord&rsquo;s son and we where comparing what we had seen.  That&rsquo;s when I became scared for the first time sense the death of my wife.  My thoughts are one of come up with some kind of logical kind of answer to what I just saw. &quot;If I saw what I think I saw . . . . . . . . it&rsquo;s not real . . . . . . is it?&quot;  &quot;What if it comes back?&quot;  I stayed out side looking up for about a half hour and then it dawned on me to call the police non emergency line and report what I had seen.  I called Yamhill County  Communication Center (YCOM) and he contacted a sheriff&rsquo;s Deputy and he in turned called me and left a message with y! our (National UFO Reporting Center) phone number as he didn&rsquo;t know how the handle such a report. Called National UFO Reporting Center and left a message on your service and request a investigator to contact me with respect to the above.", "fast moving, circular cloud-like object in the early morning sky over Grenada in the CaribbeanUFO Sighting:  Sunday August 02, 2009 I was about to leave for my usual early morning jog at exactly 5:00 a. m.   As I stepped out onto my porch and looked up my eyes locked onto a moving object.  It was just approaching daybreak. There was an area of cloudiness in the location and the object itself appeared to be a circular (though not perfectly round) batch of cloud in the background of the cloudiness but very visible (though not with sharp contrast) through the clouds.  It moved at extremely great speed, certainly faster than an aircraft, in a horizontal direction (left to right) for a distance of about two or so miles.  It traveled back and forth approximately on the same track covering one leg in about 3 to 5 seconds.  I estimate its size to be about a regular motor car.  It was about four or so thousand feet up and a distance of about 4 miles from my location.  As you will imagine size, speed and distance are very difficult to estimate in this situation but this is my best estimate. I kept my eyes locked on the o! bject for 10 minutes.  I then walked a distance of about 100 meters and when I looked to the location where I first saw the object, it was still there.   I then went on my way.  By the time I return, about 5: 50 a.m. it was daylight and the object was not seen.", "Bright  light over Owen co. kentuckyObject appeared to be a comet at first.  It was a dull green in color and had a streaking tail that was a green yellow in color.  It came from every high in the sky and was traveling due north.The object started to slow and came with in just miles and changed color to a very bright intense white color.  It almost seem to pulsate. The light wasn&apos;t a very large light,but was slightly larger than that of a passenger plane.The lighted object came to a near dead stop,just kind of wobbled and then changed it&apos;s direction from due north to due east.All this took only 40 or 50 seconds.I then got everyone out of the house and when we got back out of the house the object was still very close and was still moving due east.  We then watched the object move off very slowly.After about 2 minutes of watching the object,it just seemed to take off at a unreal speed.The reason i say this is that the object went from a large object in the sky to a very small one in just seconds.  And just disappeared.Shortly after,20seconds or so. We heard what appeared to be two very loud planes traveling very low to the ground,without any lights.((NUFORC Note:  Second object was ISS.

They were using intermittent, seemingly random, fairly bright flashing strobes of red and white.  They were moving in circular patterns.  The strobes would stop completely which made the jets was very hard to fallow by sight, then they would be bright again.  Then I noticed a similar strobe light that was not a jet aircraft.  It was flashing red and white randomly, it would move then disappear and then reappear in another part of the sky.  It&apos;s direction was never constant it seemed to wonder around the sky. It seemed that the jets were trying to get close to it.  Then, I noticed another smaller white light that was moving, (I thought it was a satellite at first) I then noticed another white light, the first white light proceeded to do a course change towards the second object and quick and smooth did a complete circle around this object.  Both objects were white lights and m! oved away from each other and faded up into the night sky.  All this happened while military jets were in the area circling.  I noticed the original (not jet aircraft) flashing object move west away from the city area.

One of the witnesses had time to look out of a vehicle window when the other two individuals shouted &quot;look at that!&quot;  This object was larger and brighter than any star or planet I have ever seen.  The moon is the only thing which ever appears in the night sky which is brighter than this object.  It was a single, brilliant white light with a starburst appearance.  There were no sounds or blinking lights associated with this object.The most disturbing thing about this object was how it went away.  The light faded to black.  It appeared to fade down to nothing just like someone had turned down a dimmer switch or if this object had moved away from us at an unbelievable speed.I have observed many meteor showers and aircraft over the years and have never seen anything remotely as strange and disturbing as this object.", "UFO PROB/FBI/CIA? 27 AUG 08 I was leaving work around 12:25 pm, 27 Aug 08, Ellington Fld, Houston, TX-- I was going home to evacuating from hurricane Gustav.I notice the object, as I was at the top of I-45 over pass going south towards Pearland, TX.

The date is an educated guess.  It occurred, to the best of my recollection, on either 10/03/92 or 10/05/92.While flying a Boeing 727 for a major airline, we were enroute to RDU airport, in North Carolina.  As we were approaching the airport from the northeast, I observed something I&rsquo;ve never seen before, nor since.  We were within thirty five miles of the airport, below 10,000&rsquo; and going 250 KIAS or less.  The First Officer was flying the airplane.  While he was flying, I was looking out ahead of us.  We were below a broken layer of clouds, and the sun was still high and breaking thru the layer above us.  Ahead of us, I saw what I thought was a flight of two F-16&rsquo;s.  The sun was glinting off of *them*, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have even have been able to see them.  The Raleigh Approach controller didn&rsquo;t call them as traffic, and I wasn&rsquo;t worried, as they were a good bit ahead of us.  I looked down to review an approach plate or tune a radio or some minor task, I looked up about thirty seconds after first seeing the flight of two, and the next thing I see is a chevron shaped vehicle within a! n eighth of a mile of us.  It is now right outside of my window, just forward off the left wing, traveling opposite direction, at our altitude.  I think that this must have been what I had previously thought to be the F-16&rsquo;s.  The chevron shaped thing must have been in a turn earlier, and that the sun glinting off what, for lack of a better term, might be considered end-plates of the *wings* made it appear like a couple of F-16&rsquo;s (or any other small fighter).As unusual sightings go, this was not a very flamboyant looking vehicle; however, it was a very flashy flyer.  It wasn&rsquo;t flying along as if it were a *flying wing* type vehicle.  It flew past us, standing on the tip of what you might consider to be its left wing.  So, rather than the wing being parallel to the surface of the earth, it was perpendicular.  I watched it for about five seconds before it passed behind our left wing.  I asked the Raleigh Approach controller: what just passed Airline/flt. # so and so?  I was specific when I asked him.  I stated that it was just to our south, and at our altitude, flying from a generally southwest direction to the northeast.  The controller took a little longer than normal to reply.  He said he didn&rsquo;t have anything on radar.  Then he waited a little bit longer, and asked if I had seen anything.  I knew it was better, at the time, to keep my mouth shut, so my reply was along the lines of:  no, I guess not.  The controller didn&rsquo;t press, and I didn&rsquo;t offer anything else.This vehicle was unusual in a couple of ways.  It flew on the tip of a wing, level (as it were) and didn&rsquo;t seem to have any problem maintaining altitude.  There was no, visible, means of propulsion.  It didn&rsquo;t leave any type of trail.  It was approx. fifty feet (plus or minus ten feet) from tip to tip, and from its *nose* to the trailing edge of its *wing* was no more than maybe twenty to twenty five feet.  It was a dull grey, kind of like battleship grey, and there wasn&rsquo;t anything on the side that was visible to me that looked light lights.  There were no markings at all, that were obvious.Unfortunately, I had been totally taken in by this thing when it flew past us.  After it passed behind the left wing, I asked to FO and FE if they had seen it.  They had not.((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC has exchanged a number of e-messages with the party who submitted this report, who is a retired senior captain for a major U. S. airline.

After watching it slowly cross our night sky for a second or two, I asked my husband to look up and see if he sees what I&apos;m seeing.

Then the object then turned 180 degrees towards the North West and began scanning the mountain top with a shapeable bright white search beam. The mountain top is estimated to be about 4 &frac12; - 5 &frac12; miles away from my home.  The object was moving very quickly compared to conventional aircraft and was completely silent.  Normally I can hear helicopters from that distance very clearly as the sound echoes of the canyon and mountain surface. The object had to be moving or jumping from mountain peak to mountain peak in less than a seconds. It did not appear to be in a hurry but searched quickly and lit up &frac14; mile sections of the mountain top almost as bright as day with its search beam.  I could very clearly see the rocky surface and trees present on the mountain surface. I watched it move from place to place along the south side of the mountain top and ridge as if it were searching for something. It probably covered about a 1 &ndash; 1 &frac12; mile area east to west then seemed to go north again just over the mountain crest out of view.  The strange thing is that when it went out of view it appeared that its search beam was penetrating the mountain with a blue hue as if it were translucent or the beam were actually shining through the mountain as it searched both the north and south sides. Because of this translucent appearance through the top area of the mountain crest it was very difficult to gauge if the object was behind or in front of the north side of the ridge. Very strange indeed, because the object was not visible when it went over the ridge but the beam was. Just when I thought I was wrong and that it just had its search light pointed away ! to the n orth it ascended upwards over the ridge to the south side again and the translucent looking beam spot looked as if it came up over the top surface of the north crest and then down the south side again only to get brighter and whiter. I then immediately began feeling my pockets for my cell phone to take a picture and remembered that I had a flip camera in the house.  I started to walk backwards quickly and then the object stopped dead in its search, I had a feeling like you get when in the back-country and you spot a deer and realize the deer has spotted you too. The object then pointed its search beam down the mountain slope in my direction but the beam only ended about halfway down the entire mountain ridge. I had a feeling that it knew I was aware of it now and quickly walked backwards towards the door while keeping an eye on it. It then resumed search of the area with its search beam as I dashed in the house to wake my parents and get my camera to film the event.  I woke my parents, grabbed the flip camera and ushered my parents outside to whiteness the event (about 30seconds). When we got outside it was nowhere to be seen and I stayed outside for the next hour long after my parents retired back to bed in hopes it would return so I could film it. It never returned.  The whole event only lasted about 2-3 minutes.

On the 8/15/09 I was helping my friend load his fathers van with gardening equipment.  Just as we were about finished loading the vehicle we noticed two lemon-shaped red lights over the Wash (an estuary in south Lincolnshire).The lights moved very quickly and demonstrated great maneuverability. The lights appeared to weave from one side of the estuary to the other in a matter of seconds which leads me to believe that what we saw was no aircraft, but is more likely to be an aerial phenomenon or UFO.We both watched the lights for nearly three minutes.  After this one of the lights appeared to zip off north-east over the horizon.  Seconds later the second light just faded away.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was taking my dog out to do her business and also taking the trash out. As I was walking down my apartment stairs I noticed 3 bright lights in the ski.  One was standing still, one was moving to the left, and the other was coming straight for me or more like over my apartment.At first I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it because I live by Boeing airfield in Everett. Then I noticed that the one that was coming towards me was really bright, kind of like the north star that those guys where following to find Jesus, but this was no star I promise you that.I also noticed it had no other lights like a regular aircraft. No red, green, or blue lights that usually flash on a plane or helicopter, the other two where the same. I was more focused on the one coming closer to me, because I could see it so clearly. I also noticed it was flying lower than a plane. Planes from Boeing don&rsquo;t take off over my apartment ever, and they never get that close to our apartment like that. There was also no sound. You would defiantly hear noise if it was that close. Now when I say close, I don&rsquo;t mean hit my house close but it was to close for a normal plane, and if it was a helicopter I would have heard it.Then also as it got closer I noticed it was swinging side to side, kind of like how if you hold up a necklace and it swings side to side. By now I was getting a little excited because I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing. Then I quickly looked at the one moving to the left and it was moving at the same speed, and it looked the same. It was just farther away.The third one was higher and standing still, but I am not sure if it was the space station or not. I don&rsquo;t know exactly where it is in the ski, but I never noticed it there before until last night.Then I decided to run in my house, and go on the deck to watch the one that was coming towards me pass over my house, but as I got there, nothing came over. It was just gone. If it was a real plane it should have come right over my apartment, and past right in front of my deck. But it didn&rsquo;t. Then I ran back out to see if I could see the other one and it was gone. The only one left was the one that was standing still.I am going to go back out tonight to see if I can see the one that was standing still, and if I can then it was just the space station. The other two where nothing like what I have ever seen before.I am still in shock.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It appeared to be at a very high altitude and was moving so quickly that I could only see it for perhaps 3-4 seconds before it disappeared into the dark horizon. I could not hear any sound coming from the object &ndash; it appeared to be totally silent. It flew in a straight line, heading north, and was moving far too quickly to be of human origin (in my experience).It was difficult to gauge the object&rsquo;s size as altitude was impossible to ascertain. My guess is that it was very large. Colour appeared to be whitish, or perhaps it was emitting a dull white light.Shape was nothing like any UFO&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve heard about. This one looked like about six standard shaped aircraft joined wing to wing (they were definitely connected - it was a single craft) and flying in a perfectly straight line at incredible speed. Never seen anything like it and cannot explain it. The impression I had was that it was simply flying past the planet on the way to somewhere else because the speed and altitude was so extreme.

It was at this time I got real excited, and started to scan the sky with my eyes to see if there were more. So I went out to the street and looked behind the house, and saw another one moving in the opposite direction of where the other 2 were heading (away from me). Within minutes, another one came from the direction that the 3rd was moving, but heading in the complete opposite direction (toward me). It was at this point that I got off the phone with my father to go get my wife so she could witness this phenomenon. As soon as we came back out, she spotted one moving right over our heads (the 5th one), at that point she was pretty nervous. Then as luck would have it, we see another (the 6th) coming from a completely new direction, lost sight of it as it was moving even faster than the others and quickly faded behind the trees.Right before going inside, we spotted one last one (a 7th).

It was a very bright light, white bright light and had a small red light above it moving around, it was be there than vanish than come back.) Anyways back to last night. So I saw something moving in the sky when I looked up. The way it was turning was so quickly and smoothly that there was no way it could be a plane or a helicopter. It made no sound at all. It had 2 blue lights and one red light. I screamed for my mom and she came running out of her room to where I was, I looked up at the object, oh yeah and I couldn&apos;t make out the shape because the lights were too bright and it was still a little too dark, anyways, my mom got over there and at this point it was just flying straight and looked pretty normal. My mom was like you called me out here to look at a plane in the sky. I didn&apos;t say anything and we both kept staring at it. All of the sudden it started moving up and down like it would drop 100 feet and than go back up again way to smoothly and easily to be anything like a helicopter or plane, it was turn very quickly also, like it&apos;d be going in one direction and in a split second it&apos;d be going the opposite way. Me and my mom were speechless. I looked at her and asked her to explain what that could possibly be and she just laughed. She did not have any idea what that could possibly be. She started nervously laughing. We watched it for another 5 minutes and it started flying away towards the west and all of sudden it completely vanished. About 2 seconds later it showed up in a completely different part of the sky. So it vanished and than popped up on the opposite side of where it vanished. IMPOSSIBLE thing for a plane or helicopter to do. My mom looked at me and was like how in the world could it d! o that.We stayed out there for about 10 minutes watching this thing vanish and come back and do turns and smooth flips making no sounds. Than one of our neighbors came out who lives below me. He looked up and me and my mom staring into the sky and was like what are you guys looking at. We didn&apos;t say anything so he looked up in the direction we were looking at. He was like Oh a plane. The object was again flying straight so looked kinda normal. Than it started doing those 180 turns and going up and down the guy stared at it and pulled out his camera phone and was freaking out. He tried to take a picture but of course it didn&apos;t come out good. Being a cell phone camera. I can&apos;t even take picture of a full moon on my camera phone. Anyways. It started getting far away and vanished behind trees. The guy ran out into the parking lot on the phone telling his friends what he saw looking for it. My mom still didn&apos;t know what to say, and I went inside to call friend and tell her. I came back out and my mom was still staring in the sky, I looked up and the object was gone but now smaller lights that were further away began to pop up in the sky. They were sparkly to the point where they looked like they were on fire. Again with red and blue lights around them. I don&apos;t know what this was. It was DEFINITELY not a plane or helicopter or jet or anything like that because those can&apos;t vanish and pop back into the sky or morph around like that.", "2 large ash circles on the groundNo actual UFO sighting.

To the East above my neighbors roofline I was a BRIGHT ORANGE/RED pulsating sphere.  At first glance, I thought it was fireworks.  However, it moved way too slow and just hovered.  Next, I thought airplane, although there was zero sound plus it was way too bright.The sphere slowly tracked a course to the Northwest, and slowly gained elevation.  I asked my wife to hurry outside.  When she arrived the sphere had continued to gain elevation, and dwindle in size and intensity.The sphere started out very bright and roughly the size of a full moon.  The sphere tracked a deliberate course to the Northwest all the while gaining elevation.  I watched this sphere for roughly one minute.  It started out at roughly 15 degrees in the horizon very intense, and slowly dissipated at 60 plus degrees in the horizon.Wife: I was packing for vacation in the bedroom by the window when I heard my husband quietly say, &ldquo;Babe, come here and take a look at this.&rdquo;  When I went outside my husband was standing at the end of our yard looking in an Eastward direction.

He said, &ldquo;What do you think that is?&rdquo;  I replied immediately with, &ldquo; A UFO.&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t making any sound at all.&rdquo;  I then yelled for my eleven year old daughter to come out into the yard to take a look.  We all stood there in amazement and watched as the object faded away.The entire sighting was 1 minute in length.  We were facing in the East direction.  The object traveled in a Northwest direction.  At my initial look the object was approximately 30-40 degrees from the horizon, close to the size of the full moon.  The color was BRIGHT ORANGE, and never changed in vividness.  At my last view of the object it was approximately 60 degrees still heading in the exact same Northwest direction.  The object seemed to become invisible due to distance.  It became smaller than a star upon no longer being able to view it.The experience made the hair all over me stand on end, and my body was covered in goose bumps that lasted for a good 20-30 minutes after coming into our home and locking the door.  I was unsure if we should call the police, our local National Guard, and then online found the National UFO Reporting website.

Daughter: My experience of seeing an UFO was not like anything I have ever seen in my eleven years of life.  The time was about 9:15p.m.  When I walked outside the color of it was bright orange with a little bit of red.  By the time I had got outside, it was fairly small but very visible.  It looked like it was smaller than the moon, but bigger than a star.  While I stood in amazement the object was at about a 50 degree angle from the horizon.

I am a trained observer, amateur astronomer for over 40 years, and have an extensive background in science. The dates are approximate. On my way to work one morning, I had stopped for a cup of coffee at a small market that sits at the north end of Lake Goodwin, WA. As I exited my vehicle, I noted a new Boeing 767 or 777, (the aircraft hadn&rsquo;t been painted yet, and was still in the green primer) coming down the length of the lake that runs north south, at an altitude of just two thousand feet and probably less. The sky was clear and visibility excellent. It&rsquo;s not unusual to see these aircraft in this area, but I&rsquo;d never seen one this low or flying so slowly. The flight path is a northerly one used out of Paine Field (approx 15 miles to the south) where these aircraft are manufactured and I assumed this to be a test flight. As I watched the aircraft come down the length of the lake, I was marveling at how quiet it was despite its low altitude and mentioned it to a lady who had pulled into the store a few seconds behind me and was also headed into the market, but like me, had stopped to watch the plane.&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she asked and pointed at an object in the sky to the right of the aircraft (west) and perhaps 50 feet below its altitude.I had been focused on the aircraft, but immediately saw what she was pointing at. At this time the aircraft was approximately a half mile or less distant. The object was round, bright white, and moving to the east. In size from my location, it approximated a pencil eraser held at arms length. As I watched, it passed directly under the aircraft (that seemed to take no note of it) missing it by about 50 feet and allowing me to estimate it diameter which was approximately 15 feet. In appearance, it was cloud like, but very round with somewhat fuzzy borders. Silhouetted against the blue sky, I could see it very clearly, and it was definitely not a bird, balloon, or another aircraft. I estimated its speed at 120 miles per hour as it covered the width of the lake (a half mile) in about 15 seconds. The aircraft passed over my head a few seconds later, but I was watching the object that maintained a constant course and speed, finally disappearing in the east fifteen or twenty seconds later. I talked briefly with the woman I watched it with and she agreed that it was something highly unusual.A few years previous to this sighting I was a passenger in a car on a highway between Butte and Helena Montana. In the sky that day, (afternoon) and on a southerly course, I saw a similar object (bright white, cloud like, but very round.) It was moving at both altitude (approximately 5000 feet) and speed (approximately 1000 miles per hour) I derived these numbers from the height of a broken cumulus deck that I estimated to be 8000 feet and the fact the object seemed to be moving approximately twice the speed of a conventional jet liner. They are by no means accurate, but probably in the ball park. I could make no estimate of size beyond saying it was small. I had the object in sight for about thirty seconds when it did something damn strange. It disappeared and not gradually. It just evaporated. I mention it only because of the physical similarity to the object I saw at Lake Goodwin under pristine viewing conditions.((NUFORC Note:  Date in May2003 is approximate.

We live in north La Mesa and can see the cross from Mount Helix from our back yard. The lights looked to be just east of there.We have had other &ldquo;sightings&rdquo; before (3 years in a row except for last year), so this would be our 4th year. With the naked eye they look like red lights. They generally seemed to appear right as the fireworks started.  But this time as I looked up, I saw 4 red lights in a large triangular pattern and yelled to my husband &ldquo;They are here now!&rdquo;  I grabbed my camera (with tripod) and got some unique photos. With magnification, the red dots appear to look like some sort of worm like shape. And they moved faster than the shutter.  Then 2 of the lights just &ldquo;faded out&rdquo;.  I took as many as I could.By 9:10: they were all gone.", "High altitude red lights moving too fast  to be any modern aircraft3 years ago i had 2 friends overnight at my new house and we decided to throw and all nighter.So we went down to the Craigie Primary School to lie on the roof and gaze at the stars because the sky was clear and the stars clearly visible.Then my friend said he saw a red light in the sky, but me and my other friend couldnt see it.Then we both saw it, there was a little red light which looked like a star, as it must have been pretty high up.It was moving really smoothly around in maneuvers that modern aircraft wouldnt be able to pull off.We saw 2 or 3 more lights, they were all moving around in these difficult maneuvers.Then suddenly one of them sped up, zoomed off and dissappeared out of our sight like a bullet and it seemed it went around the earth in seconds, or maybe another one joined the group because we saw one speed over our heads and join the group again as if the light circum navigated the globe in about 10 seconds.They all left a small light trail behind when they moved really fast and when they wern&apos;t moving really fast they were just wafting lazily in circles.It was strange, one second the ywere wafting, then doing difficult maneuvers then speeding off the face of the earth and reappearing from the other side.We watched this into the morning hours until it was too bright to see them anymore then we went inside and decided to go to sleep.We always just passed it off as a meteor shower or something we were really freaked out that we witnessed this.I just decided to Report this tonight because i want to know if anyone else has witnessed anything similar to this so i can hear their recollection of the event.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the time of the sighting is approximate.

At that point, it was just a light moving in a straight path in the sky.  We live an hour North of Dallas and very close to a local small airport and see aircraft frequently.  The aircraft I was following was traveling from the NW to the SE when I noticed a bright flash (like a camera flash) off to the left of the object I was tracking.  Then off to the right of the object about a minute later, another flash, but no object observed.As I continued to visually track the object I thought was an aircraft, it suddenly made a sharp left turn in an arc like an aircraft might do, but it seemed to turn upward and rapidly disappeared out of sight.  Mush faster than an aircraft might do based on the distance I thought it was from my observation point.The next day my wife and I observed some discolored grass in our yard not noticed before.  We noticed a pattern of 5 spots in a pentagon shape about 2 ft in circumference spaced equally apart and one spot off to the side.

Just to the west of the water tower, what looked like a few miles, and would place the object somewhere in the vicinity over highway 54, a small, spherical, metallic object appeared to be hovering at an altitude of approx. five thousand feet.  You could see the sun reflecting off the bottom and the top was darker where the sun wasn&apos;t reflecting from it.  I kept checking every couple of seconds out my window at it to see if it was moving or to figure out what it was but it was just stationary.  Anyone from this area knows the only aircraft we get around by us is crop dusting planes and small single engine props. and no other planes were in the sky that i could see at the time and this object was not moving at all eliminating the possibility of it being a plane, and the metallic appearance means it was not a star or the ISS. I went to look on! e more time it looked like the object just shot off due west and in a pretty vertical trajectory gaining altitude in a split second and was gone.  I wasn&apos;t going to think anything of this except for the fact that I saw the exact same thing in the exact same spot while driving in the exact same spot about a year or two earlier which is weird.  I also was reading reports on here about other sightings and noticed someone saw something similar in the Stevens Point/Plover area and thought maybe there is something to this sighting after all.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was sprinkling rain and there was a cloud cover blocking any view of stars as is common in Alaska.  We then viewed an odd cloud formation traveling alone and lit up, not like the other clouds at all.  I made mention of it and we started watching it.  It seemed to be moving right toward us and we honestly thought it was going to come right over our heads, very very low to the ground.  Where was the light coming from?  Then it stopped moving toward us and started moving away (west) and seemed to dissipate.   Soon after it was there again, but not as close.  Still oddly lit up unlike the other clouds and it seemed to move and stop at will instead of moving with the breeze.

We are located about 10 miles west of Panama City Beach, Florida.  Then sun was about to go over the horizon when I saw a small light about two to three times larger than a star appears to be.  The light was located southwest of us over the water approx. 5 to 8 miles away.  The angle above the horizon was about 35 degrees.  The color of the light was an orange-yellow, similar to that of the color of the sun.After a few seconds the light disappeared then reappeared slightly to the left.  That light then disappeared and seconds later two lights appeared a little to the left of where they had just been, then about four or five appeared, again to the left.  This sequence of disappearing and appearing went on for about 2 or 3 minutes.  These lights were not moving when they were visible, only disappearing and reappearing.  The lights disappeared for a final time traveling a total of a few miles.  The lights were in a line, appearing to be lined up in the direction that they were moving. Every time the lights disappeared they sort of faded out for a second or two.  Their path was a straight line.  There was no noise or anything else associated with this event.I previously considered myself somewhat of a skeptic when it came to UFOs.  So at first I was trying to think of what else it could be.  There are a few Air Force and Navy bases near by, but this was definitely something I had never before seen.  There was no other solid object or anything visible that they could be connected to.  After seeing this I looked up pictures on the internet of UFOs, and found these lights&rsquo; appearance to be similar to the event that took place a few years back in Arizona, known as the &quot;Phoenix Lights.&quot;((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be both serious-minded, and a bit &quot;shaken&quot; by his sighting.

Very large obtuse scalene triangle shape. The triangle&rsquo;s appearance is like a black line drawn across the clouds.  I can see through the center. It is at a 40 degree angle to the 1st UFO (around the same altitude).  Very difficult to see because grey clouds are moving through the center and obscuring parts of the lines.  It has no lights.  It would be invisible at night but light from the 1st UFO made it possible to see it.Details:   A large cloud lights up from top to bottom like a lighting flash but stays lit.

Sometimes it would move from side to side and then make a full stop for a few seconds before continuing.  I watched it for about ten minutes (trying to comprehend what I was seeing) then ran in to call my brother outside.He looked up and could see it right away.  He confirmed that it didn&apos;t look or act like any plane or helicopter he&apos;d ever seen, either.  It was very difficult to determine the shape of the object, but to us it seemed either circular or spherical.From what we could see it didn&apos;t have lights in the usual sense, but seemed that the object itself was lit.  However, it could be that we were unable to see the whole object. At one point the light was vibrating or dimming and brightening very quickly; my brother said he thought it was changing colors, but I was unable to detect a color change.  But we both agreed that it was clearly pulsating.It moved around in a random pattern, almost aimlessly, but always remained within clear view.After about 40 minutes my brother went back inside and I watched it for a bit longer.  I noticed that it moved back and forth several times, as though someone repeatedly driving a car forward and reversing.  It began pulsating heavily (the light seemed to be making patterns, but I can&apos;t be sure my eyes weren&apos;t playing tricks on me).After that it moved into a cloudy area and it became far too overcast to be able to spot it anymore.Just a note:   Afterward I thought it might just have been a man-made satellite, some of which are visible to the naked-eye in certain conditions.

At exactly 09:20pm, I looked out my driver&rsquo;s side window towards the eastern sky and observed a rectangular-shaped glowing object moving towards us, at an altitude I would approximate as about 2 or thousand feet, that immediately caught my attention as something unusual. I said &ldquo;what the heck is that, and stopped the car and got out. We observed this object coming towards us, then it began to veer to our left, towards the north and apparently back towards Bunganut Pond. It was then that we saw another identical object following the first at the same speed and altitude, and then a 3rd. I did not hear any noise at all, but I had left my car running, so I told my friend to shut it off to see if we could hear anything, but the night was completely silent.At this point, my mind was trying to come up with some logical explanation for what they were, even as we were watching them silently glide past us. We observed them for at least 3 or 4 minutes. As they seemed to be about over the Pond we had just left, they started to ascend at a fairly constant speed and just kept going until they disappeared into a point. My 1st thought was that they were planes with some kind of odd lighting on them, but they were rectangular and seemingly composed only of light. Then I thought maybe they were those &ldquo;paragliders&rdquo;, the ones with a fan strapped to their backs, but again, I knew they would make a whirring sound as well, so we listened very intently for any noise, but there was not a sound.I have to report that it was a clear night, a &frac34; moon, so the sky was pretty bright and some stars were visible.After regaining some of my composure, I realized that I had my camera phone on my belt, and I was able to excitedly take 2 pictures, the 1st normal and the 2nd zoomed as close as possible. It was hard to keep the objects in my viewfinder under zoom and apparently I did not get the 2nd picture in the frame, but the 1st definitely shows as a point of light.We stood there in awe discussing what we had seen for a few moments, and then we got back in the car and proceeded to pull onto Back Rd heading east. My friend called her father, who we assumed was either back at the camp on the Pond, or already in the car coming up behind us, to see if they had also seen it. He said they hadn&rsquo;t seen anything and they were driving up behind us on Roux Rd Ext, when suddenly I saw yet another single object to my left following the exact same route as the others. I stopped the car and jumped out, and my friend began yelling to her father to look and he said he was also seeing it from Roux Rd! He was asking &ldquo;what the hell is that thing&rdquo; to her on the phone as I just watched it fly silently by right in front of me from right to left. It then made a wide turn to the right just as the others had and began to ascend. We watched it continue to ascend until it too disappeared into a point of light.The best I can describe the objects is that they were rectangular, and the bottom seemed to be on fire. They did not appear to have any form at all, but rather it looked like a &ldquo;line of fire&rdquo; with a glowing rectangle of light above the fire part. They were definitely not anything that appeared to be man-made, they moved at a constant rate, and they did not just fly away from us but rather ascended until they disappeared.", "I saw five strange glowing objects flying in a patternIt was Fourth of July.

Neither one of us even realized the other had been watching the object.  We all walked to the south end of the back yard to get a closer look.  It was a very bright red/orange object that appeared to glow. It did not blink like lights from a plane it just glowed.  Pictures were taken by one of the people present. It had started it&apos;s course by coming from the south to the north but then slowly changed course and made a turn going southwest.  We kept watching it until it was out of sight.

It was dark, and a clear, starry night.  I glanced out the window, looking over the farmlands and Tri-Mountain Golfing Course to the east and began to watch a slow-moving light, not unlike an airplane, moving in the far distance.

But it was a very clear night with no clouds and you could se stars. But it was definitely not a star. What we say was a round, spinning object zipping throughout the sky.  It had neon coloring and the lights would switch colors. It started with neon blue, then it turned into neon green, then a bright white light and then it went dark. We were kind of confused and it lighted back up and was a deep red color. When it was the red color, it was flashing. It went out again and then it started doing the color cycle again. there was a ring around the object and thats where the lights were going around. in the middle, it was pitch black.It was then out of our point of view because of houses and some trees. We came home, and my sister looked out her window just to see if it would pop up again, and soon after it did come up and then it disappeared.

I wanted to at least go on record as having witnessed the following on July 21st at approximately 7:45 am (the incident only lasted about 25 seconds and I did not have a camera):  I was travelling eastbound in my car on Wrights rd in Newtown Bucks County toward the Peter Taylor farmstead where I was going to pick up produce for our farm stand.  I had noticed three parallel chemtrails high in the sky running from east to west.  Suddenly a bright light caught my eye next to the chemtrail closest to me.  At first I thought it might be an airplane with the sun reflecting off of it, but the brightness of the object and its flight path convinced me otherwise.  The object travelled alongside the one chemtrail, then shifted into it and back out.  At this time, a second object appeared (same size same brightness)  They spiraled once around the chemtrail and then quickly changed direction and seemed to disappear from sight.  It is difficult to estimate the size of the objects since they were high in the sky.  The chemtrails were fairly new since the one they were flying around was being formed at that time.(the jet was at least a half mile away from the objects.  I woul! d estimate that the diameter of the objects were approximately 1/6 to 1/8 the width of the chemtrail.I went on line the next morning to research any similar types of sightings (chemtrails with ufos).  I found several cases and therefore I wanted to add my experience to the database.If you have any questions please contact me.I am a high school teacher and I know what I saw.Sincerely, ((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  We are aware that many people accept the &quot;chemtrail&quot; phenomenon as being real, but we at NUFORC are unconvinced of their existence.

When the lighting hit, it lit the clouds up with a nice purple color.  Very beautiful.I looked up to the West in crystal clear sky.  Overhead, my wife and I saw a very bright light.  It looked exactly like a star, only much larger and brighter.  It was flying in a straight path, and was silent.  No engine noise was heard at all.  The brightness was very intense.  The light did not blink or flicker, but stayed constantly light.  The object also seemed to be flying at a very slow rate of speed, and did not change altitude.  It flew directly overhead, but no object could be made out, just light.My wife and I turned around back towards our home so we could keep watching the object.  We followed it as we walked past three houses.  At the third house, our view was blocked by a few trees.  Based on the speed it was flying, we should have been easily able to see the object once we were past the trees.  However, the object was simply gone without a trace.  Whether the light simply turned off, or it shot off in the distance, we will never know.  The experience was incredible.That night, there were other aircraft in the sky besides the object.  We saw a propeller airplane far off to the East, and could hear its engine noise in the distance.  This object had no noise at all.My wife and I have been living in Portage county for over twenty years, and have never seen anything like this.

In a large clear patch of blue sky approx 30 degrees to the South of due East I noticed a shiny white metallic object that I assumed was an airplane.  The object was clear against the blue sky, as an airplane would appear on a clear day.  The object appeared silver-white and shiny as it was clearly was lit up by the sun.  I estimate the size of the object as equal to a passenger jet, maybe 150&rsquo;, and estimate location above Lake Erie, 1-2 miles North of Sandusky, OH at approx elevation 25,000-30,000 feet.  Estimated distance of object from observer: 5 miles.I would have assumed the object was a plane had I not noticed that the object was not moving as an airplane would.

There were no airplanes in the area that morning while I was observing the object to compare the object to.The object had clear sharp edges, and appeared to be metallic.  It had no wings or tail fins like an airplane.  The object emitted no noise.  It was not unlike the fuselage of an airplane but slightly thinner at the left (North) end than the right (South) end.As I was staring at the object, that was still clearly visible against the blue sky, it disintegrated (became invisible) before my eyes.  It disintegrated from top to center and from bottom to center.  It took only about &frac12; second to go from a completely solid object to completely gone.

The reason I looked up is because I could hear the engines as it was pretty loud and low flying (planes do not typically fly this close to the ground as the airport / Kirtland AFB is about 15 miles to the south.After looking at the plane, noticed a weird object in front of the plane.  The plane appeared to be following or chasing the strange object.  What the object appeared as was a figure 8 pattern with flashing blue/green lights moving on the outside of the figure 8.  The figure 8 object actually looked like an 8 on its side.  I could not tell if the space between the outline of the figure 8 was solid as it was getting dark.

I also work on Kirtland AFB and am familiar with flight characteristics and aircraft types.  The only thing that I would even guess this could be is an Osprey aircraft (which they have at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque) due to the large propellers.

Facing northwest, looking toward Rancho Bernardo. We came home at approximately 2045. I noticed that my wife and daughter were standing outside at the top of the stairs (2nd story apartment) looking in the aforementioned direction. I came back outside prior to the appearance of the objects. The objects were viewed in the same approximate vicinity.My wife was initially looking at a large white bird (I believe that it was an owl, we do see those around here on rare occasions.) I was able to go outside in time to see the bird fly away from a tree just above the mountain horizon. Within 15 seconds of the birds departure, my wife and I witnessed what she described as a fireball moving at a very high speed across the horizon from east to west at perhaps a 20 degree angle, disappearing from view as it went behind the mountains. I witnessed a second object, described later in this report.Here&apos;s my description of what I saw: The first initially looked like a meteor. I&apos;ve seen plenty of them. After a brief retrospective moment, it seemed odd because this had a distinctive shape and appeared to be much closer than a meteor. We both agreed that the first object did have a &quot;fireball&quot; quality to it, although it was not like anything we have ever seen before. She did not see the second object.I describe the second object as a rounded disk with a dull, white glow. It did look different than the other object, although the intensity of the light emitted from both objects was similar. The big difference is that I could see a clear disk-shaped outline to the second object. After a brief and partially witnessed vertical climb (partially obstructed by a tree), it went in to a downward dive at a tremendous speed. I&apos;m not qualified by any means to estimate the size or distance of the object, but if I was forced to render an opinion, I&apos;d say that this would be an object 100 feet in diameter at a distance of 10 miles from our viewpoint. That would certainly mean a low-flying object.I&apos;m a skeptic, I always love a good debunk. I was thinking about meteors and bird flocks, reflections on the birds and such.The kicker: At 9:00PM, we heard the rumble of jet engines and witnessed two aircraft fly over the area where the objects were witnessed. They were cruising from west to east. This is an uncommon flight path. With the exception of distant commercial flights, we do not ever see military aircraft in that direction. These were jet fighters, I am confident that these were jet fighters, as I have lived near a military airbase for my entire life. I was very surprised to see this. We do have MCAS Miramar about ten miles in the opposite direction, they use a very specific flight path for training and have never to my knowledge done training that requires loud engine noise over civilian territory at night. They do have fighter jets ready to go at any moment, this is a well known fact, although I can&apos;t source it for you folks. Sorry!  The fighter jets were probably about 15-20 miles away from us and were flying at a low altitude, 8,000-10,000 feet. Please bear in mind that I am not an expert, this is just an estimate based upon my very limited base of knowledge.This was the first time that either of us had witnessed an event like this. We always hoped that it would happen some day, and this was quite unexpected. Possible debunks: The white bird/owl. We both agree that the first object was not possibly the aforementioned bird, as this was in a slightly different vicinity and looked nothing like a bird. Regarding the second object, I&apos;ve never seen any flying creature move like that.We saw what we saw and did our best to transcribe it. We&apos;re hoping that somebody else witnessed this and can perhaps explain what we actually did see.", "2 stars moving parallelI walk to work every morning at around 3:45AM.

On Aug. 24 the ISS was scheduled to appear in the NW at 4:21AM.As I was leaving my house walking north I noticed a group of 3 stars similar to Orion&rsquo;s belt but this was near the north star in the sky approximately 45 degrees N in the sky. The Orion constellation at this time should be in the lower ESE sky.Because I was walking all the stars appear to be moving but of coarse it is due to my movement. So I stopped walking and noticed 2 of the 3 stars moving east in a parallel formation. As they moved easterly they stayed the same distance from each other (about the same distance from each other as the Orion&rsquo;s belt) and became dimmer until I could no longer see them approximately 20 degrees NE. Their brightness resembled a medium size star when first noticed. Not as bright as the ISS.When the ISS appeared later in the morning it was lower in the sky (about 20 degrees) and brighter than the stars I had seen earlier but at about the same speed in the same direction.They did not appear to be planes. There wasn&rsquo;t any flashing lights. Just a steady glow as a medium star.

It was traveling at roughly 30mph.  It was completely silent, zero noise from any method of propulsion.

A few minutes in, I saw a chevron formation of lights streak across the sky directly overhead.  The lights were orange in color and were not round but rather looked like stunted bowling pins.  There were about 4 or five on each side for a total of 9 to 11.  They appeared to be low enough above the tree tops that at first I thought, &quot;cool bats flying in formation!&quot; after which I quickly thought, &quot;no, bats don&apos;t fly in formation, maybe they&apos;re ducks.&quot;   Then of course almost instantly I realized that neither bats nor ducks glow orange and that it must have in fact been a vessel of some sort which blocked out the stars behind it.  Then, while it was still in a visible spot, unimpeded by treetops, the lights went out and that was it.  I did not notice if the stars continued to be blotted out in the same trajectory, as it all happened so fast.  What was mos! t noticeable was the speed at which it moved across the sky-- 2-3 seconds heading from north to south and the fact that there was absolutely no sound associated with the movement.

I saw the movement was slow and steady. I went quickly into the house and shouted to my brother to come immediately.  He came out and also watched the object.The Pleiades were to the south of this object and higher in the sky than the object.  The object moved on a track toward the northeast horizon.  If I were to draw a line to track its trajectory backward, if it had traveled a straight line; then it started west and to the mid heaven side of the Pleiades.There was a notable gut sense the object was very large and quite a distance away, higher in the sky than perhaps one might think.  But, there was no visual reference to verify this sense.We are in Southeast Iowa in a small town of 8000.  If there were no city lights we would have had a better view.We watched to see if any star lights were obscured by its passing over them, but the lights of the object became dimmer as it traveled closer to the horizon was such that we never saw any stars crossed and we lost view of the object before it got low enough in the sky to have its view blocked by the trees.I thought of calling the police to report this, it being so unusual; then decided not to bother as the object had passed.  I reported this sighting to my ex-wife and a friend by email so that I would have a time stamp to record the time; then thought to look on the net to see if other had seen an object like this.So far I have not seen a picture which matches what we saw, but only looked on the net for a couple minutes.We are occasional sky watchers by habit when we go outside on occasion, and have many a time observed satellites on occasion.

They were vertically parallel, and the bottom one was slightly bigger (ie. closer). Because I&apos;m deathly curious and and a UFO/alien fanatic, I immediately turned in that direction. Gradually the bottom orb increased in size as I twisted through the neighborhood I&apos;d entered, and before I knew it I was almost directly beneath it. No longer appearing as an orb, the UFO was extremely close enough to the ground; I&apos;m not great with measuring distances, but to give you an idea, to my vision it was about the size of making circle with your index finger and thumb. It was rather egg-shaped, if the egg were on its side, and it appeared to be black, although it was hard to distinguish color in the dark of night. I remember the arrangement of the ship&apos;s lights looking rather like three, bright bug-eyes. As I raced through the suburban streets to keep pursuit, the UFO slowly flew overhead at a constant pace. Eventually it decided it was done there (or as I like to believe, wanted to lose me) and picked up speed so it was impossible to continue the chase. I watched it fly away from me, and suddenly it was above the hills on the far side of town. Hopeful to see more, I drove in that direction, and during this drive I saw two more very shiny orbs hovering on either end of town.

When the orb didn&apos;t get any bigger after a short hike, I gave up, but from that hill I had a fantastic view of one of the UFOs directly above the center of the valley. From this view I also noticed a human aircraft flying over the valley but at a lower altitude than the UFOs.

Most amazing thing i have ever seen in my life.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the ISS.  PD))", "pulsating light moving south to northWe were camped out on a sandbar south of Bismarck/Mandan.

It moved slowly over the Mountains for about 6 to 8 min and vanished in front of me.  I know every one on the 57 freeway going that way must have seen it.  It was to big to have been a balloon and it was definitely not a plane or helicopter.  On a personal note, in 2004 I was working near La Vern Ca. and was looking up towards a person repairing a roof, and saw 2 silver disk way above La Vern moving very slowly, I pointed them out to the roofer, and we watched them for about 30 min and then they disappeared all very strange..", "Two orbs seen over Sadieville, Ky.I was lying in the back yard enjoying the stars after the sky had cleared following a day of stormy weather.  Suddenly a bluish white orb appeared out of the darkness.  The orb was approximately 5 times larger than any of the stars in the sky, and about the same color.  It moved very quickly and smoothly. I could not hear any jets or engines.  The craft was completely silent. As it cruised across the middle of the sky, I notice that above and to the object&apos;s left was another orb.  This one was a faint reddish color, and it followed the same path, running parallel to the whitish orb.  After about 30seconds both orbs vanished into thin air.  I was quite excited to see these objects, if not slightly disappointed that I had no one there corroborate the events.", "A bright object that I identified to my boss incorrectly as the I.S.S.  She stated it was moving to fast to be the I.S.S. and that it could only be viewed at specific times.  This was not one of those.  It moved quickly through the sky, higher than commercial air traffic.  The object than paused and shot directly up/away.  You could tell it was moving &quot;up&quot; or away because the light dimming as distance passed.  We we&apos;re both in shock and now are very much believers.  We both told each other, &quot;dear god, I was glad someone else saw that&quot;.", "Circle shaped object with hollow center slowly glides over Plains PA with 3 other possible objectsMy mother, two adult brothers, and two young sons were in my mother&apos;s backyard in the Hudson section of Plains when my brother said, &quot;There&apos;s the UFO!&quot;  He had previously seen this UFO two years earlier (see report from Plains 6/17/07).  I had not seen it the first time my brother and mother and two other people saw it.It was a large round object that was hollow in the middle - think of a metal washer (for a nut &amp; bolt) and you have a good idea what the object looked like.  It appeared to me to be silver in color but my brothers thought it was black and the sun reflecting off it made it look silver.  It made no noise that I could hear and traveled slowly, well below the few low clouds in the sky.We ran down the street to try to keep the object in sight and were able to go about 2 blocks before it went over a mountain and we lost sight of it.  While we were following it down the street I noticed another darker object directly above the silver &quot;washer&quot; object.  It was much higher up and difficult to see any details but it stayed right above the silver washer.  After I lost the silver washer over the mountain the other darker object was still visible and then we saw a second darker object that was lower than the first dark object but higher than the washer.  After all three of those objects disappeared we saw a fourth object, shaped like a puffy boomarang is the best way to describe it.  It was lower than the other objects and followed the same course until it disappeared.My brother got a few pictures with a disposable camera that we will get developed tomorrow.The weather was partly cloudy, temperatures in the mid-70s, and it was about 6:45 p.m. so it was still daylight.", "Bright orange ball with white lights.On my way home me and a friend walked along a street, when i noticed a bright orange object in the sky. I t was a clear night with no clouds, the stars were out and you could see planes flying with their lights on. I noticed this orange ball in the sky, it was 95% orange (bright) and 5% white (litlle glimpses of white light) at first we just thought it was a plane or helicopter, but seen as we had already seen a plane and a helicopter nearby, this object was totally different.It moved very quick and lasted in our location for about 15 second before moving off at a quick speed. The object did not stay still or hover at any time, but it moved constantly. What attracted our attention to it was it immense bright orange light with looked amazing in the black night sky. Secondly, it moved very very fast. It did not dissapear in a zap or a second, but it moved accross our path at a tremendouse speed, atleast 10 to 20 times faster then any aeroplane was moving in the sky. it was moving so fast that it came accross our location, moved straight over head, and kept going untill we both lost its visibilty - all in the space of 15-16 seconds.After the object moved in the distance, we both said what on earth was that, did u see how fast it moved?!  There could be a logical explanation for this, but having spoken to a few people with aircraft experience about this, none seem to know what type of plane/helicopter craft could move this fast, and that emits a bright orange light and is a ball//circle shape.", "Two objects were observed in the Eastern sky as well as the Southern skies.On August 13, 14 and 16th, my girlfriend, I and her three children observed two objects in the sky adjacent to the campground we use during the Summer months. The first was massive and closer to us than the second. It was extremely bright in the sky and moved forward and back, slowly. On the 13th, it was very close to us but not close enough to view a shape with the naked eye. It did not display colors with the exception of a bright white light. It was viewed in the Eastern sky. The first night, it was very close but the remaining nights, it was much further away. The second was in the Southern skies and displayed flashing red lights.  It moved in a strange pattern, forward and back and then up and down. When it was moving forward and back, it was moving in a clear elliptical pattern.  Mindful that most UFO sightings are generally planets and stars, we used two stars as points of reference. At times, it would be above the plain between the two stars and within ten minutes or so, would transverse to the left, nearly covering the star on the left.  Then it would travel to the right, obstructing our view of the star on the right. Within thirty minutes or so it would drop below the plain between the two stars we were using as a point of reference. It followed this pattern repeatedly over the next hour. We watched this event on three separate nights for a minimum of one hour each.  On the 15th, the object was not visible.  Radar indicated that there was no cloud cover and all stars were visible.  It was a very clear night.  I spoke to a family friend who works for an Aeronautical company and he confirmed the information that I gained from my Father.  Satellites do not move in a pattern like what we observed. It is physically impossible for a star or planet to display the movements we witnessed. No alcohol or intoxicants were involved during the events and cloud cover was nonexistent.I intend on taking a telescope to the campground before the end of the month to see if I can view the objects again. I will file a second report with the new information, along with pictures (it&rsquo;s a sweet telescope).", "A very large brightly lit object floats over buildings without a sound and disappears.On 7/14/09 at 9:20 p.m. I was sitting in my easy chair watching tv when something caught my eye from the patio door to my immediate left.  The door has a full length glass pane in it with a sheer curtain over it.  I could clearly see a brightly lighted object in the sky as it was dark enough outside by then.  I could not tell the shape, but it appeared to me to be a straight wing with no fuselage, though it feasibly could have been a frisbee shape on its side with no curve, and about 8 or so bright flashing colored lights straight across it.  They were red, blue and I think white and orange and/or green.  I thought it was a jet plane about to crash.I was very startled because I don&apos;t live in a flight path so my mind was really befuddled by this time trying to make sense of what I was seeing.  The position of the object was very close and low and slowly passing just beyond a 2-story apartment building about 100 yards beyond my building in the same complex of about 10 buildings.  I did not see from which direction it came, but it could have possibly passed right over me before I saw it.I&apos;m not sure of the altitude, maybe that of a roughly 30-story building.  To me, it appeared as though it was slowly going into a landing pattern where the wheels come down and touchdown is imminent.  If I extended my arm it would be about the length and width of my pinkie finger framed between two buildings.I jumped up and got on my slides so I could step outside to get a better look.  By the time I got out on the patio the object seemed to hesitate for a fraction of a second; I thought it was trying to pull the nose up because at this point my mind still thought it was a plane, however, there was no engine noise and I assumed the engine had been cut off.  It then veered slightly to the right and disappeared behind a building.I waited for an explosion or flames and smoke shooting in the air, but nothing like that happened.  In fact, it was just gone and I heard nothing about it on the news afterwards.", "It was moving faster than any other aircraft I had ever seenI heard a loud close sound and looked up into the sky.  I saw a round base with 4 flashing lights on it (red and yellow).  The craft was at low altitude and it was moving faster than any aircraft I&apos;d ever seen.  I saw the same thing about a 1/2 hour later but it was higher.", "Me and my children where coming home as we drove up in the drive way we seen a lights going real slow in the sky and it was going so slow that we thought it was a plane or helicopter and then I noticed there where no lights in the front the lights where coming from the bottom it seemed.

It slowly turned to the east and it disappeared into the darkness the lights where red, green and a little yellow.", "4th of July - 3 Orange/Red Lights Above Lake UnionAt about 10:30 pm I was on Lake Union after having watched a fireworks display.  I looked up in the sky and saw 3 bright reddish orange lights.  They moved from NW to SE for about 15 seconds before disappearing.  I figured I was seeing flares but I remember thinking it was odd that they were in such perfect line, were glowing steadily and disappeared at perfect intervals, one after the other.I was with friends but didn&apos;t think to tell them as everyone would say they were fireworks (which would be a very logical conclusion, given the time and place).It wasn&apos;t until I read reports here on the NUFORC website that I even thought twice about the event.  If people from various parts of Washington all saw these lights at roughly the same time, the lights must have been higher than flares or fireworks.I still put my money on the fireworks explanation but I just wanted to add one more data point to this event.", "strange man appears in heh woodsI went deer hunting upstate where my uncles had a cabin.

The star didn&apos;t appear to be falling though. I then could see Venus clearly and investigated further with binocculars and saw another light by venus. The light appeared be have flashing blue, red, and whit lights and failed to move quickly. It slowly moved. I called two co-workers and asked them to observe the sighting and to give me an opinion of what they believed it was. They saw it and confirmed my sighting. We looked to see if perhaps it was the shuttle endeavor, but that didn&apos;t launch as of yet!  Clueless as to what the green shooting star was, and the lighted object!

A really bright orange light flickering like a flame.  Still assuming it was just a balloon I moved as it went behind some trees to catch sight of it coming around the other side but realized the clouds weren&apos;t noticeably moving and there was no noticeable wind at ground level.The object continued to move north north east and the light never changed in intensity.  We are close to Willow Run airport, and the light seemed to be heading NNE toward the direction of the aiport - but flight paths in that area of the sky are generally heading &apos;away&apos; from the airport unless they are on landing approach (descending rather than ascending).I tried to see if I could spot any strobes or navigation (red/green) lighting but the orange flicker was too intense.  I also strained to hear any sort of engine noises but heard none and it was generally quiet due to the time of the evening.I watched the light continue to ascend in a rather consistent north-north east direction, getting slightly smaller but still quite intense and still flickering orange like a flame until it eventually disapeered into the clouds to the northeast.It was more than likely just a plane with a whacked out light, but they generally don&apos;t take a flight path that would be that close to the airport and I could not hear any sounds of engine noises which is generally strange for anything that bright. (generally meaning it is closer proximity)  Also it would have been at least somewhat in profile when I first saw it and was obviously headed away when I finally lost sight of it - generally when you catch site of a plane coming or going from the airport, you may for example see a landing light that appears quite intense, but that is only when the plane is coming directly at you. I contacted the local police department non-emergency line and my call was the first they had heard of it.  I also attempted to contact Willow Run airport but due to the time of night I only got voice mail.  Worried that it might have been a plane on fire, I also called the airport emergency dispatch from the number listed on Willow Run&apos;s voice mail message, but similarly my call was the first they had heard of it and they had no reports of aircraft emergencies.", "Spherical orb over the mountains in North Ogden UtahWalking to work on Sunday Memorial Day Weekend.

However, it was stationary only slightly moving either towards or away from me.  It started traveling upwards and then did so at a constant velocity.

The lights stayed in perfect unison and did not appear to be very high up (maybe 1000 feet or less on a guess). The odd thing was that although it seemed to be a perfectly clear night the 3 lights appeared to have a large haze around them and it also seemed that there was a slight glow in the middle of the triangle. I can&apos;t really judge the speed but it was comparable to a slow and low flying jet except for the fact that there was no noise what so ever (but this also depends on the true size of the suspected object). I was an Electronics Technician in the US Navy from 00-05. Stationed on an aircraft carrier from 01-05 and have never seen anything like this. My brother was there also and saw the same thing.

The white lights would always take the same pattern; a triangle shape~five white lights total.  The lights would change colors from light blue, then light orange then back to a white light but they would always stay in their pattern.

This area where the lights hoover, no one travels into, not even the border patrol~it&apos;s just too isolated; not even cell phones work out here.

At first, I refused to believe they were focusing back at me or signaling me with thier lights.  I continued to focused with the binoculars but the next time I flashed the flash light,I came up with a particular pattern; three long flash, followed by two short flashed, then one long flash and then one short flash.   However, this time all five lights (crafts) flashed their lights at the exact time and in the same pattern!  Now, my self preservation heighten I no longer wanted to play with the lights (crafts)so I put the flast light back in the back seat, but I continue to look with the binoculars at the lights ~ but! longer I looked the stronger the feeling I got (they were loo! king bac k),till it became overwhelming and I put the binoculars down!  I must have looked at the white lights (crafts)maybe 2-3 minutes; during this time frame ~ the five lights (crafts) flickered their lights back to me twice in the same pattern I made up.  When I looked up without the aid of my binoculars the lights were gone, I didn&apos;t see them fly off like I normally seen them and this freaked me out.  Even though I couldn&apos; see the light(crafts), I sense they were still around. I didn&apos;t want to stick around to find out.

About a mile or so from my house, my son&apos;s flash light starting blinking(flashing)!!  I really would have chalked it up as being nothing, but the flashing light pattern was the one I made up for those crafts in the sky.

That night around the fire, I was star gazing when I saw a shape flying form one side of the sky to the other.  It had bright blue and red lights, that blinked slowly and irregularly.  It started flying in a straight line, but suddenly seemed to gracefully and quickly drop down, then fluidly backed up.  It then continued straight in it&apos;s new path.  I quickly shouted for my husband to look up.  He watched with me as the shape repeated the same maneuver, before continuing in a line out of  sight.We are professionals in our forties that do not drink or otherwise imbibe.  We were focused on sky watching at the moment and our attention was not diverted.  We are not prone to uneducated conclusions.

I noticed a bright silver looking object about 3 or 4 km above where i was hovering in the sky moving slowly from side to side, shining and then not shining as it moved side to side.Then whilst the first object moved along the same way as described above, two more objects arrived, but at immense speed, stopped near the hovering object, and shot off again in the opposite direction it came from.If a normal boeing is flying at 800km/h, I would guess that these objects must have been moving at a fifty times that speed.  I called for my brother which was inside the house to come and check this out with me just to make sure that I was seeing correctly.  He confirmed, he also saw the same objects.The whole sighting lasted about 5 to 10 minutes, there were 4 objects in total.  The four objects was hovering together for about 10 seconds and of they went together at one hell of a speed.I saw this same sighting on tv about a year or two ago, and that&apos;s when I remembered what I saw.I did report it back then on a ufo report centre, but my brother never got to confirm this per e-mail.

It had 3 dots on it in each corner where it looked like lights should of been but they were off. It had no lights on it which made it more strange. Right away we started freaking out cause it was unbelievable and we both were saying &quot;We werent just seeing things&quot;. It was scary and unlike anything we both have ever seen. It was like it appeared out of no where n flew slow above us for a second and it started to go faster and then we don&apos;t know where it went. It must of been silver but it looked like a brownish color and was lighter than the night sky. It was so crazy that tears just started rolling down my face. Me and my friend both were freaking out and got scared. We both are not the type of people to lie . Right after it happened I calle! d my boyfriend and he came with 7 people and we went back to the parking ramp because we were scared to go alone and we were even scared to look at the sky after that.  After we got there and told them about it we felt like they didnt believe us except for my boyfriend because he is into UFO stuff. A little later we saw this sphere that looking things that looked like it was turning in the sky. There was no lights on it or anything and most of us saw it. It was moving fast and then disapeared it was also the same color as the triangle ufo. We didn&apos;t know what that was because again we never saw anything like that. A few minutes later we saw this worm looking things. Everybody saw that one. It would move like a caterpillar and shrivel up then stretch out. Each time it would shrivel up different though. It was long maybe 30 feet, thats just an estimate. I thought it was something falling out of the sky or a shriveled up blimp but as we kept looking we realized it wasn&apos;t anyth! ing like that. It was moving kind of slow and it disappeared a! fter abo ut 4-5 seconds. I couldn&apos;t believe it because that was the third strange thing we saw that night. After that everyone believed me and my friend that we saw  that triangle object. The triangle object was the most weirdest  thing out of all of those. SO was the worm like thing because none of us have ever seen anything like that and the next day I tried to look it up and couldn&apos;t figure out what it was. None of these objects had lights on it. The triangle ufo looked like the lights were just off. That experience opened my mind up .

We both had our eyes caught by an object in the sky.  It was between the shape of a twisted envelope and a cigar and caught our attention because it was sparkling like diamonds, or a silver holograph,  then it just disappeared, and we both looked at each other and said &ldquo;What the h*** was that?&rdquo;  It was too high in the sky to go below the horizon, and the sun was too high in the sky and at the wrong angle for it to be the sun reflecting off of it.  The object was moving east toward the coast.  Maybe lasted 5-10 seconds.

I went into my 14 year old daughters room and asked if she was making that noise. She said no she was hearing it to. The weather report said possible thunderstorms that night but unlikely, so I said well it must be thunder.I was about to go out for a smoke anyways so I asked if she wanted to see if there was any lightening over the foothills. As we approached the door she said mom I see stars and clear sky not clouds. So I thought maybe its a motorcycle or something, but unlikely way out in the country like we are. We barely stepped out when we saw them. There first was 3 flashing white lights that were dancing in the sky moving all over the place. Then suddenly there were 6 of them as if they multiplied in front of our eyes. They were dancing like fire flies in the sky.Then they just stopped dancing and formed a pyramid formation. These things seemed to move so fast  and compared to our tree line they appeared to be pretty high. Then a 7th flashing light shot across the formation like a shooting star arcing in the sky. It came to the end of the formation and it abruptly turned to fall in line at the end. They headed east toward the Sierra Mountains zig zagging every now and again. In a matter of less than 2 minutes they were gone.We still don&apos;t know what caused the sounds we heard but were amazed at what we saw.

We had just finished a game, and I looked into the sky and observed the first 3 UFOs.  All three were traveling in a northeastern direction, in a group.  The largest craft was a black circle, which I have seen before from the location (see my report here dated 6/17/2007).  The other 2 crafts were following the same trajectory and in a group with the circle.  They were smaller, but not circle-shaped.  Because of the distance, I could not make out a shape.  All were traveling fast, and the circle tipped to its side while filing, exposing the empty space in the middle.While we were tracking the group of 3, a 4th UFO flew in the same direction.  It followed approximately 10 minutes behind the original group.  I was able to use binoculars to view this one.  It was shaped like a kidney, although its edges were straight lines, not curved as one would usually think of a kidney.  At the part of the ship where the kidney&apos;s &quot;indent&quot; would be, there were lights.Skies were cloudy with rain clouds, although it was not raining.  The ships flew both in front of and through the clouds, and were moving away from us duringf the incident.  I did not get as good a view as my original sighting 2 years ago.We were able to take a few photographs of all of the UFOs, but it was a disposible camera at a distance.

It was a clear moonless night, so I hoped for some good night sky viewing (even though I&rsquo;m no astronomer).  Shortly before midnight I went out to look at the sky, and easily spotted the Big Dipper in the NW sky, and Polaris.  I happened to be looking towards an open space between some trees to the NE, at about 45 degrees above the horizon, and could see a number of stars though I couldn&rsquo;t name the constellation.Movement caught my eye, and I noticed a light that looked like a star (no apparent size, shape or color) which seemed to be moving with respect to the fixed stars in a 10 o&rsquo;clock direction.  At first I assumed it was a distant airplane, although its angular speed seemed large for the apparent distance, given that I heard no sound.  What first startled me was that after a few seconds it suddenly changed direction by more than 90 degrees with no apparent curve to its trajectory.  A few seconds later it started moving erratically (like Brownian motion) at high rates of angular velocity; then it almost stopped at a point about which it jittered rapidly (like a laser pointer that someone is trying to hold still).  A couple of seconds after that the light suddenly disappeared. Up to that time it had been in clear sky (not close to the tree cover), and the nearby stars remained clearly visible just as before it disappeared.  The whole event lasted no more than 10-15 seconds.Afterwards I felt rather stunned, asking myself if I had really seen what I thought I saw...I couldn&rsquo;t begin to explain it to myself.  The object&rsquo;s rapid angular movement, changes of direction and sudden disappearance made no physical sense.   I waited, watching in the same direction, for perhaps 5 minutes but saw nothing more of an unusual nature.I am 60 years old, with a BS in Physics and have worked in engineering most of my career.  I&rsquo;m not a religious person or a follower of any sort of cult or even interest group.

We saw a bright, glowing green diamond with an elongated top appear out of nowhere.  It was the brightest green we have ever seen, as if you were to melt down a neon sign and shape it into that elongated diamond shape.  But at the same time the shape was so crisp you could clearly see the distinctness of each curve and point.It then changed in almost a liquid manner to a bright glowing circle of yellow light.  This too was an unbelievably bright yellow light that glowed like a neon sign.  It was a perfect crisp circle.  I&rsquo;ve never seen colors so vibrant Then finally it changed into a tiny point of incredibly bright light which flashed and then the whole thing was gone.It was large, I would guess larger than a commercial airplane, and significantly higher.  Throughout the event it was totally silent and took only about 3 seconds, leaving us both scared and questioning what had just happened.

The noise continued.  Approximatley 15 miles from us is an F-15 base (Barnes Air National Guard Base, Westfield, MA).  We saw 6 F-15&apos;s fly over with afterburners on.  This is not a normal occurance, they usually fly over during the day time, and unless at an airshow I have never seen them fly over with afterburners.  Particularly at night.  The other odd part about this incident was the fact that the aircraft were running only their red collision lights, not a typical red white green configuration.  I was wondering if you have recieved any additional reports from the area or of similar nature?  The F-15&apos;s certainly appeared to be going somewhere in a hurry.  The low rumble heard prior to the F-15&apos;s being seen was a different noise entirely from that of the aircraft.  Throughout the evening and as I am writing this report our TV has been having frequent interference and service interruptions.((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome reports from any other witnesses to this event.

We decided that it was a balloon, and that the enemy was endeavoring by that means to ascertain the strength of the reinforcements that were coming to Gen. Johnston.&quot;  The book editor notes that Union General Sherman&apos;s troops did not have balloons with them on the Atlanta Campaign.  It should also be noted that observation balloons were tied to the ground and only moved vertically up and down.  If a balloon were untethered by accident, it would only move as fast as any winds prevailing at the time, or certainly not &quot;rapidly.&quot;  The observer (book author) was a Sergeant in Company B, 46th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, and later Sergeant Major, and finally Acting Adjutant of the Regiment.

After it blinked out for the last time a second object (may have been same one unsure) appeared back in the firsts original location and did the same thing in the exact same path before streaking off like a shooting star.  After about another half an hour the object appeared once more this time moving in the opposite path as it originally did then blinked out, about ten minutes went by and it appeared for the last time this time it was much brighter before blinking out and not coming back.  From where I was sitting all of the objects were moving around and in the square part of the big dipper (it did move out of the formation but that is where I spotted it each time at the beginning).

Not low enough for me to tell what kind of craft it was.It flowed smooth like, looking like it was coming down for landing then it went back up following the curve of the earth with the same speed, nice and smooth...then it just kept going up until the big bright bulb was a little red dot, then gone.It was low enough all so that I could make out if it was a satilite, I&apos;ve never heard of a satilite orbiting low like what this bulb of light did.

The sun had set at about 8:31 p.m. and some ambient light remained near the northwest horizon.  In addition to this light, ground light also added light to the night sky so that the sky was not totally dark.I first noticed a rippling in the sky out of the corner of my eye.  Drawn to what was causing this phenomenon, I looked at that area of the sky and was able to discern the object.It was impossible to judge the size of the object, however the appearance of its width in the sky was approximately slightly larger than the width of a full moon.The craft was completely silent and no exhaust could be perceived.  It had no navigation lights.  A very slight perturbation was visible surrounding the craft--a rippling of the atmosphere.  This phenomenon was similar to that observed when heat waves are rising from asphalt on a hot summer day.Shortly after the craft passed the zenith, it turned towards due north with no perceptible change in speed.   Unlike a conventional aircraft that would have had to bank to affect a turn, this craft simply turned without banking and changed its vector smoothly and rapidly towards the north.Based on my observation -- which lasted no more than 12 to 15 seconds -- I believe this craft is an advanced U.S. Air Force stealth platform designed for secret aerial reconnaissance missions.  It uses an anti-gravity propulsion system, perhaps electro-gravitic.   When it changed its vector it was obvious that the &quot;wings&quot; were not used to keep the craft airborne.  The wings were not needed to provide lift or employed as an aerodynamic airfoil.  This was demonstrated by the fact that it did not bank when executing its turn.  Three dimly lit gray circles under the &quot;wings&quot; were what seemed to provide its &quot;lift&quot; and propulsive force.Because of the luminosity of the night sky the object was easily discernable once I spotted it.  The craft seemed to slide rather than fy through the night sky.What is also revealing is that this craft flew directly through the TCAs (terminal control areas) of two major airports:  Chicago O&apos;Hare Airport and Chicagoland Executive Airport (formerly Palwaukee Airport) the nation&apos;s busiest executive airport without any alert that I heard of later.  I&apos;m familiar with both civilian and known military aircraft having attended flight ground school and obtained a private pilot&apos;s license for fixed wing single-engine aircraft back in 1977.I made a drawing of the craft in photoshop shortly after my observation so the details would be fresh in my memory.

I watched it fall for about 2 full seconds before I lost sight of it behind the tree line. I waited to hear a sound because if it was a man made craft it surely would have crashed.  I heard nothing - saw nothing after losing sight of it behind the trees.

There is very little light pollution in this small town in the woods and the sky was clear.  A couple of nights ago about 11pm I saw a bright white flash, three or four times the intensity of a bright star.  It was 5 or 10 degrees from directly overhead.  I continued to watch the sky and saw another flash several seconds later in a different spot.  I extrapolated to the south to where I thought it would be for the next flash and neither the time nor the trajectory stayed the same.  The last flash was to the southwest of the second flash.  It took longer and did not travel as far across the sky.  I thought maybe I was seeing shooting stars coming right at me.  I had never seen that before, but maybe.Tonight I saw the same white intense flash but only once.  This one was maybe 30 degrees from overhead to the south.  Then a second later, not in the same spot but in the same vicinity, I clearly saw a faint gray sharp rectangular pattern.  It was about 1 inch by 1/4 inch at arms length.  It had about 5 or 6 parallel lines running the long way inside of the rectangle and seemed to appear and disappear just that fast.  The rectangle lasted longer than the flashes but less than a second.  The long sides seemed to be well defined but the short sides were a little fuzzy.  Maybe the parallel lines just ended evenly and the length to width ratio gave the appearance of a rectangle.  I can&rsquo;t say the rectangle appeared to be a craft but it was bizarre.  Neither the flashes nor the rectangle are anything I have seen before.", "Odd pulsing lights west of ChicagoEarly Tuesday morning my friends and I noticed two air planes with pulsing lights about 45 degrees north of the southern horizon, heading west.

When I got up to make sure it wasn&apos;t an asteroid or space junk they started up again.  They moved independently of each other and a third (dimmer or farther) light appeared.  With in a few more seconds one quickly headed south and out of sight and the other two continued in strange little &quot;loops&quot; speeding up before entering behind some clouds.

As I continued driving and watching this object it did seem to be relatively low in the sky (3,000 to 4,000 feet up) and I could begin to make out 2 mid sized red flashing lights (each light was flashing separate of one another fairly quickly).  At this point the object slightly changed direction to begin heading Northwest.  As the object was picking up speed it seemed to be about 1/2 mile in front of me as it crossed over I-12 at the Lacombe/St. Tammany exit which is about 3 to 4 miles from the original exit that I first saw it at.  At this time I could clearly see that inbetween the 2 midsized red lights were at least 4 white strobing lights smaller than those red lights but I still could! n&apos;t see a shape to the object.  Almost underneath where the object was there were 4 vehicles traveling west, I was roughly 3 to 4 blocks in back of these vehicles. I noticed as this object passed over those vehicles, 2 of them did press on their brakes for a few seconds so I do not know if those people were able to make out the object. This area has very tall pine trees on both sides of the Interstate.  As it crossed over I-12 and continued heading on a Northwest trajectory at the same altitude I lost sight of it behind the tall pine trees on my northern side.  This entire sighting lasted just about 2.5 to 3 minutes.Now, this could have been a plane.  I simply could not make out a shape to it at all, nor did I hear any noise from it.  I live 20 miles west of this area and I live in the direct flight paths to both the International and Municipal New Orleans airports and I have never witnessed a plane with lights flashing the way these did.  I know that this wouldn&apos;t have been a commercial large plane flying that low in this area as it wasn&apos;t coming from or going towards the Armstrong International area.

My fiance&apos; and I were sitting at the barn talking and I got up to walk back to our pasture.  I was standing and looking at the stars and noticed a bright red light to the west of where i was standing which I thought was a planet.  I looked around the sky and realized it was too big to be a planet.  I looked back at the red object and saw it was getting closer to me.  It was flying low and was a disk or saucer shape.  It was a bright white light on the outside and red on the inside of the disk.  Inside the red circle of light was another white object that I would call a ship.  It was like a squared off upside down heart shape.  I realized that what I was seeing was a UFO.  It came towards me and traveled very slowly.  It made NO sound.  It passed me and was to the east of me when I could see the front end of the disk begin to ascend.  It then shot straight upward and eastward and was out of sight in ! less than 2 seconds.

I was just stargazing, as there were a few nice meteors. I noticed as I looked southeast a large, red/orange ball flying east at approximately 1500 feet, going fast. The object was in my sight for approximately five seconds, before leaving my view by going behind some trees. As I had been looking in that direction a few seconds before, and saw nothing, then looked west-northwest for a second, then looked back to the south when I observed the object, I have no idea where it came from.I got up and went into my home to get a camera in the hope of seeing it again, but it did not come back this way. I live on a hill overlooking a pasture going down a valley to the south for two miles. I have a great view of this valley, with the east and west being blocked by woods. This area is not a flight corridor, with the exception of three to four C-130&rsquo;s that fly over during the week. This was not a plane.

A plane happened to fly by in the direction of the moving object, that appeared to be a ways off in space, and the plane was much slower than this UFO and I could hear the plane but not the UFO.  It did not move in a pattern but very swiftly back and forth, in circles, and just around in general.  The UFO stayed in the same area of the sky between Jupiter and the North Star around the little dipper in the south west at about a 30 degree angle of elevation.  Would split off in two occasionally and would disappear for a second or two then reappear.  It lasted for over 3 hours.((NUFORC Note:  Star??

A female neighbor accross the street yelled at me, pointing at the northern sky and stated &quot;What is that?&quot; I immediately looked up and saw 20 to 30 bright yellowish disk-shaped objects, each with an illuminated vertical red center, flying accross the sky with no detectable sound. They were moving west to east about 40 degrees off the horizon at what appeared to be a high rate of speed. They were in a straight formation, although about 30 seconds into this encounter 2 or 3 seemed to &quot;break off&quot; from the formation and head south towards me for a few seconds, then quickly joined the others in their easterly trek.While I was watching this, the female neighbor&apos;s husband also came out of his house and joined his wife and I, who were watching this spectacle from the street. After another minute or so, the objects all disappeared into the eastern sky.I am a 56 year old college-educated male, who spent over 20 years in law enforcement in several different positions. I am currently an in-town truck driver, and I do not use illicit drugs or cosume alcohol.I can offer no logical explanation as to what these objects were that my neighbors and I saw. I hope to find out something about this when I watch the evening news at 11:00 p.m. tonight.  Finally, if someone would have told me I would be making a report to a UFO center, I would have laughed at them.

Elevation of the site is about 6500 feet. This is accessible by 4 wheel drive or ATV from Tampico Washington about twenty miles to the east. (Yakima is 30 miles to the east)   We had seen occasional air traffic throught the day, the latest being a C-17 overflying the area from west to east at approximately 1900.I was  preparing dinner around when my friend asked me to identify an &ldquo;airplane&rdquo; he was watching.  He pointed out a dark colored triangular flying wing with a span of about 25 feet and a depth of around 6 feet.  When it was pointed out to me it was coming toward us from the west (traveling west to east)  at more or less our altitude. It approached our position eventually overflying us at an altitude of about 500 feet AGL and made a rather leisurely turn to the north and continued along the ridge line eventually moving out of sight in the general direction of Rimrock lake which we could just barley see about ten miles to our north.  Through the whole encounter its speed remained quite low.  I estimate it was moving about 50mph.   My impression was of more or less highway speed.  If I&apos;m correct this is most likely too slow for aerodynamic lift.We passed the night uneventfully and returned home the next day.I at first assumed this was an unmanned aircraft but it had no marking or visible control surfaces. When it turned it did not visibly bank.  Even from directly underneath it was completely silent and its surface showed no visible details of any kind, no jet exhaust, no intakes, no landing gear doors.  When it was approaching I got a decent look at it through binoculars and saw no obvious intakes anywhere.In my opinion it exceeds the state of the art, and I have no idea what would posses anyone to operate such a craft in that time and place unless they are trying to be seen.  thus my decision to report it here.Description: Dark colored triangle.L: about 15 feet W: about 25 feet H: about 6 feet Speed about 50mph  Thicker at the front than at the back (airfoil shaped) No marking or visible means of propulsion.No sound.No sign of control surfaces.", "Large yellow &amp; red lights on Red Hill Ave, going South towards Irvine Blvd. The lights simultaneous disappeared as I approached.I was driving on Red Hill Ave, going South.

In the distance I saw large yellow and red lights across the 4 lane highway. There were probably 10 lights on the pavement. It looked like a police barricade or road work. When I came closer, all the lights disappeared simultaneously. It was spooky. I mean they disappeared before my eyes. There was no one else on the road. I looked to see if the lights were there, but turned off, but nothing was there, only the street. I looked up at the buildings and there were no lights. I was freaked out because it was so odd.

I was driving down Route 66 on March 12th, 2009 at about 0:25 local time.  I was driving former Route 66 between Essex, CA and Amboy, CA. I drove over a hill, where i suddenly saw 4 lights just hovering in a valley, in a diamond shaped formation. I guess those lights were about 5-7 miles away. Those lights were round, orange lights. I can&apos;t tell how big they were, but they seemed pretty big from the distance, i would guess at least 15 feet in diameter. They were solid orange, not flickering, not blinking, not changing colors. Just bright solid orange. It seemed like they were hovering about 50-200 feet above the ground. While they were hovering there, i heard no sounds or noises at all. You could see the lights were bright enough to illuminate a pretty big area in the valley.My location was at http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;q=34.565853,-115.489876&amp;sll=34.562697,-115.490298&amp;sspn=0.026082,0.055747&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.501464,-115.557289&amp;spn=0.208807,0.445976&amp;t=h&amp;z=12 and the lights could be seen at a west/southwest direction from there, at what i guess was about 5-7 miles away. The whole area is pretty much abandoned. Amboy is nearly a ghost town, there is virtually no traffic there (in over 1 hour, i didn&apos;t see any oncoming or passing cars). There are train tracks running not to far from Route 66 though and there seems to be a pipeline, since there was a pump station that i passed earlier.As soon as i drove over the hill and saw those lights, i pulled over, turned off my engine and my lights, grabbed the camera (which was readily mounted on a tripod, since i was doing night photography about 15 minutes earlier and placed the camera and tripod on the rear seats) and started taking a picture. I did a 1 or 2 minute exposure or so, and in that time i realized that those lights are slightly moving individually. The right light was not moving at all, the top light was slightly moving to the left, the left light was moving to the bottom right and the bottom light was moving up. Shortly after taking the picture, the bottom and the left/right lights were forming one line, with the top light above them. That all happened within a few minutes though.I wanted to take another picture of those lights, when the left light started moving sideways and dissapeared (kind of just turned off) with multiple loud &quot;explosion/thunder&quot; noise. The other 3 lights simply faded out a few seconds after that. I heard no unusual noises while those lights lasted, but i did hear some very deep short thunder/explosion noises. Not like rolling thunder, but like short &quot;boom&quot; noises a few minutes after i saw those lights.I waited for about 10 more minutes to see if they would come back, but they did not appear again. Since it was a relatively clear full moon night, i could clearly see into the valley, but didn&apos;t see any houses, cars, trucks, aircrafts or other vehicles at all. Since the location is pretty much in the middle of nowhere, i am not aware of any other people that might have seen those lights.I continued driving westbound on Route 66 and about 4 or 5 minutes later i realized there is another, smaller, orange light a few miles behind us directly on Route 66. I stopped to see if that might be another car, but it didn&apos;t seem to be one. That was another orange light, but way smaller than the other one. I couldn&apos;t tell if that light was on the ground or only a few feet above the road. It didn&apos;t come any closer and didn&apos;t seem to move, and also, after another minute or so, it dissapeared. I am not sure if that was in any way related to the previous sighting or if that was just another car or light from one of the pump stations/train signals or so.The picture i took is available at http://michaelkesler.net/blog/uploads/UFO4.JPG and a cropped version of the &quot;UFOs&quot; themselves is available at http://michaelkesler.net/blog/uploads/UFO3.jpg .I am not sure what that was. I am kind of thinking that it might have been some sort of funny military craft, since there is an Airforce Base not too far away from that location. However, i don&apos;t know if that could be an explanation for what i saw. I hope you might have any ideas to tell me.", "I walked out of the house at 10 PM and something caught my eye, so I looked up and saw a  Rectangle Object with a White Light on each corner, and a Red light Flashing in the Middle...

In my confirmed excitement, I turned to the objects she was pointing at, and noticed they were the same size and shape, but more of an orange color, while mine was white. The two were headed eastward and traveling much slower than any aircraft around here.  The two grouped together were staying the same distance apart the entire time and moving in the same direction.  I turned back around to look at the object I initially saw, and observed it gliding behind the tree line in a more southerly and downward direction, at the speed it was going, it should have reappeared within two or three seconds, but it never did.  When I turned again to see the pair of lights, they had already gone.The light I initially saw looked to be about the same shape and color of a star in the night sky.  To my best estimate, it was about 400 yards away and lower than the regular aircraft around here.  None of them illuminated the area around us from their light.  Their true speed I can&rsquo;t say, but it felt to me they were going the speed of a slow helicopter.

It also had three bands of marquee-like lights on the bottom. There were lights between some of the sections and internally. I have never seen this type of craft before nor read any accounts of it.(You may post this if you wish...I did not have anyway to draw then post to internet so I found a program called draw where I made a &quot;sketch&quot; of the general shape.

I don&apos;t know if it was of earth or beyond, but it was impressive, and much larger than a typical jet.  It sounded like a typical jet but the light patterns and shape dispelled similarity to a typical jet.It made the sound of a typical jet albeit louder than average, and it appeared much larger than typical jet, if I held my arm at full length and measured using fingers I would say it appeared four inches in length, about 1/2 inch in width against the night sky.

I thought that maybe it was a plane, until the object which was the shape of a star with a ring around it moved straight up and down and side to side in a matter of seconds. The best way that I can describe how fluent the movement&apos;s were is like dropping something in water and pushing it back up again. There was no sound, but as I watched it disappeared and reappeared in a matter of one second, almost like I&apos;d blinked. There was only one of them, and there was a white aura type shading around it. The object emitted lights and it looked like someone was signaling someone else with a multi colored flash light.

I don&apos;t know when the object was gone, because I was trying not to think of it, and I fell asleep. The sky was very clear that night.

I only know that in the fifty years I have lived, I have never seen anything like this since.I lived in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, in town called Oakwood.   I believe it was the fall of 1967 when I had this encounter, which would put me at about 8 years old.  This phenomenon occurred in the middle of the night after having returned to my bed from the bathroom.After laying back down I noticed a bright, round, moonlike object about a mile to the west and coming closer.  I was so unsure of what I was witnessing that I went to the window to get a better look.  I watched for a couple of minutes as this bright object came closer.  It was now several stories above the tree tops above our neighbor&rsquo;s backyard. It had no sound and no discernable outline, but only the color of light.  It was round, about 30 feet across, and moving rather slowly.  I had to move to the other window that faced north to our backyard.   I thought about calling out to my mother, but thought that by the time she awoke and got to me, the object would be gone.  Just then the light went out.  It didn&rsquo;t shoot away or disappear, it just went out.   It wasn&rsquo;t replaced by a black outline against the sky.  I looked for several more minutes waiting to see if it would light up again or see some outline moving against the sky.  Nothing.I wasn&rsquo;t scared, just a bit confused, so went back to bed and fell asleep.The next morning, before going to school, I sat at breakfast and told my mother what I saw.   She didn&rsquo;t have much comment over the subject, so I didn&rsquo;t push the topic.That day in school we had show and tell.  I remember sitting in a circle to the left of our teacher.   As we went around the circle, I wondered if I should tell about my night.  I did.  To my surprise the teacher didn&rsquo;t think I was making up stories.  Instead, she said on her way to work she heard on the radio that there had been reports by others who had seen this strange object.I will always wonder what it was, who it was, where it came from or where it went.  I have never seen anything like it to explain away what it was.I have recalled this account so that it might conjure up a memory for someone else that may have seen this around the same time and in the same area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We saw Jupiter, a few shooting stars, some satellites, and normal air traffic as we live about 5 miles from the Airport.Shortly after 10:00 my husband, who is a pilot, pointed towards Jupiter and said, &quot;What is that!&quot;  We all paused and looked to the southeast sky.  We saw an orange light just under Jupiter that moved across the sky to the northwest.  The light appeared to be 2-3 times the apparent size of Jupiter in the night sky.  It was an intense orange light that moved silently through the sky. We watched it move towards us for better than 90 seconds before it appeared to change course and head north.  The light then disappeared.The sighting went on for approximately 2 minutes.  As an individual who is no stranger to aviation, I do not believe it was an airplane or helicopter as the light did not strobe and there was no sound from the object that I could detect.

After adjusting my eyes, i realized this was no hallucination.  it was like a bright ball, seemed like an orb-- this is how it appeared from the ground anyways.  I swear this thing was playing hide and seek; hiding behind dark evil chem clouds (5th day of major aerosol operation)  Sometimes it would drift out and sit ina a &quot;hole&quot; (HAARP?) in the clouds right in the open like it wanted to make its presence known.  it always moved in liquid motions, very graceful. 10 mins after the sighting a helicopter (black- military i presume) came from the direction of hamilton and was heading directly at the craft a! nd kept flying.  during the arrival of the helicopter i noticed the orb was gone.  i continued my walk and within minutes not only was the orb back but there was at least 2 much smaller crafts flying faster weaving in and out of the clouds moving across the whole city.  these ones were much smaller and not so blatant, and they were always moving .  for the whole 40 min walk home the biggest orb always kept appearing, dissapearing behind grey clouds always in the same general area which was in the vicinity of the moon.  Before i went in my house i checked and it wasn&apos;t there.  i played on my computer for a while and thought to look out my bedroom window, and the thing was right where it was before.  it was never out of site for the entire night, but after 330 it seemed to just sit there and act like a star.  i went to sleep just before dawn and it was still there...  one thing i forgot to mention is that when this ball was next to a cloud that wasn&apos;t as thick you could see a! red/orange glow projected from the object onto the cloud.  al! so at ti mes  light on the craft would pulsate especially when maneuvering.I didn&apos;t see anything for a few days and then last night (aug 11) i was working at 3am (on lunch outside) and noticed several orbs again.  i had a friend watch them too and he couldn&apos;t believe it.  during lunch conversation i noticed what appeared to be a shooting star- but it couldn&apos;t have been because it shot one way and then reversed and disappeared.  this was all in a flash, so fast that i pretty much saw a &quot;&gt;&quot; in the sky ( like a zig zag)  anyways there were three big balls of light this time that mostly creeped in there own areas, posing as stars for the most part.  again they couldn&apos;t have been because we watched one start creeping, we lost him behind the cloud, then he slowly rose above it in plain site.  only one person at the lunch table was bothered to even look up ONCE... they were trying to tell me that it was stars, satellites etc without even looking up.   i really don&apos;t care because i know from chemtrails that bringing up anything &quot;outside the matrix&quot; just ma! kes you look crazy... even on a spray day with the sky in a grid pattern and magnetic cloud anomolies.  Anyways, around 5am i was hanging at the side of the factory with the other witness throwing cardboard in a bin and we decided to watch the several suspicious stars that were all out of place from a few hours earlier.  we noticed one slowly creep upward through a cloud and sit above it.(they seem to do that a lot...) the witness said &quot;holy shit, look at the red  light&quot;! as it passed through a thin edge of the cloud.  it sat above and it was pulsating, got brighter and it either changed shape or the shape of the craft became apparent- which was sort of like a small case &quot;t&quot; without the bend on the bottom.  anyweay i finished my shift, and when i left it was sunny, clear and the chemtrail planes (2) were already starting for the day.  nothing else was in sight in the sky.  i have never had an interest in ufos until recently, i just couldn&apos;t help seeing it out of the corner ! of my eye the other day.  now that i&apos;m watching the sky it see! ms appar ent that there&apos;s a lot going on we have no idea about!!!", "Thought it was a Satellite until witnessing a very bright flash of light come from the object.While looking at the western sky noticed a small dot in the sky traveling from north to south. Thought it was a satellite at first as it was very small and seemed to be traveling at the speed I am use to seeing from a satellite. The odd thing was as we were watching the small dot it suddenly started to glow with a very high intensity light so much so that I thought it was a helicopter spotlight. The light only lasted for a few seconds then went back to normal and the craft continued on a southerly course at the same speed before fading out.

Moving at the same pace it turned away and then looked to travel upward(as the lights got closer together and dimmer).   It kept traveling into the milky way until we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  We never heard sound at any time.  The lights were white (like headlights of a car) and did not change color.", "Orange Light Disappears Above MeI saw an orange light, that had a candle like glow, move silently across the sky. I was about 1000 feet above my back yard. It was like a light I had never seen before. As it passed overhead, my friend and I both had a feeling it was about to disappear. Suddenly it began to fade away in clear sight. After it was &quot;gone&quot; my friend and I talked about what we saw. We both saw some kind of metallic panel like lines, as if there was a structure within the light as the light faded away above us. This happened on June 27th around 8:40 pm in the San Jacinto mountains of southern California.((name deleted))", "Craft seen in Kent, Wa.Tonight I was over at a friend&apos;s house stargazing as we do often when the weather permits. The weather was warm and clear. The moon was 3/4 full with Jupiter off to it&apos;s right. Three of the four moons of Jupiter were visible. My friend&apos;s house lies under the flight path for planes going into Seatac when they have to fly south to circle around to land going north. It&apos;s also under a flight path for planes that are going to Boeing Field from the south.  Needless to say, we see a lot of planes on any given night that we stargaze. We also usually see one of the Guardian helicopters from the King County Sheriff&apos;s Department flying around, so we are both very familiar with the aircraft in this area.At approximately 1:00am when Coast to Coast took a commercial break, my friend went into his house to use the bathroom. A few minutes later I decided to stand up to stretch my legs. We sit on his porch facing due East, so when I stood up, that&apos;s the direction I was facing. I saw a bright pulsing light directly ahead of me. My first thought was that it was a private plane with it&apos;s landing lights on heading in my direction. Private planes&apos; landing light pulse on and off as they come in for a landing, but the color was wrong and I couldn&apos;t detect any forward motion. The color of the light was sort of amber yet at the same time it was like a mixture of red and white light, but not pink. As if the red and white light was swirled together. I could detect both colors at the same time although it appeared as one light. The motion that I could detect was a gentle back and forth motion and at the same time a gentle up and down motion. It was erratic yet seemed under control. I grabbed my binoculars, Celestron Skymaster 15x70s, and looked at it. It appeared much closer, but otherwise appeared exactly the same. I was pretty sure that this wasn&apos;t a plane, so I flashed a small flashlight at it. I didn&apos;t notice any reaction from the object. I then grabbed my friends big flashlight which I believe is a 2.5 million candle power light. I flashed it twice in the direction of the object. I&apos;m not sure if it was coincidence or not, but the object moved slightly to the right behind a tree. I had to move to my left a few feet to be able to see it again through the tree.After about 30 seconds the object started moving to the left. When it did this I could see that the pulsing light was a white light at the rear of the object, based on direction of travel. There was a non pulsing white light at the front of the object and there were 3 non pulsing red lights visible. As the object came out from behind the tree moving North, I flashed the big flashlight at it a couple of more times. Again, I don&apos;t know if it was coincidence or not, but the object accelerated. It was a very quick yet smooth acceleration. This is when I realized that the object was not as far away as I had first thought. I had been thinking that it appeared to be very far away, but now it appeared as if it was only a few thousand feet away, perhaps closer. Without knowing the size of the object it&apos;s hard to tell at night.As the object moved what appeared to be North, I would lose sight of it for a few seconds as it went behind trees, but I quickly realized that it was now heading West, or perhaps WNW towards Tukwilla. It accelerated again, very smoothly, and I lost sight of it when it went behind a neighboring house.When I looked at it with the binoculars as it was traveling westerly, I was looking at it from the side, so I could not tell what shape it was, but I got the impression it was triangular. I saw no wings and no tail section and it was totally silent. From it&apos;s apparent size and distance, I should have easily heard it. Guardian One at that distance would have been very loud and easily identifiable as we have seen it on many occasions fly by at that apparent altitude and distance.  The only problem is that whatever this was, was way faster than Guarding One and made no noise.  As a matter of fact, Guardian One just flew over my apartment as I am writing this. It was quite noisy and can be heard a great distance away.It was also much too fast for a private plane, which we had fly over us not very long before this sighting.  Again, the private plane was easily heard and identified.  For it to have been a commercial plane, which we see several every night, including tonight, the pilot would have had to have been making an emergency landing since he was only flying about 20 degrees off of the horizon.  At the estimated distance a a few thousand feet, it would have been incredibly loud.  I also estimate that it was only a few hundred feet in altitude.I feel like I&apos;m rambling, so I&apos;m going to end this.", "Lights in the sky make themselves known.My boyfriend and I were saying our goodbyes for the night while looking up in the sky.  I noticed two particular &quot;stars&quot; that were very near each other.  I saw one start moving to the north in an arc while the other one stayed still.  Then the second &quot;star&quot; moved to the west, also in an arc. Due to the trees, I lost the second one behind the high pine trees.  However, my boyfriend followed the first until it faded away.About five minutes later, I spot another moving &quot;star&quot; and then the fourth another five minutes after that. I know for a fact that our government does not have aircraft that can fly that high in our atmosphere at a constant high rate speed.  I call them &quot;stars&quot; because that is how they looked due to being so high up in the atmosphere.After the moving &quot;stars&quot;, my boyfriend sees a very bright light.  A light too bright to be a planet. Also, there was no &quot;twinkling&quot; to it, but a pulsating light.  We know where Venus is in relation to the moon as well as Mars.Every night, my boyfriend and I watch the skies and wish aloud that there was no light pollution to affect our view.  He went home to tell his family about it and to show them the bright, pulsating &quot;star&quot;. They too have confirmed that it is &quot;moving&quot; across the sky at a faster rate than the Moon, Venus, and the North Star.", "Large, high altitude, oval-shaped object sighted over San Jose, CAI&apos;m a licensed private pilot (22 years) and avid skywatcher (40 years).I was up late and went outside to check the sky. I was looking at Cassiopeia which was near the mid-heaven. Passing close to the star Segin, I noticed 2 lights moving together in a N-NE direction. The lights were roughly 1/4 degree apart. I noticed the lights appeared to be on the opposite outer edges of an dark oval shape. The oval appeared to have numerous additional lights around the periphery.The object was silent. I saw no sign of navigation lights, flashing lights, or strobes. There was no trail behind the object.I was able to watch the object move in a straight line traveling approximately 20 degrees in about 3 minutes until a tree blocked my line of sight.", "Small blue flashing lights circles over North Edinburgh Sky, moving extremely fast, with flashing strobe lightsUFO SIGHTING ON FRIDAY, 24TH JULY 2009 - EDINBURGH NORTH - SIGHTING ABOVE SKY - PARAMETER FROM EASTER ROAD TO PILRIG PARK  At 11.00pm on friday, 24th july 2009 i was watching television and got disturbed by flashing light from the sky, i went to look out my window, and saw it was very cloudy, through the clouds there were pale blue lights, odd shapes, but mostly circles, which were sporadically moving very fast around the sky, they had lines of blue/white strobe light, their movement was unusual as it was very fast and sporadic, jumpy in fact, not normal. This went on spradic movements for 25 minutes, a red light was on outside of parameter of the blue lights, the red light was smaller than blue lights. The blue lights then dissapeared then a very large blue light, size of moon was still for around 20 minutes, smaller ones dissapeared. It was like the blue ones had amalgamated into one large blue one.

I noticed what I thought was a very bright star, but it was moving and appeared to be blinking. It was followed for about 15 seconds by a smaller looking red dot, which disappeared. The first star-like object was making very erratic movements, which appeared to be twirling. It came close enough to shore that I could make out the outline of a disc shaped object which was clearly spinning, with red and white lights around the edges of the middle section of the disc. The UFO then flew further away, but we could still see the light from it which seemed to blink from the rotation of the craft. A second one joined it, and began to follow it very erratically. The second one then began to ascend to the upper part of the sky very rapidly. After a few minutes, two military planes tore across the sky in pursuit of the craft, which took off. At this point both crafts disappeared. By now, we had all been following the crafts for 45 minutes. When the two planes (clearly planes, as the flight pattern was very straight and had no inexplicable, rapid fluctuations unlike the other two lights) came in pursuit the two discs took off. A very low flying plane closely followed the two jets. About 20 minutes later, we witnessed something hovering stationary over the water for roughly 30 seconds, then slowly move forward towards the beach. Once it reached the shore, it flew sideways, and then began to move forward again. It had two red lights, one on the left and right sides of the front of the craft, and a white light in the middle of the two red ones. There was also a white or orange light possibly on the underside of the craft flashing downwards. My family and I have been going to this same part of Salter Path for 19 years. Never before have we seen anything like it. All of us are used to seeing planes and helicopters flying at night, as there is a military base in the vicinity (Johnson Air Force Base). The motions of the lights were such that it would be impossible for a plane or a helicopter. Furthermore, we identified a disc shaped object to be the source of the lights.", "REAL SIGHTING     V    SHAPE     UFOI was driving along in was 8:45 it was dark.

About 15 degrees above the horizon a very noticeable deep reddish orange light with a diffuse haze around it approximately 3 times brighter than Venus (which was visible in the southeastern sky at the time)was moving slowly in a western direction. Motion was determined as this object was drifting slowly in relation to the rest of the star field nearby. Object was viewed for about 20 seconds then it slowly began to fade out over a time frame of about 5 seconds. The brightness, hue and motion of this object preclude it from being a satellite or meteor. Object could not have been an aircraft either, as 2 planes were seen in the area about a minute after the object disappeared and had a vastly different appearance than the unknown object.", "I saw a bright light that seemed to be sucked into another dimension when I looked at it, and there was a loud &quot;booming&quot; sound as it diI was standing outside, smoking a cigarette and the sun was not quite coming up yet.

As I was staring at the light, I suddenly realized that I was lying on the porch that I was recently smoking on.  I jumped to my feet, and the light was still there as it was before.  As I looked at the light like I was mesmerized, it began to get smaller and smaller until it seemed to be sucked into another dimension or something.  As it disappeared for my vision, there was a loud &quot;boom&quot; sound that was loud enough to wake my wife up.  She heard the boom, but she did not see the light.

It was about 10:15 pm and the weather was warm, and the sky was mostly clear with some small thin clouds.  I immediately saw the UFO flying just above the trees, slowly moving east, as if following Rt. 40 toward Baltimore.  The craft was huge or the size of a stadium, and it made no sound what so ever.  The craft was saucer shaped, like two plates put together.  Around the midline of the craft were rotating red and white lights that rotated in a counterclockwise direction.  The body of the craft was silver in color, and there were windows in the front, or cockpit, and smaller round windows along the side I saw.  A pilot could be clearly seen in the cockpit window, in shadow, and was humanlike in shape.  It was not an airplane.I went back into the house to rouse others to view the craft, to no avail.  My Mom was in the bathroom, and my boyfriend was asleep on the bed and refused to get up.  I ran back out to my front porch, and I saw it proceed east, toward town, and it disappeared behind the trees.  I am not sure what it was, but I drew a picture of the object I saw.

My grandfather&apos;s sister ((name deleted)) and her husband had a ranch there in the early 1900s.  My dad&apos;s family lived in Las Vegas NM.   My grandfather worked on the railroad there.  He died in an accident, and my father was 12, he went to live with his Aunt in Roswell.  He knew all the native American teenagers.  They all grew up together.  They took the horses to the mesas and camped out a lot.My dad used to visit every summer, he loved the desert, only he wouldn&apos;t drive at night.  The night desert spooked him.  My dad couldn&apos;t wear a watch, the hands would spin.  We sort of accepted that as a crazy thing, never paid much attention to it.While we were crossing the desert with my dad in 1954, I had an incident.  I was about 10.  We got to Gallup NM, and I bolted from the car and ran - My dad couldn&apos;t figure out what was wrong.  I was hysterical.  I remember it to this day.  There was a time gap, something like that - I couldn&apos;t account for missing time.  After my dad calmed me down, we got a hotel and stayed the night.  I&apos;m telling you this, because in 1991, the exact same thing happened when I got near Gallup NM.  Only that time, my son was with me - and he remembers it.We got picked up in 1991 - we drove up a ramp or something, or thru a vortex, that looked exactly like Gallup NM - only the people weren&apos;t acting right.  They were acting - my son remembers passing the same landmark twice - and now he&apos;s 26, and he still remembers it.  We never talk about it, its pretty upsetting.The 1991 incident was like the final time - I kept getting picked - they were following me around - I was so used to it, I would just play dumb and hope that the time frame would move along - they&apos;re still watching me, but I have asked them please do not interfere with me or my family - I&apos;m getting a little too old for this- we need to be as normal as possible.Back to 1987 - We were living in Los Angeles in 1984.

I got a job at the University of ARizona assisting the Dean.  I have a BA in Fine Arts, and I was a legal secretary for 20 years.  I&apos;m also a music teacher.I understand mathematical principles and science, and was majoring in math, but I got bad headaches.  The math calculations would spin so fast, it gave me a headache.  So I switched to music.  I can hear music in my head - which really helps if you compose.  It&apos;s a fairly common skill among musicians.But somehow, this ability to hear and pick up sound, was meant for more than music.  I started picking up sound when I got to Tucson.  I could hear things and I would ask people, do you hear that?  They couldn&apos;t hear anything.  I heard a high pitched signal, like a transmitter.  My son can hear these high pitched signals too.  In fact, he used to hold his ears shut with his hands and refuse to go into places he could hear it.Either it was subliminal broadcasting, or I was listening to something else.  Tucson is a pretty strange place you understand, pretty close to the largest copper deposit in America - copper will pick signals up, I think.I was at the University for about 2 years, on and off, and I had a job working for an attorney.  In July 1987, I started picking up stronger signals at the university.  Like something was under the university property.  I worked in a basement laboratory for a professor.  I finally had to quit, I got dizzy and I couldn&apos;t concentrate.As soon as I quit, I started hearing the same signals in my apartment - and it got really strong.  I started freaking out - I lost my cool - and since my family has always been a little strange in the first place - I decided to would have a chat with whoever was signaling.I said, out loud &quot;Look, whoever you are, I&apos;m a rational person, I don&apos;t talk to people who aren&apos;t there, who I can&apos;t see, so if you need to talk to me, you need to be really really clear, and it has to be something I can&apos;t miss.&quot;  So I tossed it out there - and apparently they heard me.  Because a few days later, I was losing sleep and becoming increasingly disoriented.   I fell asleep in the afternoon with the window open - and the next thing I know - a massive gust of wind came thru the window and slammed all the doors - and I could not open my eyes.  I could see without my eyes being open.I was on some planet and the temperature was below zero - everything was frozen solid - I could hear the sound of breaking glass, or high pitched bells, people talking - and I was unable to move.  I am highly analytical and I started making mental notes - trying to see on the sides -  And just like that, I was out of it.  I literally packed up my kids and told them to get in the car - and I started driving south on Interstate 19 south of Tucson.  I was shaking really bad.  All I knew is I wanted to get out of the apartment - I couldn&apos;t breathe and I was shaking really bad  A storm started rising up from the South, and started moving in - I got off the highway at Valencia - and turned left.  I was shaking so bad, I had to stop the car.  I told the kids to get out, while I calmed down.Somebody was standing right behind me - that I couldn&apos;t see, blowing on my neck.  I had the kids with me, and I was terrified.  We started walking, and we went a few blocks, and ended up in front of a bank.  It started raining, the kids were wondering what was going on.  I told them, go in the bank and sit down, I&apos;ll stay out here for a couple of seconds.As soon as the kids went in the bank, and I was standing there - the bank saw we were in distress and called the police.  The police came, talked to me, and I had to make something up - like I was tired -  Right about then, I looked like a lunatic.  My kids were really upset.  They called my husband at work - he works as a mathematician and engineer.While the police were standing there, the storm rolled in, two of the policemen touched me, and man, a huge bolt of lightening smacked me - and I saw the sun explode - and I thought - well, I must be dead.....The police looked at me, grabbed me again, and somebody took over my body and literally threw the police on the ground.  I guess touching is a no-no.  Then this voice goes &quot;do exactly as I tell you, we need to get you out of here&quot;.I guess I was on the &quot;wrong side&quot;  The police started acting really stangely.  A woman came out of the bank, and she stared at the police and said &quot;she&apos;s fine you need to go now&quot; - and they got in the car and left.  When did you ever see that happen.  Then she said &quot;come inside, do you need a glass of water?&quot;  All of a sudden, it all turned, now everybody wanted to get me a glass of water.  My husband showed up, he stared at me and the kids - and he tried to escort us home.  It just got crazier and crazier after that.Somebody started driving the car, and the kids and I had to go for a ride.  I wasn&apos;t &quot;me&quot; anymore - I was somebody else.  Whoever it was, beamed down here.After about a day of driving around, and running out of gas in the desert, the police found us again - and man I had some explaining to do after that.  My husband was furious.  I had to sit there and take it - and pretend I was nuts - I wasn&apos;t nuts.   I was trying to observe.  He was trying to show me something.  He explained things.When I said, &quot;well why are you telling me all this stuff, I&apos;m nobody.&quot;  the answer was pretty much I had to wait about 25 years, and then there was a pretty good possibility that the information would end with me unless people were willing to listen.  Other than look like a nut, that&apos;s how it all started.The police transported me to a mental facility - and I had to sit there for 4 weeks looking like a nut case.  I went along with the whole thing.  While I was there, I had a little radio with a headset.  When I changed the batteries, the batteries drained in my hand.  That hasn&apos;t happened again.After 1987, nothing happened again until 1991 - I was driving across I-40, approaching Gallup NM, and the road just ended, there was another flash, and the road was back - only I was not in Gallup NM.I stop there all the time, whenever I drive to NM.  Chief Yellowhorse sits on the property - it&apos;s a sacred site.  I usually stop and go in, maybe get a drink and buy some jewelry - but most things are unspoken -  The university offered me an office position with the Mars project - but I turned it down and went back to Los Angeles.  If I knew what was going on, I could be much more straightforward.While I was in Los Angeles, I saw the black triangle craft with the red lights, just once.  It hovered over the San Fernando Valley - I think long enough for me to see it - then it left.The only other thing that was pretty spectacular, was a light show over Mesa Arizona around 1991 - it was a series of dots and dashes in blasts of color, that streamed across the sky and went directly over our apartment.  I got my husband and the neighbors, and we all stood there and watched.  It came from the direction of the airport, and the next day, the paper ran a story that somebody was fooling around with lights - and not to pay any attention to them.I have a lot to say, there&apos;s more, but that gives you a general idea of what happened.  I had problems going to Santa Fe NM a couple of years ago.  I told them, again,  &quot;I am not going to tolerate a repeat performance, so if you don&apos;t mind, I need you to back off!&quot;  And they respect my wishes, if you can believe that.We sort of have an understanding.  They&apos;re here if I need them to be here for any reason, which is sort of comforting, but I really don&apos;t want to go thru anything like that ever again unless it&apos;s part of scientific research and there&apos;s plenty of documentation and researchers on board.  I&apos;m more than happy to walk any research team thru this, I&apos;m just not going to chase them down.  They need to ask me and respect the territory.  I refuse to be treated like a nut job -  I just saw your Characteristics secion.  Yes, my car engine stopped and forced me to walk for miles in the desert.  Also, in 1987, on that date, (I am positive of the date)  tucson lost all electricity at the date and hour - all the electricity went out for about 15 minutes in an electrical storm - you would have to check the newspapers - but I&apos;m sure that was the day -  The voice kept saying &quot;I&apos;m turning off the power&quot; - apparently they can&apos;t get in unless the power is out -  There was also a lot of extremely loud &quot;car&quot; type horns - deep ones - blasting signals - it all happened so fast - and then the voice goes &quot;how&apos;s this?&quot;  He&apos;s a real sarcastic alien with a really great sense of humor - it&apos;s like &quot;jokes on me&quot; - It&apos;s like, human beings think they are so smart, and that just isn&apos;t the case.  We are really really stupid.  I came to terms with my stupidity years ago, and I guess that&apos;s appealing.I&apos;m positive they were watching my dad and then me - this is a family thing - I am not even sure if we&apos;re from this planet - I&apos;m starting to have my doubts seriously - this family is very very strange -  You won&apos;t be able to meet my oldest brother - but he looked exactly like an alien drawing - he was super tall and very thin and bony - he even scared me a little - He passed away a few years ago.  I guess our family was out in Roswell when that craft went down in 1947 - I was born in 1946 in California - at least that&apos;s what they tell me.  My birth certificate is from a hospital that doesn&apos;t exist anymore - and there are no photos of my mom being pregnant - she and I never got along much - it was mostly dad and myself.Well, if that isn&apos;t the strangest story you got in a long time, at least you were entertained.  I also see that you want to know if I agree to talk to an investigator.  Yes, you can do that, but don&apos;t do it over a phone.Email is better.  I can&apos;t talk by phone to anybody and depend on the conversation being confidential.  My ex husband works at the National Security Agency in Washington.  He monitors my phone calls - he hates me because I threw him out 30 years ago.  That&apos;s a whole other story.   I wish aliens would pick him up and keep him. Much love.

As I was approaching the local elementary school, toward the North, I could see a large light sort of hovering in the sky.  At first, I thought it could be the moon, but I very quickly realized that it was some sort of aircraft hanging in the sky.  One thing was clear: the light was too large to be a plane.I couldn&rsquo;t keep my eyes off the light, as it was so bright it could be seen through patches of trees.  The light was round and had a yellowish tint to it.  I continued to track the light until I lost sight of it, almost as if it had left my horizon.  The experience lasted about a minute or so.Briefly after, I tried to call my father.  When I connected to his phone, I heard muffled background noise.  I listened as long as I could bear before I was too freaked out to continue.  I called my father again, and when I connected, he claimed that I had not gone through to his phone.  I&rsquo;m not sure if there was some type of electrical interference, but I have never had any type of call quite like that.My hometown, Exeter, NH, is known for some of its encounters with UFO&rsquo;s.

A peer of mine and myself were walking through his/her yard and in the close distance saw a white spherical light was moving across the horizon.  The object moved in a straight smooth motion at a very steady slow speed.  After about a minute or two of watching the object, it suddenly vanished.  I did not see streak marks of light indicating it moving across the sky at an accelerated speed, however I suggest it went invisible.As mentioned before, the sightings have occurred on different dates and throughout many years.  A few of the objects have been seen in groups of two, but no more than two.  I have seen other objects (exactly as previously described) stay in the same position for more than a half hour not moving before it finally vanished before my eyes.

It looked as bright as and as large as a small full moon.  It looked illuminated. It seemed like there was a plane just before it and another just after it, but flying below it.  It was not a high-speed chase, more like a casual rate of speed.

By my estimation the light seemed to be only slightly above tree level.  I moved in the direction of the light hoping to capture its image on my cell phone; despite attempting twice I was unable to capture any definite image on the phone.The light remained in one definite place for a period of approximately 20-30 seconds, appearing still in the night sky above the houses.  The orange light within seemed to remain constant, appearing to slightly pulse to the naked eye.  After remaining still for a 20-30 second period the light began to in the direction I guessed to be northeast.  I lost sight of it several times when it was blocked by trees and each time I saw the light it appeared smaller.  The light maintained a constant appearance, seeming to move slowly while I&apos;m convinced it must have been moving with some definite speed.

We were use to grandpa getting up every night to get snacks so never thought much of it if we heard doors even being little we wouldn&apos;t . I was laying on my back next to my mom that night Ill never forget as long as I am able to think and breath ill remember it as if it were last night. I heard a door open , knowing my grandmas house well I knew in my little mind it was the breeze way door from the sound it use to make .  It would have been around dark mid morning .This twin bed my mom and I were cramped into was straight visioned to see down the hall.  I lifted my head slightly and seen these tall forms in a single line walking soundlessly straight at my mother and I were we lay.I was so afraid to move If a 4 year old could have heart failure I was having it , just as I got the nerve to try to bump my mom or scream it was like them being all around us at the bed in a operational formation , somehow they didn&apos;t let me do anything at all.  I could move or talk or nothing it was like they calmed me in my mind only not like a mom would more like very matter of fact with firm thoughts , they never made a sound at all .I remember my eyes being able to move watching them stand over us . Seemed like they were studying me as I think back on it they touched or seem to touch places of my joints.  But I didn&apos;t feel them touch me it was like I just new they were . So hard to explain but then they all the sudden looked at one another and left in a single line just as they had walked in . My mind goes blank at this point the next thing I remember is I wake up next to my mom and am frantic to tell her what happened to me, she of  of corse being a mom along with the whole family said you probably just heard grandpa  get up and had a dream.  I remember wondering why when something like this happened to me they didn&apos;t want to know or wouldn&apos;t listen.Thinking back I wonder how can a little 4 year old dream in 1967 and see detailed humanoids that have a eery glow of greenish mist about them with huge black eyes same form and color and glow as would be said now in 2009 . How can a little girl know this when the only Aliens she has seen at this age is my favorite martian. Some man with a fish bowl on his head. Well I know I am not a liar or making up things now at 46 to impress anyone . I really finally just want to tell someone in hopes that maybe when I am gone and other things happen who knows maybe one of us and what happened to us or things that we saw will help someone out there that needs that little puzzle piece and if not it is alright with me as well, because they left me I feel better than I was before they came. I have because of them lived my life so much more open minded than I might have before it.They were now I am guessing about 7 foot tall at least that .They had a dull colored lime glow of misty look to them.They had no visual ears , they had black eyes They&apos;re head was shaped like a smooth cone huge top small chin They had a line where the mouth would be but very dim impression They communicated to me seemingly with thought and was able to control me as well.They not once made me feel threatened or took me out of that bed.I would give anything to talk to someone else who has maybe went through this not all the bells and whistles and flying off with them but just they came and  studied you and left.((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I got the directions wrong to his cabin and was heading West on Highway 54 at about 11:00 p.m. CST right on the outskirts of Camdenton Missouri when I noticed a large sphere on the left hand side of the highway above a commercial building (it was South).  I thought it was a large dealership type balloon at first, but it started moving very slowly across the highway in a zig zag style fashion. I immediately slowed my motorcycle speed down to about 10 mph, as I was transfixed on the object and could not keep my eyes off of it.  I thought it was maybe a hot air balloon ride as I got closer and thought it was amazing that they had hot air balloon rides so late and so low to the ground in the Ozark hills. It was a spherical type object but was not static in shape...it was hard to identify what it was for some reason. I couldn&apos;t see any type of hot air balloon basket, but for some reason I felt as if I was being watched while riding on the bike. I kept wanting to pull my bike over to take a picture, but was too amazed at the object that I didn&apos;t for some reason. It was large (the size of a small house) and floating about 150 foot above the ground...it was reddish colored with a glow (I thought the glow was the fire for fire for the hot air balloon). It passed right over the top of me along the highway and was hovering along the right side of the highway (the North side). I was trying to find a place to pull my motorcycle over so I could take a picture, but trees were getting in the way, but I could still see the object for another 10 to 15 seconds or so. I finally found an open spot with no trees to take the picture and within seconds of getting off my motorcycle, the object faded extremely fast heading in a 45 degree angle. It was literally gone within a few seconds, but there were no obstructions or trees for it to dissappear b! ehind. I t couldn&apos;t have been a hot air balloon because of the exit speed and how low to the ground it was. It was definitely sphere-like. The whole experience lasted only a minute or two, but I have tried to rationalize what I saw almost every minute of the day since then (It was 6 days ago). The professor&apos;s cabin who I was staying at knew what I had seen, as he had seen the exact same type of object hovering above Lake of the Ozarks 3 years ago in late fall 2006. We are co-workers at a University...both professors. He told me that I could come forward with his information as well. Him and his wife both witnessed the object hovering above Lake of the Ozarks for about 5 minutes...they could not believe their eyes...and were also so transfixed that they didn&apos;t capture it on film. He informed me that he kicks himself all the time for not taking a picture or video, but for some reason he was so mesmerized he didn&apos;t move. The fellow professor and his wife never told anyone but relatives in the past...but him and I have talked for hours in the past 6 days to try to rationalize what we saw, but there is no rational known explanation of the object, how it moved, it&apos;s size, shape, and aura around it. I have never been an avid UFO follower and was not looking for a UFO...it found me...and I completely believe and now intend to spend my summers investigating this phenomenon (as a professor my summers are fairly free). I will help you in any way I can...I am 100% CERTAIN that I witnessed a UFO...as a lawyer and professor I am very skeptical without evidence...but the evidence was literally about 150 feet right above in front of me...it was the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed in my life.

Initially I thought it was an airplane, but after it remained in the same position for a couple minutes I realized it couldn&apos;t be. I looked for airplanes in the sky and one moved beyond this light so I definitely knew it was stationary. I called my parents on the phone and had them head out to look at it.

Since we are in a rural location and it was dark out, we were seeing her home safely.  She happened to point out that the stars looked different -  We are all avid sky watchers - and all looked up to consider what she said.  She then said that she had never seen a certain tiny constellation in the Southwestern sky and we all looked to the area she was indicating.  My nephew asked if it had changed shape, and all four of us noted the change from a &apos;ladle&apos; shape to a square and then a triangle.  Stunned, we watched the shape chnage further into a rounded heart shape, a line, a zig zag, and I told my daughter to get her camera which she had left inside my house.While she was trying to video tape the object, I went into the house, got my camera, and turned all the lights out.  I went back outside and we watched and did our best to document what we were seeing.If the ground were at 0 and directly above us were a 10, the object would have been near the 7. As we stared towards the South South East, the Pleiades was at a 9 and to our left (East).   At arm&apos;s length, it would have taken a nickel to cover it.At first we thought the lights were shifting into the repeating shapes, but as we watched over 2 hours, we realized it was a saucer shaped object with the lights along the edge and the ship was rotating, causing the light pattern to shift.The object drifted to the East very slowly, and then drifted back to the West.  We could not judge the size very well, but for some reason we all thought it was huge.   We watched a Sattelite go from the south west to the north east and I would guess that the object was about the same level as it, as the lights were of a similar size.  It could have been smaller and much closer - It was impossible to tell.We also noted several shooting stars, including one that &apos;shot&apos; slower and did not fade as it curved from the area of the object and went East.We tried very hard to remain calm, but we all felt a sense of awe and gratitude.  We all sent mental messages of  thanks, for what it may have been worth - and we all felt excited and nearly euphoric.  We all agreed that what we were seeing was beautiful.Although we took dozens of pictures and videos, which we will gladly send in if requested, the lights were apparently not strong enough to be picked up by our cameras.  Maybe someone has a program on their computer that can help see what may have been picked up in the videos.  We did enhance one of the pictures and discovered that what we thought was a saucer shape was actually triangular!((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we were impressed with her eloquence, and her apparently serious-minded approach to the sighting.  Under ordinary circumstances, we might conjecture that a report of this nature might have been about a sighting of stars in the night.

We had our lights all turned off to enjoy the night sky. We had come out around 11:35 pm and had been in the pool about five to ten minutes when I noticed lights in the sky coming over the house behind us.  At first I thought it was a plane, because our house is in a flight path. They were in a distinct triangular shape that in some ways mimicked that of a fighter jet&apos;s elongated triangle--  but the lights made a triangular shape that was bigger than a plane, you could see sky through and around them.They were small orange points of light, and looked extraordinarily similar to the smallest stars we could see in the sky except of course that they were moving, and fast, flying in what appeared almost like a perfect flock of geese formation, except with two rows instead of one. I instantly pointed them out to my husband and we watched them as they passed almost directly overhead and past our house from Northwest to Southeast. There was no sound whatsoever either before, during or after they passed, other than that of the usual street traffic nearby, etc.Once we realized they were separate lights and not a single plane, I was honestly afraid they might  be missiles of some kind, because they were so small and high and going so fast,  their color was so uniform, and there was no sound.  Honestly, I have no idea whether missiles make noise or not, but it&apos;s all my mind could come up with at the time.   Also as they passed one of the tiny dots of light moved out of the V formation and away and then back into it.   They continued on in their straight path until they disappeared over the roof of our house. The whole thing only lasted 20-25 seconds or so traveling from the horizon of one rooftop to the horizon of the opposite rooftop.There seems to me to be absolutely no question that what we saw was not a natural event, but a group of-- I have no idea what. I am completely at a loss. But those orange lights were most definitely in a formation, and wherever they were going, they were going fast.I have never reported anything like this before in my life until today.

When we got out of the car my 5 year old asked if a bright light up in the sky was a planet.  It was a clear night so myself, my daughter and wife began to look up into the sky to star gaze.  I looked at the light again and realized that it had nearly moved behind a tree. It did not blink so it could not have been a commercial airliner.  It stayed a yellow/white and was clearly very very high up in the air.  It moved due North very fast.  There were other commercial aircraft in the sky that night flying due south and north west.  At first it was travelling the speed of a commercial aircraft, but it picked up speed quickly and began to travel 5-6 times the speed of a commercial aircraft very quickly. It made no sound.As the light approached the horizon we looked up and saw another light moving in the same tragectory.  It was nearly exactly the same in all ways including speed.  I watched until each light had traveled over the horizon and was out of sight.  The entire event did not take any more than 4-5 minutes.The speed at which they accelerated was amazing, and I have been unable to stop thinking about it since.  My daughter and wife witnessed this as well.  I am convinced that it was not a satalite or asteroid/shooting star and was some sort of aircraft.  I am unsure if it was in the atmosphere or outside of it.  They were not satelites.  The most likely scenario is some sort of high flying supersonic aircraft.  The lack of any noise was the most shocking thing about the whole incident...until I saw the second light following the first.Can you find out if the military had any aircraft flying north at supersonic speed along the NY/VT border that night?  If they did not then I would call it a UFO just due to the speed, brightness of the light, consistancy of the light, and exact trajectory of each object.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS.

It moved slowly at first and then before it disappeared moved quite rapidly.   At first it moved quite slowly, drifting to the right and then arcing over to the left.  Then it took a straight line to the left and quickly rising and eventually disappearing.  The light was solid and then quickly flickered before it disappeared.  The object looked like it might have been in the shape of a boomerang, but was really high in the sky to confirm.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then I noticed there was a second object hundreds of miles away from the first object, both moving in complete and utter sinc with each other.  It was two objects, because there were stars between them, but they seemed to mirror one another, never differing in distance from one another, both moving jaggedly but in complete sinc with one another, through space.  It struck me as the oddest thing I&apos;ve ever seen.  Speaking nothing of the strangeness of their movements at such obvious distance from eachother, the things resembled satelites in color and size.

Our iPhones did not have the ability to resolve the image.  The object passed below a bright object (assumed Jupiter) and was two to three times its brightness and its observable arc width.  It was significantly brighter than any other object in the sky.  We were in a boat at the time, and the reflection of the object in the water was distinctly apparent.  The object displayed variable random intensity as if a glowing fiery ember, consistently appearing orange to amber in color, and slowly inconsistently dissolved at the end of its track.  The entire event lasted approximately 95-110 seconds. It is also notable that the object seemed to alter course by 5-10 degrees east of track at approximately 65-70 seconds (030-035 azimuth) into the event. We contacted http://www.nuforc.org/ and were subsequently advised that this object was seen in the same time frame from Massachusetts to Chicago, possibly fractured into multiple objects. We were advised that this is too slow for a fast moving meteor atmospheric impact or grazing event.  We saw several of these (meteors) which are very white and short lasting within the preceding sixty minutes.  This was not an aircraft, displaying normal anti-collision strobe lights and red, green, and white navigation lights.  This was not a satellite in low-earth-orbit transitioning from day to night.  We saw several of these pass into the eclipse of the Earth&rsquo;s shadow prior to this event and the object did not behave as if reflecting solar light.  Also, it would be abnormal for a satellite to orbit in this Southeast to North Northwest direction. There are four people that witnessed the event on this boat.  I am an experienced Airline Transport Pilot with 6000+ hours flying and have not witnessed anything similar prior to this.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be unusually sober-minded, and he seemed to be an excellent witness.

After watching it for a few seconds we noticed the lights were flashing non stop instead of twice and then a pause like a jet. We also noticed it was flying at a higher rate of speed, at first it was a long ways behind what was clearly a jet but it quickly caught up and zoomed past it. It then went behind trees so we couldn&apos;t see it. We came in my house and went to look out of an upstairs window (this took approximately 5 minutes) by the time we got to the window it was all the way across the sky. It flew in a zig zag pattern for awhile and moved over to the left side of the window.  We then noticed there was another identical object on the right side of the window.

We came over a hill in the Wells area and instantly noticed a bright white light just off to the left of the highway up around an estimated 1000 ft. It was hovering over a mostly rural area and we thought initially it may be a helicopter, but would seem somewhat out of place given the area. As we got closer we could see it had some very erratic, and bright, small square lights flashing in a bizarre linear sequence. It was unlike any aircraft lighting scheme I&apos;ve ever seen. The lights also didn&apos;t seem to illuminate (a very humid evening with much haze) as much as just shine brightly. As we passed it we could see three red lights on each tip of an isosceles triangle and could hear no noise of engine or rotors since we had all the windows down. The driver confirmed the lighting being on three corners and also concluded it wasn&apos;t a plane or helico! pter. Estimated to be the size of three fighter jets nose to nose. It was way to large to be a kite. No visible craft was seen but the lights did look attached and static compared to the rest that were visible.

I always explained to the stores that I had no idea what made the alarm go off.1 day I contacted TNO (Nature Science Research) in the Netherlands, asking them: why always when I enter a store the alarms go off. TNO explained to me that the alarms are triggered by electro magnetic forces. So I had to be charged with electro magnetic forces more than other people.After maybe 6 months the complaints disappeared but after looking some files about ufo&apos;s and electro magnetic forces I do now have an idea why I was electro magnetic charged.

On this particular night, I decided to ride in the van with the two maintenance men to the barge dock.  The road was straight as an arrow and not paved.  When we were about halfway back to the main complex, the maintenance man driving stopped the van.  I got out of the van from the passenger side and the other maintenance man sat in the van listening to the radio.As we talked, the other person suddenly said &quot;what in the hell  is that&quot;?   As I turned to see what he was talking about I saw nothing but stars and the outline of a mountain across the river.  It was a clear night but the moon was not visible.  Initially I saw some flashing stars on the horizon changing colors as they do when they are first visible.  I said &quot;What&quot;?  &quot;All I see are stars&quot;.  He said &quot;no&quot;!  &quot;To the right&quot; and pointed.  As I looked further to my right, I saw the large shadow coming straight toward us.  It was so large I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing.  It had no lights and was shaped like a perfect triangle.  It passed directly over our heads and disapeared over the horizon of a different mountain.  It had a flourescent appearance and shown a greyish black surface.  It made no nise except for a gliding sound coasting it seemed through the air.  The other maintenace man in the van jumped out at hearing our talking about the object and saw it briefly b! efore it disappeared over the horizon.  I felt weird and had chills over my entire body.  We were freaked out and decided we would tell no one because it would make us seem crazy.  As we started to get back into the van, we heard a noise and it was two military jets following the same path as the triangle.  As they passed over head they broke the sound barrier and the &quot;boom&quot; echoed across the valley.  It then dawned on both of us that the triangle and the jets had come from the direction of the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Al, about 30 miles away.

After dinner we laid out some blankets on the sand a few hundred yards away from the Pier. It was a quiet night despite some celebratory camp fires going on. As we laid back, looking at the stars, listening to the ocean, we noticed the two of the stars were moving back and forth and occasional they moved to the side but did so fairly quick. No sound came from these &quot;stars,&quot; but they did shine a tad brighter than the rest of the stationary stars they were around.

There was a helicopter and several airplanes overhead. Quite a few commercial. There was only one plane (non-commercial, I believe) that got close to these things and that&apos;s when they moved away from potential contact.About three weeks ago I did hear about these &quot;stars&quot; or UFO&apos;s posing as stars on Coast to Coast AM by a guy who lives in the desert that has been using high-beam light to signal them and they signal back and move-in when engaged.

Also, planes don&apos;t move this fast.I read a lot and watch a lot of programs on tv about this kind of stuff but I really can&apos;t explain this.I did have a camcorder with me so I could have got it on tape, but unfortunately I had no tapes on me.((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station flew over Woodbury at 00:28 hrs. on this date.  PD))", "Two large bright white lights appeared equidistant as travelling extremely fast maybe triangular craftOn the night of Saturday August 1 2009 at approximately 11:15 PM (give or take a few minutes, did not have a watch, but checked the time shortly before going out)my friend and I were leaving the apartment complex and as I was stepping away from the building towards the parking lot/driveway, I glanced up at the sky directly above and saw two large bright white lights which moved very quickly towards the west. I sensed whatever was behind it wanted us to see it.These lights were large round and very luminous, but it&apos;s light seemed as if it was contained behind something opaque, almost like frosted glass but allowing more of the light to shine through without the dazzling radiance I suspect really exists there. The sky that night was very overcast and I could see these lights through a seemingly thinner lower layer of clouds.These lights most likely were two stationary lights on the tail end of some unconventional type of craft as they were equidistant the whole time they travelled. It could possibly be the tail corners of a triangular craft, as I could not see any projection of anything beyond the light&apos;s edges.The lights were similar to light fixtures you see against walls or ceilings that are circular, round and protruding out from a flat surface looking like a deep plate/saucer or a bowl.So the lights were not globes or orbs. This left me with the impression of a triangle as I could only see a undefined darkness of some seemingly solid matter inbetween the lights and infront of them and it too was enshrouded in cloud as the round lights were. It did seem to me that the lights were at the back end of something, but that this &apos;something&apos; was cleverly cloaked!  Another possibility is that they are two separate vehicles of some sort that travel in &quot;synch&quot; or equidistantly somehow but that&apos;s not the sense I get from it.So my friend and I were exiting the backside of the complex which is facing East, and I was just saying how nice the weather was for the walk ahead, and as we turned the corner of the drive, we were now facing West. I was looking up to see what the sky was doing and out of my peripheral vision a brightness caught my eye. So I turned my head (North)to look directly at it, as it was coming from a point between North and East going toward South and West.The craft moved extremely fast from at least behind this complex to a fair amount of distance in the sky infront of this complex (but still within my view) within second/s.So just before the craft gets to the frontside of this complex, I said to my friend &quot;Did(or &apos;do&apos;) you see that?&quot; and they said &quot;No! See what?&quot;, and so I pointed to it and they stared totally dumbfounded as it was about to disappear from view. It was my friends first U.F.O./craft sighting,it was my third.There was one thing that intrigued me the most about this particular craft sighting and that is just before it disappeared out of view in the Western sky, it&apos;s previously very straight and smooth trajectory suddenly at that last split second in sight, turned kind of erratic looking, and almost wobbly! (This part is like a fraction of a second!) It seemed to my eye it veered a bit to the right a little sharply and suddenly, before zig-zagging the rest of the way out of sight! I asked my friend again if they had seen what I had seen and it was affirmative, we both had seen the same thing. I was somewhat surprised as it was not expected, but not shocked as I think my friend was, as it was a more common experience for me.", "bright starlike moving and stopingI have often seen satalites passing across the night sky, as on clear nights i do tend to stare a the stars a bit.On the night in question pearing out of my window in bed saw what at first thought was a satalite passing from the south then another followed very close from my point of view about a inch apart.as they passed over very slowley they started to shine quite brightly, abit amazed i got out of to move into another room where they were more visable still thinking satalites watched them pass over, then they started to slow to a stop staying in there same position. watched them slowly fade to nothing all of the other stars still perfectly clear i would just like to know if anyone has had the same experiance found it quite intresting.thanks ((name deleted))", "Round silver ball flying in the Netherlands.I went for a week to a monastir, in Oosterhout NB, The Netherlands, and while I was preparing my tent with my mother, I was looking in the sky.

But when I looked better I saw it didn&apos;t have wings. It was just a roud ball. I thought myself it was impossible for a round ball to fly. I was nailed to the ground and I kept looking to the object until it disappeared behind the monastir tower.It didn&apos;t make any noise, and it didn&apos;t left any traces.I realised that it could be nothing else than an UFO, also because I have seen many videos with the same object as the one I saw.", "It was highly illuminated and a trail of green color was seen behind it.

The object began to take the shape of a triangular craft, with flashing lights ( like airplanes), but they were ever-changing. 4 lights could be seen, blinking and flashing. 2 would blink, then the other two, then they&apos;d go dark and blink one after the other clockwise, with atleast 2 or 3 rotations per second. the object proceeded to zig zag across the sky, over me and kept going at an estimated altitude of between 8,000ft. to no more than 15,000ft. the color of te lights were neon green, blue, red, and white. it continued on until out of my sight, moving much to fast for an airplane.  No sonic boom or noise of jet engines was heard, no other planes in sight in the sky. It would travel a great distance in a straight line for a few seconds, then stop abruptly, move diagonaly from its previous course, and then spee! d up again.", "3 orange lights in sky over Smithville Lake, Missouri moving in unnatural flight patternMy husband and I were camping at Smithville Lake, Missouri at the Crow&rsquo;s Creek Park on July 25, 2009.  At around 10:45pm, for some reason, I looked up at the sky and noticed 3 orange lights in the sky.  They were in a triangle formation.  The light on the left point faded out.  The light on the right point started to slowly rise up towards the top point.  At this time, my husband got up and stood next to me.  I asked him if he was seeing what I was and he said yes.  We watched the left point rise until it passed the top point.  Then the top point faded out.  About a minute later, still rising, and brighter than before, the last point (which was on the right in the beginning) faded out.  We didn&rsquo;t see anything else the rest of the night.  The sky was clear and as we were at the lake, there were no city lights nearby and there are no commercial air routes over the lake.

It was not raining and the temperature was about 20 degrees Celsius.As I was walking to the parking garage, I look up and noticed a black cylinder shaped object that was crossing the sky in front of me (between a 45 and 50 degree angle upwards in the sky, traveling in a left to right (west to east) direction.  I wouldn&rsquo;t dare guess at its length but with my arm extended it would be about the width of my thumb.As I was watching it sunlight momentarily reflected off of it&rsquo;s surface for about 3 or 4 seconds then stopped, at which point I noticed it was rotating in a counter clockwise manner.  It resembled a cylinder in shape that appeared to have flat surfaces down the length of it (like a stop sign).  There were no wings, no propellers, no contrails, no markings or lights, and most importantly no sound of any kind!  At this point I thought it was maybe a satellite but determined that it couldn&rsquo;t be due to its low altitude.  Its trajectory was smooth (like a satellite in space) with a hint of intermittent acceleration within its forward motion; it definitely appeared to have no problem maintaining its altitude and velocity (which tells me it was not a falling satellite).Sunlight reflected off it again for a moment due to its counter clockwise rotation and by this time it is now to my right at about the two o&rsquo;clock position.  The reflection then stopped because this object was traveling underneath the cloud ceiling.  A few moments later it ultimately disappeared into the clouds themselves.", "Never revealed this before. Grounds-- GPL General Percision Labratory. I belive previously it was the Tommy Mansville estate. I believe they were working on lasers. There used to be danger signs of laser experimation on the windows of certain buildings. Was dusk one evening when myself and a friend of mine were walking through the property. The guards would always chase us of the property all the time. We looked out into a small field above a parking lot and observed some type of capsule. The closest thing I can recall it was like the Renaults of the time. Rounded corners like a little roller skate. We decided to investigate this. As we walked into the perimiter of the craft?we thought is was a car and could not figure out how this could have got into the field. About a hundred feet from the car we were shocked 2 find two people wxit the vehicle. I can only remember they were around 5 ft tall. When we saw the faces, just like the pictures I see on TV. Small with large heads and large eyes. We paniced and decided to run for the fences surrounding the property.

I was shooting  an outdoor sequence for an online video contest entry.  The footage was a shot of my hand picking up a brick, the camera was to follow the brick as I raised it up.  The shots were successful and I put the footage away for a while intending to work on it later. I have now finally gotten around to it.   It was Friday, July 18 when I finally started editing the footage together.  I was moving through it frame by frame, intending to do some motion tracking for the project.  That is when I noticed a streak cross the frame.  The object appeared distant and slightly obscured by a light cloud cover.  It moved across the screen in a slight upwards diagonal motion the entire sequence lasts only six frames.  However, upon reviewing the rest of my footage I found that there are more indistinct dark spots that cannot be explained, moving in various directions, they seem to be falling from the sky, then stopping, then moving sideways and in one case following each other .  Unfortunately, because the focus of my shots was on my activities all images are not in focus enough to tell what these objects were, but I cannot recognize any of them as being conventional aircraft.I do not know who to tell about this, who I should show this footage to.  Does anyone have any ideas, suggestions, information as to experts that can verify this footage as being real?  Truthfully I&apos;m very much surprised by the whole incident.

What I saw was a circular object in the sky approximately 200-250 feet above me.  There were strobe lights on the object.  The colors changed from red, green, yellow, purple, orange, blue.  There was a reddish colored ball hanging from the object.  It was traveling roughly 80-90 miles per hour heading west near Honolulu International Airport, and as you can tell from my description of the colors that were shown in the U.F.O.  This was not an aircraft.", "Dark, soundless triangle low in the sky, that had a solid light in each corner of the triangle.I was at the bottom of my street at a big intersection and I saw one bright light straight ahead. It was probably a few miles ahead, and it looked pretty low in the sky... It was a real cloudy and rainy night with lots of lightning. I pulled out my phone right when I saw it, and as I drove through the intersection I was getting closer and closer, but the light was so dim, and with the rain, it wouldn&rsquo;t show up on my phones camera... when I get to about 2 miles past the intersection, it was to the left of me&hellip; I look back at it and it wasn&rsquo;t one light anymore, it was 3 lights in an equilateral triangle.  I kept looking back at the road, back at the object.  Keep in mind, there was no blinking lights on this object at all.  I have never seen anything like this, and to be honest have never believed in UFO&rsquo;s at all.  At one point as I looked back at it, a flash of lightning hit, and I could very clearly see the object in the sky.  It was a big, dark equilatera! l triangle, with a solid light on each corner of the triangle.  Now, it was a dark rainy night, so it was hard to tell if the object was pretty small, and as close as it seemed, or if it was really way further away than I though, and a big structure.  All I know is that it was under the clouds, so this object was very low to the ground, lower than planes ever fly around that area.  I opened up my car window to see if I could hear it, because it was basically right on top of me.  The object was making no sound at all, and was moving very slowly and sneaky through the sky.  The road I was on was a highway type road, so I had to go way past it before I could get off an exit and make my way back towards it.  When I got back to the general area of the site, it was nowhere to be seen...  I&rsquo;m curious to know if anyone else has reported that from last night, it happened around 11 pm, and there were many cars on the road that I was on.  There is absolutely no way that I could have b! een the only person who saw it.  What an unbelievable site.  C! hanges m y whole perspective on UFO&rsquo;s and what is really going on in the sky.

I noticed a commercial airliner contrail headed WSW while taking the picture but paid it no attention.  When we got home I popped the camera card into the computer to tweak the light and contrast levels when I noticed a black dot on one of the pics that was facing west towards the foothills.  I zoomed in and noticed a black oval. I dismissed the possibility of it being a bird or plane because as you can see in the attached pics, the camera picked up cloud details nearby that are actually smaller than the object.  To me this indicates that at that level of magnification, wings would be seen if it was a plane or bird.  Additionally, if it was a blur of a bird in flight, there still would be areas of lighter or darker shades where light would reflect off wing, head, leg or abdomen surfaces no matter how blurred it may be.  There appears to be none of these as the object shows a consistent dark shade.  There does however appear to be an area of lighter shade along the top of the object, possibly implying sunlight reflecting off the top surface.  No other objects were noticed in any of the remaining pics and no other strange effects or events were noticed at the time.  I did not zoom in further in the supplied pics because any detail would just be lost in enlarged pixels.", "2 green lights fly by fast and vanishSo I&apos;m on my computer on facebook with a big window to me left which is facing south and I am right by the Ottawa river I look out and I see this object with 2 green lights on it that just flew by and vanished in the sky I know for a fact it was not a plane or jet of any type because I had full sight on it the whole was and it just vanished it was extremely quick also I didn&apos;t really get chance to see shape I would say it was circular based on the lights. It flew from aylmer towards the ottawa area. When I saw it I could not talk or move for at least 10 seconds then my eyes started watering.. pretty weird considering just last week an unidentified flying object crashed on the Ottawa river at the deschenes rapids which is right beside here.

The skies were cloudy and it was mostly dark.  I then noticed one single light in the sky.  At first it seemed very distant and I thought it was a star, planet or satellite.  Then it became brighter and seemed to be either over the bay or over the mountains on the other side of the bay.  Then the light seemed to pivot and become several lights right next to each other.  It could have been 4 or 5 lights.  My impression was that they were connected to a single oval shaped object but I can&rsquo;t be sure.  Each white light was equally bright.  I did not get the impression it was moving in terms of distance but spinning or pivoting.  I wondered if it could be an airplane but it was staying in one place and did not seem to have the same light pattern as an airplane.

It was luminous and steady, not moving at all, perfectly round and orange in color. At first I thought it might be a radio tower but there was none -- it appeared over a wide field out in the country. It seemed suspended in the air, not wavering, the orange light steady and unflickering. Excepting the moon, it appeared larger than any planet I&rsquo;d seen in the night sky and appeared to be northeast in the sky, judging from the position of the pavilion where we were located. Clouds moved in the sky BEHIND the object but the object was motionless. It was windy out -- light storms and rain had been moving in and out of the area that evening. We enjoy watching nature and had seen clouds drifting over the waning moon about a half hour before seeing the orb. I&rsquo;d say the height off the ground seemed to be about 15 stories or more -- about the height of a radio tower. It faded away after a few minutes but never moved fr! om the spot where we&rsquo;d first seen it (but it was in the sky when we first observed it&hellip; we did not observe it &ldquo;appear.&rdquo;)  We pointed the object out to a couple who were at the event with us.

After watching the object for approximately two minutes, the craft suddenly turned and disappeared.Another couple was standing near us.  They also saw the object.  We began to discuss the large, red, slow moving object in the distant sky.  We all agreed that it was not an airplane, helicopter or fireworks.Excited and amazed, the other couple told us that they had seen the same type of craft the night before, July 3rd, while visiting their son in Sultan, WA.  They had left their son&rsquo;s home in Sultan and observed two large, red, slow moving objects in the sky.  That night they called their son on a cell phone and he went outside to observe the two red lights in the sky.  They told us that the two lights moved slowly across the sky that night as well. However, they also moved up and down at different times and then disappeared.  This couple was shocked and surprised to see another red object in the sky the very next night.We estimate that the object was 7-8 miles from us at the time we saw it at about 10:15 PM.  It was approximately 3,000 feet high in the sky. Based on the distance away and the size of the object, we are convinced that the craft was incredibly large.  The shape was that of a big circle that had been slightly flattened. The edges of the object were not sharply defined, but somewhat irregular.", "A glowing orange light moves swiftly and clean, then dissapears.It was 11:28 pm on a Wednesday night.

I told my sister to try to record it on video on her cell phone. As she started recording I ran inside the house to grab my mother&rsquo;s video camera.

It went from the passenger side where I was to the drivers side behind us and then made a &quot;ding&quot;.  When I explain it, it probably sounds like something flew in a hit something.  My mom asked, &quot;Are you sure someone didn&apos;t shoot at you?&quot;  Not only is the highly unlikely but a bullet does not make that sound.  A bullet sounds like something cutting through the air, yes, but not like a weird lazer type sound effect.  And the strange ding at the end sounded like something hitting hollow metal...or tapping a glass with a spoon or something.

To me it was like a crazy sound wave cutting through the air with no object or anything just a crazy sound. Something you would hear in a Pink Floyd song.

Had this video on my DVR for over 1 yr., and it got erased by mistake.  When viewed on a high quality DVR you will have (62) frames of this UFO (3.5sec)   I&apos;M sure if you can get access to a DVD of this video you will be able to professionally observe and prove this object is a silver disk that shoots out of the water and changes direction like no terrestrial vehicle. In my opinion this silver disk accelerates from 100 or 200 mph to 1000 or 2000 mph in less than 1 sec.  Please do not dismiss this msg. I had been in contact with the president of your co. years ago. OK here is the link http://www.mtv.com/videos/the-duel-full-episode-ep-15/1549313/playlist.jhtml  Yes it is a reality TV show (Real world Road rules), this makes it much more reliable video with higher definition than any camcorder.  Please, Please review this video very carefully. The time frame is 4:25-4:28. You will see this vehicle accelerates so fast that it actually echos on the video, this isn&apos;t cause of the poor quality online, it happens in high quality DVR at (62 frames in 3 sec). the 1 disk echos up to 2 times in (1) frame, that is damn fast!!!((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC receives many reports about &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot; captured by television and movie cameras.

Too fast to be a plane, also the lights on the object were like nothing I&apos;ve seen before on any aircraft.  The object was slightly disk-like, but more substantial.  I would say more oval-shaped than anything.  The lights moved in a horizontal line across the object in a dotty pattern and changed colors from pinkish-red to light green to white.For a short time it was very close but it moved further away, still in our sights but not as clear.  As it moved, the first thing that occurred to me that was odd about the flying object was the sound.  It was completely silent except for when it was closer at first, but even then it didn&apos;t sound like any kind of engine at all.  All we heard was a soft whirring wind noise.  Also, its movements were eerie and very strange.  Not like anything I&apos;ve ever seen or heard of before.When it moved further away, it stopped traveling and started hovering in place.  The lights continued to revolve around itself in that dotty pattern and the only movement it made was a slow swinging from side to side.My friend and I were really weirded out and this point.  We kept trying to verbally convince ourselves that it was a plane or something of that nature, but it was becoming more and more obvious that it wasn&apos;t a plane at all.Then we both saw the object vanish into thin air without warning.  But almost a second later it reappeared in a new place directly to the left of its original spot.  We watched it do this several more times, disappearing and reappearing in new locations that were all relatively close together.  Its movements appeared very erratic, but effortless and swift at the same time.  Then the object started traveling towards us.  My friend and I were just staring at it, freaked out.  It looked like it was coming straight for us.  The object was rapidly growing larger in size as it closed the distance between us.  It was then that I noticed more things about the object.  There seemed to be a pinkish-purple haze surrounding it.  Also, the object didn&apos;t look remotely metallic or industrial.  It merely looked like an extremely dense concentration of energy in that oval-disky shape with the lights continuing to revolve around it.  I can&apos;t say for sure that the object even looked solid.  It was definitely substantial, but it looked to have formed out of a material that I couldn&apos;t begin to fathom, even now.It stopped midair and remained completely still for a long ten seconds.  At this time I could clearly make out its shape and the light patterns and color changes.  Then it shot directly over our heads to the left and traveled an insane measure of distance in about half of a second.  I wish I had a better sense of distance so I could be more accurate about this...  Anyway, at this time both my friend and I were convinced that this was something not of this world.  The movement was like no manmade aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen.  The movement was precise and liquid and smooth when it traveled that fast.  Also, there was no sound.  A plane, number one: could not have gone that fast, and number two: would have made a very loud noise when it was that close to us.It then hovered in the left section of the sky, repeated the same swinging movements from before.  It was slowly moving further away.  My friend and I watched it for a little while longer until it disappeared from sight for good.Needless to say,  I really regret not having a decent camera function on my phone.", "London Jul 12th 2009 13:00 black cylinderWent outside to have a cigarette just before the F1 grand prix started on TV.  Object came over the rooftop to my south, travelling west to east, constant speed, black non reflective cylinder (drum proportions), long length vertical.

After arriving home, we saw an unidentified object in the photo, which was not seen when taking the picture.

I have hundreds now with red, blue, green, yellow, orange, grey, really all colors of light balls in then and in many different shapes. Some of them appear like an orb but they all seem to have a black hole in them. Some then are single, some grouped in 2 or more.  On some of the objects you can see a precise ring of lights.  There is no question looking at my pictures what I am getting in the sky every night.  Last night I started seeing them as the flash went off.  They were in my face and all around me.

The aircraft did not posess normal characteristics.I have never experienced an incident in which the sight of something unfamiliar in the sky has compelled me to believe it to be foreign to Earth. However, I do seriously entertain the idea that there is intelligent life elsewhere in the vast depths of space, albeit with a small dose of skepticism. I do not want to jump to the conclusion that what I just encountered was truly an alien aircraft, but it&apos;s behavior puzzled me.At around 18:40 PM on Tuesday, August 18th of 2009, I was at work and decided to take a break for a cigarette. I was seated on the loading dock, facing south, when something in the sky caught my eye. The sky was very clear, almost cloudless, and I distinctly saw a white shape, which I first believed to be a normal commercial airplane, traveling west. After further inspection I realized that the object did not resemble any airplane I had seen before, as it had no markings on it. It also didn&apos;t have any distinct shading, by that I mean to say that I could not concretely identify any appendages that would normally be visible, such as the wings. It was also traveling at a higher speed than a plane like that normally seems to move.It was quite far away, and I do not have the best eyesight. I could not hear the roar of any engine, but that is most likely due to the distance. Also, there was no cloudy trail left behind in the craft&apos;s wake. While I was still inspecting the object, keeping it in my line of sight, it vanished. I got off the loading dock so I could have a better view of sky above me and searched for the object, but I could not find it.", "Two blue-green smokey streaks of light forming large boomerang shape shot across about 50 feet above the road.

I could not make out the general shape of the object, but did observe that it had one large red light, and a smaller orange light next to, and seemingly behind, the red one. The object executed a shallow turn, gradually heading south. It suddenly appeared to stop, and hovered for several seconds. About this time, an identical object came from same direction, following a seemingly identical flight path. It also stopped, and hovered slightly behind the first object. After it began to hover, a third identical object came into view, and fell into formation behind the previous two.The three objects hovered in what I can only describe as a loose crescent formation, for at least 30 seconds. Shortly after the appearance of the 3rd object, I stuck my head in the apartment and told my roommate they should come and see this. They came outside, and witnessed a good deal of the event.Sometime after the 30 second mark, the first object floated upwards and disappeared. Following this, the remaining objects moved closer together, and almost seemed to touch one another. They then separated, hovered for a few more seconds, and finally drifted upwards and disappeared as well.I would estimate the entire event, from the appearance of the first object to the disappearance of the latter two, was about 90 seconds to 2 minutes in duration. Though, frankly, it&apos;s difficult to say as I was more than a little surprised to be seeing this, and thus wasn&apos;t paying attention to the time.These clearly were not fireworks of any kind. Also, the lights on these objects were not consistent with what I&apos;ve witnessed on traditional aircraft. There was no white/clear light, and none of the lights on the objects blinked or flashed at any time. They were also silent, and seemed to have a slight &quot;wiggle&quot; in their movements. There&apos;s a lot of air traffic in my area, so I see planes and helicopters every day. I feel safe in saying these objects were very odd, in both their behavior and appearance.Please feel free to contact me if you need any further information.", "A silver-lined diamond shaped object that folded in on itself and disappeared on July 16, 2009.On the afternoon of July 16, 2009 I saw in a field just on the outskirts of Hermann, Missouri, a diamond shaped-silver lined UFO in a field.  It seemed to have images within it and for some reason I immediately thought I could see another dimension.I told my 15-year-old son to look but before he could focus on it, it folded in on itself and disappeared. Oddly, the next day, I woke up from an afternoon nap and couldn&rsquo;t move. After over an hour I could start to move, but am still having problems with walking, etc. All kinds of tests have been done with no answers.

I walked outside on my patio early that morning and looked up at the stars in the clear predawn sky.  I turned my head to the left and at that moment I noticed a bright light, maybe twice the size of Venus.  The light appeared to be moving right at me even though very high up and it seems that as it noticed that I was looking straight at it, it then began to move backwards and then to go up even higher until it finally became non-visible.So many thoughts went through my head at a rapid speed regarding what I might have thought this thing to be as I was looking at it.  I knew that it couldn&rsquo;t be a satellite because it was just too bright and because of the way that it had just suddenly reversed itself and went straight up till it disappeared.  I have never seen satellites behave that way.  There were no running lights, no port or starboard lights on what I was seeing.  It was just a big ball of light.  The light also seemed to be sort of flickering at the center.  I say flicker, but I mean that it was more like if one were to take some crinkled tin foil and move it around in the hand just slightly so that it throws light reflections around.There actually was a car going by at exactly the same time that I saw this light in the sky.  I remember thinking as it happened that the lights on this car could be reflecting on something and causing this light in the sky, but quickly dismissed that idea since the car was down below me and on the street behind my apartment, which is on the second level, and the bright light I saw in the sky seemed too high up to be a reflection from anything on the ground.This sighting affected me in a very unfamiliar way.  I feel that my reaction to it was very instinctual and quick. I became very afraid as I stood there watching it move up into non-visibility.  I think the hair on my arms stood up and that it made my skin crawl.  The one thing that really got to me was that I felt this light was being stealthy and creeping in on me and when I turned my head to look at it, it just backed away, as though it knew that I was looking at it and sort of catching it in the act.  I felt like a frightened animal, or a cornered animal.  I then just gave up on watching it disappear and bolted back inside.

Altitude approx 8800ft. GPS Coordinates are 37&rsquo; 10.216N and 106&rsquo; 26.579W. My wife and I were camped out in the national forest campground.  We were walking in the campground at approx 8:30PM.  Due the the canyon depth the sun is gone quite early.  However the stars were out and you could easily see the Milky Way and Venus just south of overhead.  The area is quite forested but I looked straight up and saw a bright white light approx 2x the brightness of Venus.  It was traveling west to east at high rate of speed but jerkily veering slightly north and south with each jerk.  It was gone over eastern canyon wall in approx. 20 seconds.  It dimmed slightly as it moved east.  I assumed that is was quite high and still reflecting sunlight.  But that is only an assumption.  We asked a gentleman also in the campground the next morning and he had seen it too.  But he saw as it came over the west canyon wall and till about straight up when he lost it due to the trees.  There was no sound following as you would expect.  It was not a satellite, as we had watched one from north to south only a few minutes before.  Its as also silent (of course) but moved at about half the speed and much dimmer.  It&rsquo;s path was smooth and steady as opposed the jerky slightly side to side movements of the light we are reporting. It did not move as fast as a meteor and it&rsquo;s movement was erratic rather than steady.", "Four balls of light over NCI was sitting in my kitchen in April one night when I got a cell phone call from my mom (in the front yard) telling me she was watching something weird in the sky. Skeptical at best, and a little annoyed because it was cold, I went down to our driveway where she was standing beside our truck, which was still running. She pointed out a tiny light quite a distance off, and after watching it for a minute or two and seeing it was moving too slowly for a plane, I began taping it on my cell. The phone didn&rsquo;t have a very good camera, and couldn&rsquo;t zoom in enough to record the light, but it caught what was going on.Then another light appeared, and my mom cut the truck off and called my dad. Both lights were moving directly toward each other, and when they crossed paths, they seemed to twitch and spin around one another and then fade out. That was about when I couldn&rsquo;t record anymore because my annoying little phone ran out of storage space. Before long, another light appeared, and then another, from different directions than the first two, (by now my dad was outside with us in his underwear muttering about how they were just planes) and they did the exact same thing as the first: meeting up, spinning around each other, and fading out not long after.By definition, they were UFOs. Past that I don&rsquo;t know what they were. But planes fly over our house pretty frequently, and they don&rsquo;t spin around each other or fade out. These lights were white at first, but would change briefly to red or orange, like a star. They were far away and high up, I can&rsquo;t say how far though. Both my parents were skeptical- my dad&rsquo;s not a big believer in UFO&rsquo;s and such, and my mom basically doesn&rsquo;t care.

At about 10:30 pm,as we packed up to leave we noticed a bright colored gold object in the distance.  We thought that it was another model airplane so we decided to drive closer to it and watch it.  As we headed closer to the origin we could see that it was not a model airplane.  It was cigar in shape and hoovered approximately 20 feet above the almond orchards.  We were not the only ones that saw it.  We exited on the Hammet Ave exit and there were plenty of other cars on the overpass that were braking to watch these strange lights.  We then decided to chase it down.  This is an area filled with nothing but almond orchards.  It took us awhile but we finally made it to the general area.

I grabbed my remote when I realized I was hearing what sounded like either a rolling thunder or and aircraft.  I live on the second floor and my window was open two away from me.  The volume on my tv returned but I was puzzled because I was unsure where the sound was coming from.I turned the volume on my tv down to mute to verify what I was hearing not from the tv. The sound continued. It had been a clear day so thunder I thought was unlikely. The sound still persist, by this time at least 2 minutes had passed since my tv volume had first been interrupted. Out of curiosity I walked over to the window and there it was.The craft was ascending into the air very very slowly. It was not very high in the air, I would say maybe the height of a police helicopter. But I know it wasn&apos;t a copter for at least two reasons; 1.  There was no helicopter sound which I am very familiar with having grew up in the inner city and currently living within a mile of a police station.   2.  The lights on the craft where not at all like the typical search light you see on police helicopters. I am pretty certain that it was circular shape/disk shape. Although it did not seem thin or flat disk, it was thick or tall but it was more wide than tall by far. It seemed black or dark and it&apos;s figure was more of a shadow or outline. It had three very dark lights on it. There were two red lights on each end and on the left side just near the red light there was a blinking yellow light. I must stress that the lights were very clear and very bright! I followed the craft rising in the sky with my eyes until it went out of my line of sight through my window pane. I wanted to run down stairs an continue watching but I was in my undergarments. The sound which was jet and thunder like continued to persist. I scrabbed to my bedroom to find something to pit on, but by the time I reached the stairs the sound had ended. What I thought was strange about the sound was that it was quite powerful and was clearly being generated from this vessel however the craft itself was moving very very slow.I immediately sought out this web site because I am convinced that what I saw was an UFO. I live in the city I am used to seeing airplanes and helicopters, and even those small planes that advertise signs and blimps. This was certaintly not a craft I am familar with.

I quickly realized that these in coming objects were bright red/orange and followed the same flight path... I called for my wife and a few neighbors to witness this sighting.  WE all gathered and watched the orange/red spheres move across the sky almost like they were moving in our direction.  If they had continued across the sky I could of thought of a few possible explainations for the occurence but they didnt... they stopped.  One by one, 4 of them arriving at first.  One stopped sharply and held its position while another went up and stopped and another dropped lower to its position.  The last of the 4 went straight up and stopped.  It was still really calm out and there wasnt a sound to be heard and were all used to airplanes &amp; h! elicopters flying over us, this wasnt the case this time.  All 4 UFO&apos;s held that position for at least 5 mins until 2 more red/orange spheres appeared from the same North Eastern direction as the other 4... and joined them by finding there position in what seemed to me to be a flight formation.  All 6 spheres held that position for at least 10 mins as we watched them all slow pull away out of the atmosphere until them looked just like stars... then disappeared.

After I shot the first picture of the balloon I noticed (through the view finder) a small white object moving rapidly from left to right within the view finder.  I quickly tried to take a second photograph of the object but was unable to as it vanished before I could focus on it accurately.However, when I came upstairs and uploaded all of the images I had taken into my computer I noticed that the second picture I took of the helium balloon had the strange white object within its frame.  I couldn&rsquo;t help (and still can&rsquo;t help) but wonder what the object could have been, as it flew very quickly and completely silently before it disappeared.

It then Sped up and headed more southeast dimming then disappearing into my horizon.I would estimate the object was at 10 to 15 thousand feet in the air. This light had no strobes and was clearly not a commercial or known military plane, nor do I feel it was a meteor. I know this because of my background in A &amp; P and the fact that the object quickly surpassed a commercial aircraft that was over 30,000 feet in the air (with the usual strobes).

They were probably no more than 30,000 feet. They would fly as if gravity didn&rsquo;t matter.They were directly south of us almost the entire time, almost as if they were going along with us.

The craft moved in a climbing pattern to the right over about a 15 minute time period and then we watched it get smaller and smaller as we could tell it was leaving but it was leaving directly away from us, we lost visual as the huge bright light (still immensely bright even with the sun rising) became a speck in the upper outer atmosphere.. The other odd thing about this sighting (not sure if it is related but I feel worth noting) was that the whole time there was a glowing orange light off to the left that we thought might have been a neighbors light (even though it DID seem closer than the nearest neighbor..) but we haven&apos;t seen it since that morning.", "Ufo in Preston, MoMy wife and I were driving towards Fristoe, Mo. We noticed an orange fire like streak cross the sky and break up into parts. It then seemed to fizz out. We thought it may have been fireworks or a meteor. About 10 to 20 seconds later we then noticed another one in the distance and we could make out many planes in the sky. As my wife drove I continued to watch the sky. My wife noticed a white light in the distance off the side of the road. As we approached it looked like a white box of sorts about the size of a small house in the sky (about 250 feet?) with square compartments. It flashed slowly on and off and wasn&apos;t very bright emmiting a white light. At first I thought it was a radio tower until I noticed it was at the center of a huge football field sized triangle. It seems strange that I wouldn&apos;t notice something that large in the sky but it was just a tad darker than the sky and honestly not very noticeable. At each point was a white &quot;star colored&quot; light. ! These lights were also about as bright as stars. They all flashed in unison. As we drove by it seemed as if we were almost under the object and its depth or height was impossible to determine as were features on the triangle. It just seemed like a large black mass that blocked out the stars. The white box also remained centered in the middle of the triangle so I am fairly confident it was all one object. Amazed and unable to look away I noticed more lights very similar to the ones at the points that seemed to crackle all of a sudden flashing on and off quickly at random points around the perimeter of the object. This lasted about 3 seconds and then stopped. The object just hovered motionless with no noise. We couldn&apos;t pull over because the shoulder was pretty short, and a vehicle was close to our bumper. My son was also a witness to this. We passed a bend in the road and lost sight of it after we passed. As we approached Preston we noticed 2 or 3 more of those fire streaks ! far in the distance.  We then pulled into a gas station in Pre! ston to calm ourselves and discuss what happened. All activity in the skies ceased at this point.(There are only about 2 gas stations in Preston.) I hope there were more witnesses it was amazing.", "Bright light shooting across the skyI woke up around 0430 in the morning due to the fact that I couldnt sleep because of the wind blowing outside. I went to look out the window and see how the weather was for the day. It was still pitch black out with a medium overcast outside due to the rain. I couldnt see any stars, just the street light in the distance flickering. All of a sudden I saw a bright light streak across the sky almost as if a shooting star but it was going straight and not downwards. The light looked almost like a rocket shooting across the sky. It was oval shaped and brighter than anything I have ever seen in the sky.It had a short trail behind it, but again nothing like a shooting star.

That lasted for at least 30 seconds. I said to my daugther, wholly crap, did you see that star. and she did see it.  I told her to get her dad, he had to see this.She didn&apos;t get him because the star and beam of light disappered. There was only one star left after that.

There was no evident body of any aircraft supporting this light.

While sitting outside by the fire and watching the sky I notice two lights moving from west to east. Initially I believed these were aircraft. As a few minutes passed and the objects came closer, my first thought was why no flashing marking lights? Dismissing the thought due to possible observation angles and possibly seeing only the front I waited until they came directly in front of us and then began to seriously consider something wasn&rsquo;t right. The objects were far too close to each other and secondly didn&rsquo;t make a sound. The ridge above us was around an elevation of 6500 ft, the objects were no more than 200 to 300 feet about the ridge line. (Less than 1000 feet above our location) Never at any angle was there a sound or any flash of strobes. The proximity of the two objects defies any commercial control and the speed was t! oo slow for any military AC to my knowledge.

It passed underneath it and disappeared.  What I find amazing is that the star it passed under was no longer there thirty minutes later.

It stopped for a while before moving up and disappeared in the pale blue dusk sky.I&rsquo;m reporting from Mauritius. I was driving back home from work. The sky was clear except for few passing isolated clouds. It was almost dusk. While driving I saw an unusually orange light. The time was 18:40 and it was not completely dark. The intensity of the light, its color, its size (too big to be a commercial airplane) were the reasons that attracted my attention.I slowed the car and continued to follow the light while driving. It was flying to the south and seemed to be growing bigger. At that moment I thought that it must be a commercial plane or a helicopter but still the shape, color, size and intensity of this orange light puzzled me. I stopped the car as I wanted to see the shape of this unusual aircraft as it was almost flying above me by then. But despite the proximity it was with me I could not distinguish any shape behind the light. I would estimate the height of the object at that moment to be about 700m high.At that moment the flying object stopped, which made me believe that it was a helicopter but again strangely I could not see the shape not hear the sound of a helicopter.

They were not Chinese lanterns because they came down from the atmosphere then projected back up.

When I first saw them my first feeling was of terr! or because I had no explanation for what it was then I was hop! ing alie ns were not preparing to invade Earth. It made me very nervous. Three of my friends and myself that were witness to the encounter work in the aerospace industry and have never seen anything like it before. The ages of the witnesses are from 25 to 55. I have searched &apos;Orange balls of light&quot; on YouTube and have seen different various videos of exactly what we saw in Chicago but filmed all over the world. The night we saw them there were at least 6 to 7 objects in the sky total.", "Star-like, color changing triangle shape objectMy outside dog began barking around 0130 am as he has done the last couple nights, which is unusual for him. Determined to find out what was causing this commotion I began looking out my windows. I saw what appeared to be a blinking &quot;star&quot; at first. Then it began to change shape like a white inner ball with intermittent red and blue lights forming a triangle around it. I woke up my son to see this object. It moved gracefully up and down and from side to side. I put new batteries in my digital camera and went out on the porch to try and photograph it. Snapped one shot not catching the object and the camera flashed the battery symbol and went off.Then is when I noticed what appeared o be two lights on the bottom of the object. My cell phone camera would not pick up the object. My inside cat and dog were going crazy! We watched this for over 25 minutes and then I went to get my husbands binoculars and when I found them and came back to the window it was gone. T! here was no noise at all; the whole time. Then my pets went back to normal and I watched the rest of the night but seen nothing else.", "One fiery ball that grew into a crescent shape, then an apparent battle between 2 jets and a small craft.On the night in question, I was hiking on the Gainesville-Hawthorne Trail, a greenway that runs south of Gainesville east towards Hawthorne. I don&apos;t remember the exact date or time unfortunately at this point, but I do remember the sighting occured at the tail end of dusk, when stars were beginning to pop into the sky. As I was climbing a hill on the trail, I looked up to see some of the stars and planets coming out. This was almost directly east, as the trail in that section runs that way. As I glanced at some directly in front of me and straight down the trail, I noticed what appeared to be an explosion in the sky, in my peripheral vision, about 10-20 degrees to my right. The moon was in the sky, I think about 3/4 full, and it was a further ten or so degrees to the right. The object I saw was about a quarter of the moons diameter, I would reckon. The object, or the explosion, seemed to grow, or shift, at first, but then held a circular shape for about 5-10! seconds. After this time, &quot;wings&quot; seemed to grow or appear out of the top and bottom, again seemingly on fire, with many colors and stange flashes continuing within the &quot;fire.&quot; The wings formed with the original ball a crescent shape. If I had to guess its size, based on the distance I think it was from me, I would say 300-500 feet in length, from wing tip to wing tip. I don&apos;t quite remember exactly how the explosion/object/craft disappeared, just that it seemed to quite quickly. This particular object I saw in the sky for about twenty seconds in totality. After the above object disappeared, I saw a second event about one or two seconds after, and about three degrees to the left in the sky. Two lights, which seemed to be obvious jets of human design, were flying quite fast in what I would consider to be combat manuevers. Working seemingly in concert they both were performing roll after roll, never stopping turning, and seemingly at full speed. The distance from me to them was great enough that I could not hear them, but despite the many turns, they were moving left across my vision, that is north, at a good clip. As I watched them in wonder, for as I said I noticed them first directly after and adjacent to the strange object above, I noticed a much smaller light, so small I didn&apos;t see it at first. This light appeared to be a tiny craft, and it was flying in between the two jets, seemingly dodging or fighting with them. For all intents and purposes, it appeared what I was watching was a battle. This battle continued and ran, as! I said above, left and north across my vision. I was only halfway up a hill while watching all this, and the craft, all three of them, slipped behind some trees. I ran the rest of the way up the hill to try to see the encounter, but I never saw anything strange again that night, or since.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Became brighter.  &quot;Winked out&quot;,While relaxing and sitting on the outside rear deck of our home, the sun was setting due west, I was looking towards the eastern horizon.  The sky was clear and I was enjoying the perfect evening and talking with my wife and at that moment I noticed a bright star or I thought was a star, moving very slowly up the eastern horizon.  As I continued to track its rise to a viewing angle of just about over our heads, tracking east to west, I tried to fix its position with the top of our table umbrella support to make sure it was not my head movement that was causing me to think it was a false sighting.  I wanted to confirm what I was seeing.   At that very moment the very bright yellow glow, stopped moving completely and remained very bright.I confirmed its position again and at the same time it moved from a stopped, motionless position and then moved left of its east to west track by 5 degrees, stopped again, and then moved 5 degrees to the right.  Tracking its rise from east to west, stopped over our heads, glowing, then moving north and then south and then moving back to where it&rsquo;s original stopped position.At that point the glowing object, very round, got brighter and then it started to dim.  At that moment it produced 8 bright lights at its edges, aimed right at us and then &quot;winked out.&quot;   Absolutely no sound or noise of any kind.  Very, very high altitude.

Ironically, when all the people were looking up at it, I was getting out my camera, and as soon as I turned it on, it had began to fade away.The craft was a bit higher than a normal plane would be, although the shadow stretched far down, but not nearly far enough to reach the ground.((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

I pulled them away from my eyes thinking an owl must have flown by, since I heard no sound of a plane.  Nothing seen. I put the binoculars back to my eyes and floating in front of the moon was a giant V shaped object.  Not as sharp as a V but not as curved as a boomerang.  It was slowly moving, more like floating toward the small Thun airfield to the north.  It was barely above the 75 foot evergreen trees on the west and north sides of my 1/4 acre and was directly over my house and barely moving.  The thing was giant.  I would guess 3 football field lengths per wing.  No body, no windows, no vapor trail, no noise at all.  Just a giant V with the faintest of white night lights all along the top of the V, in a straight line.  It was almost see through and nearly invisible to the naked eye.

I had been relaxing and just watching the sky. I noticed a bright circular light coming from the North-West area as I was able to view it as it peaked over my house off in the distance. Normally I see air traffic (lots of airplanes) coming in from the north but this one was coming from a different area and look nothing like the other lights. This light was about 3 times brighter and bigger than the planes I usually see and not once did it blink. At first it was really bright but then it dimmed a bit. I thought I was looking at a plane at first but then as it dimmed it looked as if it were really high and I began to think it was a satellite. Almost immediately after that thought the light became very bright and was bigger than when I first spotted it. I immediately called my wife outside to see it as to see if maybe she could make out what it is. When my wife came! outside the circular light was just about overhead roughly 85 degrees above the horizon line. The object was very close and bright but made no sound as it traveled quickly through the sky. It took about 1 minute to go from when I spotted it peaking out from behind my house off in the NW distance to far off in the South East. When the light was far in the South East area my wife and I noticed the light became much brighter and a bit bigger than before, taking on more of an oval shape.

It was clearly a light, not a star, and looked to be the size of a large spotlight with one primary beam coming down.  However, it was partially obscured behind a house, so I did not at first see that, while there was only one &ldquo;light&rdquo;, there were in fact two beams coming down.  Also, this light was extremely high in the sky; this was clear by the fact that the length of the light beams, despite coming from an intensely bright light, ended far, far above the ground, what looked like miles from our perspective.  Nothing on the ground was therefore illuminated.  As soon as I rounded the bend and saw these beams, they immediately began to disappear in a strange manner.  Rather than getting smaller and smaller as they ascended, the brightness diminished in a nanosecond; what was left was the &ldquo;after light&rdquo;.  It appeared that the light had perhaps disappeared behind a cloud; however, the night seemed to ! be cloudless, based on the fact that stars were visible (although, due to the density of ground light, there were not many of them).  The &ldquo;after light&rdquo; lasted several seconds as it got dimmer and dimmer; it was clear that the &ldquo;lights&rdquo; had not been turned off, rather, that whatever they were attached to was ascending rapidly in the sky.

Myself and another county employee were standing outside having a smoke and talking,  facing north, toward the Ocala National Forest just across the highway from the road camp grounds.As we were standing there, we both noticed a brilliant white light appearing over the treeline to the north, possibly a quarter mile off.  The light was streaking along almost due south in a perfectly straight line, emitting no sound at all, and trailing a perfectly formed &apos;tail&apos; that faded out in a very even, regular manner perhaps 70 feet behind the head.  It appeared to be no more than 200 feet up, yet it did not seem to illuminate the pine trees below it at first, then there were no trees for us to gauge by in the mid-part of the flight.The visible portion of the sky, to us, was perhaps a mile and a quarter from the northern edge of the clearing we were in to the southern, and this object crossed that entire space in the space of 8 to 10 heartbeats, though we did not count it off while it happened.  We arrived at that number after comparing notes immediately afterward, when we were trying to comprehend whatever it was we had seen.  I do not know where that employee is, I actually only knew his first name, and that he was a heavy equipment operator for the County.It should be noted that the Ocala Nat&apos;l Forest starts just on the northern side of SR 44 and continues northward for about 50 miles, with an average width of 30 miles, and has no paved roads traversing it E to W for the first 25 miles.  There are a number of fire roads through it, and they are used by people who have cabins on the Wekiva River.Which leads me to the second half of this sighting.  Fast forward to 1995, I have a lawn care business in the Orlando area, and one day I get to talking with a customer, an old school friend of my mother&apos;s, and I tell him about that night in late 1974 in rural Volusia County.  I share this with him because he was one of the lease holders for a cabin in the National Forest down by the river, and we had gone up to it to clear brush away in preparation for fire season.After hearing when my encounter had occured, he shared an encounter with me from about that same time, though I think his was in October of 1974.  He and his family, wife and 3 kids, about 12 to 15 years old, were driving back up to the cabin over the rough dirt fire roads after having had dinner in DeLand that evening, when one of his kids almost screamed that there was something in the air over the car and behind a little way, keeping pace with them.  All 3 kids saw it through the rear window, though he and his wife did not.  He stated that it was with them for perhaps 30 seconds, and there was no mechanical failure or engine stalling during that time.  I asked him specifically, as by this time I had read a good deal about UFO&apos;s and knew that was one of the things that oftentimes accompanies near sightings.  I do know where this man is still, and can put you in touch with him if you like, but he&apos;s getting up in years now,  nearing 80, I would guess.What ties these two together is the year and time of year, and the fact that his cabin is only 1.5 miles away from my sighting as the crow flies, a little farther if you follow the river.  Also, the Ocala Nat&apos;l Forest plays a large, mute part in it, as I see it.  The area covered by it is vast, varied in land type, and largely inaccessible to anything but the most hardcore campers or hikers.

The dull light ball made pulsating light circles which grew in diameter. In the centre appeared a small bright light like a star which started to glow brightly and it grew and also the pulsating light circles continued. The bright light grew and shrunk about 4 times then the light took off in a northerly direction.", "triangle shapes hovering over Kezar Lake at sunset.Myself and 4 others were on top if a mountain watching the sun set.  Over Kezar Lake we noticed two triangular very dark shapes literally hovering like a kit in the wind.  However, these objects were several hundreds of feet in the air.  One of the black shapes went left about 30 yards a literally dissipated right in front of our eyes.  The second object still hovering did the exact same thing in a slightly different direction.  We all literally watched the second object in motion go from solid mass into a light grey partially see through and then gone right before our very eyes.Has anyone else seen this before?", "20/09/2009 18.45  Mulbarton, England. 2 glowing orbs very close in silence.  Rose verticallyAt approximately 1835 hrs I was contacted by my mother asking if I had seen the colourful light in the sky.  I went outside but nothing could be seen, however I decided to sit out for a while  At approx 1845 two Orbs of light rose from behind the nearby houses.  One was distinctly ahead of the other. I would say these objects were no more than half a mile away if that, perhaps even a few hundred metres. They rose in the western sky.The lead UFO rose quicker than the other but extremely gracefully, heading toward my direction. Instantly I knew what I was seeing, this was no ordinary craft.  Suddenly to my amazement the lead craft stopped dead in mid air! It then backtracked for a second or two, then it rose directly vertically approx 200 &ndash; 500 metres again stopping dead.  There was absolutely no noise whatsoever and we live in silence in Mulbarton.  It appeared the lead craft was almost waiting for the other which as it came within 50 metres both craft headed off into the distance rising up eventually through the clouds.The best description of the ufos is as follows.The lead craft was slightly brighter than the first.Each was a colour that I will describe as orange, however they were more than that As they were so close at one stage I could see that they were made up of many merging colours that radiated outward. They were obviously emitting an extreme energy but in total silence. I would also say that gravity did not appear to affect them. They left no vapour trail.As they rose from such a very low level I believe it possible that they may of actually been on the ground nearby. I live very close to a very wooded area surrounded by fields.My wife is the biggest alien doubter of all time, however at the first sighting I shouted through our kitchen window to her to come quick. She to saw them and was amazed at what she was seeing.These were defiantly ufos, no doubt whatsoever. They were not aircraft with lights on head on. There is only one Venus, which was clearly visible anyhow. Also Venus is further away than a few hundred yards. And Chinese Lanterns is laughable.My biggest regret is that I could not video the event.  I believe the video would have been the utmost confirmation of the existence of ufos ever.  Nothing on Earth is coloured like that. Nothing can stop dead in the sky. Nothing floats like that in total silence.  These were real and I just want everyone to know it.", "Extremely fast light in low sky.We were driving home when a light shot over us and was gone in a second.  It was approximately 50-100 yards above the top of the trees and power lines. The only thing that comes to mind is a jet of some kind, but it was extremely too low to be a jet.  It moved as quickly as a shooting star but extremly bright and low.  About 3 minutes before, we saw a jumper plane overhead that was going towards FT Benning.  Would love to know what it was.", "One object with two white lights, one red and one blue light hovering without sound about 300 - 400 feet in the air.My husband was driving.  I was in the front passenger seat and my mother-in-law and daughters were in the back.  I first noticed two white lights in the sky about 300 - 400 feet up.  My first thought was that it was a small plane or helicopter.  As we drove towards it, I pointed it out to my husband who now also saw it.  It was dark and there was some cloud coverage.  As we got closer, we noticed that there were 2 white lights that appeared to be in upper corners.  On the bottom there was a red light and a blue light.  The object appeared to be hovering.  It did not move as we drove past and I did not hear any noise other than our own vehicle.  I would estimate that it was about 300 feet to the right of the road.  It appeared to be bigger than a helicopter based on the distance between the lights, but no bigger than maybe two put together. We continued driving home about 2 miles, dropped off my mother-in-law and daughters and then drove back.  We did not see! anything, so we continued to drive in the direction we first came.  There were no lights in the sky at this time in any direction.

I had gotten my dad earlier because i thought i saw something moving, but this time i got his camera from him to see if anything showed up. thats when i got a big suprise ! there was something in the sky. in fact right over the other side of the lake ! there was 2 to the left one in the middle, and 4 to the right all hovering way above the other side of the lake, and they were different shapes, one was cigar shaped, one was a triangle, one was just a ball, and the other was a sphere. I started to film then moving about the sky, and a bit later every one from my family came to see, my brother, dad, and mom. i continuted filming and got a couple good pictures, plus 20 + of film, by then it was just me and my mom, and thats when we heard a loud sound, it sounded like air being moved or a loud jet, and we looked up, there was a triangler shaped ufo with 3 lights going right over are cottage about 50 feet up, it was pretty crazy ! after that i got my d40 out, and got 2 really good pictures one were you can see 2 weird lights, and one were you can see 3 lights and make out the shape. that was all for that night. 2 days later though i was by myself and i heard the same loud jet sound and a red flashing light came down to tree level and started skimming the edge of the lake as if it was looking for something, this time i was freaked out and booked it back inside the cottage.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

On Saturday night/Sunday morning - Aug 23d 2009, I awoke around 3 AM and saw strange bright lights out the window.  There was a light to medium steady rain that night.I awoke my wife and we went outside on the deck where we both observed 2 very bright orbs of light (or fireballs as they are called on this site) that were visible over both the water and beach in the area near and around Briggs March and Warren point.The balls of light did not seem to be attached to any craft or structure, they were large and bright whitish-blue colored (almost halogen-like), they made no noise and emitted no beams.At first I thought they were car headlights on Warren point because they moved together in parallel and they were very close to the ground (if not on the ground), but then they rose into the air and separated.  They were also too large to be headlights.  They made figure eights in the air and moved in many directions, they stayed generally close together as they moved but did not keep any constant distance. We saw them rise vertically and go horizontally faster than any machine could have done for the distance we saw them at, and they were in the air but stayed fairly close to the ground (my guess is that they did not go higher than a 100 yards off the ground.  They rose and fell as they moved, and in my best way of describing it: they appeared to &quot;dance&quot; or &quot;act playfully&quot; together.  They were clearly in some kind of intelligent control.We watched them move together until they disappeared toward the water behind some trees that blocked our view.  The whole thing lasted about 2-3 minutes.Both my wife and I witnessed this, we are both 25 and were not under any kind of influence of alcohol or anything else.  We are physically and mentally healthy and only she has eye problems, but while witnessing this she did had her glasses on. It was early morning and we were both sleepy, but seeing this strange sight instantly made me quite alert - this was no sleepy induced imaginary figment.We have ruled out every natural or man made thing we could think of.  The lights were about a mile away, and due to their size, brightness, location, and movement we have ruled out: people with flashlights, car/motorcycle headlights, planes, helicopters, spotlights.. etc  I have absolutely no explanation for what I saw, I hope someone else saw this too and will report it.", "One bright ,dark pink, slow moving, orb went through my yard at 3am lasting 5 or so seconds.I saw a low-flying (approx. 20 feet from ground), slow-moving, bright, pink orb go northeast through my yard, into some tall trees next door and out of sight.  This orb was silent and had a wavy, indefinte, outer edge.  It looked hot, and after it left my sight I am pretty certain that I could see smoke trailing off.

In that evening the witness ( I ) at my normal post and have been working there for three years. Familiar with the flight patterns of the small planes, passenger airliners, helicopters and the normal air traffic. Did not notice anything unusual in the surrounding area. The witness was on his normal patrol that evening. The witness was walking do west and notices a light that resembled the normal police helicopter with it spot light on. And coming from the north, North West over the San Gabriel Mountains heading east. It appeared to have swept over the mountains then came lower into the valley. When it approached and was closer, the object looked more of a ball or sphere of light. A super white florescent light with a hint of blue, it had a slight haze around it. Just like the planet Venus in the sky. The witness was expecting a helicopter sound but there was no sound at all. Planes and helicopters at that altitude make some noise at the least. There was no tr! ail of any kind either. The altitude was an estimated 2000 to 3000 feet when over head. Could not tell exactly the size of the object for it was as big as a small plane at 2000 feet at the point the object was over the witness. The witness had a flash light in hand and begins to flash his light at the object. After a few flashes the object or the ball/sphere of light was wobbling erratically up and down as if the object was reacting to the flash light. It soon starts gaining altitude and speed. Heading east then turning south. At that evening and time it past in near the moon and the planet Venus and the object was three times the size of Venus. And it was well gone at that point about 40-50 miles away from the witness. After the object was not seen it was about 19:50 hours. The objects flight path was do south east and seemed to be moving fast. Then do east and slowed down above the witness. Then slightly turned do south and speed off as well as gaining altitude. At the ti! me of the event the witness took a picture a few seconds of vi! deo with his cell phone. The video and picture is of bad quality do to the darkness of night and the bad camera phones performance. The witness called his wife to notify her of the event. At 19:52 hours, the witness went to finish his patrol when he was feeling ill. The witness did feel like he was affected by the object as he felt dizziness, confused and disorientated as he was walking. The symptoms last for an hour. But wearing off and getting better as the hour progressed. Nothing else happened that evening. The witness is 99.99% sure that It (the object) was not a plane, helicopter or any other conventional know flying object but an unknown flying object that was in good visual detail to make an observance. There was a similar object the passed by before in the same flight patter but do east only. The object was similar in size, color and shape. And it happened just as the station fire started.

Around 11:16pm, while having a conversation with my friends I had my head up slightly glancing at the sky. At first I thought I saw a shooting star, and excitedly told my friends, but the duration of the object was in the sky for about 5 seconds, and logically we ruled out the fact it was a shooting star. My two friends saw the last 3 seconds of the object before it went away. They said they saw it suddenly shifted to the right before it vanished. We ruled out that it was a jet or any human aircraft because of the speed it was traveling, no human aircraft could be going that fast. It looked like a shooting star but there was no tail or trail, it was as if the object was a big subtle orange/yellow light traveling through the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was looking up at the hill while they were collecting wood and they were about 50 yards away loading wood into our &lsquo;Ranger&rsquo; or off roading vehicle and they left it running so they could not hear me.  As I was looking up at the night sky I noticed a strange coned shaped yellow light coming from a cloud.  I yelled up to the girls asking them to look and what did they think it was, but they could not hear me.  I then looked around and didn&rsquo;t notice any other clouds in the sky.  The reason we were having the fire was to sit out and enjoy the night sky because it was so clear.  The light came down from the sky the way a bulb would emit light into a cone shape with it smaller at the top and larger at the bottom.  It was nothing that covered the whole sky but it was! definitely not light from a plane or helicopter. Neither was it the sun because the light was in the east and there was no moon at that time during the evening.   It stood still with no noise and the top of the cone was covered with the small cloud.  The light was there for around 45 seconds and within a couple of seconds it disappeared from the bottom up, almost as if it fizzled away. The cloud also disappeared immediately after.((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))", "Diamond shaped silent object floating over Dothan, ALIt was 9:54 pm.  I was out in the backyard with the dogs.

I first thought it might be helicopters flying in formation, but there was no sound.  It seemed to be only one or possibly two football field lengths away.  When it turned, I saw a third red light that made it the shape of a diamond.  Only one light was blinking.  The other three stayed on constantly.  I watched in amazement until it went behind the trees.  I watched and waited for it to clear the trees.  When it did, I saw it turn around and head back the way it had come.  I was speechless.

I think it was stationary for a while then it started moving slowly to the right and I seen it go behind the trees at my neighbors house across the street, I thought I would continue seeing them but it never came out from behind the trees. It was energy of some kind. I did not take my eyes off of it. It never entered my brain to get a camera, I was just locked on to it.If someone would have put 7 cd discs in a v formation on a long sheet of Plexiglas and was moving it to the right out side my door that is what it looked like. It stood out, it was on top of the view I was seeing but it went behind my neighbors trees across the street. It just did not belong there, do you know what I mean. it was memorizing, I could feel it, or I was like connected to it in a way. I did not count the discs but when I drew them on the computer 7 discs looker closer to what I seen compared to five discs.  One thing for sure it was a perfect even V, but in this direction &gt;  .  It was so different from photos  and videos of UFO&apos;s I have seen. I don&rsquo;t think it carried passengers. It just looked like energy.I always wondered why people took a sighting so serious and went to gatherings. I am hooked now. I will always be searching for what I seen. It only lasted maybe a minute.

With this one I could make out the shape of the lit up object.  It was a crooked tear drop shape, moving slow and not realy in one direction or at least not in a straight line.  Finally I heard somthing that made sence on the scanner &quot;do you guys see the light up toward the hill&quot;?  I waited for a responce but nothing.  Infact, nothing the rest of the night.  But back to the &quot;lights&quot;, and third one apeered and this time the three I could see were shining a &quot;super&quot; spot light or beam in a patrolling like matter toward the houses, ground, and trees.  No sound realy came from them b! ut, I could almost feel them flying kind of like a train in th! e far di stance that you can&apos;t hear but on a calm quiet night you can feel a train coming.  I ran from windo to window looking for more of the &quot;lights&quot; but couldn&apos;t see any out the other side of the house.  What I did see is light in the air like a stop light colors, three total. I huddled in the corner for some of this night terrified the spot beam would point see me.  The presun rise was starting to light up the sky and the fog and the lights all disapeared and the scanner went back to normal.  There are other details about other strange things I saw that night like I could see in the distant the line of tail lights toward the highway all seemed to be parked or stopped.  I don&apos;t know what I experienced that night but this site I found tonight seems perfect to get this of my chest and see if I feel better about it.

I was sitting in my truck and my girlfriend was standing right outside my truck talking to me.  That&rsquo;s when a bright light appeared out of nowhere at about 1000 feet up to the left of my girlfriend,  I told her: &ldquo;Turn around and look at that bright light up there.&rdquo;  She was so happy to finally see something like this. As we were looking at this bright light, a beam of light came from the bottom of this object, the beam of light was a controlled beam, something I have never seen before.  For example when you turn on a beam of light, it simply goes on and you can&rsquo;t control it&rsquo;s length. It started off small then as the beam got longer it got wider, the beam of light never came down to the ground.  Inside the beam of light was slow moving white and green mist, the beam of light stayed in one spot and did not move at all.  There was no sound, then the beam of light started to get shorter until there was no beam left, then the light just started getting dimmer until it turned off.

It was not a large craft.It had white lights at each corner.  It appeared to be perfectly flat on each side like a triangular box.  I saw it at an angle.

It was not moving quickly but I just happened to look up just as it was passing over the building.Later, I saw far up in the sky, two strings of white lights.

The bridge does not look like a bridge but just part of the roadway.  I was headed northbound.  On my left hand side, out of my driver window there was an extemly large circular shaped object sitting around 100 feet up in the sky.  It was dark in color and fit closely with the darkened sky. There are really no street lights through the area or at least there was not at the time.  As I noticed the object I slowed my speed.  So did the three or four other cars behind me and in front of me. There is a passing lane.  No one passed.  Others had to see it as well as myself.  I recall looking up and seeing very dimly lit light! s.  There were three of them and they were in the formation of electric stove burners.  The color was very dim orange.  From what I gathered the object was huge similiar to Independence Day UFO&apos;s in regards to its&apos; size.  The bottom of it must have been what was visible to me. It was not even hovering.  If an object were to hover you would see some slight movement.  This thing actually sat in the sky as if it belonged there.

We saw a few formations of these lights, about 5 minutes apart and in all different areas of the sky. In total, I think we saw about 5 different appearances of these lights over the course of an hour.We also witnessed flickering/blinking lights directly after seeing the orange lights. These seemed to be moving independently and would cross the sky back and forth with no pattern at all. They seemed to be moving faster than an airplane, and had the ability to change direction or stay in one place.

There was no discernible afterburner glow despite the sound.  Then on the underside of the craft there were three distinguishable round lights on each of the three corners of them!

In total there were 7 of us all standing outside yet only 6 could see the object as it blended in almost perfectly with the night sky.  This large group of people included my own brother and another man who would later join the Air Force of which he is currently enlisted.  We were in the back yard of the home smoking cigarettes when an individual frantically pointed to the sky asking something like, &quot;What is that?!&quot;  I remember the date because it was not only Cinco De Mayo but also 5/5/05.  Had there not been others to witness the event I likely would have never told anyone about it.  The object was flying extremely low.  It was traveling so slowly that If one of us had chased after it we would have been able to keep up.  It was around 10 feet long and maybe around 10-12 feet at its wing span.  It was a triangular object that gave off absolut! ly no sound or reflection of the lights below.  It almost completely blended into the night sky in a way that seemed like it was mimicking it.  It gave off no lights and had no lights on it that I remember seeing.  However this event did occur nearly 5 years ago.  The object travelled across the entire length of my yard and crossed over South Boulevard/ 20 mile Rd into Rochester Hills.  Because it was so difficult to see against the night sky everyone lost sight of it after it had only traveled a short distance.  Less than 100 yards.  The object flew directly above us and never changed speed.  When the object crossed South Boulevard I could see that it was flying only slightly higher than the telephone poles it was passing over.  It also released no vapors or any kind of trail that I could see behind the object.  Even though one of the people in the group was unable to see the object it is likely due to his poor vision or unwillingness to accept what was occurring around hi! m.  Other than shock there were no feelings I experienced duri! ng this incident.  I know what I saw and so do the others who witnessed this event.  There is no way this aircraft was earth technology.  It made no noise and seemed to cloak itself against the sky.  If the object was under intelligent control it would have easily been able to see us gawking at it.  It was literally flying so low as it was passing over us that I could have thrown a baseball at it and hit it.  This event deeply disturbed me for some time after.

We were waiting for moon rise. Jupiter was bright in the south sky, but other stars were still dim. I looked up and noticed two stars as bright and large as Jupiter about 15 to 20 degrees above the SSE horizon, and asked &quot;where did those stars come from?&quot;  They were about 1-2 degrees apart, somewhat more than the distance between the stars/nebula in Orion&apos;s belt. My partner asked if they were moving - and I could see they were moving in parallel in a southerly direction, when tracked against another nearby star. They remained bright for another minute or two, then gradually dimmed in unison, and disappeared. They appeared to be objects at high altitude, picking up the sun&apos;s reflection, and large enough to resemble Jupiter (not small like a satellite). There were no blinking lights and no indication the objects were lighted themselves, just brightly reflecting the sun&apos;s light. If sighted by anyone else, these objects may be reported as flying over north central New Mexico.

I&apos;m not sure if they were the same planes flying back and forth really low to the ground, or if they were different planes coming from different directions.I have never seen planes flying this low in this area and they were coming from every direction.  They were flying extremely close to one another as well.There is no close airport or landing strip that I know ofin the area.I am not sure if these planes were looking for these weird objects I saw floating by or if they were performing some type of test operation.

Together moving quickly southeastAt approximately 06:15, while outside with the dog, I observed a dim to moderately bright yellowish light approaching from the north. As we live near an airport I at first thought it to be a plane. As it got closer it became a triangle shape of 3 lights. The lights were spaced too far apart to be any type of aircraft. When it was almost overhead it turned sharply to the East. I could then see that the 3 lights were slightly oval in shape, brighter in the center, dimming with a slight haze to the outside. As it (they) continued east the light in the right rear quickly moved to the left past the left light then back into position leading me to believe it was not a single object with three lights but three objects.

It took less than 5 seconds to be totally out of sight.

It seemed to be generally over Seattle, directly to the east of the Bangor submarine base on the Kitsap Peninsula.

This morning was no different when I received a flat tired just a few hundred feet away from my office area, so it was not too bad.At the end of the working day which is normally 6pm but today I stayed behind to finish up a new user account creation at one of our client sites, for some reason it did not work whilst I was on the phone with the customer so I retried at 6:00pm and it worked and fired off an email from the new mail box which I accessed over outlook over web cc ing our support@ email address.Any way sorry but I&apos;m tired and I&apos;m taking the time to write this so any way I fetched my bike and to be totally honest I downloaded a number of mp3sand  put them on my mp3 player, I  unlocked my bike and started the 20/25minute walk home slowly with player on etc, nothing was really on my mind and I was just thinking about my outside of work endeveiours, I am successfully at a form of homework I do similar to trading.I reached the corner of what appears to be wordsworth gardens and felt a slight pain in my stomach (as if confronting some thing)and I looked directly to my left and saw a large ginger cat under the tree , I made eye contact and given I grew up with two cats and can make an excellent come here sound I attempted to beckon towards me the cat so I sort of sat down holding my bike up with my right arm (see image marked with x), the cat just stared at me and I got the general idea that he was not interested in moving his fat arse over to me for some affection which is fair enough.Ok so this is when I saw the object, when I got behind the second car in the picture walking along the normal path I take(normally on my bike on the actual road path not left foot path) I looked up and saw a sort of silver object, I very often do double check most objects as I was interested in ufos in the past and have listened to rense .Because of that I am able to give the rough elevation of the object.My first few seconds looking at the object progress as such.That&apos;s a funny looking airplaine.Yeah I&apos;ve seen this before, The airplaine can be at a certain direction or facing a way that makes it look strange or funny.(and not like a plane should etc) Wow it&apos;s not moving.Ok Its not moving because it&apos;s so high and when it&apos;s that high you can&apos;t tell unless you watch for longer than normal, if its lower you can tell it&apos;s moving , its more obvious, how high is that, wow if thats so high that its difficult for me to tell the height and I have been looking at it for a good few seconds it must be plus 50k feet? but it&apos;s not moving even a small bit, not even a fraction of a bit of sky.I then concentrated on the movement issue a lot and tried to detected any movement at all going so far as to maybe walking from quite slow to really hardly walking in step and being more mindfull of my movement vs its movement so as to lower my movement so I could focus in on this point, it was not moving at all was my conclusion.I then reconsidered the shape and size of it and it was very difficult to make out what it was, it did not seem to have wings but it was not a clearcut shape but square with silver to the right maybe some kind of silver metal beam, yes there was definitely solidness to it and a part of it which mimicked the appearance of a wing but not in the configuration or direction which a normal airplane will exhibit a wing, sort of off and to the left.It was very hard to tell what it was or its correct shape to describe now.I then continued to look at it for maybe a few more seconds before I reached the end of the long red line (see images) and I put my head down and stepped off the small curb and to the left as this is the direction to continue my walk home.No sooner had I put my foot down,  of course I wanted to look straight back up at this weird thing but it was gone, my head then sort of went on a instant out of control sweep. I then felt like someone had pulled the rug from under my feet or someone had stolen something from me and I was a little bit pissed off about the fact it was gone.One point I wish to add is that the visibility was 100% with zero clouds and due to the layout of the buildings my vision of the sky was  very wide, I don&apos;t know measurements or scale of what I can see but I can / could pretty much see the whole open sky and yet it had disappeared, that was a total impossibility I can state 100% there is no way at all it could have moved any were more than a short distance at the height it must have been if it were the size of a craft, to disappear is totally impossible.The rest of my journey home consisted of me pulling my mobile out and calling my parents to say what I had just seen and scanning the sky. but I got through to voice mail so I hung up.The only additional points of interest are the moon was out but it was to the left and back of me or 7/8 o&apos;clock when walking down the attached path.Around 10 to 15 seconds after the object disappeared I saw quite a number of other aircraft one coming from directly ahead and to the left going to my 4oclock, and further along my walk another two Plaines going whichever way they were going.Regarding how high it was if looking straight up is 12oclock and straight ahead is 9 clock , then my eyes were looking up at an angle of just below 11oclock, you could not look at it with your head in a normal position, and it was not bang between 9 and 12 o&apos;clock it was slightly higher than that.My final submission now that I can talk freely is that the biggest thing that hit me was when it was gone, it was there 100% whatever it was but it was when it was gone that was the impressive thing, that it could be there and in under 1 or 1 and a half seconds it could clear out from someone who had such large visibility. That is what I will remember from this, this was the unusually factor and light had not yet fallen I could see the whole sky in close to normal daylight.Additional points : When I got home I told my housemates about it, I have a lumix Panasonic dmc fs4 digital camera and felt it important to get out there to document the site I saw the object and also see if it was there again in the sky.I will inspect this part of the sky tomorrow at the same time to see if it returns. Please let me know if anyone else has seen it or if there is a valid answer for what it was. I was not so impressed with the object but more with its ability to disappear like that, that it was solid there and then gone, it upsets me that it went when I looked away and i did not see how it went.

Its apperiance was of white with solidness to it being silver.http://i37.tinypic.com/2vx58c7.png   I do not wish to be contacted unless it is extremely urgent, I am willing to discuss this but all facts of the matter have been reported here.

My husband, sons and I were returning home in our car, when I spotted something in the sky.

Then, it appeared as if the &ldquo;spotlight&rdquo; retreated into a small cloud or a sort of a mist and faded out. The &ldquo;mist&rdquo; quickly dissipated. There is a cloudless sky here tonight, and so whatever the mist was came from the object that we couldn&rsquo;t see. It was just a light and then it was gone. There was no smell.
