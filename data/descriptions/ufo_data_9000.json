["8 to 9 individual craft in a chevron formation that broke briefly into 2 individual rotating circles then reverted back to the chevron.My mother and I were walking on the riverwalk from the Flamingo Hilton to the Riverside.  We stopped about halfway and I looked up and spotted faint lites traveling from north to south. Spotted them as they  approached the Colorado River from the Bullhead side.  There were about 8 or 9 of them in a chevron formation. Then from the Chevron formation they formed 2 separate circles and still moved at the same steady - fast speed. The individual craft (I&apos;m assuming) rotated around into circles for about 10 seconds then quickly reverted back to the chevron formation.  I told my mother to look at it and she saw it at the moment that they were moving back into the Chevron formation.   I would say that they were flying at a higher altitude than jets and it took them only about 40 to 60 seconds to leave our line of sight.  The reflection of the almost-full moon made them easy to spot, but faint.((NUFORC Note:  I, together with Dr. Roger Leir, Peter Gersten, Mr. Terry Burris, and many others,  were personal witness to a similar event over Laughlin, NV, on Saturday, February 27, 1999.  In addition, however, there are many migratory birds over the same area, which is the cause of many sightings from this area.  We do not know what the witnesses observed on that night, but the fact that the objects apparently formed a circle seems to us to militate against migratory birds.

The trees and brush below it were pushed down and away , like a force was  holding them there, they did not move or sway at all. I was standing on a small storage building in our back yard situated on a small hill. The craft was about  100 yards away west of where I was , I was facing north. It was slightly below horizontal line of view. I could see its right side, some of its top , and some of its rear. It looked like the space shuttle, but much sleeker, no markings, no sign of seams or windows, or propulsion units from the rear. I was outside that dayand noticed a silence, unnatural, thats when I got on the building. I got down to get someone else, changed my mind and got back up on the building, about a minite, it was gone. I noticed a dot in the sky to the northeast that got smaller and disapeared, fast.(NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1974 is approximate.

I was trying to prove to a friend that what he had witnessed the previous evening was a satellite and nothing more, so I watched the same area of sky he had (due north) and waited.  Sure enough, a dimly lit object came from the south and halfway across the sky gained in brightness, reached a peak of brightness, and slowly dimmed and moved on.  I attributed the change in illumination to reflection of sunlight off a solar panel of a man-made object, but my story does not end here. Crossing the path of the above object and just barely visible to the naked eye was a dimmer object which seemed to have a reddish-brown aura surrounding it.  I thought it was a shooting star at first, but the object did not throw sparks and was travelling too slowly for a meteorite, but faster than any object that I have seen in orbit.  It moved from west to southeast, and performed manuvers (no meteor could have done this) in a zig-zag fashion.  I watched the object for a full minute until it faded from sight.", "On an evening in February,1967 at 12:15 am, a friend and I were walking back to our billets from across the base at Ft. Bliss on a Saturday.  We were passing by the crypto infomation center for the Strategic Air command which is located underground in a highly secured area.  We looked up at the sky on a very clear night, when we noticed large cloud like puffs, that seemed to come from out of nowhere.  Then we saw a UFO that looked to be the shape of a disk/saucer.  It came out of the puffs and went directly over the crypto site and stopped abruptly. The UFO was about 100-200 feet from us and about 100-200 feet above.  It then shot a beam of light of blue, red,orange, and bright white in the shape of rectangles with spaces between each light which followed in sequence and travelled slowly down and looked to be penetrating the concrete and metal surface.  Then the light came out in sequence at around a 45 degree angle rise up a to what seemed a fourth or fifth of the way up to the UFO and then disappear.  It did this for about 5 or 6 minutes but I&apos;m not sure. The UFO then travelled back into the puffs and shot off like a rocket at an angle of 45-60 degrees and was gone.  The puffs were gone also. We felt very calm and different which I can not explain.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual at some length, and we found him to be quite credible.

My wife handed me the camera and I got out to see if I could zoom in on it. My camera is not the greatest. As I zoomed in and it started to take shape, the veiw became distorted and shaky. I drew back the shot and got a good shot of the distance in height compared to the tree lining. A car pulled in and a guy asked what I was looking at. I pointed up to him and asked what he thought it was. He said a balloon or something. His friend thought it might be a helicopter. I said that a balloon would pop at that height and it would be moving. I thought that a helicopter wouldn&apos;t be able to reach that height. They both looked in the camera and said that they couldn&apos;t figure it out. Another car pulled in and a lady asked what I thought it was. The shape of the object, almost looked like a cluster of balloons. My four year old son could see the object also. I decided to get back into my car since the object was really doing anything. My wife asked if she could look through the camera, to see it up close. While she was looking at it, I notice a small plane coming towards us. I asked my wife for the camera so I could get both in the same shot. I figured this might be a good way to see the distance in height and size. The plane was alot lower and alot closer to us. I recorded the plane and zoomed in on it. When I drew back to get both objects it was gone. I panned around the area to see if it moved. I couldn&apos;t find it again.

What caught my eye was Military Road in Arlington has constant aircraft heading toward the Potomac River preparing for landings at Reagan National Airport.  The aircraft fly so low you are very accustomed to their sounds, different lighting, and even at times are able to read the company logos on the side of the aircraft.  Last night I was taking down draperies and as I looked up I saw blinking white then red then white again lights that were unfamiliar to any normal aircraft that we have seen.  These lights formed a somewhat circular pattern and would alternate between the red and white in this clear pattern.  This first caught my eye and as I observed if further it seemed to move in a pattern of front and back and then side to side but all the while moving forward, almost as if it was gliding or floating.  I pointed this unusual sighting to my  daughter and her friend (both honor students at G.W. University) where I work.  We then proceeded outside to the front yard and watched as this light pattern and movement continued.  As it moved closer and continued over the house, it was not close enough to determine the exact shape but as we closely watched the light pattern it seemed as though it was somewhat circular (most definitely not our usual jet or helicopter) and continued with very exacting movement and light pattern.  And then very suddenly we saw another one meet with it and they both seemed to instantaneously disappear.  Just a further note, I have never seen anything like this,  I am very well traveled and come from a military background.  This was most defiinitely some time of aircraft and what perplexes me is how something like this can fly across a flight path, so near to the district where it is heavily populated, and then towar the diretion of the Pentagon and yet we have heard nothing about this on the! news.

The light seemed to be flying at a steep angle.  At first I thought it was going to crash, but as it came closer, I realized that its flight was not on an angle, the craft itself was tilted, at least 45 degrees, but probably closer to 60.  And it was saucer-shaped.  Also, it did not have the lights on it that I usually see on aircraft coming or leaving the airport: it seemed as if the whole craft was one big light.  It was heading  north by northeast and had 2 near collisions with planes coming in for a landing.  It was also extremely loud, much louder than then the planes that normally fly by (and they are QUITE loud!).  In fact, it was the noise which first drew my attention.  )It sure as hell sounded like a plane that was going to crash).  The 2 planes it almost collided with were both coming from the direction of northern New York City, a typical flight pattern for around here.

By this time we were quiet excited and yelled out to everybody else the only person that heard me was my step mother who could not be bothered getting up.

The light, which was only slightly dimmer than one of the stars in the Belt of Orion, at first was traveling very fast in a straight line toward the north.  It then abruptly turned westerly, then northerly, then westerly again and continued these erratic manoeuvers.  After watching the light for a minute or two, I went inside and asked my wife to view the light.  Although the sky was clear, after about five minutes of watchint the light, it faded from view, then reappeared and, and finally disppeared altogether, not to be seen again. Having spent many years as a journalist, I have observed many different types of phenomena, both natural and man-made.  Because of the apparent altitude of this light, its movement, its speed and its lack of any characteristics common to an aircraft or weather balloon (there were no anti-collision lights, for example, and its speed was much to great), I find it hard to believe it can easily be explained.", "Three Bright Orange Orbs large in sizefor about a couple of weeks of my last year in high school(night School), i would take some friends of mine home and i would drive a stretch of road called pecos road. pecos road backs up to an indian reservation so its basically all desert and theres no houses for miles. while driving we saw some unusual lights about 5 miles away in the desert, there would be about 3 of them at one time. they disapear and reappear for almost an hour. they had an almost orange hologram appearance that was very bright and the craft looked like it was alive in a way. these sightings went on for a week until we decided to go closer to the ufos. one night after school we saw the lights again. myself and 3 of my friends stopped at my house to get some firearms and we headed of in my car and went about 5-10 miles in the desert at a very high speed trying to get to the craft(they were about 7 miles away once we reached the desert). about 2 miles away from the ufo&apos;s we noticed a cow dung smell in the air? and when we got closer to the craft it indeed had a brilliant almost florescent orange color to it that looked to be moving on the outside of the craft.when we got closer to the craft it would disapear and not even a second later it reappeared about 3 miles farther away. we gave up going after the ufo a short time after that and returned home, but the next night i was armed with a video camera and i filmed the ufos from about 5 miles away. so i do have video and would love to share it, maybe someone else has video of the same ufos out there. my friends mother also witnessed the crafts and she talked to some military type people(i think theres a proving ground near that area) and she was told that the lights were just flares. from what i saw and from what i have on tape, these are clearly NOT flares.

It looked like it was bobbing left to right then there was a solid roll of lights that started with only one light then followed by one on each side then a multitude of resddish lights began to flash on and off in a pattern.  The pattern was, it would start at the center light then flash out quickly and continue to flash in this manner.  The object seemed to be rolling ( like an airplane would).

My parents live outside the city limits.  I was almost all the way home when I drove out of a clearing of trees when I spotted the primary colored lights in the sky.  As I approached the lights I slowed my car to a halt.  I was nearly underneath the lights.  It was a clear and cool evening.  I turned my car engine off to listen for any engine noises. there was no noise coming from the lights which were to my guess about 150 foot up in the sky.  I can judge this by the 50 foot tree that was near.  The lights were very large circular and were in groups of primary colors of red, yellow, and blue.  I left my parking lights on and flashed my headlights at the colored lights and the colored lights began to slowly fade and brighted but in a pattern of the grouping of the colored lights.  I rolled down my window and got out of my car and shut the door.  I continued to flasth the lights for a few more moments.  I was startled when I heard an older couple in a luxury car slowly approach from behind me.  I heard the lady in the passenger seat say to her husband &quot;What is that?&quot; and I noticed her red painted fingernair pointing up at what I was seeing.  The couple being frightened drove off rather quickly.  I tried for the life of me to get a shape of a craft of a length or color of one and I could not see any lines or shape.  The lights which were in perfect focus and were not the little twinkly lights a person would see on a plane or helicoper far away were easy to see.  The thing that puzzles me to this day is why I could not make out a shape of a craft.  I looked near the colored lights and far away from them as to see if I was not looking far enough out.  I believe there was only one craft because the lights must have got bored with my light flashing and slowly turned clockwise together and then slowly went in a direction to my right.  Because there were no immidiate roads to chase it I did not chase it.  I then w! ent home which was only a few hundred feet from the sighting and told my parents about it.  They believed me mainly because I was brought up not to cry wolf and they knew I would not do such a thing.

The delta shape was static with no engine noise at all. It kept this position for 4-5 seconds as if it were scanning the area or me.I didn&apos;t take my eyes of the shape, the lights appeared to be green/yellow in colour and they did not appear to round more oval in shape. The delta had no back or form as in a triangle just the delta wing as I could see the sky directly behind the lights. The delta shape then moved slowly across the sky for just a second or two then the movement was so rapid I could not track with the human eye. It did not disappear at the front of my eyes it was just as if it went faster than my eyes could react.The position of the delta was north to south.

It then proceeded to drop and rise in elevation, change course at angles greater than 90 degrees, coming to a dead stop and starting again. It traveled from west to east and appeared to originate from the White Sands area, which is just west of Sierra Blanca. After about 2 minutes of viewing its travel, we observed it turning to the northwest and the light became too dim to see. About 10 minutes later, we observed another point of light crossing over the mountain, coming from the same area as the first object.

The five-foot pear-shaped piece of silver metal was first spotted hurtling towards the ground by trainee teacher Jenny Cook in Hendon on Tuesday morning. Police launched an inquiry following the report by the 18-year-old Sunderland University student but, despite a ground search of the area, failed to find any trace of the object. The Echo has now learnt that officials at Newcastle Airport were alerted after a similar sighting three hours later above Penshaw. Ron Atwill spotted a mysterious five-foot long grey object narrowly miss a passenger jet as it made its descent towards Newcastle Airport, while walking his dog near the old Herrington Colliery site. Mr Atwill, a retired prison service worker, saw the object at 11.45am. He said: &quot;I was looking up as a passenger jet was flying quite low in the distance on a flight path between the colliery and Penshaw Monument and I saw this thing almost hit it. I rang the airport because this thing appeared that close and I thought they might have spotted it as well. It was about 20ft away from the plane. &quot;It looked exactly the way it was described in the Echo. It was a silvery grey in colour and from where I was standing it looked very flat, pear shaped and about four to five feet long. &quot;I watched it for a little while and then turned away and took my eye off it and it had disappeared. It almost looked like it was standing still, moving very slowly earthbound towards Sunderland. If you can imagine a piece of corrugated iron, but not corrugated and oblong.&quot; Speculation has included suggestions that the metal could be debris from a plane or a metal chunk from a decaying Pegasus satellite, which Nasa officials have warned is in the process of breaking up and falling to earth. Other theories include that the object could have been a model aircraft, advertising balloon, or even plastic sheeting. Mr Atwill, 64, of Elm Place, Newbottle, added: &quot;I hadn&apos;t a clue what it was and I didn&apos;t want to say anything, because of what people might think. &quot;But I definitely saw something. It wasn&apos;t a speck in the sky. It was big enough to make out even though it was a bit in the distance, but now I am beginning to think what was it? I thought it must have been something dropping out of the sky. I wasn&apos;t imagining it. I should know, I was there. It wasn&apos;t a weather balloon or a model.&quot; A spokeswoman for Newcastle Airport said the pilot on board the jet had reported no sightings to air traffic controllers. Detective Inspector John Watts, of Sunderland City Centre Police, said: &quot;We had a report of a strange object in the skies about the size of a small car. We couldn&apos;t find anything but it has been reported to the relevant authorities.&quot; Roger Mallett, an independent paranormal investigator, said: &quot;It is more than likely they saw something which they can&apos;t rationally explain and they don&apos;t know who to turn to.

I was home sick with a cold and not in school.  My brother stayed home as well, because he too did not feel well.  My mother is a housewife, so she was taking care of us.  It was around 3:00 p.m. which is when school lets out my older brother was coming home from school.  I knew that he would be coming home soon.  My brother played the violin so I knew that he would be carrying his violin case with him.  For some reason around 3:10 to 3:15 p.m. I had an urge to want to go out the front door.  So I opened the door and I did!  I began to run down the stairs, my brother followed me out and my mother ran after me to get me back into the house.  At that exact time I saw my older brother coming around the corner of the Street.  He was looking up into the sky and walking really fast.  I noticed that he seemed nervous looking into the sky ever so many seconds.  I later looked up into the sky and noticed that what he was starting at was a large &amp; I mean large object that was bright red and a perfect circle.  My mother stoped pulling on my shirt at that time because I noticed that she noticed it too, and so did my brother.  The object had to be the half size of a house, thats how large it was in the sky.  The bright red object moved as if it was following my brother and my brother at that time started running to the house.  I noticed that then the object came closer and then it just hoovered in a stationary position for about 10 to 12 seconds and then the object took off in a matter of 2 to 3 seconds and it was gone.  The one main thing that caught my attention about this object was that their was no sound, not when it stayed in stationary position and not when it took off.  It was a beautiful bright red, but it didn&apos;t blind you.  I saw no patterns of any kind to on the red object to see if it had any form of a design.  Later that evening it came out on channel 7 news and it was ! seen in the entire city of San Francisco.  But they dismissed the object to be a red air balloon.  I may have been 11 and my brother 13 and my older brother 16 and my mother about 49 years old, but I could tell you this the government might want to fool the people, this was no red air balloon.

Probably about the size of a jet fighter and lower in altitude than the other typical aircraft that were in the sky around it. I would guess less than 1000&apos;. I live near John Wayne airport and there is always a couple of planes in the sky. I have never seen anything like this before. Not a sound was made by the craft. There was a large plane much higher in the sky, and I beleive a police helicopter close by judging by sound, but was unable to see the helicopter. I live about 2miles from the ocean, and this craft was coming from Newport Beach when I initially saw it. It then veered off towards Seal Beach, which is north from me. My brain was telling me that it was three white birds flying in formation. But when I first saw it I remember an outline, which is why I say translucent. It also was visably &quot;banking&quot; when it turned north, meaning the right light appeared to raise slightly. That was it.", "a totally weird paranormal experience.a light fire-ball shaped object shoots across the night sky &gt; this direction disappears then returns travelling ^ upwards /away from witnesses. again disappears and once again returning to travel in the complete opposite direction &lt;.", "The object, which was about 30 degrees above the horizon and towards the south, moved. It shot from its stationary position at a speedIt was after midnight, about 1:30 A.M., the 17th of June, 1997. I went out to the deck to have a smoke. The moon was below the horizon and the night sky was very dark. Because of the lack of moonlight the stars shone very brightly. While I was looking at the stars I noticed what seemed to be a flashing white star moving across the sky. This object was a great distance away and had no red or green lights. It was just a flashing white object. The object was due east and almost directly overhead. It was at an 80 degree angle of elevation. I called to my brother to come and take a look at it. After he stepped out on the deck he noticed a different object. It was much closer, approximately 2 to 5 miles away. It was a very bright, luminescent white. It appeared to be fixed in the sky. He pointed directly at this object and I looked where he pointed. He started to say, &quot;Hey what&apos;s that over there?&quot; He managed to get out just the &quot;Hey...&quot; part. The object, which was about 30 degrees above the horizon and towards the south, moved. It shot from its stationary position at a speed faster than either of us have ever seen anything move. It flew parallel to the fence in the backyard and was gone, our further view of it blocked by the house. Just as this object, which appeared to be about the size of a loaf of french bread, dissapeared from sight, we saw way off in the sky a shooting star and right away a second one.  Neither of us spoke a word for the next few minutes. We were, it&apos;s hard to put into words, we were both stunned, shocked.  It was so bright and moved so fast.  We stayed out for about another half an hour and speculated as to what it could possibly have been. We both had the impression that whatever it was, somehow it was aware of the fact that we were aware of it. The fact that it shot off like that just as my brother pointed to the object to bring it to my attention seemed so weird.  We tried to find out if anyone else had seen anything at all like what we&apos;d seen that night without any luck.", "My sighting happened a long time ago in 1974 at the time i was twelve years old and had never heard of u.f.o.s let alone seen one.Some friends and i were collecting money from the local residents by going &quot;penny for the guy&quot; which was common for children at the time.You were ment to make a guy by stuffing straw and the like into trousers and a shirt and then making a head.The result  was supposed to look like guy fawlks.Then you knocked on doors and asked for a penny for the guy.However we were cheating and had dressed my friend in old clothes and a scary mask but were doing quite well in the penny stakes all the same. We were at the end of Spinny Hill road which was a quite council estate backing on to farm land. I lived about 100 yards from where the sighting took place.It was a cold and clear night with many stars visible,my freinds were struggling with the guy who was starting to get a bit heavy(we pushed him around in a wheelbarrow)when for some reason i dont know why, i looked up but instead of stars i saw a huge ring of red and green lights only a few feet above my head. iside the lights was a dark disk shape which was more of a shadow than a solid shape underneath there was a kind of dome but again it was just a kind of shape and not a solid object.It was perfectly still and totally silent, just sitting there.The whole thing was so big that it totally filled the sky. I could see  nothing else. I turned to my friends and said somthing like &quot;wow look at that&quot; but when i looked back there was nothing there. I just couldnt belive it.

The &quot;bottom&quot; was round and covered in white lights.  With binoculars, it sort of resembled an old Gemini space capsule.  There was a brighter light &quot;on top&quot;.  With the naked eye, it looked like a cluster of flashing lights, some of which were red.  However, whatever it was did not move for at least 30 min.  It was a clear night and there were several stars visible and quite a few planes passing by, so it was obvious it was neither a star nor a plane.  About fifteen minutes after first  sighting the object, it emitted a small, circular &quot;disk&quot; from it, which flashed red and moved very quickly away, it a southwest direction from the main object.  We watched the object for about another 15 minutes, and then it finally started moving very, very slowly until we could no longer see it behind a line of trees..

I was facing north and it was a semi clear night with lots of small clouds.  I was ready to get up and head home and noticed something which I thought were clouds moving above a taller apt. building.  I realized what I was looking at weren&apos;t clouds but a craft of some sorts.  This was the best view I had of this craft. Even with an excellent veiw of this, I became terrified when I could not identify it, and was able to continue viewing it as it nearly flew above me.  It was traveling south (up pine st. just a half block to my left)  and low to the ground (1000 ft)  having no sound, and a smooth fast flight path.  It was black and white (or grey).  I remember thinking it was odd because at times all i could see were the lighter parts,  it blened well with the few clouds out that night.  My first idea  was, that it was a stealth plane.  It seemed to be the only match as in size shape.  It disappeared from my sight (the apartment buildings blocked my vision from it).   An intense fear over came me, due to having a good look at something so unfamiliar.  I was extremely close to an unexplainable craft. (?) I had dismissed the sighting as perhaps a hang-glider.  When telling this to friends and family, they say that a hang glider would be unlikely.  (what are the likely chances of some one hang gliding or gliding over that area that time of night?)  When reading a recent sighting on www.ufobc.org web site, &quot;2000 - Boomerang-shaped Craft Over North Vancouver &quot; It re-created the experience for me, and every description in that article, along with the date and time is too close for comfort to forget about.

I work as an overnight television broadcast engineer.  I had slept most of the day since I worked the previous overnight. It was 7:20pm CDT.  It was pretty cloudy everywhere except to the southwest, to the horizon.  I could also see Venus clearly.  I had just stepped outside when I saw a moving light to the southwest.  It was about a fist at arms lenghth above the horizon moving north.  There seemed to be a bright spot/point or two on the front of the object and it was leaving a very distinct trail that had a sort of shimmer to it.  I watched the object for about 30 seconds and it probably moved 90 degrees across the sky.  It went behind some clouds, so after the first 10 seconds I would see it, then lose it... until it disappeared for good behind heavy cloud cover to the northwest and north. Maybe because of the trail, I figured that it must have been a plane, (I live near a small airport so I see lots of lights in the sky) but it just didn&apos;t seem right for a plane.  I really thought that it looked like some fireballs that I have seen in the sky and on tv/videos.  I thought that it would start to break up at any moment, but it just never did. This is the best part.  The trail that it left stayed in the sky for another 10-15 minutes.  It must have been high enough to catch the last glint of sunlight because as the sky got darker, the trail went from a shimmer to a glow!  It was like a beam of light, as bright as the full moon, across the southwesten sky.  It really was a sight.  I took some 35mm photos but we&apos;ll see how they turn out. I ain&apos;t Ansel Adams.

It caught my attention because the left wing lights were blinking like the craft was signaling a turn.  On the left wing there were three white lights equally distanced apart.  On the right wing there were only two lights, a white and a red.  They were located at the outside and inside ends of what I thought was the right wing of a large airplane.  I was driving north on route 95 at 70 mph.  After a few moments of observing the craft I realized that it was stationary in the sky.  The vehicles separated, the one on the left was lower and the one on the right went up.  The two crafts remained within a matter of yards of one another.  As I continued to watch the crafts I saw the upper craft launch a fireball in a northward direction.  It resembled a shooting star in the night sky.  The fireball followed a strait trajectomry until it disappeared from view in the distance.  I pulled into a rest area parking lot to continue watching the crafts.  The two crafts moved slowly to the south, continuing to maintain a pairing.", "Saw dancing metallic balls high in the sky over the Mall that moved unlike any plane I&apos;ve EVER seen before.I was lying on my back on the Mall right across the street from the Washington Memorial (my feet were facing the Capitol Building).  I was staring up at the sky (there were no clouds today) and noticed what I first thought was an airplane (because it was metallic and reflecting light) that was flying so high it looked like a little ball.  It was moving in a straight line, much like an airplane would.  Then, I noticed another one, same size, same description, but flying towards the first object.  I thought maybe they were planes flying at different altitudes, because it looked as though they were going to have a head-on collision.  I became anxious as I thought I was going to watch a plane wreck mid-air, but just as they were going to hit, they VERY QUICKLY (much faster than an airplane ever could) spun off in opposite circular directions.  They danced around each other in circles, occasionally disappearing then reappearing.  The most I saw at one time were 4.  Then, and actual airplane passed through my area of vision (flying much lower than the objects) and as it did, the objects disappeared totally.  After the plane had been gone for about a minute, one reappeared and continued to dance around, and another appeared.  Sometimes there were two, and sometimes one. During the course of this, I stood up to observe, and sat down, and laid back down, just to make sure I wasn&apos;t contorting my body in a way that was effecting my vision.  But, these objects were clearly in focus, not just light spots created by poor sight. Finally, I decided I had seen enough and wanted to leave.  I&apos;m not one to make up stories (as most people probably say), and though I believe there is something out there, I NEVER thought I&apos;d ever see anything like this.  There was no other explanation for what I saw today.

Very slowly moving from West to East, at a high altitude.  My husband and I watched it for 25 minutes and timed the flashes, which were exactly every 10 seconds. We guessed it to be about ten miles up.  The object hovered in the same area, moving back and forth as though it were inching across the sky.

I first thought it was the &quot;V&quot; formation of a flock of birds.  I cupped my ear to listen, but it made absolutely no sound.  It glided smoothly but quickly from the North towards a South-southeasterly direction.  It spanned the portion of sky from Hercules to Capricornus (where I lost it behind the trees) in about 5 seconds.  It was shaped like a flattened out &quot;V&quot;. At arms length it was about 3&quot; across and about 1&quot; long.  It&apos;s shape was made up of many pinpoints of white lights, not brilliant, about as bright as the average star.

We were facing a NW direction. The object was moving towards the SW. It was larger than anything I have ever seen in the sky before. My daughter yelled out asking me what it was. We have a lot of planes in the sky here. This was 10 to 15 times larger than any airplane I have ever viewed before. It cast a yellow color not like a normal plane. There were no other colors on it to be seen. Any other planes I have observed out here have been white. This object was moving too fast for a plane. There was no noise to be heard with this object. If I were to hold my thumb up it would have been the 3/4 the width of the end of my thumb .I was not wearing my glasses so I asked my daughter to tell me what shape she was seeing and she confirmed that it was an elongated shape like a cigar which is exactly what I was seeing. As the object moved to our left it reached a tree line and was still well above the line and then suddenly it just disappeared. My daughter yelled at me asking where it went. It was like someone had turned off a light. It literally just vanished. My two granddaughters were observing it also. We watch the skies out here often. This is unlike anything I had ever observed. If it had been close there would have been some kind of noise. But this thing was moving way too fast for any kind of craft I have ever observed. After it disappeared I noticed at least two planes in the sky moving as usual with their red and green flashing lights. Everything looked normal.

I thought with tourist season in effect that it was a helicoptor but it was strange to see one at night and at back beach road . As it got closer , I noticed it was not a helicoptor , I had no clue what it was . It was dark in color , almost transparent with the exception of 3 reddish lights , one on each corner but very dim . It was about 100-150 feet above the ground , and not a sound what so ever .

It appeared to be oval with colored lights and either pulsing or rotating in position.  We ruled out helecopters and planes.  It definately wasn&apos;t a house or vehicle as there are no houses or roads in that area.  We turned off our lights to watch it for a couple of minutes.  After a couple of minutes, I turned on my parking lights in case someone happened to drive up on us and the object suddenly emitted a very bright white spot light and started moving in what looked like our direction - I turned the lights off very quickly and the object returned to it&apos;s original colors and stopped moving.

All I saw were lights and I thought it was just an airplane, but I watched it anyway because no one was talking. I lost it behind the trees about 5 minutes later. We reached the end of New York Rd. and got out to sit and talk. We saw the aircraft again and it was hovering above the trees not far from us, and it was not making any sound. It would hover in one place and dive straight down and back up again very fast. Then it would move over a bit and do the same thing. It was very quick with its movements. I&apos;ve never witnessed an aircraft moving in such a way as this one did. We soon lost it in the trees so we decided to drive in the direction it was heading, about 15 minutes later while heading south on Lesley Highway back towards Leesburg we spotted it again to the West of us near a radio tower. We followed it until it started to accelerate, at this point we observed a series of lights blink on and off. Three lights blinked on one side(?) and then 3 on the other. I do believe the lights changed too, from red to orange to white(not necessarily in that order). After this it quickly accelerated and disappeared. We didn&apos;t see it anymore after that.

Both performed unlimited climbs until disappering.That morning, was warming up for a fitness test at a local track. I was facing West when I noticed two red lights cruising at a high rate of speed from the North (the direction of Jacksonville) to the South Southwest(towards Orlando). Best guess of altitude was +20,000 feet. Sky was completely clear, morning twilight was beginning in the East. Initially thought the two lights were from the same aircraft and the red lights would have been position lights on the left side of the aircraft. However, I noticed no strobe lights, beacons, etc. which are normally present on aircraft. At exactly the same time, a passenger plane took off from Daytona Beach Int&apos;l giving me a visual reference in the sky. I realized the two red lights were moving even faster than I thought and were two distinctly seperate objects. As they passed the due West position in formation, they shifted, without changing speed. Object #1 made several sharp turns and course reversals, then shot straight up into the clear sky until completely fading away. Object #2 stopped and stayed stationary during the manuevers of object #1. It then spiraled around the first object as it climbed out of view. Both lights diminished as they traveled farther up into the sky (unlimited climb). Aside from the momentary noise of aircraft taking off, no other noise during the quiet, calm morning. I am a civilian and military pilot and familiar with various types of high speed/highly manueverable aircraft. Absolutely none have that capability. While observing, I immediately was able to rule out any known aircraft, atmosphereic phenomena (clear sky, stars visible) and due to the maneuvers, rule out anything like meteors, pulsing stars, etc.", "Large bright blue light in the skyA friend and I were playing in an open field at the base of Mount Southington.  It was summer and just about dusk when we noticed a bright blue light in the sky, just hovering above us.  There was no sound and it didn&apos;t appear to be moving.  We just stood there looking at it wondering what it was and then all of a sudden it just disappeared.  I was so scared that I just ran home and left my friend standing there in the field alone.  When I got home my mother told me that the lights had gone out for an instant and there was no reception on the T.V.  To this day my friend reminds me of how I left her standing alone in the field.  There were reports that it had landed on the mountain and the government had roped off the area.  There were all kinds of military trucks coming in and out of that area.", "Unusual aircraft or ??I live near a military base.  I have seen every kind of military aircraft known, but I have never seen anything like or since what I saw on 6/4/97.  It was approximately 8:30 pm and I went outside to put the windows up on the car.  As I was outside, I looked to the NE sky and noticed something flying low.  It&apos;s normal for military aircraft to fly low in this area, but the light pattern was strange.  It had only red lights in the front and a very unusual pattern I&apos;ve never seen before (that&apos;s what caught my attention), and I could see that from the trajectory of the way it was flying that it would come over my head.  During this time, I noticed recognizable military aircraft flying around but keeping distance.  Anyhow, this aircraft came over my head, and I did not hear any engine noise.  It was HUGE!  I could see small white lights on either side which would be at the end of each wing(?).  I was transfixed by this sight and continued to watch.  Then the view changed as the object went over my head and was moving away from me, and there was a plasma white color in the middle of the back, similar to the color of an afterburner on an F-18.  This unknown aircraft was not flying quickly; it was not an F-18.  It continued past me in the opposite direction.  All of a sudden, two red lights shot out from it, and then I saw a triangular pattern of lights--the white light had gone off and was replaced by red.  Then, the top two red lights shot off together and one of the military jets headed in that direction, and then the object lit up the back again, and went the opposite direction, with 2 jets following along behind it.  I stood there wondering what I had just seen and my first idea was maybe the B-2 Stealth at night, but I really couldn&apos;t say for sure.  Maybe it was simply some sort of night-time military exercise---which is the impression I got, but what I saw didn&apos;t really make sense, and like I say, I&apos;ve seen all kinds of military aircraft flying (except for the B-2).

The light was constant, not blinking or changing colors.  Then about two minutes later we spotted another one coming more from the northeast, but traveling in the exact same direction, like they were meeting at one point.  We followed them until we lost sight of them from the brightness of the moon.  This has happened on numerous occasions, and on each one they were traveling in different directions.  Twice they were north to south, then I also saw one moving from west to east alone on a different night.  The one I am writing about occured this past Monday.  The light seemed to be brighter than the others and was traveling from south to northwest.  About one minute later I spotted another moving from the west to northwest, going to the same point as the other.  This happened at 4:20am.  Then at 5:15am I spotted another coming from the direction the other 2 went, traveling northeast to southwest.  I have watched this go on for about 2 weeks now.  Each time I see them it is almost like clockwork.  The first couple of occasions this happened at 5:20am.  This last time it was 4:20am, two days after daylight savings time.  These lights are not aircraft because they are moving way too fast and are very high in the sky.

There were three triangular shaped, silverish-white objects with black bottoms. Each triangle was accompanied by serveral silver spheres. They bobbed slowly and noiselessly descending toward the park, but only close enough to make out the shapes and colors of the objects. We watched as two of the trianles flanked by several of the silver spheres moved to the left of us while the third triangle and its spheres moved around to the right of us. We watched them for approx. 10 minutes before they just disappeared without a trace. They made no noise or smoke. It was a clear day no clouds in the sky about 2 hours before sunset. It was awesome. I contacted the Fort Wayne Police Department,they had not received  any other reports.   I&apos;m a 46 year old married female,with over 20 yrs. of experience in electronics assembly and repair in the defense industry.I&apos;m a high school graduate with some college course work.((NUFORC Note:  We talked to this witness at length, and we found her to be quite credible and convincing.  Her written report and illustration are quite interesting.  We will attempt to post her illustration.  PD))", "Beautiful ball of light instills aweI was nine years old, sharing a room with my sister. It was about nine or so at night, November of 1991, we had been sent to bed for the evening and couldn&apos;t sleep. I have always been a &apos;skywatcher&apos; and had the venetian blinds pulled up. We were on the second story of an apartment duplex, overlooking a man-made &apos;lake&apos;. About thirty minutes after nine or so (it&apos;s hard to be sure of the exact time as I didn&apos;t have a watch and there were no clocks in the room) I saw what I at first assumed was a very bright &apos;star&apos; over the lake. As I watched, it began to speed at an incredible rate toward me. I woke my sister up, and we watched as it came closer and closer. It finally stopped at about five feet from our bedroom window, and was quite small. About the size of a VW beetle, at most. It made no noise as it hung there, and I remember saying over and over again &quot;Wow...wow...wow...&quot; neither me or my sister could believe what we were seeing. It might&apos;ve been saucer-like in shape, but was covered in many bright lights, which made it difficult to ascertain it&apos;s real shape. It had two &quot;appendages&quot; coming off the sides, which ended in two, very bright, bluish-indigo lights. Along the front it had the brightest yellow-white lights I&apos;ve ever seen in my life, but it did not hurt to look into them. It also filled me with a sense of incredible joy and awe, and I feel now as if I could&apos;ve spent the rest of my life just staring at this craft. There was no fear or apprehension whatsoever. About three hours later (by my best estimate) the thing left just as it had appeared- very quickly and suddenly. I felt numbed by the experience, but also deeply content. The reason I assume it was there for three hours was that, shortly after it&apos;s departure, my Mother entered our bedroom to check on my sister and I, and was irritated to find us still awake. It felt to have only &apos;visited&apos; us a few seconds, though, or at the most, minutes. Even though I was an incredibly skeptical child before this incident (and still am, for most things) thi! s event instilled in me a definite belief in the existence of ETs and an insatiable thirst for knowledge pertaining to UFOlogy. I have never reported this event officially before.", "A large circular craft with many different colored lights blinking around it (like they were windows or lights on the craft).The date is not acurate since I am reporting this from my childhood, about 22 years ago. On a clear night in the mid to late 70&apos;s, my brother and I observed a very large round strange craft with a rounded bottom and sharp circular edge and above that a row of various colored lights that seemed to light in circular fashion around the craft.  It had a smaller circular top.  We observed this object hovering over the tree line and were very disturbed by this since it was very different.  I don&apos;t remember what happened afterwards; I think it slowly drifted away.  At the same time (not sure if it was the same day) I was walking up some stairs and observed 2-3 bright spheres out the window making a pass over our house.  NO sounds were ever made by any of these objects.  I have heard other reports that these spheres have been seen entering and/or leaving a large craft like the one I described before.  Any other reports of these incidents at the time?((NUFORC Note:  Approximate date.  It is very difficult to report to a witness if anything similar was reported, unless an accurate time and date is known.  The time and date of an event are very important for comparison of possibly related events.

We were driving on a rough forest track from Newborough in Anglesey, to Llanddwyn beach. It was late Summer and it was about 6 pm in the early evening. There is a lot of airforce association with this part of the UK, and we were not far away from military No Go sites. Lots of the beachhead further along is used by the Airforce.Suddenly out of the blue, came a very large triangular shaped object, and I could see that it was very low over the trees and was obviously following us. It made no sound, and there were red lights flashing around its edge. It stayed with us until we reached the beach and then it shot off along the beach and disappeared. The next day I telephoned the R.A.F station and they said that they would come back to me once they had checked if there were any planes about at that time.They did come back to me, and there was not anything that they knew about in that area at that time. They confirmed that it was a UFO, and that other people had phoned in to say that there were sightings over Bangor city through that particular week. The 2nd time I saw a UFO was in 1975, and this was on a particlarly stormy evening. I was out with my small son and our dog, taking a walk on the mountain track that lay to the rear of our house. Suddenly I saw a cigar shaped object hovering over a large aerial that was on top of the mountain.Even though the wind was very bad and there were black storm clouds the object was static in the sky over this mast. I believe that the aerial or mast is used for radio and TV signals. The object then shot straight upwards at fantastic speed and disappeared out of my sight.", "twinkling star to naked eye, blue and red flashing lights, change shape in binocularsunusually twinkly star, not real bright.  Get binoculars, ex husband looks and says, Damn these binoculars work good. There&apos;s blue and red flashing lights coming from it.&quot; I looked and saw it to be a round shaped white light with flashing Blue light on the left side of object and red on the other.  Amazing to see, but could only see the distinct light through binocs, otherwise looked like a slowly moving satellite or star.  I look back about 2 -3 mins later, but the flashing lights were gone, now there was only a single red light sitting on top of the object!  Shocking and exciting to see!  I looked again 2 mins later, no red or blue lights at all and the shape of the white light had changed entirely.  For one it was not horizontal anymore, it was more vertical and now it was shaped like a long hotdog and pointed on an incline towards the heavens!  Weird, it was moving more and more away into space slowly and our eyes were tired.  I think it is a satellite, My ex husb. says satellites don&apos;t have blue lights on them or change shape.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know for certain what the witnesses observed, but it is reminiscent of a &quot;twinkling&quot; star.

We all got excited and walked over to the western edge of the parking lot to watch this light source behind the coluds in the west. It was the same size as a full moon behind the clouds. We talked excitedly as to what it could be and became excited as a rift in the clouds started to drift toward the light, we thought for sure then we would know. To our surprise and confusion the object moved to the other side of the rift in a split second, and you couldn&apos;t see it move across the rift just one second it was on one side of the rift the next second it was on the other side of the rift, it did that several times during the 6 minutes we watched it, I asked the guys if they would be against reporting this to NUFORC and they said that would be fine so one of the men, ((name deleted)) called right then and there while we were still witnessing the object but there was no answer. We continued to watch the object hover until another rift would come and then it would just jump over what looked like  5 inches from our perspective and then it would be still behind clouds we all watched as finally after al this it just blinked out. One of the other men and I swore a few times we saw some kind of flash come from the object through the clouds,it also seemd sometimes to have a greenish hue to the light . it was so weird...((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report, so we have not way of getting back to the witness(es) to request more information.

I drive up a little ways and something catches my attention out of the front left corner of my windshiled.At this time I only saw it for a brief moment.It was a series of lights that formed a circle, the lights were spaced apart evenly. I lost sight of it through some trees and tried to explain it away as a reflection, plane, or strobe light from an airport against something. I pulled up a ways and clearly saw it again, it seemed to be hoovering several hundred feet off of the ground but was moving south at a low speed. i stopped my vehicle right away and turned off my lights and motor and got out. i didnt see it again but i also heard nothing. Not a jet sound or anything. I am 38 years old and have been in the outdoors all of my life, camping, hunting, etc and this is the first time i have ever seen anything i couldnt explain.", "Huge circular orbs of flaming red light flew above the river right in front of me one night while I was camping.In October of 1977 I was camping along the Snake River at Hood Park which is right outside of Pasco, Washington. My companion and I had been in town visiting friends that evening and since we were both driving our own vehicles, I headed back to the campsite in my own car ahead of him. When I got to the campsite, our two dogs were frantic because their ropes were all tangled around each other and they wanted to be loose, so I walked over to where they were tied up and set them free. I grabbed some soap and a washcloth from the tent and started walking towards a water faucet that was about 40 yards from our tent. The dogs started racing around me in endless circles which I thought was strange because they were extremely excited and unusually rambuncious, but I just figured in that moment that they were just glad that I had gotten home to set them free. However, they were annoying me because they were getting in my way and I yelled at them to go play somewhere else and they took off in a flash. At that point I looked to my right towards the river and up to the sky. It was a brilliantly clear night, no moon, with lots of shining stars all around. As soon as I looked towards the sky, I stopped dead in my tracks because I was staring at two huge orbs of light that were silently cruising right above the river in front of me. They were not very high in the sky at all and were flying right above the river, about as high as a crop duster plane might fly if it was getting ready to position itself for the next pass over a field. I knew immediately that they were not of this world and I dropped to my knees. My mind started racing.....I was not afraid.....in fact, I began to mentally send my thoughts skyward with a million questions......&quot;who are you? Where are you from? What are you doing here? Are you who I think you are?&quot; and so on and so forth. These orbs of light were as big and as round as a full moon can sometimes look as it is rising low upon the horizon. I&apos;m talking huge here. They were definitley orbs of light, but as I stared at them I could see a slight outline behind the light that looked to me like an &quot;H&quot; shape, an &quot;H&quot; that was laying flat and flying. The light itself did not look like the kind of light that we are accustomed to. In other words, the light did not have a neon or artificial kind of quality to it. It seemed to have a life and energy of it&apos;s own. In fact, it reminded me of a burning coal....it had the same qualities and color and glow of a burning ember. The orbs of light also sparkled around the outer edges, similar to how a diamond sparkles when hit by rays of light, and they were exceedingly beautiful. So beautiful that my mind was overwhelmed by the greatness of their beauty and I just kept saying mentally &quot;you are so beautiful!!!&quot; These orbs of light (or celestial vehicles as I like to call them) were moving very slowly above the water, one in front of the other at exactly the same height in the sky. They made no sound, no sound at all. In fact, I was stunned at how quiet it was. They just flew by, right in front of my eyes, and then slowly made a 90 degree turn and headed towards the town of Pasco, the direction of which was going away from me, not towards me. As they continued to move away from me and away from the river, the orbs of light appeared to become one, but that was because one was right in front of the other and they were at the exact same height in the sky. At this point I was feeling extremely disappointed that they were leaving me behind because they had allowed me to see that they existed and I wanted to know much more about who and what they were. My mind began to cry out to them saying &quot;please don&apos;t leave me now that you have allowed me to see that you exist!&quot;....and then I started to pray, and I said to God, &quot;please Father, if these orbs of light are in some way connected to you, please give me a sign&quot;. Amazingly, as that thought and prayer left my mind, the two orbs of light, in unison, suddenly sprang into action and zipped through the night sky in an exact movement that left red tracers in the sky in the shape of a huge triangle. I burst into laughter at that point and said to God &quot;Oh Father!!! Is is too much for this tiny doubting soul to ask to see that one more time?&quot; and in immediate response to that request, the orbs of light zipped through the night sky again and left the red tracers of a huge triangle in the sky. At that point, they disappeared from view, and I rose up from my knees and started walking back towards my tent, but I swear to you that I did not feel the ground under my feet! I felt like I was walking on air. My companion had just gotten back to our campsite and his back was to me as I walked towards him, but he did not hear my approach, which I thought was strange since the night was quie! t and th ere were leaves all over the ground that should have been crunching as I walked, but even I did not hear the sound of my own footsteps. I walked right up to my companion and tapped him on his shoulder, and as he turned around, quite startled, I found myself trying to tell him what I had just witnessed, but my voice was barely a whisper as I felt as if I was under some kind of magical spell that I did not want to break. Unfortunately, my companion did not believe my story, and his disbelief made me decide to keep this experience to myself and I did not tell anyone about this event for another 10 years. I have only told my closest family members and friends about this and I admit, if I hadn&apos;t seen it with my own eyes, I would probably have a hard time accepting it as fact. But fact it was and is and even though I cannot prove that this ever happened, I know what I saw and experienced. This was not a vision or a hallucination.....this was a physical manifestation of something beyond this world and it was decidely celestial in origin. Since then I have continued to watch the night sky and have seen quite a bit of activity way up there where the satellites roam, but some of what I&apos;ve seen leads me to question whether or not it&apos;s all just satellite action up there as I have seen 3 to 4 white lights flying side by side going in various directions a number of times. I believe that we are not alone and it remains to be seen how this is all going to turn out. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell my story. I&apos;ve been carrying it around for a really long time. Take care and God bless....", "Unusual light formation moving extremely fast across the sky.Between 6:15 and 6:30 on the morning of October 10, 2000 my wife and I were walking our tow pekingnese dogs.

I was approaching the Fulton exit, less than a half a mile away, and it was about 2 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Weather was mostly blue sky, with a heavy wind gusting from left to right. I saw what appeared to be a metallic object with a tail, at about 10 o&rsquo;clock elevation and about 2 o&rsquo;clock to my right. It was moving right to left at one hellacious speed, and the tail seemed to flicker. The object was about half of a pencil eraser diameter at arms length, just enough size to make me think it was probably round, and the tail was about 1/2 to 1 hour of arc, trailing behind it. It only was visible for about half a second, and just when it was about to go over the highway, it seemed to disappear. I have no idea how big it was, or how far it was away. I think it was less than 1,000 feet from me, and less than 200 feet in altitude, but I am not sure. If it was farther away than that, it would have had to be really moving! I tried to fit it into some familiar object, and could not. It was not a balloon, because it going against the wind at a high speed. I don&rsquo;t think it was a stunt kite, because there is no place to fly one in that area, as far as I know, and because it went in a straight line. It did not reverse direction or stop as a kite would have to do. (I fly them myself, and it definitely didn&rsquo;t move the way a kite does.) Airplane or helicopter, no way. It did not resemble one in either appearance or the way it flew. As for a meteor, I have never seen one in broad daylight, and this object seemed to have more size than that. Also, every meteor I have seen has been going almost straight down, and I have only seen them at a much higher angle of elevation, while looking up, not straight ahead. The nearest thing I can fit it with is a &ldquo;rod&rdquo; which I have read about a few times on various web sites, but I am not sure about that either. I don&rsquo;t think it fits any of the classical descriptions of &ldquo;flying saucers&rdquo; or any kind of alien space craft, unless it was moving at a truly incredible speed, or was less than 3 feet in diameter. They usually don&rsquo;t have tails, as far as I have heard. Don&rsquo;t know...just a curious thing. If there are aliens, I wish they would fly things around here, it&rsquo;s kind of boring in Sacramento, most of the time. I never thought I would be sending you one of these things.

I was standing facing south. It was a clear night and the stars were very visible in the heavens.  From out of my right  came a formation of four to five objects, grouped closely together in flight, but clearly individual objects, traveling west to east straight across my field of vision.  Within 2-3 seconds they were clearly visible in the sky straight ahead of me.  They then paused, banked slightly and shot upward  to the south disappearing in the sky at about a 100 degree angle from where I first spotted them.  The objects seem to glide rapidly as opposed to &quot;flying&quot;.  There appeared to be no &quot;drag&quot; to the motion as one would expect if watching a plane make its way slowly across the sky.  Instead they glided effortlessly, silently and quickly like a shooting star. They paused in mid-air for only a fraction of a second before changing course.  When they banked and changed direction, they moved all as one unit.  Not one of the objects appeared to lose the slightest distance in its position to the other objects when turning.  They turned synchronized in perfect unison as if one unit.   Each object in the formation was very large (about the size of our moon in the sky), triangular to boomerang in shape and completely illuminated in a brilliant, but unusual white light -- as opposed to having lights &quot;on them&quot;.   When they paused for the split second and my mind could fully view and assimilate the formation of objects which had just sped into view before me, I had an incredible sense of awareness and knowledge that I was viewing something awesome and extremely technologically advanced.  I say this because of the speed and agility with which they glided across the sky; the fact there was no associated engine sounds; the ability of the pilots to fly in a formation so perfectly at the speed they were achieving; and the size of each object as compared to the stars and other objects in the sky.  I refer to  &quot;other objects&quot; because at the same time they were crossing the sky, there was a jet plane to my left traveling eastward.  Had the formation of objects continued on a straight line eastward, they would have passed just south of the position of the plane at a very close proximity.  In fact, I was hoping the plane passengers would see them also.  Instead the formation paused, banked and headed southward well out of view of the plane. When the objects turned, I saw the underside of each object and realized that the illumination of each object was emanating  at different intensity levels.   Hence, it was not a reflection of one object appearing as several, but in fact several.  When the objects turned they increased speed dramatically and disappeared from view in about the time it would take a person to blink their eyes.", "An adult female, camping in the Utah wilderness, reports she and a companion saw a bright light project a beam downward; mighttime, 10-Principal reporting witness is an unmarried, self-employed artist residing in Moab, Utah (pop.5000). She was previously employed as a Colorado River guide in which occupation she conducted group trips on the Colorado.  Witness is a college graduate, with a BA in fine arts. On the night of June 27, 2000, witness was enjying a recreational 10-day river trip with 3 other adults (dob 1951, 1958, &amp; 1984).  The four were camped on the bank of the Colorado River in a wilderness site known as Cataract canyon in Canyonlands National Park, UT. At approximately 10 PM (MDT) Witnesses were seated outside their tent, contemplating the evening.  Witness states none of the four had consumed any alcohol or other intoxicant that evening.  Witness states she cannot recall what oother two were doing .  THey may have been inside their tent or possibly reading using a flashlight.  In any case, they were not looking at the night sky and did not witness the event which unfloded. Abruptly, witness states, both she and other witness observed an extremely bright light at elevation 45 degrees to the north.  Witness variously described the apparent size as that of a quarter at arm&apos;s length and one-half the size of the full moon.  It was &quot;as bright as&quot; the full moon and did not vary in intensity of light, witness states.  On that evening, witness recalls no coulds, no wind, stars visible, and no moon. Investigator consulted an ephemeris and confirms that on the date and time in question, the moon was not visible. Witness states the bright object was white in color, surrounded by a white halo edged in blue.  As both witnesses watched, the object extended a white beam downward (left angled) to the canyon wall.  The white beam was edged in &quot;defused blue&quot;as was teh object.  Witness states she saw the beam&apos;s leading edge move downward and then retract, whereupon the object diasppeared.

So I suddenly realized that I was seeing some flying object, as it was advancing in the air very steadily (not high speed at all), and it looked like I was seeing the back of the object (nothing else showed). I could follow it for maybe 20 or 30 seconds, and then the orangy glow slowly disappeared as it moved further away towards the East. It was absolutely silent and didn&apos;t seem very high in the sky (unless it is a gigantic object).

I was facing south, when I looked up into the sky and noticed an object moving west to east.  It was very bright compared to the stars, but had the twinkling light quality of a star.  I thought that it probably was a satellite (or perhaps the space shuttle). It moved quite fast across the sky and disappeared within 15 - 30 seconds.  Then from behind my son and I (from the north) a triangular formation of six or more objects moved at a very fast speed toward the south (observable for only 2 - 3 seconds).  There were no lights on these ojbects.  They were a beige color and did not contrast very well with the dark sky.  They struck me as looking like a formation of geese, except  they moved way too fast and were very high in the sky.  In my memory, the object at the head of the formation was a degree or two out of line with the other objects following behind it.  I didn&apos;t see them long enough to make out their individual shape, but they were uniform.   At first, I thought I was seeing a spot light from the ground and so I was expecting the pattern to sweep back across the sky to the north, but the objects disappeared into the south.  It was then that I noticed a wispy vertical column moving at a comparable speed to the triangular objects, track across the sky in the same north to south movement.  There was no sound and and no light emanating from either the objects or the wispy column that followed them.  I watched the sky for a couple of minutes after the column disappeared into the south, and tried to figure out what it was I had seen.  I also was hoping that there would be more activity, but no other unusual effects or objects appeared. The pipeline right-of-way is located within 1/2 mile of the Strathcona Industrial Park where several large refineries create a considerable amount of light pollution, as do the housing developments that border the right-of-way on the east side.  Still, the sky was cloudless and dark enough that the big dipper was clearly visible when I was facing north in the right-of-way, as were the stars to the south.  It was also very easy to track the movement of the &quot;satellite&quot;, that I describe above, as it moved from west to east. I am curious if I saw a natural phenomenon, a light effect or a formation of military planes on a manouever?  What do you think?  My son saw all of these things as well, although when I asked him a few minutes afterward he couldn&apos;t describe any details.  He has the opinion that the objects may not be so easily explained as I think they probably are.  Thank you for providing this wonderful service.  I didn&apos;t realize the skies above Sherwood Park could be so exciting! Interestingly, the Canadian military base in Edmonton seemed uninterested.  They told me to call the RCMP.  The RCMP weren&apos;t able to help either  - &quot;What do they want us to do?  Chase it?&quot; was the response I got from them.  Hopefully, this is interesting to you.", "Silent, slow moving light that eventually took off very fast.I was going to guard duty one night while I was in Viet Nam.  We were on the mountain overlooking Da Nang.  About a dozen of us were standing around talking, while waiting to go to our posts.  One person spotted a light and pointed it out to all of us.  The light was changing colors and was unlike any light we had ever seen.  It moved slowly and quietly until it was almost over us.  It hovered for about 5 to 10 minutes.

At first it looked as if it was not moving at all. Over a period of 3-4 minutes, the object had clearly moved in an upward and easterly direction (approx. at a 45 degree angle from the horizon). This object was very far away. After a couple minutes of wondering what this was, I thought that it could possibly be the space shuttle taking off. Given the vast distance from Florida to Ontario, I did not really think that it would be possible to see. But that is how I would describe it. The fireball was stationary but shaky (much like a twinkling star but with a much greater intensity). The fireball was orange for about three minutes then it flickered to orange/white for about a minute and a half.

We Continued to drive towards the lights, which appeared to be a plane flying too low.  As we approached the lights, we thought they might be from an athletic field, however; as we approachedk even closer, we could clearly see a &quot;Stealth&quot; shaped aircraft (except that the ends of the wings curved inward toward the fusilage).  The aircraft appeared to be approximately the size of a passenger jet (big!!).  The aircraft hovered in mid air, approximately 200 - 300 feet off the ground, as we passed within 200 feet of its location over a field on the side of the highway, near a stand of trees.  There was no sound we could hear over the &quot;road noise&quot; of our van.  We were very exited and I turned our van around in the highway median and went back for another look.  The aircraft moved across the road in front of us and off in a northeast direction.  We lost sight of the aircraft as we drove by a stand of trees, and when we cleared the trees, the aircraft was gone.  The aircraft appeard to have three lights on the front of each wing which projected from the nose of the aircraft.  There was also a red blinking light in the middle of the plane.  At the time, we were six miles or so from the Dover Air Force Base. I think this may have been an experimental military jet, but I have never heard of a jet this large capable of hovering like a Harrier Jet.  Also, the lack of any discernable sound intrigued us.  We wanted to pass this &quot;sighting&quot; along in case others also report this sighting.

Then they gradually (over about 5 seconds) &quot;extinguished&quot; themselves.  Prior to extinguishing, we noticed a smaller fire ball (about half the size) descend downward below one of the two, as if suspended by a wire.  It descended to the ground in about a minute. Two possible explanations:  there are some natural gas wells in the vicinity, however I am not aware of any flare stacks.  We have driven this road numerous times and have never seen any flares.

The first time I thought that they were comets or metors of some sorts, but as i thought about it, they were following each other.  I live out in the country, away from the city lights. so i get a pretty good view of the sky.  The next time was about 3 days later, this time there were more going in the same direction  s.s.e. very fast high in the sky.  The next time was on October11th.

It had One oth! er light that was directly beneith the craft. The other two were more of a circle or globe with the tops smaller than the rest.

The migrant told him of a experience he had while working down in La Joya, TX for a rancher. La Joya is a very small town in a rural area near the Mexican border. One morning he went deer hunting.  As he was sitting in his deer blind he notice a &quot;flying disk&quot; coming from his right view and moving away from him very slowly. It stopped a few hundered feet from the blind and &quot;stood still&quot; a little bit, and then hid behind a small hill covered with brush.  He was very excited since he had never seen anything of this sort.  (He was a poor 50ish migrant worker that had never heard of ufos or aliens)  He jumped out of the blind and ran over to the area where he thought the disk had hid itself. He found nothing.  This went on for the next two days at nearly the same time of the morning. [ I don&apos;t know the exact time but deer hunting is done in the very early morning hours when the sun is just coming up 5am - 9am. ]  He never saw where it came from since a blind has only 2 to 3 openings about 3&quot; by 12&quot; on either side.  He mentioned to his boss, the ranch owner what he had been seeing.  The next morning to prove his story he invited his boss to go deer hunting with him.  As expected the disk flew by the blind and hid behind the same brushy hill.  They both got out of the blind.  His boss was scared stiff and white faced. He asked his boss to accompany him to find the disk. He said no and got into his truck and left. He, the migrant told my nephew this story because the disk reminded him of a plowing disk the type you would see at the end of a plowing tractor.  He never mentioned how big or small the disk was other than it flew just a few feet above the brushy ground. He also never mentioned if it made any sounds or if it had any colors or lights. There aren&apos;t to many hills in south Texas and if there are, there&apos;re very small. As I mentioned before this story is a little old but I thought it was very interesting.

First, it moved perfectly vertical, then perfectly horizontal, and then vertical, and so on, until it moved a great deal across the sky.  While this light was flying in this strange pattern, another bright yellow light appeared in the same spot that the original one had.  This started moving in the same pattern as the first one, but it did not travel as far neither vertically nor horizontally.  After a few seconds, it completly dissapeared.  After about a minute, another bright yellow light appeared in the same place.  Immediatly, it started move in the same direction as the other two, in a similar pattern, but this time more erratically.  It moved rapidly, and moved in the direction of other, stationary, flashing white lights.  It seemed to be flying in the direction of one light, then would change direction towards another light.  After about another minute, an airplane appeared over the horizon in the north west, and began to turn in order to alter it&apos;s course to follow the light.  After several minutes of the plane flying after the light, more airplanes began coming over the horizon from the north east in fairly regular intervals.

There were perhaps 3,000 other people present. Surprisingly, no else commented on what I saw, even though I tried to point it out to my wife and my sudden and excited words to her were no doubt heard by people sitting immediately around us--&quot;Look! Wow! Don&apos;t you see that?! You didn&apos;t see that?!&quot; Most of the seating was on the grass. At the time, I happened to be reclined and looking up at the sky (the time was about 2130-2200). Earlier, I had seen a few &quot;shooting stars.&quot;  The object--which looked like five lights forming a point--appeared suddenly, as if it were just there, many miles above me. (I am almost certain that the five lights formed a singular object. The position of the lights was too symmetrical and the object moved in perfect unison so as not to appear as multiple objects.) The individual lights emitted what I might describe as &quot;luminous radiation,&quot; and the points of light seemed to be &quot;connected&quot; by the same type of luminous radiation. It moved in the direction of the point (west); within 2 or 3 seconds it was gone, moving faster than anything man-made could move.

The path the shape followed was extremely erratic. The shape gradually moved closer until it was possible to make out this occurance as a starnge looking craft which looked nothing like a plane or airship.

Conditions: Daytime, low dark clouds, flat land on left side of highway leading to distant hill top of which seemed above the clouds. No sunlight visible. Window of car rolled down -no reflections possible. I was not wearing sun glasses. As I was gazing at this scenery a dark object came down out of the dark cloud, leveled off and shot up through the cloud. It&apos;s shape was of the inverted saucer on top of another saucer type. No rudder or wings visible and silent. I shouted to my friend who was from Petersborough, Canada to look. I don&apos;t think he saw it as he wore rather thick glasses and had never driven a car. I would judge the distance from us to the object with the hill in the background to be not more than one mile. I had been in and out of the marines twice. Had observed dive bombings along the western shore of the Red Sea and straffing and bombing in Korea, all these planed clearly had wings and rudders as well as very audible engines.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

He descirbed it as &quot;two saucers put together&quot; and stated it had lights around the edges. He was in a truck at the time and his friend was in a tractor, and both saw it. My grandpa is experianced in aeronautics, having been a pilot and a avid aerospace hobbiest. He had no prior belief in UFOs as far as I know and my grandma still does not believe in UFOs, even after his sighting.

I took some still photographs of the object but ran out of film. Plus I was shaking so bad I know those photos probably won&apos;t be that good. So I hauled butt upstairs and got the video camera. I got to film this object for at least three minutes before it passed over the roof of the townhome. The battery to the camera was dead so I had to use the ac adapter and film it out of the window. After it passed overhead I went downstairs and watched it for another five minutes. It floated and move very high in the sky and appeared to stop, but it continued to rotate. I could clearly see it rotate and change color from white to like a brownish color. I could have contiued to watch, but it was very sunny and my neck was hurting from looking up so long, so I went back inside. Later I was having a smoke out of the window when I noticed another plane leaving a trail in the sky I noticed high up to the west another of these strange objects, so I ran downstairs and tried to image that object as well. But it was too small and the camera would not focus on the blue sky. But I can verify it was the same thing, It was rotating and changing color like the other object, it might have been the same one. I saw it rotate to my left and it dissapeared.((NUFORC Note:  We do not understand how witnesses are able to distinguish the alleged &quot;chemtrails&quot; from genuine contrails.

I stepped out on my front porch at approx. 8 pm and looked up to see how clear the sky was, and saw what I initially thought was a single small cloud, but symmetrical with a sort of cresent or chevron shape, moving from directly overhead to due South.  It was moving in a straight line from North to South but much faster than a cloud and did not change shape until it disappeared beyond other houses.  There was no noise, no distinguising lights.  It appeared the size of my thumb and forefinger extended at arms length and would have traveled from horizon to horizon in less than 15 seconds. I do not know the altitude, so actual size and speed would be impossible to determine. I thought perhaps it had been one of these rotating ground spotlights, but it moved in a straight line rather than an arc, there were no clouds to reflect off of, no beam, and it never came around again.

At first I thought it was maybe a signal flare or something, but quickly ruled that out because there was no smoke or fluctuation of intensity and it wasn&apos;t falling at all.  I then thought maybe a new radio or communication tower had been built, but then realized the light was too high and too bright.  It also wasn&apos;t flashing like the strobes on many towers, although the light had the brightness and intensity a strobe.  The two things that made me realize this was something extraordinary were its intense brightness and its utter motionlessness.  The light appeared to pulsate slightly, but that could have been the result of atmospheric conditions.  The air was somewhat humid, though not really hazy. I watched the object for 3 to 4 minutes until it dimmed substantially and suddenly began to move off toward the east.  I don&apos;t know if the light went dim because it turned or if it in fact dimmed.  In any event, it became much more difficult to see as it began to move.  It didn&apos;t speed away but rather moved off at a fairly steady, smooth pace until it was no longer visible.   It was much smaller appearing after it began to move, probably because it became a dark object rather than a light one.  On the move, it appeared to be a sort of pea-shaped object, maybe slightly oblong, but mostly roundish. There was no noise associated with it at all.

The place was Warwick, Rhode Island, the Buttonwoods/Appanoag Section.  It was sometime late at night or early morning.  My parents were sleeping. I went to the bedroom window.  I observed round (like a ball) light, slowly decending to the ground.  The distance I&apos;d guess was about a city block away.  Since I was a child, I said to myself, &quot;Oh a plane light fell off&quot;. I had not heard of UFO&apos;s, etc. The next day I went to my babysitter&apos;s house.  I told he about the &quot;red plane light&quot; in a nonchalantly way.  It was not a big deal to me.  The babysitter&apos;s husband, worked at TF Green airport in Warwick about a mile away.  When I recall his uniform it had decoration like an Airforce uniform.  I guess he might have been in the service somehow.  The babysitter told her Husband what I saw. The Husband came home and I overheard him telling his wife there was a lot of phone calls about the red light and that no airplanes lost lights.  He proceeded to question me about it.  I simply told him that I saw an airplane light fall. He made a phone call and then returned to work. As an adult now, I realize that an airplane light, if it fell off a plane, would not still be lighted up red.  I researched old newspapers for any mention of this incident.

Object was seen for up to 30 mintues high up over south downtown SF.Bright shiny objectWe are  entertainers  for kids and  was playing at a brithday party.My name is  ((initials deleted)) .and my wife name is ((name deleted)).When we  finished the party and started to pack up my partner and wife in the act asked me what was that in the sky. My self and another guy said we did not know.At first the 3 of us  thought it was a ballon,but we agreed that ballons don&apos;t hovverThen we went through the usual supects,a plane, helicopter. At that point others begin to become interested in the object .We were in San Franciso close to downtown.We were in a backyard of a rec center,facing the bay. To the left of us if we&apos;re facing the bay was  the south part of downtown SF. This is where we saw this object sitting still in the sky.It was really high up in the sky so i decided to go and get my binoculars.I zoomed in as close as i could.It looked  like a shining egg just sitting there by this time some 5 mintues had past.Other witnesses started to use the binoculars,they describe a similar sighting. Older kids maybe ages 12 -15 took a look.I knew their eyes was better than mine .They reported seeing a red fireball.I was stunned.We all Begin to take looks, by this time the damn thing begin to move slowly toward the direction of the Bay Bridge. It was still pretty high because i remember first thinking it was a star in the daytime.Anyway I was looking but i did not really see it move, it was like you know it move but when?Next thing we know it had change locations.This is about 15 minutes into this sighting.Once it took another location i took another look and i swear it had lights on the outside of the object flashing.I must confess that i am a Peter Davenport and Art Bell fan but i did&apos;nt expect to see this.At arms length i could not cover this object up.By this time most everyone knew  something special was going on.Then all of a sudden there were 2 objects.It was like it had split into. All concerned were amazed. This was about 20 mintues into the ordeal.Of course out of all the years we&apos;ve been doing family events this is maybe th! e first time no one had a video camera at the party.At this the second object started to curise right above our heads.One little girl started to say this is scareing me.If it was it 1oclock over the Bay Bridge it headed  toward 4or 5oclock over our heads.When it was right over our heads i took a look in the binoculars and i saw a red plusating craft.I felt really strange. It really hit me that we could be witnessing other dimensions.Most people had that feeling.Anyway the 2nd object headed our way pasted over and went about what seem to be another 2 miles away hovvering over some trees.While the 1st object is still over the direction of the Bay Bridge.The 2nd object over the trees is just there and then it seems the 2nd object spilt into 3rd object but only briefly,maybe once or twice. After about  5mintues or so the 2nd just vanished.Now with our breath taken away, we focused our attention on the first object.It was still there but one weird thing was . We could see the object with our naked eyes as before but now when we tried to see the object in the binoculars we could not find it.It seemed transparent,strange. Then we looked away for a few seconds and looked back and it was gone.We were lost for words.30 mintues is a long time to witness a sighting.We just wonder did anyone else see it.

S..  PD))Cursor shaped objects over SW MichganOver the past week in the skies over SW Michigan we have been subjected to heavy contrail spraying.  This was my reason for watching the sky.  With my binoculars and video camera ready I watched and taped as continuous streams of high flying aircraft left trail after trail in all directions.  There has been a constant sound of distant jet roars in the sky but with no visible craft and this over a fairly rual area. This day though the sound was much louder and followed shortly by the sound of a low level helicopter.  While trying to get the helicopter on my video camera I noticed strange movements from behind the haze of a contrail directly overhead. After several unsuccessful attempts to focus in on the object with the camera I opted for the binoculars.  Looking in the direction of the roars I saw something move across my field of vision so I tracked along with it and could not believe my eyes. My first impression was that it was a bird soaring in a thermal but then it began to move in the sky so fluidly and was then joined by two similar craft and then performed a beautiful aerial display and crossed huge expanses in the sky seemingly accelerating and decelerating at will and turning on a dime. I was just recently at the Chicago Air show and watched the Blue Angels do their stuff and it does&apos;nt even come close to what I witnessed.  My entire world has been rocked by this experience and I cannot seem to let it go as nothing.  My original reason for watching the sky that day was to gather evidence of contails on tape and stumbled upon this with an open mind and have been completly convinced of the existance of something in our skies.  I have some very interesting video that has freaked many people out but without the ability to see it frame by frame I don&apos;t know what I have here.  Many good detectable objects in the sky moving in strange ways but due to distance and speed of the objects focus is less than perfect. Some appeared to be similar to a cursor shape and some disc shaped objects that reflect su! nlight a nd have stealth type obscurity with different positions.  Now that I have seen this and know where to look when you hear the sounds in the sky I have seen this 3 seperate times and I feel that my eyes deceive me.  It is as though the contrais are acting as shield to try to obscure what is happening above. I&apos;m frightened and feel that this was of significance enough to report it here.", "Well, me and my friend were out watching the stars and then we saw one big glowing light that was pretty bright. We wathced that one for several minutes just playing around in the sky. After a few more minutes we saw a second appear. From our view it seemed as if they were just playing with one another. After a few minutes of wathcing those two a third object appeared and seemed to be doing the same.  We tried to get a camera but we did not succeed. They were in the sky to the left of us but we could make out thier shape and size very easily. They were about the size of a large cow. We watched them longer and then they seemed to hit the ground and came right back up and then disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness implies the night of 06AU00.

They said it wasnt cold out so why were they showing up?  I told them the higher you go the colder it gets.  That is ho you can tell if a jet is real high or if it is low.  We then saw a smaller crat (UFO) that appeared to be higher than the jet.  The jet was flying west and the smaller craft was heading north and it crossed behind the jet.  I thought it was kind of weird for a small plane to be that high and continued to watch it.  I was steering the boat we were on and turned to make sure we werent going to hit anything and turned around and looked to continue to watch it and didnt see it anywhere.  The craft wasn&apos;t flying mach 1 or anything like that so it couldn&apos;t have flown out of sight.  The jet was still visible but yet the other object had seemed to just disappear.  The object was dark gray in color, cigar shaped, and it looked like it had two big circles on the side.  There was no contrail behind it.", "Near miss - a UFO shot out from under our MD-80 and made a ninety degree turn off our right wing.My wife and I were on a TWA MD-80 from Phoenix, through St Louis to Cleveland, Ohio in May of this year (2000). As we were approaching Cleveland from the west, it was night (nearly midnight), but there must have been a full moon as we could clearly see the clouds below and around us. I don&apos;t think we had really begun our decent yet. We were sitting on the right side of the plane and were both looking out the window at the clouds, when suddenly something crossed our path. The MD-80 didn&apos;t even wiggle, so I don&apos;t know if they saw it. It came from our left and shot out from below and forward of our plane, going off to the right. I would say it was about 50 yards off our wing and forward of us. It lifted it&apos;s right side, then it smoothly lowered the right and lifted it&apos;s left side, and then  shot past us going in the opposite direction of our plane. This whole maneuver took about 3 second to accomplish. It was almost in slow motion, but it accelerated past us very quickly. We saw the following: 1.    No obvious wings 2.    It was rounded across the front 3.    It was more or less flat (not like paper) but it definitely had a low profile. 4.    There were no vertical stabilizers or fins. 5.    The tail appeared to be sort of flat not rounded like the front. 6.    It was sort of oblong (not round like a saucer). 7.    There were no obvious individual lights, but the whole craft glowed with a brilliant white light. 8.    There were no engines visible. 9.    We saw nothing that would suggest an exhaust or jet nozzle. 10.  We could hear nothing, but then we were in an MD-80 going 500mph at the time. 11.  We saw nothing that looked like numbering or letters of any kind. This was all amazing enough to see, but what was really amazing I did not realize until it was over and I had a chance to think about it some. This thing crossed our path and completed nearly a ninety degree turn to the right which in itself was amazing enough, but the really amazing part was that during the approximately three seconds it&apos;s took to make that turn, the MD-80 we were in (which by the way was traveling about 500 mph at the time) did not speed past this thing. It made this maneuver almost suspended in that position. We saw it commence that maneuver in the same position out the window that we saw it complete it. It was like we had not moved forward at all. I know we did, but can&apos;t imagine why this craft was visible to us for so long in the same position. I suppose perhaps it was larger than it appeared and perhaps farther away which might explain it&apos;s lengthy stay in that position, but I don&apos;t think so. When it was over, we looked at the others in the plane to see if anyone else had seen it and I doubt anyone else was even awake. Nobody said anything about it, so we felt it was best not to mention it then. We didn&apos;t want others to laugh, but the longer we thought about it, the more we wanted to speak up. We did tell our relatives in Ohio when we arrived, but I don&apos;t think they really believed us. I personally have always believed that the universe is too large and deliberately constructed to belong to only us. I have always thought if we were the ultimate in intelligent life, the universe was really in trouble, so UFOs were never out of the question for me. I had never seen one before and may not have now, but I always had an open mind. My wife on the other hand is oriental and is not at all open to science fiction, or anything else like that.

As I walked through our sliding glass door, I noticed a funny looking light about three to five thousand feet above the center of the city of Pueblo.  This distance was about a mile from my house.  From plain eyesight, the color of the object was opaque.  It was like an opal in the sky.  Furthermore, it stood stationary in the sky with no movement for a duration of ten minutes.  I unpacked my binocular and took a second look. Wow, this was incredible, a triangle shaped craft with three bright dots inside, one in each corner.  I then unpacked my spotting scope and viewed the object. Double WOW, this was one of the most amazing objects I&apos;ve ever seen. Of course there were no stars out at this time, so it wasn&apos;t that. Furthermore, the object remained stationary for ten minutes, which eleminates an aircraft. About the time I zoomed in on the object for a second time it took off at a high rate of speed. I took my eye from the lense and followed it from about three thousand feet to about fifty to seventy thousand feet in a matter of two seconds, counting one one thousand two one thousand.

This happened approx in Oct. 1975.  I was 19 years old.  It was in the middle of the night, I was sleeping - I was suddenly aware that I appeared to be outside of my house and looking down at my house, I remember seeing the roof of my house and the street below me, then I saw a silvery side of a disk shaped classic flying saucer - my condition was not at all what I would call normal, I felt I wasnt simply dreaming - it had a very real aspect yet I was sort of out of touch with what was happening, a good description was I felt like a bystander - which is hard to describe or even understand.  I next recall encountering a man, and United States Air Force officer in full uniform, he had black hair and seemed alittle angry - He spoke as an american english, slighly overweight, and was yelling at &apos;others&apos; later I think I may have said something to this person and he was mad because I was &apos;awake&apos;? - I seemed to be floated around inside what appeared to be the outer parimeter of this craft and placed on some sort of operating table.   Then I had the awareness that they were performing some sort of brain operation! - this caused me TONS of mental and spiritual discomfort, anguish and FEAR... I felt that during this time I was outside my body and was watching from behind the &apos;surgeons&apos; - I was incredulous and shocked at this experience wondering AT THAT TIME was this really real? was it really happening?  I recall hearing their voices, but I dont know what they were saying. That seems to be the extent of it, or at least, it is all that I recalled happening.  I &apos;awoke&apos; the next day fully aware of what I had just experienced and KNEW that there was NO WAY I could EVER reveal this to ANYONE EVER... It was just too incredible.  I was very scared at the whole experience.  This happened in 1975, October.  Years later, when I read Whitely Striber&apos;s Communion, I had a terrible shock that this &apos;dream&apos; may have not been a dream after all, and could have been a real experience, it was one line he inserted in his book at the end of a chapter he said somthing like: &apos;they implanted something in my brain!&apos;  THAT realization, that my experience may have been TRUE was almost too much for me to handle...

Mary Tyler Moore (NOT a re-run) was on TV at the time. It was just past dark, probably in early summer. I think the show &quot;Canon&quot; was coming on. These were my favorite TV shows at the time. I lived with my grandparents at the time, and was probably about 18 or 19 years old. I&apos;m 45 now. This would have been about 1975, I guess. My grandma, grandpa, and I were home. Grandpa has passed away now, and Grandma had a severe stroke, so I am the only one who can tell about this incident. We lived in the country, 7 miles from town, so the window curtains were up (we never closed them at night.) The weather was clear and warm. It should be noted that some very high voltage electric lines run across our farm. (We have experienced several strange phenomena besides what I describe here.) I also want to note that we frequently walked around outside the house at night, to feed animals, get things from the car, bring in clothes off the clothes line, and so forth. On really nice nights, we sometimes sat in chairs on the porch and watched the stars. So we were all familiar with the ordinary things you see at night, from our farm. For example, you can see the lights from houses of distant neighbors, and even lights that are probably part of a nearby town. But what we saw on this night was very different. I had my back to the window while watching TV. Grandpa sat across from me, facing me, and grandma was probably in the kitchen. Just then, a bright flash of light appeared outside. It was so bright that I saw it despite having my back to the window. My cousin later told us that she too had seen a bright flash of light outside from my Aunt&apos;s house, which is about a mile away. None of us ever thought this was lightening, and there was no thunder -- no sound at all. Grandpa got up and went outside. He thought something on our electrical pole had shorted out. We had been having problems with it for a few days. Grandpa came running back in, looking terrified. &quot;Strange lights, strange lights!&quot; He screamed. I had never before nor after seen Grandpa acting like this. He was one of the quietest and most calm people you&apos;ve ever known. Grandma and I ran outside. In the distance, maybe a quarter mile away, were the lights. There were several rows of red lights, stacked one on top of the other. These appeared to be in a field, about two farms distant from us. They were not in the sky; i.e., this was not a flying object but something on the ground. If I have to describe an overall shape, I would say a cigar, because the &quot;object,&quot; if it was one, was much longer than it was tall, from our point of view. If this was an object, it would have to be very large. I would say as much as 40 or 50 feet across. To me it looked as if all the many lights were distinctly separate from one another, in about 3 or 4 rows. A row across the bottom, then another row above, then another above, like well-spaced Christmas tree lights. They appeared to flicker, twinkle, or possibly rotate -- we were far enough away that I couldn&apos;t tell for sure. I know that if you stare long enough at a distant light on a dark night, it can appear to twinkle. We watched this thing for a long time, all expressing our views on what it was. Grandma thought a bunch of people had parked their cars, leaving the taillights on. Neither Grandpa nor I thought that was possible. After all, we were way out in the country and that would mean about 30 or 40 cars, all facing the same way, had somehow gained access to the neighbor&apos;s private property and left their lights on. We speculated that it might be something on fire, but the lights seemed too evenly spaced for that. In retrospect, it seems weird that none of us thought of calling the Sheriff or anything. I think it was just too bizarre and we were in too small a town and didn&apos;t want to be in the news or get laughed at. There had been a recent incident of a light following two girls home, and 16 people witnessed the light. This made the local newspaper. Also, there was a &quot;cattle mutilation&quot; in the next town, which also made the news. My grandparents really didn&apos;t want to be in the news, I think. But this does show a recent record of strange occurrances. Grandma and Granpa wanted to get in the truck, drive down the road in that direction, and see what this thing was. I myself had read a lot of UFO abduction stories in paperbacks of the time, and I was very frightened to get any closer. I really was a fraidy cat at the time, and I actually pulled them out of the truck and wouldn&apos;t let them go. I deeply regret that now, no matter what had happened. So we continued to watch this thing, and then suddenly it just disappeared. Like all the lights had turned off. Throughout this incident, we never heard a noise of any kind. We continued to look over there a while, then gave up and went into the house. ------- I want to add another, totally different incident here. We&apos;ve had a history of seeing &quot;strange lights&quot; on the farm, dating back to the turn of the century. My grandpa grew up there, and he and his brothers used to jump on mules to chase lights that appeared and disappeared in various places.  I heard these stories all my life, but had never witnessed this for myself. In 1984, I saw these lights for myself, along with my brother, sister-in-law, and mother. My brother, sister-in-law, and I were outside at night. Grandpa was having surgery and the family had all gathered. We were outside that night looking at the stars and talking. There were two australian shepherd dogs on the farm, and they suddently went racing off into the nearby pasture, which belongs to a neighbor. Thinking they were chasing the neighbor&apos;s cows, I walked over to call them back. I heard a noise like a crying baby. This is also the sound a rabbit makes when it dies. So I stood by the fence, thinking I was hearing a rabbit&apos;s death cry. (Let me note that those two dogs were NOT hunting dogs and I had never known them to hurt other animals, so this seemed strange to me.) Anyway, the dogs suddently came charging back towards me, through the fence, and got behind me. I no longer could hear the strange sound. I looked over the fence thinking maybe the neighbor&apos;s bull was chasing the dogs back toward me. What I saw was a red light, which rotated slowly. It illuminated everything in its path as it turned -- the trees, grass, etc. were all very clear. It seemed to hover a few feet above the ground, and I could not see anything supporting the light, holding the light, etc. This light was only about 50 feet or so from where I was standing, and though I could see everything the light illuminated, I saw nothing supporting the light itself. The other weird thing was that the dogs were not barking. These were very, extremely aggressive dogs when it came to strangers. One of these dogs had bit several people. The other dog had such a fierce bark that most people were afraid to get out of their cars until you called the dog off. But neither dog was barking or growling. I went to get my brother and sister-in-law and they came over to see this light. We were standing there talking about what it might be, when it went out. We started to walk back toward the house when the light re-appeared, only now it was farther away, down by the barn. At this point, my sister-in-law must have run to get my mother. I walked down towards the barn to get a closer look at this light, when it disappeared again. Very quickly, it re-appeared much further away, way out in the neighbor&apos;s field, this time at least 100 to 200 yards from the barn area where we had just seen it. I was so busy watching this light that I didn&apos;t realize my mother also saw it, until we discussed it later. Finally, the light disappeared and did not return. We never figured out what could have caused this light. Later, when Grandpa got out of the hospital, we told him about it. He just laughed, shook his head, and said, &quot;Oh. They&apos;re back.&quot;", "white light and a dull red light followed by a whitelight changed to one light and disapearedwhile trick or treating my son and daughter and my self happened to look up to the sky at my sons request he asked if that was a ufo just then the two balls of light shot across the sky at such a high rate of speed , now i used to work on jet aircraft for the navy for 20 years and i never saw any thing that even came close to what i witnessed it streaked across the sky and shot verticaly straight up and vanished right before our eyes the third person , a lady stated &quot;oh my lord&quot; we look at each other and she said did you see that.yea now i&apos;m a sceptic and i don&apos;t believe in u.f.o.&apos;s but i can&apos;t believe what i saw tonight nor can i believe it ,.but i had to say something,... right....", "A  vary fast moving Jupiter size light, looking north in central Indiana going east to west for about 6-10 seconds.While my neighbor and I were walking the kids trick or treating, I looked north and saw what seemed to be at a far distance looking to be the size of Jupiter.

As I looked up and seen this object, I had to focus and realize what I was seeing, I then pointed it out to my neighbor who then saw it for several seconds. This was absolutely not a plane. Plus, there was no meteor tail at all to be seen. I spend a many nights outside looking up for any thing that moves, and have never seen anything move at that rate besides a meteor moving a bit faster. But the length of the movement was much longer than any meteor I&apos;ve seen.", "Silver spheres that appeared then quickly disappeared...I am not totally sure if it was alien activity.  I believe it was because of something I read.  I was looking into the sky and I saw a silver ball flash very quickly and it disappeared.  I had read an article once on how you can communicate with it telepathically.  In my mind I said appear again and it did.  Then I asked if it was alone, then alot of the silver balls appeared but disappeared in the matter of seconds.  I saw it from Jersey City, but it was over the Manhattan skyline.  I asked it to appear again and nothing happened.  I asked several of my friends if they had seen any weird actvity in the sky at about that time.  They all said no.

The storm had high winds and there was something about the air that night that was different.  The storm had ended and we were approaching a plateau where the high school is located.  There is two high objects there on this plateau, the water tower and two grain silos. As we were making the approach, I noticed a light hovering above the grain silo&apos;s.  This light was round in shape and looked like the same light as fire.  It hovered above the twin silo&apos;s.  My brother then noticed the light and asked me if I saw it too. We didn&apos;t know what it was.  As were got within 500 yards, it began to move and did not make any noise.  I began speeding toward the object as if we had scared it.  I approached 85 miles an hour and seemed to catch up to it. It was as if it had not wanted us to get closer.  It began to speed up more quickly. When the object seemed to have the ability to go over the horizon, I began to be disappointed.  I flashed my auto lights and honked the horn.  It seemed to wait at the horizon. My brother and I had to drive down into a valley and up another hill to where this horizon was located.  My brother was deathly afraid and I wanted to make some kind of contact.  We drove around on top of this hill and I had the feeling that something or someone was around.  That was the last time that I saw this object.  However, my brother drives a newspaper route in the morning and he states that he has saw it again.  I can&apos;t confirm it but I know what my brother and I had seen.  I had thought it was ball lightning but it acted as if it was hovering above the silo with intent.

It was heading to the Southwest projecting a small tail of white fire. It was bright white and about 50 degrees above the horizon. When it reached the zenith of its trajectory, some part of it fell off like molten white hot steel dripping to the ground. I didn&apos;t see anything really unusual about it. I figured it was a meteor or space debris skipping the upper atmosphere. It disappeared about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon in the southwest, which made me think it went back into space or burned up.", "a point of light which flew zig-zags, loops and back and forth over an area of minnesotas north woods.  it was nearly midnight.standing on a dock in a bay of lake vermillion i was star-gazing when i saw a distant light to the north a few degrees above the distant treeline. my immedite feeling was fear, the light was zig-zagging at about the rate an airplane might fly and it looked like it was lost, searching for a landmark in the darkness and so i feared for the plane&apos;s safety. as i watched the plane turned around and headed back to where i first saw it, but this time without zig-zagging. it then zig-zagged in an ascending way, flew what appeared to be a few degrees off of heading in my direction and gradually did a series of 3 loops. this was followed by a long, straight flight back in the same direction as the first zig-zag, and a straight flight back to near where it did loops. by now i was so fascinated i turned to look in the boat for my binoculars and when i turned back, the light was gone.  there was no strobe,  just a constant point of white light.  it kept a steady speed.  there was no sound.  i looked at maps the following day and there is very little development in this section of northwoods.  my rational mind says it was a pilot out for a midnight joyride.  most planes here are seaplanes.  what do you think. please answer.", "i saw a bright light rising very slowly by a tree.It was some time is august around the 3rd.

They had lights like a car but their ship could hover in the air. I could see the whole spacecraft and the top looked just like a cymbal from a drumset. It had ridgeds and no windows, that I determined on top. We were in the middle of Damrascotta Lake, and the ship moved torward the egde of the lake bed. It was beautiful , so much that I row the boat towards the craft. My sister and brother, 8 and 12 were getting very scared. Mind you, we were in a canoe. But I wanted to get a close- up of the U.F.O.  The technology was very advan- ced on the bottom of the craft.

The aircraft moved across the road in front of us and off in a northeast direction.  We lost sight of the aircraft as we drove by a stand of trees, and when we cleared the trees, the aircraft was gone.  The aircraft appeard to have three lights on the front of each wing which projected from the nose of the aircraft.  There was also a red blinking light in the middle of the plane.  At the time, we were six miles or so from the Dover Air Force Base. I think this may have been an experimental military jet, but I have never heard of a jet this large capable of hovering like a Harrier Jet.  Also, the lack of any discernable sound intrigued us.  We wanted to pass this &quot;sighting&quot; along in case others also report this sighting.  There were many cars on the road at the time, and we are sure that many other drivers must have seen the aircraft.  I reported the sighting to the Delaware State Police the next morning. I am hoping that someone can identify this sighting as a specific military airplane, as we are interested in researching this aircraft.  Maybe its not as uncommon as we think, but we&apos;ve never hear of, or seen anything like this.

About 3 miles outside of Saint Joseph city limits, above the trees there was a 3 dimensional reflective rectangle in the air, not moving, approximately 5 miles away. The reason we were able to see the object is that the sun was setting in the west, and the object was in the north.  Thus, the sun was reflecting off the object. A few seconds later, the object turned clockwise, and was very difficult to see, because of the loss of reflection.  A few seconds later the object disappeared. I am a pilot, and the object I saw was not a commercial aircraft.  The object was too large an not moving.", "A silent triangular object around 60 feet corner to cornerOpen countryside at night, so colour was not evident. It was only around 50 yards away and only 50 yards high. I thought it might have been some new kind of millitary machine, but it was completly silent other than a whoosh of air as it changed from a stationary mode to a low level flight path. It shot accross a field after hovering for about 10 seconds and then out of sight. At first I thought it was &quot;human&quot; because it had a red light in each corner of the triangle, but the 60 or so foot span and the silence of the object was very strange [I had my car windows down] No other reports were made in the area to the best of my knowledge.", "grey and white hovering Y shapeI am an Inspector for the ((name and type of organization deleted)).  While driving to work today, I observed something I was unable to identify.  I was westbound on Hwy. 50, approximately 8-10 miles from Sedalia.  This would be the vicinity of Smithton, MO.  I noticed a shape in the sky ahead of me.  Clouds had just moved into the area and it had sprinkled rain.  The shape was over an open field to the South of the highway by approximately 100 feet.  I noticed a grey shape just a little darker than the clouds and no movement to it.  It appeared to hover.  I was driving at or about the speed limit of 60 m.p.h. and observed the object for a total of possibly 15 seconds.  The color wasn&apos;t a shiny metallic, but seemed to be shades of white and grey.  The shape of the object was that of a &apos;Y&apos;.  There was a fuselage and a wing coming off each (back?) side in the slanted position.  I saw no propellors, rotors, or &apos;engine&apos; type parts.  It seemed to be somewhat larger than an ultralite, about the size of a small plane.  The object appeared to hover, as I could detect no movement. This area is approximately 15 miles WSW of Whitman Air Force Base in Knob Noster, MO. A co-worker who drives in from the West told me he saw a black helicopter hovering just before he got to work. Our work place is roughly halfway between my sighting area and the AFB.  There is also an airport for small aircraft in the area. This was not any airplane I have ever seen (and I have seen many of all types).((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.

When it went out I could barely make out a small light that was dimmer than a very distant star and much smaller than an airplane.

We were three fisherman that evening fishing in our secret fishing spot on the jauques cartier river by shannon and the military base.  We have never publicly reported this sighting since we fishing on the wrong side of the fence, inotherwords at the first bridge on the military base valcartier.  The great thing is that we were three witnesses that seen this incrideble sighting.  This was the last legal trout fishing day and even though we were fishing on the wrong side of the fence this sighting could of been seen from the shannon side off the fence.  So from my opinion this has nothing to with the military and I claim this because of a different reason which I mention in this report in detail since I was the only one to see this. And I will wait and see if somebody seen something similar inorder to make sure that hoaxters wont use this part of information. Now me and my friend are writing this report together to get the details as accurate as possible.  Our third friend has moved a few years ago, so he is not with us for now.  So at 12 minutes after 9 that night it was a crystall clear night.  There were so many stars out that night and not one single cloud in the sku.  There was absolutely no wind and it was starting to get cold.  All of a sudden my friend shouts out to me and my other friend hey look at that wow. So I looked at the northwesterly direction and there was this very precise white ligtht slightly larger than the north star, bigger than any star in that present night sky full of stars, so there is nothing blurry about this light.   And when I seen this way high up in and coming so incredibly fast the power and speed is just out of this world, I Immediately knew that this is it.  I have worked as a dog handler in west germany for the british of the rhine and I was out for many nights with my dog and I have seen many meterites and have more experience than most people with meterite sightings, and this is why I knew that this is it.  My two friends were afraid a little but I had the instant reaction of looking at my watch for the time and in my head I said that I am not going to blink my eyes once.  Believe me I had tears running down my eyes by the time this was over. So this light came in so fast and slowed down to a complete halt right above our heads, I was so happy inside off me because I instantly knew I was dealing with the real thing.  And it stayed there immobile without moving at all.  this maybe for a good 6 minutes.  If we didn,t see it coming we would of never noticed it because with so many stars out that night it was very well camouflashed in a sense.  But right from the beginning off this whit lights stop I pulled out my bic lighter and was jumping up and down and shouting at it hey come down come, and my friends stopped me because they were really scared at this point.  But I wasn,t  I am the type of guy that would jump right into the saucer with them were this to happen.   I respect all life in the universe, and I believe this is very important and a very evolved way of thinking.  I would like to mention that humankind may not reach this goal with the way we treat our enviroment and wildlife.  Mankind may need another 20,000 years or so of research in order to be technologically adavanced enough to surpass the speed off galactictic expansion. Anyways I respected my two friends, and to be honest I had a little heart beat myself.  The whole time it was in its immobile state I tried to figure out if whether there was any movement whatsoever but from being under neather it there was no movement whatsoever,  it seemed to be descending it hard to tell.  Also with my lighter clicking I was thinking to myself that if this was a saucer it must off seen my clicking, I even held the lighter in front of my nose to make sure to make sure that what ever was up there seen my face. Well all three of us still fixed on this because if I would of looked elsewhere and looked back at it with so many stars out that night I might of lost sight of it, then again maybe not because in a sense it was the biggest star three times the pinpoint size of a normal star. Besides all off a sudden it took off again in the same direction it was going to in the first place but really slow and constant towards the pmq section of the military base valcartier.  I think a tiny plane could off went faster than this ridicoulously slow pace, compared to the full power high speed it came at.  So to recap, it took about five seconds from the complete far horizon since we were standing in an open space to come to a complete halt.  Then it stayed in this camouflashed starlight state for about at least 4 minutes, Then as it was over civilisation well the pmqs. it all of a sudden shout out its light with a double flicker, we are talking milliseconds here,  my two friends didn,t see this shut down electric feeling of the light, but this is where I believe my keeping eyes on it the whole time payed off.  This double flicker electric feeling is hard to explain in writing but I think I am describing this well.  And thats it.  I would also like to mention that there was absolutely no trail and sound whatsoever.  At about 9:40 we could hear a small plane coming from the west and we could hear this so well.   So we packed our bags, and headed back through the woods in a very dark trail towards the shannon bridge. Something very strange happened though.  My two friends were well ahead of me and without giving any information of what I saw amazed up to this day.  All I will say to you is that it is very small and alive, and 1 inch long.  I will never tell anybody what that was because I will wait and see if there is any report that has seen this same thing.  It is a gift for my lighter clicking because even though it is similar to an earth creature, it doesn,t exist in the books, and nobody ever seen something like this.  The last hint I will give is that it came and looked at me straight inbetween the two eyes. So beware to any hoaxters you will have to be very precise in your sighting to match what I saw.  This way I will be sure the day somebody reports something exactly the same, well then I will tell you what this was.  Up to now no one ever has mentioned something similar so we will leave this at that.  I developed a great interest in sightings in the past few years and whenever there are those people with white light sightings I listen very carefully.  I would like to give a final opininion, about this, I don, think that the military has anything to do with this.  I have a very good reason for that. So I am absolutely not ashamed to report this sighting since we are three fisherman that seen this.  I don,t care what anybody says, but If anybody could off seen the tremendous speed and deceleration of this machine, and the sneaky way of camouflashing itself in it immobile state well I think anybody would go nuts.  But what happened after is a payback for the courage of flicking that lighter on and off. I hope this will be well recorded in the history books of the future, even though it is more or less a simple sighting compared to some other sightings.  Maybe there are radar system records archived somewhere inorder to verify this sighting.  I would also like to congratulate the UFO reporting center for thier work in trying to solve the mystery,  I am now positive that humankind will succeed in proving these ufo sightings. So I tried the best I could and as honestly as I could in this report. This sighting terminated at exactly 9:28 PM September the 10th 1995", "Lights over the Oregon Coastal Mountains.It was just after 8pm on Friday night, the 13th of October, 2000.  I was out in the Elsea Unit of Oregon settling in for dinner in my vehicle after a day of hunting. The area I was in is west of Eugene. I parked at the very top of one of the highest mountains in the area, right at the edge of a clear-cut. I could see for miles over the tops of many surrounding mountains. The sunset was at 6:33pm that night. There was a bank of clouds flowing filling the valleys and another wave of clouds floating over the mountain tops. I looked up at the horizon and saw some small lights in the distance. I figure that they are maybe 5 miles away. The lights are white for the most part and changed in intensity. The color would sometimes be yellow or red. The group consisted of four lights that would &quot;dance&quot;; or &quot;play&quot; around in a relatively tight grouping. About the area of a dime at arms length. My first thought was that they were other hunters traversing the mountains. From my vantage point however, I could see they were above the other mountains and moving much too fast for a car or truck viewed from this distance. A couple times one of the lights would dip down into a valley, but never low enough to go out of sight. The light dipping into the valley meant that it couldn&apos;t be lights of a distant town flickering through the clouds. After a couple minutes, I noticed another group to the right of the first. It was more of a line of 5-6 light closer together. The way they flickered made me believe that they were flames of a large fire. That was until one from the first group moved over to join the line. A few seconds later, it or another one returned to the first group. Roughly five minutes had elapsed before I realized I had the digital camcorder. I climbed outside to get a better shot. It took several tries to get anything to show up on tape due to the distance in the dark. I switched it to infrared. Nothing. I turned up the gain. It worked. The lights and tree tops were present although fairly grainy. I managed to get one minute recorded to tape before the clouds became too thick. In the morning, I cammed the same direction for sake of comparison and took nine gps readings to comfirm exactly where I was standing.", "three bright light&apos;s, no sound, about a foot ball field awayIt was dark at the time we saw it. There was three lights in the sky and their was no sound for about five minutes and then, the round light went in different directions and their was still no sound at all. the object&apos;s were about a foot ball field away from us", "60 or more UFOs seen by 5 witnesses over fields near a small village..........IT HAPPENED AT 3.00AM ON SUNDAY MORNING.WE CAME BACK FROM A NIGHT CLUB AND PARK IN A PARK NEAR MY HOUSE.

They were hovering for a long period of time, they had lights, to me ,it seemed like it looked like a tophat or some upright cylinder also at the same time I saw a pulsating star in another direction and also a very strange light in the middle of the woods beside our house", "On 09/09/2000 I saw an object that had three rectangular goldish-amber lights in a triangular pattern and the object was totally silentMy two friends and I were hanging out in the one friends backyard, which is actually located on the main business strip of our town. They were sitting at a picnic table and I was standing.  I was talking when I looked up, and in the opening between two trees(40 feet), I saw something fly overhead. I said &quot;what the **** is that?&quot; I quickly turned and took a few steps to my left and watched the object disappear into the night sky.  While I was watching my friends had got up from the table.  The one was standing behind me and said &quot;Did you see that?&quot;  &quot;What the hell was it?&quot; The other friend didn&apos;t see anything but could tell that we definately did.  We discussed what we saw and each drew pictures of what we saw.  We saw the same thing.  First of all the object was completely silent. It did not appear to be flying at an altitude greater than a couple hundred feet.  It was again absolutly silent. It was moving but not at a tremendous amount of speed.  Traveling west to east and moved laterally to our right before disappearing. It did not bank(like a plane would)it swiftly moved to the right.  I cannot make a fair call on how large it was and whether or not I was seeing the back of it or the bottom of it.  But what I saw consisted of three rectangular lights, goldish-amber in color, not terribly bright, but distinct--no halos or blurriness to them(it was a little hazy that night too) The rectangles were in a triangular pattern, one on top, two on the bottom, as if there was one for each point on a triangle. Whatever it was DID NOT make a sound.", "Very fast - in formation flying lights with NO sound and vanishingThis is a copy of an e-mail I sent to a friend after I had seen it: You know I&apos;m always star gazing looking for shooting ones.  Well tonight I saw something very very different.  5 or 6 lights flying about twice as slow as a shooting star, in formation and appearing to dip then rise and go out of sight.  All over in 2 seconds.  They covered about quarter of the sky in those 2 seconds.  I&apos;m used to military aircraft round hear but there was no noise, at all. So what do you think - is this the DT&apos;s or madness or have I just seen something weeired.  You know after I had seen it I kept saying &apos;oh my god, oh my god&apos;.  It bought tears to my eyes.  Wish I know what it was...  Sorry I just needed to share that with someone. (the formations was a V shape - white round lights)", "Shiny gold/black large balloon like object travelling up Puget Sound WA w/ consistent altitudeWhat at first seemed like a wayward balloon, when viewed through a strong scope, was a watermelon shaped object, with a shining gold top half and black bottom half with a distinct demarkation horizontally across it. Viewed from a bluff overlooking the sound, it seemed to be quite a distance from shore. I watch this view for quite a few hours a day, and see all variety of birds and am usually fairly accurate in judging distance from shore. at least a quarter mile or more offshore. It seemed to be drifting from south to north at an even elevation of about 400-500 feet (?), and moving more quickly than the shore breeze. After about 20 seconds it started rising from its flat path at about 60 degrees from the horizon and disappeared from my sight.  This all on a bright sunny day with clear visibility. If indeed it was a balloon, it was very large. I have seen adrift balloons let loose from the shoreline here before, and this was indeed out over the sound at some distance, and too large to be a typical balloon.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to be both sincere, and quite serious-minded.  PD))", "large quiet  craft, covered with blackness, and &quot;stars&quot; to not be noticed, moving slowly southwest to north north east.I was in seventh grade. I had a great love for the stars. each night I would stare at the stars. As I nightly looked out my window from my bed, I knew what I should see when I  looked. The night in question, when I lay down, I looked to my friends, the stars, there was a wrongness. The stars I expected were not there. I was mighty confused, but as I continued to look I saw that stars north of the wrongness were disapearing, and stars south of the wrongness were appearing. I realised that the stars I saw, that were wrong, were moving as a group, in a north north east dirrection. The &quot;group&quot; was moving, very slowly, blocking out the stars in an enormous area. I heard no sound from it. The &quot;group&quot; was made up of large, small, dim, and brighter &quot;stars&quot;. as if it were camafloging a huge craft from the casual observer. I would not have noticed, but I looked out the same window, at the same time, every night. And I looked to the stars as a consistant. I was extreamly excited, I ran to another window, but It was covered and could not see out. Now, I would try to get pictures, then, I went back to bed. I didn&apos;t even go outside. The next day I told my seventh grade english teacher, Mr ((name deleted)). He told me I was dreaming. That it was not true. But I knew what I saw.

She shared it with me on Friday the 13th, but was too &quot;scared&quot; to report herself.  She was sitting on a fifth floor balcony at work at 6:45 am smoking a cigarette when she saw an orange fireball in the western sky.  no estimation of distance.  The fireball lit up, was stationary at the time...not moving, was huge, then disappeared but left a &quot;vapor trail like an airplane&quot; for a small distance, then fireball appeared again, stationary.  This happened three times...fireball, trail, fireball, trail, fireball, trail, fireball; was heading south.  Then disappeared completely.  She was shaken by the incident.  Was not an airplane or helicopter.  I questioned her at length.  She was very sure of what she saw and she is a very credible witness.  We are aware of the fireball sightings of later that night, but thought it important to include this early sighting for the record.((NUFORC Note:  The author of the report is correct.  There were many sightings later that evening, many reported to the FAA by airline pilots.

The object was very low in the sky (about 1500 feet) and flying on a flat trajectory. It was flying on an almost due east to west coarse and was seen at a distance of about 1/8 of a mile.  The object was seen for about 7 seconds and I had a very good side view for a couple of seconds even though the object was moving very rapidly.

The one where there were many small ufo&apos;s that formed a &apos;v&apos; shape.  Remember?  Some people thought it was flares.  Then they each slowly disappeared behind the mountain they said. 1 of the people is in my friends band.  They had a party Saturday night, and I was talking to this guy who was friends with the person in the band.  He told me a lot of stuff I can&apos;t remember.  What I do remember is this.  He said he went on a trip with S((name deleted)) (The person in my friends band) and they were sitting out in the desert on private property called &apos;claims&apos;.  He said him and S((name deleted)) were writing songs by a camp fire they lit out in the middle of knowwhere.  I forgot S((name deleted)) friends name, but S((name deleted)) friend looked up and saw many lights just above them.  He told S((name deleted)), &quot;S((name deleted)), look up and tell me what you see&quot; and S((name deleted)) was surprised as well.  Cool thing is, S((name deleted)) friend says they have this all on their cassette tape because they were recording song ideas at the time.  I rememeber S((name deleted)) friend saying that there were many lights that were fairly close to them.  He said he could of shot them with a 30 od 6 rifle.  He said each light was zooming from one place to another at too high of a speed for a person to handle.  The &apos;G&apos; force would be too great for a person he said.  Then he said all the small lights formed a &apos;V&apos; shape and took off towards, I forget what state or mountains he mentioned, but I bet it was the same place where everyone on tv mentioned they saw it. So to round this whole thing up.  I think these 2 guys have more information to add to that event.  I think they saw the UFO&apos;s before everyone else.  I personally believe them from talking with S((name deleted)) friend.  He had know reason to lye about this.  I was the one who said that they should call someone and report this because from the show I watched on this event, they never mentioned individual UFO&apos;s that formed the &apos;V&apos; shape were on their own at first and zoomed around at great speed, then formed the &apos;V&apos; shape. I told S((name deleted)) and his friend that I would search on the internet for them to see if I could find a place to report UFO&apos;s and that&apos;s how I found you.  You can call me, and give me a number to contact you after I get S((name deleted)) and his friends phone number.  S((name deleted)) friend says that he would love to tell what happened and even go back to the place he was at and do a film recording for you or whoever does that. I&apos;ll leave my information below.  If you call then I&apos;ll know you are interested.  I&apos;ll then get your number so I can call you back with S((name deleted)) and his friends phone numbers.  I don&apos;t have any of their numbers yet.  I will call H((name deleted)), who is the leader of the band S((name deleted)) is in and I will get S((name deleted))s number.  S((name deleted)) will have the phone number to his friend.

The story may be accurate, but I have heard other accounts regarding the origin of the &quot;swamp gas&quot; explanation.

Under the circumstances I tend to take notice of everything that moves in the sky.  Tonight I saw a very, very large light holding a stationary position just South East of the super mall in Auburn.  A plane was flying in a pattern near the object and another light was a great distance East.  I couldn&apos;t tell if that object was a plane or not.  I only had a short time to view the object, but I&apos;ve seen similar.  The light from the object was slightly golden in color, very bright.  I&apos;ve been told that hot-air balloons are known to be in the area, but I rule this out for this sighting.

After watching it we determined it was not rising upwards, but coming toward us. We then noticed a flashing red light approached the craft at the 1 o&apos;clock position, and remained beside it for a moment, before moving ahead of the craft at about the 7 o&apos;clock position. It steadily came toward us and we noticed that the small flashing red light in front of the craft appeared to be a jet, and the large craft was following it.  As it began to move above us, we no longer saw the one large white light we had seen before, but we saw six fairly large white lights on the bottom of the craft.  These lights were rectangular in shape, and looked very similar to flourescent lighting fixtures you would find in a garage or kitchen.  The larger craft stayed very close behind the jet (obviously following its&apos; flight pattern), but made no noise whatsoever.  The sound from the jet&apos;s engine was all that could be heard.  It was moving much too fast to be any type of balloon, or anything like that.  As it got directly over us, we could make out a somewhat triangular outline, and saw what appeared to be a semi-circular shaft coming down from between the six rectangular lights.  We wondered amongst ourselves if this could be some sort of secret military plane, and we noticed that the large craft had no flashing lights, only the six lights on the underside.  This craft was extremely large and absolutely dwarfed the jet it was following.  We watched the flight pattern as it seemed to be going back from where it came from.  The flight pattern was almost a complete circle!  We don&apos;t have any idea what we saw, but we wish someone has witnessed something similar, and will be able to provide a clue or two for us.", "Object  was like the picture on the home page &quot;During July&quot; except the color was bright white.November 21, 2000 at 5:07AM I looked out my second floor bathroom window facing East and noticed the moon and stars in a clear sky.  I noticed a bright object to the North East traveling in a South West direction that was a very bright white light.  I would estimate the object had to be at an altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet and 2 to 3 miles from my viewpoint.   I assumed it was an airplane but the object was going pretty fast, faster than an airpane.  At this point I thought it might be a shooting star but the object had a pulsating bright white light not leaving a trail behind it. The object suddenly stopped for a few seconds then the glowing became very dim and dropped at a slight angle to the ground.  It went out of sight behind the hills and trees for a few seconds then it moved back up to the position it dropped altitude from, began to glow bright again then took off in a climbing direction in the South East direction at a faster speed than before.  It went out of sight in about five seconds. I also noticed two aircraft in the sky at this time.  I know that these pilots had to see this object.

From my far east a disk or ball (somewhat obscured by the light clouds) appeared kind of as a soft white glow, like the moon light, and traveled to my far west in about 1.5 - 2 seconds.  It moved so quickly that it appeared to have a short tail coming from behind.  It disappeared to my view for about 5 seconds.  The object reappeared to my far west side and in approximately .5 second moved to a position just in front of me and slightly to my west and stopped.  While it was stationary the soft glow stopped and all I could see were four lights which were green, red, and white.  The object hovered at that position for about 15 seconds and then moved off to the north at a slower rate, but much faster than any airplane or jet.  While it traveled northward I could see the lights and it did not during any of this sighting make any noise.  At first I thought maybe it was a shooting star or an object entering the atmosphere.  However, it was unlike any falling star or other object I had ever seen before and, it was much to large, I thought to be such an object.  I also thought maybe it was a search light, however you can see the trail of a search light as it cuts the sky and this did not have any.  When I saw the lights I thought maybe it was an airplane, jet, or helicopter.  However, there was no noise, no airplane or jet I know of can hover, and a helicopter noise would have been very distiguishable at that range even if in a silent mode.  I followed the object as it traveled northward until I was in front of my house (on the other side from the drive) and then it was lost to view shortly afterward behind the trees.  I stood in awe and watched this thing.  I have heard of sightings and other reports of people seeing objects like this.  My wife said her and her mother seen one when she was just a child.  But, until it happened Friday night I was still skeptical! .  The t oughest problem for me right now is that I have a very analytical mind and I would like to explain this away.  However, it has bugged me all weekend because I cannot explain it.  Was there anything in this area or in science that can explain what I saw?  I am curious now.  I hope I have another encounter because this was such an awesome, frustratingly inexplicable, and wonderful thing to behold.  I hope you don&apos;t think I am nuts.

We were all looking at the sky which had become black half an hour before. There were lots of stars, sattelites and shooting stars.  It was quite entertaining and we were talking.  Suddenly without speaking we all looked at an object which at the time I thought was a hovering bird of prey.  After aproximately two or three seconds the object travelled quickly in the sky directly across our orientation.  Suddenly I thought it was a teridactle(prehistoric bird) by the look of its bent around &quot;boomerang&quot; shape and it seemed to move very quickly and effortlessly as if it were gliding.  It glided directly above and across us.  Suddenly it seemed to change shape into a triangular, hard object which moved as if it were on one part of the sky but still in another.   It was a short distance that the triangular shape moved and then object disapeared. We didn&apos;t talk for about two minutes, we just laughed.   All three of us had realized there was no explanation on earth of what we had seen except that it were an alien spacecraft.  It varied speed dramatically, changed  shape and we didn&apos;t believe anything of earth had capabilities like that no matter how much technology had advanced.  I thought about Saudi Arabian technology and thought there was no way as it was almost as if I had seen photographs or pictures of such things a fairly long time ago. Myself and the two others were so definate about what we had seen that we went to the local bar straight afterwards and told everybody. When we talked about it we thought initialy it had looked like a cloud, then a hovering griffin or eagle, then a boomerang or terridactle, then a hard straight edged spacecraft sort of thing. All three of us had a long experience with smoking grass but we know you don&apos;t see things like that on grass and two of us have smoked for two years continously.

I got out of the car and felt a pressure coming from the object like wind, but it was not wind........It made my hair fall back on my head.

I was facing north, and the lights came from behind me and continued north at a extremely high rate of speed.  The two lights were traveling side by side.  I believed them to be shooting stars at first, because they were lights and because of their speed.  However, they did not leave any tails behind them.

There was nothing behind our house at the time but woods for about 4 miles. As we began to walk back, a very intense white light hit us from behind. I remember seeing my shadow directly in front of me, so I knew it was behind me, not above me. It only lasted a couple of seconds. By the time I turned around all I saw was the light going out just above the treeline. There was absolutely no sound at all. We got very scared and ran back home. My parents, brother and wife saw what looked like 50 cars in the woods with thier lights on high beam. This made no sense, since there was only woods for about 4 miles.

Rate of speed excedes what I have seen from commercial and military aircraft at that elevation.Once they left my periffial vision two very large orange spheres approximatly 2 inches apart from my perspective, and half the size of a moon after 12pm. appeared (explosion like) in the sky in the same location all the previous (glitter) activity took place.

Except smaller, and there was a lot more. They went a little faster though. Then about a minute later, it molded back together, so it was big again.

There is a busy air corridor that passes over my home, probably mostly Chicago - Dallas traffic. I enjoy watching the aircraft pass by.  About 7:45pm I noticed an airplane I believe to have been a twin turboprop commuter plane (maybe a Brasilia) traveling the usual flight pattern from northeast to southwest.  I am not a good judge of elevation, but I would guess the plane was at 9,000 to 12,000ft.  The sun was down and it was dusk so I could see the usual red, green and white strobe lights on the airplane.  I could hear the plane faintly.  The plane passed behind a tree in my yard and I watched to see it come from behind the tree.  The airplane came into sight again and after a moment, I noticed a dark, triangular object that appeared to be following the airplane. The object did not display any lights and was behind the airplane at an apparent distance of about the width of my hand at arms length.  It appeared to be at the same elevation as the airplane and of similar size.  My first thought was that I might be seeing a large bird that just happened to be gliding along a similar course as the airplane, but after a few seconds I could see that it was not a bird.  It then occurred to me that I might be seeing a shadow cast by the airplane on the thin clouds.  There was also a contrail that was thinning out and creating some cirrus-type clouds.  The clouds were thin and broken and a lot of brighter stars were becoming visible.  I observed that there was no direct sunlight striking the airplane and that the angle was wrong to be some kind of shadow.  I concluded that the object was some kind of triangular craft and that it was indeed following the airplane.  There was a denser contrail running north-northwest to south-southeast and the airplane crossed this contrail as it continued southwest. When the triangular object crossed the contrail it disappeared.  It was suddenly just not there anymore.  I carefully watched behind the airplane until it was out of sight but I did not see the object again.  Since the airplane was approaching the lighter part of the western sky, the object should have been more readily visible the further west they traveled, but the object was just not there anymore and I did not see it again.  The airplane maintained a straight course southwest until out of sight.  As for the triangular object, it was dark and I could not see any details, other than it was triangular in shape, it was similar in size to the airplane, it did not display any lights, and I did not hear any sound that I associated with it.  It did not appear black, but rather a dark charcoal color around the perimeter and a lighter gray in the center.  This difference in color was not sharply delineated.  About fifteen to twenty minutes after I saw the object, a large jet aircraft came from the northwest and virtually bisected the point where the object disappeared. The jet then curved from a southeast course to a south-southeast course and moved rapidly out of sight.  It may just have been a coincidence, but if the jet had been sent to the area to look for the object, its most likely point of origin would have been Tinker AFB near Oklahoma City.  Curiously, the jet left a contrail across the night sky that seemed to glow softly and the contrail persisted for almost an hour.  That is all that I recall about the incident.  I hesitated to report it, but maybe someone else saw it and will report it as well.  I do not believe the triangular object was an F-117 or a B-2.  I have seen both of these aircraft in flight more than once and really don&apos;t think it could have been either one.  I would not be surprised to know that it was some kind of secret aircraft, but I can&apos;t imagine why it would be following an airplane in a relatively busy air lane.  I also can&apos;t imagine how it could have vanished like it did.", "Delta winged object flies by as power goes out in Houston Texas.At 9:00 pm on November 6th, 2000 the power went out for a large section of Houston Texas, North of downtown south of Loop 610 in the area between IH 45 and IH 59. We went out on our patio immediately and saw a triangular delta wing shaped object similar to Aurora fly over us at about 2000 feet. It was the size of large commercial jets that fly by. This craft however had no sound and seemed to glide by at least twice the speed of a commercial jet. It was silver and did not have any lights, it reflected light from the city.

I must admit it appeared to be very similar to those I have seen on TV documentaries about UFO&apos;s. There was a light emiting from the top downward to create the shape of the saucer. The color of the light was whitish blue. I pointed it out to my wife who also had the same reaction of awe as I did. I noticed that it wasn&apos;t moving in a straight line. First it moved toward the east,then slightly north,then ultimately westbound un- till we lost it behind some trees. Beacuse of its appearance and movement,we knew it couldn&apos;t have been a plane,heliocopter or even a blimp.  I assumed it would be clearly seen by thousands &amp; checked the Saturday &amp; then Sunday newspaper,Newsday,which is the largest on Long Island. They said no one had reported it &amp; since it had passed,they were not interested. I should call only at the moment I see it. I still plan to check the Long Island TV station-Channel 12 to see if they had any calls. I have to believe that many saw this as well but possibly were embarresed to call.", "It had no lights, but it could be seen against the dark sky.  It was veery high, but easy to see.  There were two shapes, then one broke into two, they then disappeared. The single object continued in a northwest direction. At times it looked as supple as a scarf, but its path and direction was very exact.", "Object was circular with kind of a square shape at the top (grey)It was about 2:30am on a Friday night, My sister and my best friend and I were hanging out on my roof right outside my bedroom window.  We were sitting there when all of a sudden a bright light from the distance of the hills started getting closer and closer.  When we started yelling &quot;holy ((deleted))!!&quot; the object slowly moved backwards a tad, but as soon as we settled down it started moving for my house again.  The object had a green lime light underneath it, it looked like nothing I have ever seen before.  When it hovered over my house I looked up and it was a grey color like misty sorta.  It had that bright light right on the front of it.  We tried to take pictures but every picture on the roll showed up but the ones of the UFO. Ever since that night, I have looked out my window every night and about two nights ago I saw the same bright light hovering over the house across the street.  When I looked at it, it slowly moved away for the hills. Definantly a UFO (i think)((NUFORC Note:  It would be unusual for a UFO for hang around for 3 hours.  Were such to happen, I suspect that we would have been inundated by reports, which I believe was not the case.

I looked up from the telescope when at about my 11:00 position I spotted a V-shaped formation of circular diffuse white lights on the underside of a &apos;solid&apos; V-shaped &apos;fuselage&apos; which was transparent (could see star field behind it) and shimmered like a mirage. From 4 to 6 closely spaced lights down each leg of V and 1 at point. Their diameter was nearly the width of each leg. They pulsed slowly (approx. 1 sec intervals) and simultaneously, and shimmered in sync with rest of craft. At first sight it was at least as big as both fists held at arms length. Estimate altitude at between 2000 and 5000ft. Traveled straight and level SSE at what must have been thousands of miles per hour and was completely silent. Fantastic, dizzying speed. Within view for approx. 5 sec. At last sight it was about the width of my pinky at arms length.", "Fast moving bright lights that split and disappearedSunrise had not happened yet, but it was light enough to see around the area and the blue color of the sky.  It was light enough so no stars were visible.  I was looking to the north about 30 degrees above the horizon and a very white bright sharp light caught my eye.  It was moving from NW to NE and gaining altitude.  It was moving at a rate of speed that I estimate to be 7-10 times faster than any airplane that I know of.  It traveled for 2-3 seconds, split into 3 bright lights one above the other.  The center light was not as bright as the other two.  As soon as the it split, it appeared tocome to a complete stop.  The light split into three seperate lights and disappeared.  There was no contrails, smoke trails or debris of any sort during flight or when it disappeared.  There was no shape detected as it was only the bright light during travel and the three light just prior to disappearing.  The sky was clear at the time with no clouds or aircraft in the area. Both my wife and I saw it traveling through the sky, but she turned to look at me in disbelief for a second and didn&apos;t see it split into three lights and disappear.

Story This happen to me when I was sixteen years old. I&apos;m now 44. That was 28 years ago, In the Summer of 1972, in the Month Of August on the 28 day.  I have only been driving for 3 month, I loved to go to my Brother House, It was so much different then my house at mom and dads. so that Day I went to spent the day and night with my brother and his wife and kids. To make you understand I was a mid life Baby, My Brother had kids older then I. My neice was 2 years older then I. so I enjoyed the friendship I had with my neice and nephew , they was close to my age. At around 10:30pm we went to bed, there was only one bed in the kids bedroom so we had to lay across the bed to fit, We had two very large windows went the length of the bed and they where very tall windows, this was very old farm house, and just up the road was a very large hill, it was called Coon Anderson Hill. While we where laying in bed we could not sleep it was August and very hot and no air con, we had the windows open and was looking out the windows at the very bright stars, it was in the country and no street light made it very easy to see the stars. time was now getting to be about 11:15pm. and I noticed a very small light in the sky, bluish in color, kind a like the stars where. I thought it was maybe a light from a slow moving plane it was going from the southeast to northwest. I look over to my neice and said do you see that Light over there up in the Sky, She said no, So I pointed it out to her and my nephew , my neice said it look like a light from a plane or something. All a sudden the light started to zig zag back in forth at a very fast pace, then it really got going, It appeared to us to move across the sky in a split second. at this time we knew it was not a airplane, they cannot do this, so as young kids we got really scared and ran into my brother bed room and told him about it , we all went outside onto the front porch and watch it for about another ten minutes or so. then it came to a stop and it was hard to see it because it blended in with the stars. it started to get larger and larger and it appeared to land or go behind the hill. we all jumped into my brother truck to go up to the hill to see if it did land or not, but we didn&apos;t make it, the truck just died and the light went out and would not restart, my Brother said the truck has done that before, he had a weak battery and drove a very old truck that had a generator, and if the battery got low the generator would not put out enough voltage and everything dies he said. but I&apos;m not sure Now if it was that or maybe a magnetic force that did it.. It was very dark and could not see your hand in front of your face, the moon was not out.  Then we notice lights coming from the south and went right over us, it was a helicopter, army one. we also heard jet engine we thought, but no planes in sight, my brother said we need to get out of there and as we was walking back to the house we saw the light it went straight up and went out of sight, the helicopter left to, the next morning my brother went to get his truck that we left and it started right up, guess that old weak battery just charge it self up... I have never shared this UFO story with any official, I was afraid they would think I was A nut case, but with all the other people see weird things I thought I would share this with you&hellip;", "Small black object following airliner within its contrailWhile seated at an outdoor restaurant on the Gulf of Mexico, myself and two dinner companions observed what appeared to be a widebody commercial airliner, silver in color, heading north at cruising speed, at an altitude of perhaps 10,000-15,000 feet.  Behind the aircraft a very clearly defined contrail extended for perhaps 1/4 to 1/2 mile.  Towards the tail end of the contrail, there appeared a black object about the size of an automobile.  This object followed the aircraft at a fixed distance, always remaining perfectly centered within the contrail.  No wings or control surfaces were visible on the object, but it appeared metallic in composition because it seemed to reflect the light from the sun, which was low on the horizon. It was difficult to determine the exact shape of the object because it was engulfed in the vapor trail, but it was consistently visible and did not disappear at any point during the time the aircraft was in sight.  Other patrons nearby immediately noticed the object, despite that I had only pointed at the aircraft and did not mention the UFO.  One person commented that it was as if the aircraft was towing the black object, although no towing cable was visible.  During the course of the sighting, the contrail rapidly dispersed about 100 feet behind the black object, leaving no evidence of the aircraft&apos;s passage.", "5 objects sited in Eastern skyOn our way to dinner we observed 5 objects in the eastern sky. It was light out.  The object were like a dark grey color.  They were in a &quot;V&quot; formation almost like a flock of geese.  The leading object dipped then flew up and went between the other 4 then disapeared.  The remaining 4 object went into several different formations.  At one point two of them seperated from the other two.  They remained like that for about 3 minutes.   We judged the distance to be about 15 feet between the pairs. Then they just disapeared.   WE TOOK A PICTURE.  We had a digital camera with us and my husband was able to capture one fairly good picture.  At the time he took the picture you can see three of them. We don&apos;t know how to make the objects bigger in the picture, but tomorrow my son is comming over to see if he can.", "Tear-drop shaped UFO over central New Jersey.Me and my associate were emptying cardboard in the rear of the store where we work, when we both saw a round, black object come over the trees to our west.At first we thought it was a large balloon, but as it got nearer, we could see a definite tear drop shape to the object. The altitude of the object was below one thousand feet, and as it got directly overhead it tilted it&apos;s nose toward us, showing a flattened shape and two fins running from nose to tail. The craft then righted itself, then wobbled from side to side as it continued on toward the east. It was travelling faster than a balloon would, especially since there was very light wind at the time. It was black in color, and we could not see any markings or windows on it, but I am very familiar with all known aircraft, have a very open mind, and I can state with certainty that this was not a known aircraft. The object appeared to be approximately thirty feet in length and made no noise.", "WE ARE NOT ALONEmiddlebury,ct june 11 1987 about 9:00pm. before i begin,after i saw this space ship i went to yugoslavia the very next day for 3 months on vacation,when i returned, a few freinds of mine told me it was in the paper the very next day.Now,a month ago wich would be august of 2000 i went to the waterbury library to look up the news paper of june 12 1987.when i observed the newspaper article it said that a lot of people phoned freinds,family,newspaper and the police of flying saucers in the sky.

The other light was in the middle...the light in the middle yet was much different, it was kind of changing colours.  It was pink then red then blue then green then yellow.  i stopped walking and stared at it for over 4 min.  i looked up and it stopped the figure stopped.  then it went diagnal and turned over as if it were going upside down then it turned back up...i think it was showing off its stunts.  the UFO made a humming sound which was pretty loud.  The sight was unforgetable and the UFO was low. I know the UFO was no bigger then the lenghth of a whale-watching boat.  This made me then believe in aliens, but then... There was a second time and this was more unforgetable.  I went outside to my best friends house which is a couple of blocks away...when i came home i saw it again.  it was scary yet unforgetting again the exact same ship as last time exept it was much much lower and much much louder...it wasn&apos;t any hight then the hight of 2 3 floor houses.  It followed me home and thats what scared me.  but the weirdest part was my first sighting i was all alone no one to be near me at all yet i called one of my friends and told him i saw a UFO my best friend which was not w/ me the first time was on the phone w/ her friend and said she saw one too.  we were not w/ eachother yet we both saw it and had witnesses that we said we saw it...the second time she said she heard it and i said i saw it and heard it and thats all that has ever happened but listen...i don&apos;t know if i should be telling you this because i have had several of dreams telling me not to tell anyone what happened!

I couldn&apos;t go back to sleep, so I went into the kitchen, got a Diet Coke, then went into the livingroom, sat down on the couch, and turned my lamp off.

This is what made me get off the couch and look, and I couldn&apos;t believe what I saw.

Again the object stopped dead for about 10 seconds , then when straight up at incredible speed until it went out of sight.  After this had all taken place, we noticed that the vapor trail was still disapating directly overhead in the atmosphere where the object had made the 180 degree turn around. This vapor trail seemed identical to that which you see when a high altitute aircraft leaves a vapor trail. This trail widened, and distorted over a period of about 3 minutes or so.  Our observation was that the original vapor trail formed an absolutely perfect 180 Degree semi circle..  No vapor trail was caused by the craft when it was excelerating away from us or toward us...

The top of the object appears to be round on the lower portion with a dark vee shape cut out on the top.  Both the easterly and westerly sides of the craft are brightly illuminated.  We thought this was strange because if it were a weather balloon or something of the sort we would expect the easterly pointed side to be brighter during the sunrise.

My husband is a pharmacist and I am a registered nurse.   I reported another sighting to your organization last winter, but is was nothing like this  sighting.  What makes me wonder if this is anything important is that it is remaining essentially stationary.  It is just something that I have not seen before and I spend a lot of time looking at the sky.

Then I noticed some kind of movement and I ran to the opposite side of the back porch. I heard a low pitched ,deep humming sound like a generator. It was sporadic like an engine thats idleing. I could make out what looked like several amber colored squares of very soft light, butcould&apos;nt see the shape of the object they were coming from. At that point it was about 150 feet away from me. I could have easily run along side of whatever it was,it was moveing so slowly. I did&apos;nt have the courage....I watched it for a short time and then it was gone. It ! did&apos;nt f ly off..it was just gone. I did report it to the Pennsylvania Mufon Director.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It did not appear to be moving, but as I continued driving east it dissapeared below the horizon and out of my view as I got closer to it. I then called my neighbor who I thought may have a better unobstructed view from his home, but he was unable to see it. I then drove to his home a mere 2 minutes after the sighting and aquired a pair of binoculers and he and I went back out on the highway to the location at which I first observed it, but it was no longer visible.

I was seated in a lawn chair facing east.  I thought detected some motion about 60 degrees above the eastern horizon.  Through my binoculars I was able to discern three steady, faint lights moving in a southerly direction. The speed seemed to be faster than most high-altitude aircraft, about the speed of a LEO satelite.  The lights were fixed in a triangle formation.  No sound was heard.  No strobes or other navigational lights were seen.  They were barely visible with the naked eye.

We tried to catch it.  It looked like lightning at first.  But then we realized it was not.  It was a bright light that flashed from left to right for just a second at a distance of about a football field.  It flashed at a ten minute interval then a 2 minute then 10 then 2 again.  It kept moving around.  It was very low to the ground and was often slightly hidden by a horizontal cloud.  We thought that the cloud might have been a trail like a jet would leave.  There were no clouds in the sky anywhere.  The moon and stars were very bright and it was only 35 degrees out.  So there could not have been any lightning anyway.  We got close to it only once where I got a good look at it without a cloud.  It was an incredibly bright light and was very white.  It was big.  It was long and skinny like a shot of lightning going sideways.  It lit up most of the sky but only for a second like lightning, but it was NOT lightning.  It moved around and we chased it. I can&apos;t think of any other way to explain it because we never saw anything like it before.  There was absolutely no sound, we rolled down our window to try to hear anything.  It was very scary because we could not believe what we were seeing.  We kept trying to figure out what it was.  We wondered if anyone else saw it and what they thought.  Though we were scared we kept following it so we could get an answer, but even when we got close we could not figure it out.  We just looked at each other and said it had to be an alien.

It was flying above the tree tops, and was rather big (may be 50 metres in diametre). I started to slow down, but other cars (two) passed me by, as though they did not see anything. I took the first road on my right (to the school yard actually) because the object was moving perpendicullar to the road i was driving, to my right (in direction of COD main campus). I followed it untill the road ended, and somehow though the object was moving slowly, it was already far away. I was looking at it from there, and it was still in the air when I started to drive home (it was late and i had to go), and from the distance it was a small enlighted oval, i would not notice it anong the lights from the street light.

It was a few weeks after Christmas (1968). I and my future wife (name deleted) were staying with friends for a few days. Around 10 or 11 PM we both laid down to sleep for the night. Let me describe the house a bit this well mean something later. Our friends had put us up on their living room floor with the usual blanket and pillows. The living room was adorned with a large fireplace (no fire, just for decoration I guess) which was at our head and our feet were placed at the opposite end, which to the right was the front door and to the left an open hallway to the kitchen. There was a dim light left on in the kitchen and the living room was dark except for the faint light from the kitchen.  The front door was made of solid wood and had a couple of small windows in the very top, there was also a glass screen type door on the outside with glass top and bottom, both doors were locked for the night. The rest of the room contained the usual items, carpeted floors, coffee and end tables, chairs, lamps, cabinet type stereo etc. The outside of the house was adorned with large trees (maple I believe but not sure of this) and were much taller than the house and shaded it very well. And now on with the story: We hadn&apos;t lain down to long I guess and then it came!  Right through the front door to the right of our feet. A ball of light about the size of a soccer ball or a 10-inch paper plate passed right through the glass door and through the wooden door. It immediately went to the ceiling over our heads paused then broke into 5 equal size pieces, danced back and forth and mixed them selves as they danced and hovered over our heads.  Never getting close, as they stayed tight against the ceiling. I remember saying to ((name deleted)), &quot;What is that?&quot; and here reply, &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;  After a few seconds or minutes later one of the shapes broke from the others and started along the ceiling towards our feet and then started down the wall like it was searching for something back and forth, up and down. Let me describe the shape because this is the very interesting part. Like I said it was about 10 inches in diameter and glowed with a bright white light. There was no definite shape to the object other than the approximate size and it was circular. There was no body to the object and yet you could not see through it. All 5 of the objects were equal the best I could tell and were of the same light intensity. The strange part as the object entered the room and broke into 5 there was no light emitting from them (the room stayed dimly lit from the light in the kitchen) yet they were bright white and emitted no light. As the one object broke from the group and was on its search (or whatever it was doing) it cast no shadow on anything or lit anything brighter than itself. The light was so bright from the object that you could not see its true shape other than it was circular and spherical. Being 18, full of vinegar and not really thinking about what I was doing. I got up from where we were laying and started toward the light that was dancing on the wall. ((female&apos;s name deleted)) stayed were she was for the time being and watched. I followed the light and was within about 2 ft of it at all times and tried to visually see what it was by stretching my head within touching distance (maybe as close as 1ft.). I peered into it and was straining my eyes to see if I could tell what it was then it started down the wall and was going to go behind the stereo. My first thought was that it was going after the electrical outlet. That&apos;s when I got brave and reached out to touch it before it was gone. As soon as got with a few inches of the object it shot with amazing speed upward to the ceiling  (I jumped back out of reaction) and watched it shoot through the front door the other 4 followed one by one as if in a procession line. ((femeale&apos;s name deleted)) popped up and we both went to the front door to see where they were going. I twisted the knob the door was lock with a dead bolt. I fumbled around and got the door open and then found the glass screen door lock also. Soon we were outside and seen the lights dancing above the roof of the house (approx. 14 foot off the ground) among an opening in the trees.  They soon grouped together as one again and shot straight up, zigzagged a bit and left at an amazing speed.  I remember saying something to ((female&apos;s name deleted)) like I have no idea what it was and her reply, &quot;me neither.&quot;   We went back inside and secured the house and lay back down. For the next 2 hours or so we heard a jet circle the area. You could here it coming closer and listen to it as it faded off in the distance and then hear it reappeared from another location.  It was definitely circling the area for some reason. I figured radar must have picked up the objects we had seen or something perhaps larger where they had went.  Perhaps the plane was just a coincidence and not related at all, this part doesn&apos;t really matter. It was just an observance the same night and we fell asleep listening to it fade away and return. The next morning when we woke, ((name deleted)) didn&apos;t mention anything about the night before and I got to thinking it could have been a dream and would keep it to myself till she spoke first. I anxiously got the morning paper hoping there would be something in the news about the aircraft that was circling the area or a clue to what had happened the night before. Nothing in there but the usual garbage, so I dismissed the whole thing as a dream since ((name deleted)) did not mention anything about it for the next few days. Well life went on and ((name deleted)) and I were married and eventually moved to Hanover Indiana. Several years later we were on our way home late one evening (after dark about 9pm or so) with the two girls. And we all saw a shooting star (meteorite) as it streaked across the sky. The first words out of ((name deleted)) mouth was, &quot;Remember that time down in Florida we saw the lights in the house?&quot;  I almost run off the road!  My God it wasn&apos;t a dream after all!  It really did happen!  After we got home and got the kids to bed I pumped ((name deleted)) to see what all she remembered and it was exactly as I did right down to the finest detail. It is really strange that we did not discuss this encounter till 8 years later and it took a meteorite streaking across the sky to open her up. I ask her why see never talked about it before and she said she really didn&apos;t know. ((name deleted)) and I were divorced a few months later. I saw her about a year ago and it was brought up in our chatting about our past encounter.  She told me she felt it happened for a purpose and really didn&apos;t understand what or why it happened but it defiantly did happen. I have been in search from time to time since to find someone with a similar experience and have posted articles on several UFO message areas and was once the MUFO  (Organization for Mutual UFO&apos;s) Fidonet coordinator for Indiana, KY and Ohio.  I have yet to find anything really close to this encounter other than Foo lights and there&apos;s not to much talk about them anywhere and really just barely related.  I have no idea what it was but it seemed peaceful, seemed to mean us no harm, did not want touched for some reason and was able to pass through solid objects (wooden door and glass). From this day in 1968 and to the present day I 2000 do believe in UFO&apos;s and close encounters and contest that all the is written here is pure fact and not fiction in anyway.  It&apos;s really hard to discount something you see with your own eye close-up and have a witness to back it up.

It crossed over I-75 heading west, when an explosion or emission of somekind, lit behind it, illuminating the craft.  This event, looked not like an explosion proper, but rather orange, yellow and a sparkling gold bolt of lighting with many branches!  At that moment it came to a quick stop but quite a distance from the previous anomalous event.  This took all of 5 seconds.  At this point we stopped the vehicle and went for the video camera.  We tried to turn it on, but the battery was dead.  So we pulled out binoculars we took for the trip and started watching its movements.  I pulled out the binoculars and handed them to my friend ((deleted)), and when I turned around to look back at the craft, I saw a flash of white light, and then the ship moved up approximately a half mile.  That is where it stayed, until we decided to move in, and then it stayed with the car up to the Cygnet Rd. exit.  At this point, the object was hovering what looked to be a hundred feet above the trees.  We turned off onto the Cygnet exit, and turned left onto Cygnet.   We pulled the car over on the right hand side of the road, and started to observe the craft, at this point a woman named ((female name deleted)) stopped in front of us and asked us if we saw the previous events.

So she departed, and we went in to investigate.  Once we got close enough, we stopped to investigate even more.   We observed it again change colours and reduce and increase in size (from dimming, we believe)  All of a sudden, it became an intense red, and Jim l ooked at me and said, &quot;Tim, let&apos;s go, I don&apos;t like the way that this is looking&quot;, and as he said that I said &quot;were going&quot; just then, I looked at the lights in the jeep and they were starting to dim and get brighter and the dim again.

It was September 8th, 2000 and we first saw a police helicopter circling around and we concluded that the helicopter was there because of the UN 2000 conference/meeting of world leaders. Then, I saw a reddish/amber object which seems stationary at first but then seems to move very slowly, I then asked my workmate &quot;what&apos;s that red thing there in the skies?&quot; he replied, &quot;oh, its one of those baloons.&quot; But, for some reason I kept on looking and the object now was showing a bright white color also, so I pointed that out to him and we decided to focus on the object and the helicopter. It was&apos;nt long before we noticed that this thing was acutally moving in a circular fashion, that is, it was traveling and spinning, this was evident because we would see the bright white color and the reddish/amber, sometimes it appears that this was a two-colored object sometimes one. We became more curious when we realised that this thing was really moving upwards and getting smaller and that we now would only recognise the bright white color. By this time we knew it was not a baloon, nor a helicopter, nor any other object that we can recognise. In the midst of the whole scene we would look at each other and ask &quot;what da hell is that thing?&quot;  Then one of us suggested it might be one of those flying saucers, we both laughed as if to say &quot;yeah right.&quot; The object mounted so high that had it not been for the bright white light we would not be able to recognise it with our natural eyes. It disappeared when it mounted beyond some clouds so to us the clouds covered or blocked our view but it had gone so high already. I must say that it seems to pick up in speed as it climbed higher. Although maths is my favorite subject I am not good at estimating distances and sizes so I will not attempt to estimate either at any point in this experience. All i can say is that when I first saw this thing it was probably a little above the distance the helicopter was and at that point it was quite visable; by the time it disappeared it became as the size of a miniature baseball. What is interesting is that there were other people(about 12-15) in the same cafeteria at the same time but we really never thought that we should bring it to anyone&apos;s attention because we were&apos;nt sure what this thing was. There was a plane which was traveling ( in the opposite direction) high above the helicopter but this object was high above the plane. I am not going to conclude precisely that this was indeed an UFO for I still do not know what the heck this thing was but I know for certain that this was something like I aint never seen before. And the movement and awe startled me. If there&apos;s anyone who had a similar experience I would sure like to know what this was, maybe some expert can contact me or even someone who is a doubter. I know we were&apos;nt dreaming, we had no strong drink, I dont smoke and i dont think my workmate does.

After traveling roughly 1/2 of the way across the visible sky, the formation instanteously changed to a diamond formation with no apparent change in the speed of any of the objects.

After travelling approximately 2/3 of the way across the visible sky the formation again instantaeously changed, this time into a line with the space between the objects considerably diminished.  As soon as this line was formed, in order each of the objects described a semicircular path with the first going right, the second left, third right, and fourth left. With the completion of the maneuver, the objects ended up in a line identical to the one observed just before the maneuver began.  As soon as the line formed, the objects again instantaneously shifted to a line abreast formation, and contined until I could no longer observe the objects.

I have hesitated to say anything up until now.  I work at a hospital in Midland Michigan on midnight shift.  I was outside on break walking west on Sugnet street at a little after 3:00 a.m. At the intersection of Valley Drive and Sugnet street I looked to the west up above the trees ahead of me.  It was a very clear night and a lot of stars were out.  I saw a VERY BRIGHT star hanging stationary just above the angle of the tree tops.  I thought maybe it was Venus, but it was VERY BRIGHT, too bright to be Venus.  It was so unusual that I stopped and just stood watching it. I had never seen anything like it in my life.  All of a sudden, over a period of 5 to 7 seconds the light gradually dimmed.  It dimmed down to approximately the same brightness as the numerous background stars.  It either dimmed, or it was possibly moving directly away from me at high speed.  There was no way to tell.  I kept my eyes on it, and suddenly it started MOVING slowly to the right (south) at a constant rate.  It moved for about 15 seconds and then stopped again.  I still had my eyes on it. At that point I pulled out my pocket laser that I carried to ping deer with when I&apos;m out on break, and using some twigs high up in the trees across the street as an aiming aid, I started pinging it with my laser. I was zinging it pretty good, but got no noticable response.  I then lost track of which speck it was amongst the faint stars.  I thought about it for awhile after returning to my work area, and decided to call Midland 911.  I asked if they had had any reports of strange lights in the sky that night.  The gal said, &quot;No, why did you see something?&quot;  I responded, &quot;Yes.&quot;  &quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot; she asked.  I hesitated, and then thought what the heck, and I told her.  She was very interested in all the details.  I told her it was really weird.  Neither she nor I knew what to do with the report, so I said &quot;Just put it in the log,&quot; and we both laughed.  Later in the shift, around 4 or 5am, someone told me ! that the re had been two ladies standing outside of the Labor and Delivery entrance smoking.  They were under the parking lot lights and saw nothing but total darkness above them, however, they HEARD what sounded to them like something passing overhead in the darkness.  Whatever it was, they said it sounded BIG, it was flying low, and it was moving FAST.  Come to find out, THAT incident occurred about ten minutes AFTER I was pinging the mysterious light in the sky with my pocket laser.  It felt really strange when I suddenly realized that the two incidents may have been connected.  It sounded to me like whatever I saw and pinged with my laser maybe came back for a closer inspection of the hospital campus with its lights off.  Maybe.

Its flash is broke but its all I had so I tried anyways. When I got back outside it had apparently move some more and was a bit lower to the ground but not much. I was kinda scared to get any closer so I just snapped a couple pictures right where I was. One of them came out ok I guess so thats the one Im sending. It looked as though it was domed or kinda like a half a donut with some  smaller dome with a point on top of it. It had what looked like smaller lights all the way around it. There wasnt any noise really but it seemed like I heard a very low hum but Im not sure if that was this thing or something from the traffic down the road or not. The lights on it would kinda alternate between yellowish and orange to white now and then. It seemed like it would always wobble before it moved also. It would wobble then shift to the side. When the lights on it were mostly white it looked like it was shiny on the outside like silver or a shiny grey color. I tried to watch it every second it was sitting there doing this stuff. I just couldnt figure out what in the world this thing was. I was going to try getting more pictures of it and started to reset the camera but Im telling you this thing all of a sudden shot straight up! I mean like a rocket except it was like one second it was sitting still and the next it was moving at top! speed o r something. Either the lights on it went out or it just dissapeard becuase I lost sight of it almost immediatly after it went up. Im not really sure what else to put here so I guess this it. Its taken me awhile to convince myself to send this to someone but since I would really like to know just what this was I guess I have no choice.

I reported this event here and also worked with a local mufon investigator. Since that event occured I have had a host of very strange phenomenon happen to me.I have been shy talking about these things but after confering with Peter Davenport about this situation occurring to me now, from what I beleive is a result of my interaction with this object back in December. He assured me that this would be valuable follow-up information about this whole phenomenon. About two months after my encounter/sighting all of the moles on my body began to fade then completely disappear, too date five moles have completely disappeared and nine more are in different states of fading. About five months after this event occured all of the hair on my arms and legs began to change to light blonde en mass. I have medium brown hair and am only 29 years old. Although I originally considered premature greying I began to notice the individual hairs changed color from the root upwards and when the hair started to change it took about 5 days for the complete hair change the top of the hair fading from medium brown to reddish to blonde  , so it was not as if it was growing out this color and no amount of sun exposure has ever caused lightening like this on me before,also the hairs that have changed colors have actually changed in consistency they were originally a medium coarseness and now they are feather soft fine. About two months ago my spider veins in my legs began to fade and now one that I have had for about 5 years is completely gone and another is fading rapidly. Since this has occured I have had &apos;dreams&apos;almost nightly of entities who talk to me and claim to be intelligent species from somewhere else and they keep trying to give me strange information I don&apos;t understand. I have woken up a few times and caught myself uttering some language that I have never heard before but I have ruled out speaking in tounges because it seems this  &apos;language&apos; seems to have structure and form. I also throughtout the day have feelings of hot and cold in different parts of my body, I get pulsating feelings on the bottom of my feet up my legs down my arms and on the palms of my hands.Sometimes this pulsating becomes so intense it is painful. I have also felt this heat/pulsating feeling right below my eyes between my eyes and in the front of my brain.

I was called outside by one of our kids who ran in and said there was a UFO outside. When I got outside I looked in the sky at approx 80 degrees (facing south directly across from Immaculate Conception Catholic Church). I saw a very large triangular object relatively low in the sky. I estimate it&apos;s distance from me to be between 1000-2000 ft. I would estimate it&apos;s location to be over the Hudson River in an area just south of Kingston Point (near area where Rondout Creek meets the hudson, approx.) I would estimate it&apos;s size to be between 50-100 yards. It was very large. It hovered completely silent. It had 5-6 lights (white). 1 in each corner of a triangle and 1 between each corner. It remained in that position motionless for approx. 5 minutes. During this time people from the neighborhood were gathering in the church parking lot looking at the object. Many motorists were also stopping their cars and getting out to look at the object. The object then rotated to the left slightly (silently) (the lead point of the triangle was initially pointing east)and moved slightly forward then rotated again left slightly towards the NE then stopped and then proceeded to move in a NE direction slowly (10 mph?). It&apos;s path appeared to take it directly over the Hudson River in a northerly direction. After it cleared the trees and went out of sight, everyone went on their way. No police were observed in the area. I saw no media coverage on the event. I would estimate there were between 20-30 witnesses in my area of Delaware Ave. alone. Sky conditions were clear. I could not make out any surface characteristics as the craft appeared very dark.((NUFORC Note:  Approximate date.

I started to say  &quot; What is that &quot; only the &quot; &quot;what is&quot; was said in the bedroom at 1:15 and the &quot; that &quot; word was said in the kitchen at 7:45am. I said &quot; oh my god , Why are we in the kitchen now and why am I finishing my sentence in here. We felt as though we were dropped into the kitchen and in a big  hurry.  We were rushing around trying to fix breakfast and don&apos;t know why...   We don&apos;t eat breakfast right when we get up. Where did all the time go ? Where were we ? What was that tone and lights about ?  Did we go somewhere and don&apos;t remember ? Our three year old son said later that day that &quot; The mean men were coming back when its dark outside again.&quot; I asked him if the men drove here and he said no they come from up there and pointed to the sky.,...........WHen he was 2 years old he would wake up almost every night at the same time and talk to someone in his room It ws like he having a conversation. We would laugh and then once screamed bloody murder like something was hurting him. We went in his room and he clung to us for the rest of the night and said he was sacared of them. WHo ? He said those guys. When he was 1 week old we went in his room to feed him and he was in a totally different position than when we left him. THis happened about 5 or 6 times. He also developed a red triangular shaped mark on the back of his leg and it stayed there for 1 to 2 months before going away. We never did figure out what it was. It was about 1 Inch in size and he was about 8 months old.

I have had quite of few weird things happen in the last three years, like firecrackers going off in my bedroom and lights turning them selves off and on. I pick up strange conversations on the phone quite often too. One day I was sitting on the floor in my bedroom and heard a elecrtical zapping noise coming from behind me. I turned around to see my plant zapping electricity from one upper branch to a lower one. It burned it off the main stalk and left soot. It looked at though it had been burned off. The branch fell to the ground and was smoldering. I hope to hear from you soon and maybe you can make some sence of this.

I looked up and saw nothing. Once again about 1 minute later I saw something moving and turned my head I looked up and saw nothing. I kept walking and once again saw something moving out of the corner of my eye. THis time I kept my vision on the object and slowy turned my head and saw an enormous aircraft carrier in the sky. It was covered in lights that looked just like the stars.   I told ((name deleted)) what I saw and told her to look out of the corner of her eye and she would see something moving very slowly. On her forth attempt she zeroed in on it. She grabbed my hand and screamed &quot; oh my GOd&quot;&apos; . We started rumming for home and then decided to stop and watch it under a tree. We sat down shaking very hard from being so scared and watched it for about 1/2 hour. It circled the valley of Eburg 3 times very slowy and them disappeared as it turned to go back up higher in the sky. It looked just like the sky so you could not see it if you were just looking up. THe lights on it would change with the stars as it passed them so it didn&apos;t attract attention to a star being covered up. The reason you couldn&apos;t see it if you were just looking at the sky was because of this. It was so big , like 2000 747&apos;s hooked together . I don&apos;t know how high up it actually was but I would say 60,000 to 100,000 feet up. I have had so many weird things happen that I can&apos;t begin to tell you all of them. ..

They were dark.  I had just crossed Cherry Hill where there is an open view because of fields.  The sky ahead was cloudless and blue with large, puffy, dark clouds to the west and lighter ones to the east, but these &quot;objects&quot; were against clear blue sky.  They caught my eye because they were moving so fast from east to west (crossing Sheldon Rd. and seemingly traveling parallel to Ford Rd. which is a very heavily travelled road) and so low that I could see two of them, one flying in front of the other.  I live approximately 10 miles from Detroit Metropolitan Airport and see planes flying all the time, and less than 6 miles from Willow Run Airport whose flight path is directly over my house and these objects were not planes.  Planes never fly that low, east to west, around here.  These objects were too high, too big and too fast to be birds.  As I continued to travel north, and they to the west, it looked as if there were really three distinct objects with space between them with the first one hiding the one in the middle until I was farther north to see it.  Then they went behind the trees and out of my sight.  When I got to Ford Rd. I looked to the west but couldn&apos;t see a thing.  Then I turned west and parked in a large strip mall lot to search the skies, but I could not see a thing.  I looked at my van&apos;s clock and the time was 7:06 p.m. Eastern Standard time.

I was facing approximately north when the entire surrounding area lit up brightly for several seconds. I began looking toward the garage to my left on the property to see if a spotlight had been turned on. While turning, I noticed a bright light coming from high up shining through a tree in the yard. I stepped to my left to see the light without the tree being in the way. I was facing approximately west. At about sixty degrees above the horizon, I could see a bright trail angled down from right to left terminating in a bright mass. When I held my hand at arm&apos;s length, the length of the mass and tail together was roughly that of my index finger. Within a few seconds, the light from the object had faded. I did not notice any smoke remaining after the flash faded. My first thought was that perhaps it was an exceptionally large meteorite. I have seen numerous meteorites in my lifetime, but have never seen anything light up my surroundings like this did. I then wondered if it might have been an Iridium satellite deorbiting. The thought that there was a space shuttle mission recently launched to the international space station made me wonder if there could have been an accident associated with that, although the notion clearly seemed like a stretch of the imagination.

It was triangular in shpae and it produced no light.  The only light that came from the objest was the light that was reflected off the bottom. The light source was the city of Naha which is 5 miles south of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.  The light that was reflected off the bottom was also oval in shape giving it the idea that the bottom was convex and had bulges(like that of a bird...air that goes around must speed up to catch up to the air that goes straight through). Plus the light was formed in a &quot;V&quot; formation like geese heading south for the winter which suggests the object was triangular. there were no flashng lights like a commercial airliner.  There were no headlights on it like a KC 130 aerial refueler(the sir station has KC-130&apos;s, CH-46&apos;s, and CH&apos;53s).  Th object did not make the sound of a KC-130 which has 4 propellars.

We were facing west, watching the sun set.  As the fireworks began, I found I was drawn to a bright red light just to the right of the fireworks.  I pointed it out to my husband and we speculated on it.  If it was moving, it was very slowly towards us because we couldn&apos;t discern much, if any, motion.  We thought it must be a plane and tried to focus on the fireworks.  But we kept being drawn back to it because it wasn&apos;t behaving like any plane we&apos;d seen and it didn&apos;t seem to be at the right altitude either.  It stayed there a long time and we heard others around us pointing it out as well.  It was there through the whole display and possibly longer (we had to get the children home). Later, the local free paper ran an article on a local UFO investigator and the recent sighting.  The report mentioned the light moving from West Des Moines to Windsor Heights and that it was seen to have dropped 1 or 2 objects (flashing red lights, I believe they said), but we hadn&apos;t seen that.  Of course, looking near and through fireworks likely obscured any other blinking red lights!  Many people in the city saw it, since so many of us were out for the holiday shows.  A follow-up report in the same paper said that it could not have been a plane, fireworks, weather balloon, etc.  There is no explanation as of yet.

It was pretty high up, but awfully big and bright enough that it grabbed my attention.  The driver in front of me even slammed on the brakes for a second.  But as quick as it came it also left.  The flash of green which had streaks of yellow and blue behind it only was around for about maybe two seconds.  It was pretty intense.  Im guessing that it probably was a piece of falling space garbage.  Or something like that.  But the thing that bothered me was the size of it. It was a rather large green blur of light.  And also that afterwords i saw a pair of helicopters in the area. This may not be related to anything that happened (whatever it was), but who knows. Plus the idea that it could have been a UFO is a pretty neat.  I believe in them. And I sure wouldn&apos;t throw out a ufo sighting as the source of the odd green lightstreak.  Im wondering if anyone has any further information on this possible sighting, there was nothing in the papers on monday or tuesday.  Maybe someone knows a bit more about it.", "Multiple sighting report!Hi, I wish to report a sighting. It occurred on August 20th, 2000. To begin with I wanted to go for a walk at 2:30 PM, so I decided to walk to a supermarket that was about a half hour walk! I got to the store at 2:55 PM bought coffee and left. On the way home I noticed the sky was very clear, yet there were some small white clouds! I was amazed there wasn&apos;t any chemtrails today! Then at 3:01 PM, I noticed a long chrome colored rod or bar shaped craft slowly moving from the east to the west. I kept looking at it and didn&apos;t see any wings on it! It then looked as if it disappeared. I kept walking home. Then when I was almost home at 3:21 PM, I saw the chrome rod again! I don&apos;t know if it was the same one, but it was the same as the one I saw at 3:01 PM. I noticed it was moving in the same direction again, from the east to the west, but this time I noticed there was a faint chemtrail cloud over the mountains in the west! I saw the chrome rod shaped craft go through this very this cloud and it vanished! Yet I could see it cutting a trail through this very thin almost clear cloud! It cut a path through it like an ice cutter does in frozen waters! Then at 3:27 PM, when I was only one block away from my house, near a funeral home parking lot, I notice the chrome rod one more time! This time it was moving from the west to the east! I also noticed that there was a cloud in the sky that looked sort of fake, for it looked like the edge of it was oily! Then to the lower left of that cloud there was a very tiny white cloud. Well the chrome rod shaped craft headed slowly toward this cloud, yet while it was heading there I saw the craft vanish and re-appear about 3 times against a background of clear blue sky! When it got near the big fake looking cloud it passed under it, but went into the very tiny white cloud and vanished! It never came out of it! Then when I got to my house, my sister came out and I told her about it! She didn&apos;t believe me. I showed her the cloud and we watched but we didn&apos;t see the chrome bar shaped craft anymore. But then, from the fake looking cloud a black flat object dropped from it, then flew quickly into the west! She said it looked like a bird, but it wasn&apos;t! I ran to get my dad&apos;s video recorder, but both batteries were completely dead! Well that ends this sighting report! If your interested, I had more sightings I never reported. They are below. In the winter of 1994, I got up in the middle of the night because I couldn&apos;t sleep. For some reason I looked out the window and saw a very bright amber colored light heading from out of the south to the north. It was heading towards my house! The amber color is beyond explanation, for it pulsed from bright amber to complete darkness, and inside the amber was a reddish color! When it got closer it instantly turned to the east and looked like it was following the Lackawanna river that is near my house! When it turned I could see how the side of this craft looked! It had a very flat thin dark black bottom, and it&apos;s top part was amber with red in the middle and was pulsing off and on slowly! Then as it followed the river, something happened! It&apos;s hard to explain this but here goes! It was ejecting things from the craft, but you couldn&apos;t see them until it got away from the craft! They then looked like sparks falling to the Earth! I notice it did that until I couldn&apos;t see it any more! End of that sighting. Then this one is the best of all sightings! It happened in late March or early April of 1997! It was around then because Passover was approaching! Well the sun just set and it was still bright out! I always lay on my couch and look out the window towards the mountains in the south. Then I noticed the stars were becoming noticeable. It was then, just above the mountain range to the south I noticed what I thought was a star. But to my surprise it jumped from about 1 inch over the mountain, to about 2 feet above the mountain! When I say 1 inch and 2 feet, that&apos;s just how it looks from my window! Then when it jumped higher in the sky, it got extremely bright, then went back to it&apos;s normal brightness! It did that 3 times, then I almost fainted, for what I saw I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes! I guess that craft that looked like a star signaled another craft that the coast was clear, for as soon as it pulsed 3 times this happened! The exact, and I repeat the exact craft that Bob Lazar calls the sport model came from out of the east, and went to the west! It was so close over the house tops I couldn&apos;t believe it! It was bronze in color, and had towards the bottom, light spinning just like on the Jupiter II of the original Lost in Space series! I saw it&apos;s lighted interior, but I couldn&apos;t see any beings or men in the windows! I watched it until I couldn&apos;t see it any more form my window, then I ran downstairs and outside, but it was gone! It didn&apos;t move fast, yet it was silent and very stable! It was so sleek and awesome! When I saw that craft, I knew Bob Lazar was telling the truth! That craft was his sports model UFO! Yet to this day, no one reported this! Not one! I saw it but couldn&apos;t believe my eyes! I always listen to Jeff Rense and I used to listen to the Art Bell show, and from one show that Art Bell had on I think I found out something! I remember Art had on a guest named Victor that had a clip called the alien interview! Well he said this, &quot; From what I understand, all the alien craft have been moved into the northeast! &quot; Well I think they have moved into the mountains near my house! For some strange reason they have built a highway atop of southern mountain range in which I have seen Bob Lazars sports model UFO! During the night about 3:00 AM I see lights in the clearings of the mountains, I don&apos;t think they are vehicles! Yet I don&apos;t know! I also hear many nights the droning noise of turbine engines coming from the mountains! I see craft that are very dark flying ultra fast towards the mountains! They move so fast they look like your seeing things! Well that&apos;s it for me.

The craft emitted a blue laser beam from the craft to the ground and a blue egg shaped object which looked like it was comprised of millions of tiny particles of energy,was &quot;beamed down&quot; to the earth from this craft as if from some star trek movie. The blue egg shaped object was carefully projected down the laser beam and once it was &quot;released&quot; at ground level the laserbeam retracted back into the spacecraft.  We had the local airport tower on the phone during the event and the airtraffic controller on duty assured us that there was nothing on the radar fitting this description and that the only thing they had on radar was a medivac unit coming into san antonio from boerne flying from west to east into the airport.The air seemed to buzz with an electric/static during the event, and as soon as the blue egg was released from the beam the spacecraft took off at an extremely high rate of speed then disappeared.Could anyone tell us what it was that we witnessed being beamed down ?

I was looking at the unusual number of contrails in the sky to the west of the town, when we both noticed what at first we thought was an extremely large airplane banner in the sky at about 2 o&apos;clock high. It was rectangular in shape. Then we realized that there was no plane in front, and it was not moving. It looked to be about 2 miles away, and appeared to be the size of a football field. We observed it for about 30 seconds, until trees blocked the view. On subsequent trips past this area, we haven&apos;t seen anything that could resemble it, so we know it wasn&apos;t something that we mistook for a ufo (like a billboard, microwave tower, etc.).", "The saucer floated with lights circling around it, and with a bright flash shot away.I woke up at 4:21 am. durring exam week last year because of what I thought was heat lightning.

Then there was another bright flash and it shot straight up into the sky.", "Strange fireballs on Dec. 03, 1999 on the West side of Lodi.  They hung around for about four hours, and military planes flew over.Around 7:30pm on Dec. 03, 1999, my cousin (who at the time was 10 years old) and I went outside to wait for Santa Claus to come by on his firetruck (a town Christmas tradition). I need to give you a quick description of where we live.  We live on the West side of Lodi, our house faced north but to the west of us across the street is nothing but fields going towards the delta.  The only houses around us are to the east and north.  As we were outside waiting I happened to turn to the west towards the field and noticed two large orange/red fireballs hanging over the field just a little above tree level.  I had my cousin go in the house and get three more of my relatives.  As we watched these lights they would appear and disappear as if throwing alight switch, and sometimes they would just get real dim then glow real brightly.  Around this time four more of my relatives were driving by so we flagged them down to watch.  There were other motorists on the road, and some looked like they were looking at the objects, but I&apos;m not sure if any one else saw them.  Anyways, this whold thing lasted about four and a half hours of these huge fireballs appearing, disappearing, dimming, and darting back and forth. And the entire time aircraft was circling them, I mean lots and lots of airplanes.  AT one point a huge military plane flew right over our house and it was so low you could see the missles attached to it. One of the unknown craft went flying down the field, just barely over the grapevinyards, and it seemed to be spinning as it flew.  It had red and blue lights andit was so fast we couldn&apos;t even tell where it went.  So to make a long story short Lodi was full of strange lights that night and after that night we saw them around five or six more times.", "Triangular shaped craft (20-30ftlength of side) with a light at each corner, hovered motionless 40-50feet over a farmhouse.I was driving on Hwy 35 north from Ankeny Iowa to Ames. About 5-7 miles north of Ankeny I casually looked over to the right side of the road at what appeared to be a farmhouse. As I was approaching the farmhouse I saw what looked like lights for the farmhouse but as I approached the farmhouse I saw something that looked nothing like a typical pole light. First no light was illuminating any kind of pole that would be holding it up. Second I saw that the three lights were unusually distant from each other(about 20-30ft?)and arranged in a perfect triangle. Also the lights were higher than nearby oak or elm trees leading me to think that it was about 40-50ft high above ground. but the most astonishing detail was that the lights didn&apos;t appear to be pointing strait down but rather out and down at an angle. This allowed some kind of surface around the light to be illuminated, showing the outline of the craft.", "Cigar in Memphis 1974.my mother was visiting her sick uncle at the V.A. hospital in Memphis in the late summer to fall of 1974. She and her aunt went out to the Denney&apos;s nearby for dinner. Mother said that everyone in the parking lot ust kind of all looked at the same time at some trees in a nearby (field, I&apos;m guessing). Over the trees there was a silvery cigar shaped craft.She said &quot;It looked like an airplane with no wings or tail, I could see the lit up windows and everything.&quot; My great aunt refuses to talk about it to this day. The reason I&apos;ve sent in a 26 year old report is that I am trying to figure out how many people, other than those in the Denney&apos;s parking lot, saw this craft on that date. I am not at all sure of the date, but am certain of the year, the story and the locality.", "Stars that move erradically and make trails like meteors.Actually this is a typical sighting. ANY clear night in Kenosha County even out my back door I can see at least 3 UFOs moving around. My last sighting was at the Fox River and Highway 50 fishing for Walleyes.  I always see UFOs out there.  There is  an Indian Effigy Mound near there on Highway 83 North of highway 50. It is shaped like a panther and stands for the &quot;water spirit.&quot; I have had over 200 sightings since 1996 and have seen a big yellow ship come out of the clouds in 1996 in front of my apartment as big as 4 city blocks with my friend and it lit the whole sky up and shot off at 90 degree angle in milliseconds. So sometimes the UFOs just move around a bit or streak off and make &quot;trails.&quot;  I have seen two UFOs making a &quot;U&quot; shaped pattern over and over at the Fox River also. I also have been abducted since age 5 and have seen aliens in my room. I still am being abducted and think I being used for genetic experiments and used for sexual purpose for some reason. Thanks!", "&quot;Baton-shaped&quot; object moving end-over-end in clear afternoon sky.It was in September of 1986 around the middle of the month, weekday, probably a Thursday between the hours of 1500 and 1800 CDT, most likely around 1600 to 1700 hrs.  I was driving north within the city and stopped for a traffic signal.  I looked up and saw what appeared to be something falling from the sky in a spiralling motion.  I was naturally quite curious and when the signal allowed me to proceed, I crossed the intersection and pulled into a then vacant business drive access.  I got out of the car and saw that the object was not falling but rather was moving in a southern direction by flipping end over end with a &quot;scooting&quot; motion between flips.  The object was metallic in appearance, cylindrical in shape with a small sperical apperature at both ends, rather like a majorettes baton, except not as elongated in the shaft and the tips being slightly larger in proportion to the baton.  I was intrigued by this motion and shape of the object and looked around to see if anyone else was observing this; though  there was plenty of traffic, no one else seemed to notice.  I then looked around in the sky and saw 2 jets travelling in the same southerly direction, but they were northeast of the object.  The jets were in a &quot;half-V&quot; formation and seemed to be moving at a speed and course congruent to a &quot;trailing&quot; flight.  The jets were at a fairly high altitude as they were quite small, but clear in appearance.  As I recall, it was a clear day absent of clouds, so I cannot accurately guage the altitude of the object itself.  However, as an ex-paratrooper I can safely say that it was not less than 2000 feet above the ground, but it could have been much higher as there was nothing in its immediate sky-space to relate it with, and it being an unfamiliar object, I had no mental reference of how large it actually would appear in relation to its distance.  If it was at the same altitude as the jets then it would have been immense in size, however the jets were sufficiently far enough away from the object to prevent an! eyeball comparison.  If this object had openings, lights or other &quot;decorations&quot; I did not see them, what I observed was what appeared to be a solid metallic object void of any rough texture, creases, etc.  The motion as described before, was &quot;graceful&quot; in that it took approximately 3 seconds for the &quot;rear&quot; sphere to become the &quot;front&quot; one, in relation to its direction of movement.  Then its &quot;scooting&quot; duration was about the same amount of time of 3 seconds, before it would engage another &quot;flipping&quot; motion.  When it performed this &quot;flip&quot;, it appeared that only the rear sphere changed altitude in relation to the ground, so that the front one remained on the same plane.  There were no &quot;dips&quot; or gawky motions or changes in velocity, that I observed, by the object.  As it began to fade from view in the south, I once again looked around to see if anyone else was watching this, to my disappointment, there was still no-one that I could see looking at this strange sight.  When I reached my destination I used the phone to     contact the local airport watchtower (ATC?) and inquired as to the object.  The person to whom I spoke with related that they were not aware of this and that there had not been any other reports made of the object.  I described the object to him and he stated that he had no idea what it was. He sounded neither surprised nor condescending, just matter-of-fact.  I would be interested to know if you are aware of any reports  which match the shape/motion criteria of this report.  I was 32 years old at the time.", "Saw a craft streak across the sky in ohio.We were driving on I-75 north, when we saw a flying object across the sky.  It was going from the east going west.

The other object was now directly north of me and moving towards the north. I turned onto highway 108 and pegged the 85 MPH speedometer in my vehicle trying to catch up with it. The object continued to move away to the north. I had to slow down to go through the town of Holgate and lost sight of it. I looked at the clock, it was 2:58 AM. I drove east of town on highway 18, stopped about a mile out of town and got out of my vehicle to search the sky but the object was nowhere in sight. I then observed a small plane flying from west to east directly over head, I clearly saw the wingtip lights and belly strobe and heard the engine. I returned to Leipsic at about 3:30AM. When I stepped out of my vehicle I heard rotor blades to the north and watched a jet copter fly from north to south. I am a 41 year old male. I have done some flying and amateur astronomy. I live 5 miles from an air force base and have seen lots of different types of aircraft in flight both day and night including the B2, F117 and SR71. The objects that I saw were brighter than anything in the sky and the brightness did not change when they moved away from me. At no time did I see any kind of structure, just steady bright white lights. They were not planets since they were too far north to be near the ecliptic and they changed position in the sky.", "The sky was darkly overcast at the time and while working on the computer something caught my eye about 400 yards to the North East. I have a Penthouse Suite on the 12th Floor. A silver ball appeared with great brightness and then in rapid succession the others came out to join it. They were all the same size and began to dance with each other in a playful manner back and forth; it looked like a tag match. The spheres were perfectly round and the silver brightness against the black sky was not a natural light source in the least, but a powerful bright silver. Did anyone in London, Ontario see what I witnessed?", "I was out in my garden looking to see if I could see the comet Hail Bop,,it was nice and ark,,I could see aircraft heading in and out of Heathrow,,but out of the corner of my eye ,I noticed a round orb shape object coming toward me,,as it got nearer I could see there was another orb ball type behind the first one ,,only this one was smaller,,there  were no lights,,and they were aluminium in colour, no sounds and they passed directly over my head!! Shortly after this incident I was admitted to hospital with a swelling on the right side of my head,,the doctors said I had encephalytus,,I think I had something very different,,but no one person believes a word I say,,I know different!! I am a level headed man,,ex forces too,,I know what I saw was very real!", "South on Highway 5, rectangular object w/blue lights charged the freeway -- thought it was going to run me off the road.Driving south on Highway 5 in California, just south of Fresno area. At first I thought I saw a plane coming in to land just ahead of me off the freeway, but it was flying way too close to nearby houses, and there was no airport nearby.  Then the object looked like it landed, but shot up in the sky, flipped around, almost in a full circle. I watched it swing out towards the fields I was driving past, then turned and seemed to CHARGE THE FREEWAY.  It was a rectangular object -- about as long as a pickup truck. It consisted of nothing but this grey strip. It had about five lights on it -- when I saw it in the distance they were white.  When it was coming towards the freeway, they were blue.  It was heading east towards my car, I thought this thing was going to run me off the road.  It was flying extremely low to the ground.  I just kept driving, and I passed it.  I was going about 70 mph.  I lost sight of it after that -- I kept driving but could see no sign of it in any of my car mirrors.  It seemed to disappear.  I looked around at the other cars on the freeway to see if anyone had seen it -- no one else stopped.  I flipped on the radio to see if anyone reported seeing the same thing.  I am unaware of any reportings. There was a heavy meteor shower that night, I saw lots of shooting stars. This happened just as it was getting dark.  When I saw it look like it was landing, it was late dusk -- by the time I had driven past it it was dark.  This thing maneuvered in ways I&apos;ve never seen aircraft be able to do -- it was definately not a plane, jet or helicoptor. Time and locations are close approximations.

I just noted the sighting reported from Bend, Oregon and I need to chime in that I saw that and took two photos, yet to be developed. I was at the Pilot Butte Oregon State Park, which is a large conical volcanic cinder butte which has a road to the top and there were probably ten or twelve other folks up there then at the viewpoint overlooking Bend and vicinity..  My wife works at the nearby ((deleted)) and I had about 15 minutes to wait till I picked her up as she got off at 5P.M..  The place has a great view down to the city of Bend and you can also look over to the Three Sisters Mountains to the west about 25 miles. I had been watching the sunset going down over Mt. Bachelor south of the Three Sisters. There was a high thin cloud layer above the 10,000 foot summits of those mountains, and over Bend.. After a few minutes of watching the sunset I took a few minutes to walk over to the east side to look down on the side where I could see the building  below where my wife worked. The sunset was creating a great shadow of the Pilot Butte Cone which was stretching some length of miles across the flat land to the east of town. By chance I had my camera in my car and I took a photo of the long conical shadow, but because it was dimming light I thought to myself that the photo probably would&apos;nt come out with much contrast or detail. As I walked back to my car on the west side of the overlook parking area I spotted this silver circle slowly rising to the west of Bend. I was looking down at it at first and it appeared to be several hundred feet above the ground already, but below my vantage point.  It looked like it might have risen from the forest area just west of the city limits.  My impression of it was that it was probably a large balloon, perhaps the size of a car, and probably three or four miles distant. My second impression was, is that a UFO? It deffinately appeared round and silver, but I did not see any lights or anything else of distinction on it. There was enough light left in the evening sky to see it pretty well and know that it was not a plane, copter, ultra light, hot air balloon or blimp. It was going very slowly up and drifting slightly north and east and coming for a time closer to my location as it ascended.. I felt this to be consistant with the light wind direction. I had seen a weather balloon launched just a few days before at the Salem, Oregon airport and it rose at a similar pace.  However it did not have that kinda inverted teardrop shape nor the hanging attachment of instruments like a weather balloon does. In that I had intended to photograph the great setting sun silhouette of the mountains, I went ahead and took two photos then with the circular object pretty much centered in the frame, just in case it was really a UFO..  By then the object had risen to about eye level and was above the tops of the distant mountains from my vantage point. I have not developed that roll of film yet, and at best it would probably appear no bigger on the print than this period&gt;. unless enlarged. If it is helpful, I! can pro vide a copy of those photos when developed. Had I observed any thing more out of the ordinary, like unusual maneuvers, I would have rushed that unfinished roll of film to the developer. I noticed several of the other folks at the top of the Butte looking at the object but nobody appeared too excited so I just presumed it to be a balloon and that they probably did too. In that it was time for me to go and pick up my wife by then,I drove on down the spiraling road from the top. Several minutes had elapsed and the object kept slowly floating up toward the high clouds. I lost sight of it as I spiraled down the road, and when I could&apos;nt spot it any longer I presumed it to have disappeared into the clouds.((NUFORC Note:  Time indicated is approximate.  It is an estimate of when sunset would occur in that part of Oregon.  We spoke with the witness, and find him to be quite credible.  He holds a responsible job.  PD))", "I saw an orb of white light traveling extremely fast at treetop level that appeared to be the size of my fist if I were to raise itIt was a full moon outside and there was no clouds in the sky. I was walking outside my residence when a bright whit orb flew aross the sky at an extremely high rate of speed. It looked to be about at treetop level. Pine trees as, I live in the Sierras. I waited to see if it would return or anything to follow, but nothing happened. If I raise my fist into the air it was about that size at the treetop level. Also it made no sound at all.", "the object was intentionatly staying at a standstill.

I was watching the jets do there thing when I noticed overhead, a silver object that appeared to be cigar shape bright silver color. I used my eyes to get a idea about how high it was, I guess around 7 to 10 thousand feet. I watched the object for a few minutes and showed it to the people who were sitting next to us along with my wife. We did not notice at anytime that the object had fixed wings to make it appear to be a plane and we were very positve about the shape.  It appeard also to be blunt on the ends not pointed like a high flying plane.  The object stayed in one spot for about five minutes and then dissapeard.", "White, disk shaped, and very fast.It appeared to be white, it was still at first, then it changed directions many times, then I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  There was only one.  There was also an airplane near by.  It was strange because the airplane turned around-- one minute it was going toward the object and the next it flew away.", "4 white lights initially stationary suddenly merged into one light and then when out.4 white lights became visible through a patchy cloud cover. It looked similar to Moon light breaking through a cloud, except there were three lights (and a fourth more faint). The three brightest lights were shaped in a triangle pattern and where not moving. They were about an extended arms length apart (like one hand on the 10 and the other on the 2 of a clock).  The fourth fainter light was off to one side from our position. They were almost overhead, possibly 15-20 degrees looking down, if looking directly overhead was 0 degress. Suddenly all four lights came together in the middle, they merged, moved down very slightly and then went out. The fourth light seemed to be just a hair behind the other lights as they merged together.  The movement happened in about 1 second. The lights seemed to be shining down, but it is difficult to tell as the clouds were obscuring them from a direct sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness appears to be describing advertising light, but that is a guess.

His cousin was also visiting from Los Angeles. She was taking a late night flight back to L.A. and we took her to the Jackson airport to catch her plane. After we left the airport we drove back to Lexington. We were only a couple of miles or so from the airport when we noticed 3 very bright lights far ahead of us just above tree level. They were so bright that we couldn&apos;t see what was behind them. The lights were arranged like the landing lights on a 727, with equal spacing between them, but the center was a few feet higher than the outer two. They were very bright white, like the color of halogen lights. I thought it must be a jet coming into the airport, but they were only a bit above tree level, which puzzled me. My friend, Bill, and I were both puzzled when after a few minutes of driving toward the lights they hadn&apos;t moved. We came to a rural intersection where the road we were on &quot;T&apos;d&quot; into a larger, divided highway. We stopped at the stop sign at the intersection and just sat there for a few minutes trying to figure what they were. At this point, the lights were directly in front of us, shining directly at us, and they were so bright that we couldn&apos;t see what they were mounted on. We were away from any town and  there were no other cars or streelights. We eventually decided to continue on back to Lexington, and to do so we had to turn left onto the divided road. We pulled across the highway and median (which was paved at that point so you could turn left onto the divided road) and stopped on the highway shoulder. The lights were on my right (I was the passenger) and I stared at them out my window, still puzzling about what they could be. We were neither drunk nor stoned, the windows in the car were rolled down, and the radio was off. There was no sound except the idling car engine. Bill took his foot off the brake and let the car idle down the shoulder. At that point, the lights rotated very slowly and with such pr! ecision of movement I&apos;ve never seen. There was no sound. The lights rotated so that they were pointing directly at the car, and as precisely as they had rotated to stay pointing at the car, they now travelled beside us at the same elevation they had been and not more than about 300 feet away from us. They travelled alongside the car at the same speed we were moving, still idling down the shoulder. I have never been as scared as I was then, because it was clear to me that this craft, which we still couldn&apos;t see because of the intensity of the lights shining directly at us was following us. I urged Bill to &quot;floor&quot; the car and get the hell out of there, because it was so obvious that this thing was intentionally flying next to us and had responded to our movement. I had no idea what might happen next, but I was so scared that all I wanted to do was flee. Bill eventually accelerated gradually and pulled off the shoulder into the right most lane. The lights still stayed beside us. After a couple of minutes of this the car picked up speed. The lights ceased flying beside us but rotated again so that they always pointed toward the car. Then their altitude decreased and they crossed over the highway at very low altitude, maybe 20-30 feet above the roadway, went directly over the trees on the opposite side of the road and went straight down into the trees and disappeared. At this point, I got my courage up and asked Bill to turn the car around and go back. We came to a crossover in the median, did a U-turn and headed back. We got all the way to the intersection where we had turned originally, but never saw them again. We turned around again and headed toward Lexington. When we eventually came to a gas station that was open we pulled in so I could use the pay phone to call the Jackson Airport FAA. My father worked in radar for the FAA in Texas, and he had told me that they sometimes received calls about sightings but usually just blew them off, so I was prepared for what the controller I spoke with said, which was &quot;oh it ! was prob ably a helicopter or something.&quot; However, I knew it wasn&apos;t any kind of aircraft I&apos;d ever seen because of the incredible precision with which the lights moved and the total silence. I have told some friends and family about this, but I&apos;ve never reported it because I didn&apos;t know who to tell. Last night I heard the 21st century radio program where a gentleman told about his sighting in 1936 in Alaska. This inspired me to dig out an old journal where I had written about this. I got your website from the radio show and I decided to tell this story. I&apos;ve never had another experience like this, although I&apos;ve promised myself that if I ever was priveleged to have another I wouldn&apos;t panic and try to get away.", "Boomerang -triangular shaped object traveling just east of Long Beach Island NJ..It was late saturday night ..A girl that iam seeing and I were sitting in the hottub in the back yard of a house that iam renting.. We were facing east.. We noticed a few shooting stars that night.. There was a bright star in the eastern horizon ..I am guessig that it was venus.. As i lay back in the tubb chatting i saw a section of sky that seemed to be blurred.. This section was just north of that bright star... I tried to clear my eyes,figuring that i had gotten somthing in them.As i did this ,,my friend said what the heck is that!! and pointed to the area just right of the bright star... I clearly saw a boomerang shaped,triangular something.. It was as large as jumbo jet ,,or slightly larger.. There was definately ,more surface area than a jumbo jet.. It was camoflagued in to the sky.. What iam trying to say ,,is that it tookon the darkness of the sky,,with little bright spots to resemble the background of the surrounding stars.. The only other way to describe this is using the movie Predator as an example... I took on its surroundings but the area inside was blurred of fuzzy in respect to the surroundigs.The outer edge was illuminated due to the moon being toward the west behind us..The moon was almost full and the sky was clear .. The glare of the moon illuminated the edges of this thing and showed the boomerang shape clearly... If the moon was not shining in that direction we feel that the object would have been very hard to detect... The object crossed the sky from the northeast moving to the southwest... It was traveling sideways with the point of the triangle pointing to the west... It crossed quickly with out any trace of sound..The time was 1:10 EST ,,the ground wind was out of the west at about 5-8 mph.. Skys were clear ,, visability i would estimate over 20 miles..  The altitude of the object seemed to be around 15000 feet in my estimation.Based upon my experieces in traveling in comercial airplanes ,and skiing large mountains.. I would also estimate that it covered a distance in the sky of approximately 50 miles in that 10 to 12 second of time.. There were no traces of propulsion,,smoke,,vapor,,sound,,or any accompaning objects..The outline was whiteish,,as that of the glare from the moon.. The object was seen clearly without mistake of an aircraft ..It had no ligh! ts..Abou t ten minutes later a commercial aircraft passed in the area traveling north ..I wonder if the pilot saw anything..I told my observation to my friend and she said she saw the same thing exactely..

I remember looking outside. well we were folding when suddenly from in back of me and my brother and the front of my mom hovered a red ball of glowing light.  We quickly turned and backed up trying to figure out what this is, besides my mom who didn&apos;t do anything but look up at it.  But before we could really try to move, time slowed way down.  I stood there looking at my brother but he was right in front, 5 feet from the window so I guess because he was lookin right at it he couldn&apos;t move.  I am a little more observant but the light got very bright and I could see the light wrapping around my brother.  This didn&apos;t take  long but it felt very long as the light got my attention and got me.   I remember  my eyes shutting with cray red light all around us in the room.

My mom went right back to the dryer which is 2 feet from the bed, my brother remembered that day probably for only two days cause he wrote it in his diary the next day.

My mom at the dryer as I walked by was looking at her watch and said to my brother and I that a hour passed and it was dark outside.

Hearing this tale broughts me to my knees at the dinner table trembling in tears while my wife and sone sleep the night away not knowing of an encounter I had when I was 17 years of age that I have kept silent all these years for many reasons I am sure you can understand.  I lived in an area that was a fairly quiet suberb of Painesville, ohio it was a 2mile circle of residential homes with duplexes/ town homes in the center.  A very quiet community. On the evening of august 17th, 1979, I was 17 years of age.  It was a quiet evening with clear skies.  you could see all the stars and constilations in the sky with a light breeze.  a very cool evening.  I was living with my mother and step father in a residential home on the outer circle and was walking home after playing the guitar over a freinds house trying to write lyrics for a melody we came up with.  You could hear the crickets in the field as I walk down the road.  I was a bit chilled though, . I did notice that there was absolutely no one outside of their homes all bundled in for the night and scattered far apart there were lamp posts but they were so far apart it was really still pretty dark.  I guess I was too busy trying to keep warm because i didn&apos;t wear a coat and i was running the lyrics to my song through my head to take notice that all of a sudden everything was silent.  I didn&apos;t hear the crickets anymore, i heard nothing.  dead silence and a wierd sense of being watched and all of a sudden i just stopped walking.  The first thing I did was raise my right hand and look at my wrist watch and the time was 9:37pm.  What I encountered next I really don&apos;t know how to explain but I remember looking upwards to the sky that I had just seen stars just moments earlier and I just stood in total awe trying to take in all this information in total awe of the huge amassity of this huge thing that I swear was several football fields in either direction. it was smooth and very flowing in design. it was like a huge mother ship that completely took out the sky above me in every direction.  I remember seeing a huge cylindrical shape in the center that extended down maybe eight feet taht maintained a dark red glowing hugh almost like the black out lights used in the military but it was intense yet at the same time it was not lighting up the area at all.  I also quit vividly remember hearing a very LOW EARTHLY RUMBLING SOUND VERY DEEP IN PITCH LIKE AN EARTH QUAKE BUT VERY LOW AND DEEP IN PITCH.  iT WAS AS IF IT WAS FOLLOWING ME DOWN THE ROAD JUST GLIDING ACROSS THE SKY AT A VERY SLOW SPEED THAT WOULD CAUSE ANY OTHER CRAFT TO CRASH. All of a sudden i noticed three lights begining to strobe like a strobe light blue, red and white lights and I was hit with a solid beam of pure white light.  this all happened in a matter of three minutes topps since I looked at my watch at 9:37pm.  The next thing I remember I was walking back down the road in a very calm and relaxed state as if I came out of surgery just comming off sodium pentithal.  it was just a real peaceful relaxed feeling yet It was very much over shadowed with a very strong sense of being violated and my under arms were stinging bad.  when I got home i removed my shirt to find that my under arms were both bleeding and I was missing flesh.  But I remember that when I found myself walking back down the road in a drug enduced state I remember looking back at my watch and it was exactly 10:05 pm!  approxamately 25 minutes passed that I could not account for because it only seemed to actually have taken place in a matter of three or four minutes.  To this day I have identical scar patterns under both arms and since this tramatic experience that I was put through against my will I will live with this untill the day I die.  I do know that what I saw and experienced was as real as the car I drive and the air that I breath and you are the first to know of my abduction.  I didn&apos;t ever say anything to anyone for the fear of becoming someones lab rat!  You can reach me by leaving a message on my e-mail at ((e-address deleted)).COM.  i am now 39 yrs, going on the big 40 January 7th.  I am willing to share my story to the listners on the radio show.  it was because of this show that I decided to come forward.  I do not wish to reveal my last name or address.  To this day, every night I go to bed and.  wonder what was done to me!  All I can say is that we as a people on this planet have great concern to be worried with technologies this advanced.  I was under the impression durring this ordeal that these ships as far as our technology was concerned are totally and completely untouchable, unstopable and indistructable.  We have great cause to be seriously concerned and with the increase of sightings and such close encounters which i fear are deliberate and with purpose, it  will not be far too long before we know the truth.  Do you really think they care if they are seen!  They are obviously getting bolder and bolder all the time.  You see TV shows like Star Gate.  What makes you so certain that things like this really don&apos;t exist!  They only appear to be seen when they want.  Just call me matthew be too", "BlindedOk for no reason I got off the bed went to the window and I saw a bright light and nothing else for a split second. Next thing i know Im back were I was and my legs feel tired. It was like a split second in my mind cause i remember looking for a camera but then relising that this thing was long gone. I couldn&apos;t explain how i knew it was gone.", "((NUFORC Note:  The object reported over Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas on this Friday night apparently was a Russian &quot;Proton 2&quot; rocket casing, which re-entered the atmosphere over the Midwest.  To the best of our knowledge, the event had no special Biblical significance, although the Bible is not our specialty here.  PD))The Book of YahwehOn Oct 13, 2000 we were keeping the first day of Tabernacles... in fact it was just a very few min. after sundown which begins the day and we looked up in the sky not too high and a vessel traveling at a great speed but putting out a lot of smoke from behind it was spotted.  Within moments it passed almost directly overhead traveling to the North and all of a sudden split up into 4 different parts... almost like an explosion.  One of the Abilene, Texas News crews actually had some footage on this thing but it seems as though it got hushed up pretty quickly.  I know that I would like to know more about it, and in a biblical sense think it&apos;s splitting up into four parts has to do with a prophesy of these end times. In fact the date given may actually be Oct 12th as it was actually the 13th after sundown, but following the Roman Catholic thing... it would have been the 12th until midnight.  The 13th was actually 7 years exactly from the time that the Peace Agreement for Israel was ratified and went into effect... exactly 7 years to the date of this sighting from the time the Peace Agreement was ratified!  Looking at the Peace Treaty... it was active exactly 3 1/2 years, and went out of effect for exactly 3 1/2 years when the sighting occoured!  A time, times and the dividing of a time... found in Revelations and also spoken of by the prophets.  October 13th was the date of the sealing of the Servants of Yahweh and in Revelations it speaks about the four Malakim (known to all the world as angels.. but angels are messangers of Satan and follow Her every command) that are holding back the winds of war so it doesn&apos;t hurt the earth, sea nor any tree... Revelations 7:1-8.  October 13th the servants were sealed and the Malakim were only holding the winds of war back until this sealing. I know this sounds far fetched and like I&apos;ve fallen off my rocker... maybe I have given you too much information that you feel is not relevant?  None the less, all these gods are doing is tresspassing on the earth under the Devil&apos;s control and She has only a short time to bring utter destruction to all mankind.  Her angels are what you find flying around in these space vessels.  The neandrethal man they found and did DNA testing on and found it to have no human DNA was one of these gods... one of the children of Yahweh... at least he created them too.  The vessel we saw that evening that broke up into four parts... right after the sealing of the remenant of the 144,000 the winds of war may have been released. Can you give me further information on what this vessel did after it split apart and where the other parts ended up?  I would not be supprized to hear that one landed at the Vatican to talk with the pope to hurry up and get the destruction under way as soon as possible.  We believe that Satan Herself is a guest in the Vatacan.. delivered by one of the vessels that come out of the comet that came forth from Jupiter somewhere around the exact time that the Peace Treaty went out of effect... 3 1/2 years after it went into effect 7 years ago on October 13th.  One of the vessels went over NM from what I understand and the other over the Vatacan... the city that sits on 7 hills... you can read about this place in Revelations 17:1-18, read it for yourself... remember in verse 9 it talks about this woman who has on her head written:  MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.... verse 9 says, &quot;And here is the mind which has wisdom:  The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.  We believe this woman..Satan the Devil now sits there in the Vatacan that sits on seven mountains... Rome is her new home.  She was cast down.. Revelations 12:9 says, &quot;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who DECEIVES THE WHOLE WORLD.  She was cast out into the earth, and her angels were cast out with her.&quot;  Has to do with the dates!  Remember when we had said that transmissions of S.O.S. were comming from Jupiter, and then all of a sudden this comet called....&quot;LEVI&quot; comes out of almost nowhere and bombards Jupiter for 6 days but stopped on Friday before Sundown... which begins the Sabbath.  Hit it with 21 big old rocks and then all of a sudden this other &quot;comet&quot; comes out from ...&quot;behind&quot;  Jupiter and heads directly toward the earth?????  Then this big old block of so called &quot;Ice&quot; explodes a short way out from earth... into two seperate chunks of &quot;ice&quot;????  When&apos;s the last time you saw a chunck of &quot;Exploding Ice????&quot;  Satan is here! my frie nds and sits with the pope who is about to take over the Holy Land.. as prophesied that it would be given to the gentiles. Now then please let us know what ocoured to those four parts of that one vessel that came to earth?  Can, or will you tell me where they ended up... United Nations building, Vatican, Moscow, White House.....????  Where???  Your help would be greatly appreceiated.  Thanks!", "Last night in the northern sky, I saw 2 bright lights. A golden amber color. One ws comming from the northwest, and the other almost intercepted it from the north. The one that was comming from the north was moving at first, then it stood stationary for about 5 min. The other light was moving slowly towards the south, Over Walnut Creek. Then the light that was stationary started to move. It just started to move straight up in the air. And then moved south. It must have climbed for about 5 seconds, but in that 5 seconds, it moved upward until it was almost a small light, then, it moved south. Both crafts had no sound, they had bright yellowish golden lights, and when they flew over head, there were two other lights on either side of the bright light. The bright light was in the shape of a star. It had points on it.((NUFORC Note:  Might be landing lights on an airliner.  Just a guess.

As I do on any clear night, I started to look at the stars.  From the East, an object which looked like a pen appeared and was moving toward the Detroit River (north from my location).  It began to turn northward just past Casino Windsor which has 5 circulating lights which shine upwards (similar to the lights at an airport).  It appeared as though the object momentarily observed the source of the light from the Casino, and then flew northwards (towards Michigan) between the Casino and the Ambassador Bridge.  Instead of flying in a straight line, the object began to fly in a snake-like pattern until it disappeared from my view.  I wasn&apos;t able to determine the height of this craft because there was absolutely no sound.  There was also a definite glow to the object.  At first I thought this was a reflection of light from either a boat in the Detroit River or from the Casino lights, but the sky was incredibly clear.  My heart began to pound, I began to sweat, and I got the chills  when I finally realized what I saw!((NUFORC Note:  A similar report was submitted from Houston, TX, for a sighting there on the morning of 08SE00.

Their was a large thunderhead to the south of us, it headed twards the large thunderhead and tuned on a tweenty to thirty degree angle and slowly went into the cloud. It was as big as the cloud.

I looked up and a similar object was returning from the direction the first one went.The second one didn&apos;t make as much noise as it headed SW about the same altitude as the first.

I was walking up a footpath/road about 30&apos; wide. I looked up to my right and saw a huge triangular shaped craft passing parallel to my position. I had a pair of 8x30 binoculars and started viewing it with them.  It was flying west and the sun was reflecting on the huge nose area and the leading edge of the wings and the area was smooth and rounded and was sand colored.  The underneath was shaded and grayish colored.  I seen no lights or windows.  It made a very faint jet sound.  It was leaving a very thick contrail.  I lost sight of it as it flew into the sun and the trees got in the way.  I then faced east and could see another one coming on the same flight path but closer to me.  Again I used my binoculars.  As it passed overhead and past me, I go a good look at the rear of the ship.  There was no tail and the rear of the ship looked very complicated.  I could see two rows of engines or exhausts where the very thick contrails was coming from.  There appeared to some kind of housing area around the exhaust areas and I saw a large strobing light on each side of the housing area.  There also appeared to be some type of louvered areas.  The top side of the back of the ship overhung the exhaust area and the bottom of the ship.  It is hard to estimate the altitude as this aircraft was HUGE!! It pretty much filled up my binoculars at times.Addendum: I saw two huge triangular aircraft leaving contrails.this is a report of additional information on an earlier report made 11-20-00. I went back to the location and got a gps location of 36 degrees 09.41 west by 087 degrees 04.43 west at an elevation of approx. 760 feet.

I was sitting on the couch watching TV when I noticed a bright white light through the shades of a west facing window. The light flashed several times and left a trail. My first thought was that someone was shooting fireworks in the neighborhood. Instead of disappearing, as would be expected, the light maintained it&apos;s position in the sky and began to strobe erraticly. I went out to the front porch and turned out the light for a better look. After a few seconds I once again saw the strange light. It was now farther away and higher in the sky framed between two trees. It began jumping very quickly from point to point in the sky. This was happening so quickly that at first I might actually be seeing 3 or 4 seperate objects. I ran into the house to call my daughter out. By the time I returned the object was higher in the sky and moving north at a moderate rate of speed. My daughter was too late to view the object. Approximately 1 minute after the the object moved north, another object appeared from the south moving in what appeared to me to be the same flight path of the original object. It had two equally bright lights (very bright- brighter than seen on most air craft). From the ground the lights appeared to glow steadily (no strobeing). By the time my daughter located my binoculars and brought them to me the second object was far to the north. As I looked with the binoculars the lights appeared to be colored red and green (odd because they looked white when seen from the ground)and were strobeing constantly at a very fast rate.

I asked a man coming out of a store to look at it and then I went into the store and had a young woman who works there, and another man come out to view it.  I then called the Bend Police Department&apos;s 911 line and reported it, and asked if they had any other reports of it, they said they did. My roommate then came home, and I had him look at it also.  We had a sighting a couple of years back that we also reported on this database, and this craft slowly dissappeared in the general direction as that one did, towards the now infamous cattle mutilation site of Sandy Springs to the south east of Bend.  We only just saw this thing, so I&apos;m going to call the Redmond airport and see if they have any information (I tried contacting the local newspaper but they were closed).  My roommate took a photo of it.  Right over the center of our town.  Wow.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and found him to be exceptionally convincing.  He has pursued facts surrounding the incident, to the extend of contacting the local news media, police, etc..

The object was huge, about the size of a baseball at arms length.  It appeared to be at least ten thousand feet altitude at 45 degrees.  It was not the moon, as the full moon was visable during the sighting.  The object followed the I-75 corrider through Fort Myers on the west coast of Florida.  I was west of the object looking east.  It became visable to me over the southeast portion of town and then it moved slowly north for about one minute.  I tried to reason this sighting as possibly a blimp.  But then it disapeared completely and reappeared roughly 5 miles north in less than 10 seconds.  It continued moving north slowly about four more minutes and faded in the distance behind cloud cover.  It appeared to be headed towards the Sarasota and Tampa area.  This object had to be sighted by many other people.

I shouted to my son (his name and) Look! Both of us observed and described the same thing to include that as we watched this object we observed between the three dim lights a &quot;fuzziness&quot; or blurring as if the three lights were connected but the connecting material was not possible to be clearly discerned.  This all took place in no more than 10 seconds.  The object(s) then suddenly vanished.

The &quot;tip&quot; areas of the triangle were not pointy but rounded.  There where large circles in each tip.  There were no lights,it was lit only by the ambient light in the area.

It just stayed in the same place.  Then it began to slowly fade awa.  It just became dimmer and dimmer until it was completly gone.     I am not by any means saying this was a  UFO, Alian or other.

(can&apos;t tell how many). the Park Rangers pick up the alien body(S) and took then to their station. there, one of the rangers found a camera and took several pictures of the alien while it was lying on a strecher.

Our understanding is that this alleged event, and many others in Puerto Rico, have been investigated by Jorge Martin, MUFON SD and Investigator for PR, and there may well be merit to the claims.

Whilst outside I looked out North into the night sky when I spotted what I thought to be a bright star just above the roof top of the house behind us. I continued looking and this light suddenly became brighter and it was moving.  Seeing this light, I initially thought that it may have been a helicopter or a plane headed due South.  However, this light was moving too slowly for it to be either of these crafts.  It was just one solid light with no flashing strobe lights that are present on aircraft and helicopters.  I then thought it may have been the blimp but this light was too high in the sky for it to be a blimp.  We live about 22 miles from Lindbergh Field Airport but this light was no aircraft per se as I see them every night and this was nothing like the behavior of an aircraft. This light continued heading directly South and every now and then, the light became brighter as if slowly pulsing.  Occasionally the light would diminish a fraction but then it would come back to its normal intensity.  I continued watching it and the speed was very slow.  At one point it seemed as if it had come to a halt in mid air, but then continued on.  As it got closer I became aware that it made an acute right angled turn as it headed East. This had my curiosity really piqued, so I went back inside and got our binoculars to observe this light more closely.  I was able to pick it up and once again I saw the light increase in intensity.  As I followed it with my binoculars, it suddenly vanished completely.  I lowered my binoculars to see if I could pick it up again with the naked eye but it had gone. The slowness of the light and the acuteness of the turn told me that this was no aircraft.  What it was I do not know!  I have also witnessed other sightings and my husband and my son have also witnessed a couple of sightings  with me. This light may have possibly been a weather balloon, a satellite,  the space shuttle or something along those lines, but I feel that is was something else because of the speed of it and also the angle of path that it travelled when it went East.((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date of incident to 14NO00.

As the observers were eating dinner at their residence (elevation 650 ft. above sea level; at approximately 33 degree North latitude, 117 degrees West longitude) located at the mouth of a canyon,  observer #1 spotted a balloon-like object in the sky about one-half mile due east across a small valley and above a ridge at an elevation of approximately 750 feet above sea level. This is in an neighborhood of widely spaced large homes on large (1 acre+) lots in an uneven terrain. The object moved slowly toward the observers&apos;  home until about 1/4 mile away, when it  made a right angle turn to the north, at which time observer #2 saw it. The object, which was gray colored,  did not behave as a typical balloon. It  seemed to have a controlled flight path and a constant speed (perhaps 5 miles per hour), and it maintained a level elevation of about 750 feet.  It did not drift in  the breeze, nor change elevation, but moved slowly in a straight path. The observers moved outdoors onto the patio behind their residence, and observer #2 observed it thereafter through 7 x 35 binoculars.  After making a 90 degree turn to the north, it travelled slowly (estimated at 5 mph) due north across Lake Hodges and toward the City of Escondido, CA, in a straight line until it disappeared in the distance.  At one point, over Lake Hodges, the left (western) side of the object glinted in the setting sunlight. The oject had a shape somewhat between that of a balloon and a football.  It had no wings, or anything exterior to its basic shape,  and no antennae were observed.  It was about as large as a standard sized suitcase, about 3 feet long and 1.5 feet wide, and an elyptical shape, somewhat like a small derigible.

To get to the kitchen from the den, she had to walk right next to a set of sliding glass doors that ran parallel to the White Oak river.  She yelled for me to come into the kitchen to look at something, she had to call several times because she does the same thing at the site of  a cockroach, clearly an overexadurater.  This time however, she had spotted something much bigger than a roach. As I turned and looked through the glass and over the river, I caught my first sight of a black disk that must have been 30 feet in diameter and about 10 feet thick in the middle and tapering to about 3 feet thick equilaterally at the circumference. The craft was hovering about 50 feet above the water and approximately 120 feet from my siter and I.  That put our vantage at just slightly above the craft when I noticed the moon reflecting off of a semi-gloss black finish. We were stunned but not afraid.  We slid the large glass door open and walked out onto the first floor deck and the first strange thing I noticed was the complete absence of noise.  The craft was literally hovering noiselessly in front of me.  That is when the gravity of the situation hit me.  Living between Cherry Point Air Force Base and Camp Lejune Marine Corps base, it was not unusual for aircraft to fly directly over the house.  In fact it seemed that the Marine Corps had mapped a low altitude helicopter route directly over the house.  Helicopters do however make an unmistakable noise which would have been nearly unbearable at the range I was from the noiseless black disk. My sister and I walked across the deck and down the stairs onto the concrete driveway which was littered with shattered hickory nuts that had been run over by my mother&apos;s Buick.  The reason that I mention the hickory nuts is because I was bare footed at the time and the only thing that distracted me from the noiseless black disk was the incessant pricking on the bottoms of my feet.  It was for this reason that my sister and I walked off of the driveway onto the grass.  Myself having moved about 90 degrees horizontally, about 20 degrees vertically, and about 30 feet closer, it was fairly clear that the object was taking up 3 dimensional space. From the time that my sister called me to come see the object to the time that we were standing in the grass was a matter of about 2 minutes.  We stood in the grass for about 1 minute which also happens to be the amount of time we watched the craft before it left.  During that 1 minute, things went from being strange to being inexplicable.  The craft began to move slightly more into the bay and away from us, but it wavered a bit horizontally.  After about 30 seconds of that, it moved farther out into the channel.  At this position, it was equidistant from the shore and from the White Oak river bridge (of the two bridges, the bridge on the Swansboro side).  It wavered a bit in this direction as well.  Finally, as it slowly moved toward the bridge, it gained speed so quickly that its path was traced with a streak of light.  As it left, it moved forward much faster than upward, but it did move upward and to the left.  When I say it gained speed quickly, I mean that it was gone in a matter of a tenth of a second. When the last minute of the observation of the craft was over, the first minute of discovering its effect had begun.  Immediately I heard the noise of masses of minnows jumping in the water.  My sister and I walked down onto the dock to investigate the seemingly amplified noise.  What we discovered was a large area of foam.  In fact the water seemed to be boiling.  All around us the minnows were jumping.  Normally minnows swim in schools of about 30-60 which might measure 5 square feet in surface area.  While in a school, each minnow acts as one so that when one is scared the entire school is scared.  I have been in situations where maybe 5 schools of minnows will jump at the same time because I jumped on the dock, but never before and never since have I seen so many minnows jumping.  In retrospect I wish I would have put my toes in the water to see if it was hot, but I didn&apos;t.  I&apos;ve often wondered if the thick foam on top of the water was caused by all of the minnows jumping or if all the minnows were jumping because the water was foamy. At that point, approximately 7 minutes had passed and my mother had come outside.  My sister and I told her what had happened and I guess she was too tired to care.  A few months after the experience I drew what I had seen with crayons for a science teacher, and I bet he still has it somewhere. At the time, my sister was 13 years old and I was 8 years old.  My sister and I haven&apos;t talked about it since just after it happened.  During my education at a state supported University, I realized how contradictory what I have seen is to contemporary physics.

It landed on the beach just past the dunes. with an amazing rainbow effect going around underneath the craft. We stayed in the car with the lights off to see what would happen.

Driving along a &quot;country&quot; road in a feild that runs parrallel to the ocean, shoreline which is about 100 yards to our left. It was clear out. I noticed out over Frenchman&apos;s Bay a copper colored glowing dot, just above the water,about a mile away. Then the &quot;dot&quot; was moving, appeared to be flying like a plane tward the shore, and us. It had blinking colored lights, green, blue, but still copper orange like flames surrounding. I pulled the jeep over and said &quot; Is that a plane on fire?&quot; to the two girls that were with me. Then the &apos;dot&apos; turned bright white reflecting a path of light on the water tward shore. The moon was out and was reflecting on the water as well, though it was candle yellow and very dim compared to this thing. I then thought it was spotlights from a helicopter, because the object was moving to slowly to be a plane. It had reached the shore, at the most 150 yards away from us, about 75 feet off the ground. I shut the jeep off and unrolled my window to listen, expecting to hear the sound of a helicopter. The girls got nervous exclaiming, &quot;What are you doing?!&quot; The object was silent aproching from the left, up a treeline forming the edge of the feild, close to the tree tops. We sat silent as the object crossed the road directly in front of us, just above the powerlines. It was close enough that I had to lean forward and look up in my seat to see it. It was bright white like oncomming car headlights, as it crossed and went out of sight in the trees to our right. We didn&apos;t really say much, we were just bewilderd. I started the jeep and we drove about two miles up the road to drop one of the girls off at her house. The house was directly beside the road. As she was getting out of the car she said &quot; Youguys, get out and look at this.&quot; The object we had just seen cross the road was right above, and behind us so we couldn&apos;t see it while driving. It was as close to the trees as it could be. We stood in the road, as it aproached, then was directly above, going very slow. I could have hit it throwing a rock. Bright white from the front, underside, and rear. I may have been able to see up through the center of the craft, as though it were a doughnut shape, but I&apos;m not shure. The object appeared to have &quot;geometric framing&quot;, or narrow beams connecting in weird patterns around the perimeter. I walked with it 100 feet down the road, looking back at the girls, which shone no light on them. I was still nearly under the thing holding out my bare arm showing no light, yet it was so bright that when you looked at it, it was shrouded in light. The craft went down the road above me making no noise. I was holding my breath, and turning my head to listen, and I might have heard the slight wirring of machinery, or hum of electricity. But it was to insignifigant to say. The craft went down the road 100 yards and turned back tward the water.

He said he and his girlfriend saw a UFO flying in the direction of my house and told me to run outside to see if I could see anything.  I did and looked all around; saw nothing.  He was extremely excited and wanted to know if we would pick them up and go out driving to look for this thing.  Ok, we did.  Drove back in the direction of where he thought it went.  Found a side gravel road where it was dark and sat there looking up at the sky.  It was very eerie; a very quiet, dark country road.  We sat there watching the sky.  I was on the passenger seat in front, my boyfriend on my left on driver&apos;s side; the other 2 in the back seat.  He said to look for a bright star-like object.  After approx. 20 minutes waiting.  I saw a bright object which I was fixated on.  The next instant it appeared directly near us in the sky; above the treetops toward the backside of the car.  I yelled to look and all of us stared at it.  It was a huge saucer-like object with red light blinking on and off around it.  After a few minutes it disappeared so fast we couldn&apos;t tell which direction it went. It was so unreal. But the 4 of us saw it.((NUFORC Note:  We assume the date may be approximate.

Just after the sun set, around 7:00 pm we witnessed 14 to 16 luminous sphere like objects in the sky for one hour.  They would slowly fly across the sky, change direction and then reappear in another portion of the sky altogether.  At one point a sphere &quot;flashed&quot; us appearing to have increaded tremendously in size briefly in an intense flash.  We were able to clearly discern these objects from other meteor &quot;shooting stars&quot; that evening which were occasionally present as well.  This event took place in a clear night sky without the moon, which rose hours later.  The &quot;flash&quot; occured when I directed a question  internally whether this could be my imagination.  A few of the individuals in the group had other sightings but most of the group had never seen anything like this before.  It was an entirely fascinating and extraordinary event which covered three days in total as one person in the grop had a contact experience the night before in the high andean village we stayed at before the ascent to the plateau, and again the following two nights on the mountain.  We later learned of another group near Mt. Adams (Washington State), witnessed by reporter Michael Miley of UFO Magazine,  had a sighting similar to our on the following days of May 23 and 24.

This was in a wooded residential area on a little street that is only about 6 blocks long, end to end.  There were no other cars on the street except mine, which is not uncommon since the street just leads to another road that is a dead end.  The craft had very bright green lights in the front and very bright, bright white lights in the back, one on each corner.  The white lights were so bright they illuminated the back of the craft and you could see it was solid across the back.  The green lights in front (one at the point and one or two on each side very close to the front point)  were also bright and emitted a green glow downward as they passed over my vehicle.  It was similar to witnessing a traffic accident where the crash may have only taken 1 or 2 seconds, but everything seemed to move in slow motion.   Looking out my windshield, first I saw the green glow from above, then the green lights as the first aircraft passed over my car.  I thought it was a plane that was going to land in the street and I slammed on my brakes and the green and white lights from the 2nd craft passed over my car and I realized they were 2 jet like aircraft, except they were triangle shaped and I said out loud &quot;What is that?&quot;   They appeared to be flying in formation and reminded me of the way the Blue Angels fly, so close together.   The 1st one was in front of and a little to the left of the 2nd one. (The right 1/2 of it was in front of the 2nd one)  They flew very fast, very close together, had very, very, bright, bright lights, were just above the tree tops and were silent.  My car window as half to 3/4 of the way down and I did not hear a sound.  They continued to fly North.  I estimate the total time I observed them as 6 or 7 seconds.  I am a middle aged, professional, married woman and this is my first sighting.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be quite serious minded in her approach to the incident.  The party was quite convincing, and the person occupies a position of responsibility in the business community.  We have checked with the administrators of local sky cameras, and have found no record of the incident yet, but if the objects were at as low an altitude as the witness suggested to us, they would not have been recorded on the camera in Woodinville, WA; its effective horizon to the west is some 20 degrees above the horizontal plane.

I watched it stay in the apparently same location for about five or more minutes. At this point thought it was two large and very close stars. I then went into the house and told my mother to come see it. We wasn&apos;t looking at it very long and then it started to approach us. I could tell it was getting closer because the two large lights was spreading further apart and getting larger. The lights blinked off and on twice and what I thought was going to be a thrid time but instead the two lights just very went dim. Soon it was directly overhead and this is when I looked through my binoculars for a better look. My mom who was talking on the phone heard lots of static on the cordless phone. I could tell that it was triangular except the point of the triangle was the tail instead of what I believe should be the nose. The tail had a very small red light compared to the large front lights. These lights looked as tough they was pointed down at a forty five degree angle. It was flying very low and I could hear the engine. The engine sounded as though it had zero throttle. It did&apos;t sound like the planes to day but those in old war movies. As soon as it crossed over my house I went to the front porch and watched it circle over high way about 3000 yards away. Then Sept. 9, 2000 I seen two transport helicopters then about five minutes later I seen a Apache or simiular helicopter going in the direction of where the object came from. Then I remembered seeing three helichopters come off the ground and fly over me about ten minutes before the strange object on the the night of Sept. 1, 2000. The are no airports near my area which is in the country. The lights was was bigger than the moon that night. And I believe the moon was almost full that night. I am certain that is was very large and flying very low.

Small aircraft moving in other direction!After having gotten out of bed due to some extreme lower back pain I looked out of the window at bedside and started to look at the sky which was filled with stars. The moon had set and as I was looking to the Southwest at Orion I noticed a bright white light just below and to the left (from my perspective) of Orion. At first I thought that it was that bright star in the Constelation next to Orion, but then realized that it was something else, perhaps a planet! I then noticed that it began to move to the Southeast at a very slow rate of speed. I estimate it to have been between 2000 to 3000 feet in altitude and about one to two miles away. It made no sound and as it moved away I moved to the side door and opened it standing on the deck to watch it continue to drift away from the house. While outside I confirmed my own opinion that there was no motorcraft sound at all. The temperature at the time was noted by me to be 32.2 degrees. I do not know how it got to be where it was when I first noticed it without my have having seen it, as the area in my view of  the Southwest sky is not obstructed by any trees and I did not see it move through that portion of the sky as it would have had to do in order to get to the point at which I first sighted it. My conclusion is that it (1) had been at that point motionless for a period of time before I started looking at that sky or (2) suddenly appeared out of thin air! This is not the first time that I have seen such a light in this part of the sky going in the same direction and at about the same slow drifting like speed. About 8 minutes latter a small aircraft which I believe was a Cessna flew over near the same area in the opposite direction. Certainly the pilot of that aircraft had to see this light. I would be interested to know if that pilot reported any unusual airtraffic at that time of the day.

I turned around very quickley to see a very bright white/blue object of great size traveling at a speed that my son and I agreed would see the object fall to earth very soon ( in fact I kept looking to see a mushroom cloud rise above the hills to our west) there was no cloud nor any sound at all.

The object was bright enough to light the lake and the hills around us, it&apos;s colors were like a cutting tourch used for cutting steel (in fact the trailing sparks were brighter than steel being cut by a cutting tourch, the sparks trailed the object by about three times its size. The size of the object was hard to figure, but with the skyline of the city &amp; lights to guage, the object was huge, I would say more that a a mile or two across or cubed.  It was approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the south horizon, and was not traveling at the speed of a metorite, it was as a slower astroid would travel. the direction was east to west, in fact I was thinking to myself that california would now have another disaster to bare. there was no sound or vibrations, there was no blinking lights, there was only white, blue and some orange hues in the short tail, the object only went in a straight line, no turns, but almost a failing arc to the west (thus, our thinking that it would fall in west Arizona or eastern California.

While staring up, we also saw three contrails (not sure they were actually contrails, but that is what they looked like) that formed a PERFECT triangular shape - even stranger, the contrails appeared to be sparkling as though they were electrically charged.  There were light clouds in the sky that formed an almost perfect circle around the perimeter of the sparkling triangle, and they were distorted as though heat waves were emanating through them. The size of this circle was about 3 or 4 city blocks. At this point, I became very frightened and ran downstairs to call the UFO hotline. I went back upstairs about 20 minutes later and the sparkling contrails were still there and still shaped like a perfect triangle, but the clouds were gone.

We thought it might be Venus because it looked like it might be in a crescent, but decided that it wasn&apos;t.  We then realized that the light was starting brighter on the right and then dimming towards the left -- like it was sliding repeatedly in that direction or like a lighthouse beacon rotating.  It didn&apos;t appear to be moving otherwise, unless it was coming very slowly towards us.  I tried to grab the binoculars, but got our inferior pair and the vibration of the car made it too hard to see well.  When I took the binoculars away from my eyes, I saw there were now 2 objects.  I asked my husband where that other white spot had come from and he didn&apos;t know, but it looked like it had split off of the first.  That second light DID move and it stayed around the first.  As I recall, it came from the right and swerved around in front and down.  And then suddenly they were both gone!  We think it lasted all of 5 to 8 minutes. A little later on, further south and a bit higher (I can&apos;t recall the time or place -- Wyoming, near Cheyenne?).  I think it wasn&apos;t too long after the first two lights disappeared.

Then after another second or so, it went off again and disappeared. It&apos;s a pretty clear night so I don&apos;t know where it could have gone. The strangest thing about it was the movement and the speed at which it seemed to have traveled. I would have dismissed it as a helicopter if it weren&apos;t for these two factors. My wife is convinced it&apos;s a UFO, but I&apos;m wondering if there is another explanation. I&apos;d appreciate an e-mail with any information regarding this &apos;sighting&apos;.

I didn&apos;t recognize the sound but as it moved slowly closer the vibrations became more intense and louder.  Whatever was making the low rumbling was up in the sky above my house. There were no lights that I could see, and the speed of the ufo seemed to be very slow.  I often hear hellicopters and airplanes fly over, but this noise was like no other I have ever heard.  After it passed over my house, causing local dogs to bark, i stood and listened to it creep out to the east.  And about 5 minutes after it passed over me i could still hear and feel the vibrations. But never once did i see any lights.  The whole duration of sound lasted about 15 minutes until it flew over the mountians.((NUFORC Note:  We find this to be a very interesting report, primarily since we have received many such reports from northern California.  It occurs to us that the U. S. military may be flying some type of aircraft that produces a loud rumbling noise, which is detectable at ground level, even when the aircraft is at high altitude.

I happened to glance upward:  at the top center of the windshield, just above the steering wheel, in the western sky, fell a star-like object, in a zig-zag, almost floating fashion, slightly  toward the north.  It was slightly dimmer than what Venus has been recently;  at first I thought it was a meteor - but it seemed more &quot;lightweight&quot;, as an ash or cinder would have fallen.  It was silvery-whitish-blue in color, and didn&apos;t change in color, a bit sparkly, but more like a planet than a star.  If it were to break into the atmosphere and &quot;land&quot;, it would have fallen a few miles beyond west Seattle, into Puget Sound - not as far in distance  as the Pacific Ocean.  If this thing had behaved like a normal meteor, I would never have phoned the UFO Center...I even looked up information, hoping a meteor shower was in progress...but I understand the Taurid meteor showers are not expected until close to 11/09/00.  If an investigator were to call, all I could do in addition to this report would be to trace the object&apos;s pattern from the top of the windshield to its descending northern position as it went beyond the shrubery at the top of the driveway.  Wish I could be of more assistance.  I only hope other callers have reported to you from better vantage points.((NUFORC Note:  Correct time is after midnight, not during midday.

The first thing I noticed was that it was moving fast and smoothly. I thought UFO? Then I thought  no, Airforce jet. Then I realized it was moving too fast,  and had an odd floating sense about it. I continued to watch and it wavered a litle twice which tipped me off that wasn&apos;t a conventional craft.  It started at about twenty degrees off the horizon and kept coming towards me and slightly curving. It started out about the size of a big star and was the size of high altitude aircraft light. It was either very high and moving VERY fast, or very low and EXTREMELY small. There was absolutely no noise,  It was just after dawn and the full moon was low to the W. Northwest so there was plenty of light to see if there any conventional stucture. There was none.  The light was white and there were no other colored lights to indicate any kind of coventional craft.   It continued to move overhead and to the Northeast until it was out of site. The whole thing too k 3-4 minutes and it moved faster than any plane at a high altitude, even the airforce jets of which I am familiar with.

I tried to report one to you several years ago but was followed by what I realized was a man in black, and had someone come into my back yard one night! and was just a couple of feet from my open screened window.

When I first saw the object I thought it was a blimp completely illuminated in the distance.  As I drove towards the end of my street, the object became much more clear and the shape became much more defined.  I believe that the object was moving towards my development as I was driving towards the object. The object was a perfect rectangle tilted approximately 20-30 degrees (long axis horizontal).  The object was completely illuminated to the point where all I could see was a white light in the shape of a rectangle.  If I had to guess at a distance I&apos;d say the object was between 1000&apos; and 2500&apos; away from me.  It lit up the sky like a full moon does on a dark night (it was still pitch black outside). I turned onto another street and continued driving while looking out the window at the object.  It was moving parallel to the street I was on and about the same speed (45 mph).  For a split second my line of sight was blocked by some trees.  When I could see again, the object was much farther away (several miles) and all I could see was a very small illuminated rectangle.  I am 30 years old with a wife and two children.

I told my friend, &quot;Look at that bright satellite!&quot;, which was ridiculous because it was way too bright to be a satellite.  It looked to be extremely high, and was moving at about the same speed of a satellite, faster than any jet could go.  It was lit up with an extremely bright white light.  Upon looking at it closely, it appeared to be a triangular shaped craft with the white light around it&apos;s borders.  It was going from the northwest to the southeast above Salt Lake county.  It started going behind a tree...I told my friend I was going to get up to check it out before it went behind the Wasatch Range (mountains), but before I could even get out of my seat, it took off at a rate of speed so fast that it basically vanished before my eyes, and I made sure I didn&apos;t take my eyes off of it.

I met a potential client in Colorado Springs, CO and then left there around 6:30-7 pm. I arrived in Raton and stopped at the McDonalds and called my family in Andrews at around 9 pm mnt/10 pm central. From Raton, I headed Southeast on 64/87 and went through Clayton and Dalhart. Once 87 turned into 385, at around Channing or Vega, I started seeing what I thought were peculiar lights moving down the fields I was driving past. The lights I saw would go one at a time at approx the same height along the stationary &quot;normal&quot; lights at that were in place in the field. I watched this as I was driving for about half an hour or so. At approx 1 am mnt/2 am central on September 1, 2000, I stopped my car on the RH side of the road to watch a light I&rsquo;d seen out of the rear mirror of my car that appeared to be moving inwards in the field. I turned off my engine &amp; watched the light move across towards the road and then &quot;hover&quot; out in the field for a few seconds. It was the same color as all the others I&rsquo;d seen - a white light (same as starts you see in the sky or headlights from most cars). All of a sudden, this light &quot;whipped&quot; around to stop approx 15-30 feet behind my car a little to the left above the road. I could very easily see it out of my window. Immediately upon stopping it &quot;opened up&quot; or changed form (there were no &quot;doors&quot;) and I was able to see much more than a &quot;blob&quot; of light. This inside was defined by shades of light - golden hues. I could see 2 distinct cylindrical shapes coming from this part of the object. They were more horizontal than my drawing shows (they were not pointing down at the earth, but outwards towards me). There were &quot;bands&quot; that were coming from the cylindrical shapes towards the center. I saw nothing resembling anything I&rsquo;d ever seen on earth or even on TV. Nothing appeared shiny or metallic. This object made no noise at all. I looked at this object for seconds at the most and then turned in my seat and started my car and began driving away as quickly as I could. I said the words out loud &quot;no I don&rsquo;t want to go.&quot; The object did not follow me and I don&rsquo;t know where it went. I did not see it in my rear view mirror when I looked back. I did, however, as I continued driving see the lights out in the fields that were traveling down the stationary lights in the field. I stopped again to watch one that was at it&rsquo;s &quot;end&quot; of its &quot;route&quot; and tried to communicate with it as it &quot;hovered&quot; out in the field. I felt no response to my questions. When it started moving inwards again like the other light, I drove away. The next night, at a hotel where I was staying with my sister in Andrews, TX, I awoke in the middle of the night to my body jerking (much like when you fall asleep) and the bed shaking from side to side underneath me. This has never happened to me before. My sister was not disturbed, nor was my dog in her cage near my bed. I felt an &quot;energy&quot; moving over my body and saw a tiny light &quot;dancing&quot; over the room that I could not explain. I felt parts of my body tingle throughout this process and at one time felt a &quot;pressure&quot; on the left side of my brain. I was able to move, however, I chose to stay still for several minutes since I was not uncomfortable during this experience. Then I got up and went outside and saw nothing out of the ordinary. I went back to sleep and then woke up and felt my bed shaking underneath my body at least 2 more times that night. I was extremely tired and so I immediately went back to sleep each time. I have no unusual marks on my body from this experience. I have noticed a different mental &quot;awareness&quot; since the incident and I am remembering all of my dreams so far each night since the event, which is not usual and has not happened to me since childhood. I have felt anxious since the event, however, this I feel is due to my own imagination and choosing to listen to stories my friends have told me they heard or read about abductions. I am choosing not to do the hypnosis, since having listened to some friends who are familiar with the hynotic process, I feel there is a tendency for suggestions to the mind that did not actually occur. I have absolutely no reason to think I was abducted (I have accounted for all time that night) and that whatever beings might have been in that object meant me any harm. I know what I saw was nothing I can describe based upon my experience or TV. I believe whatever technology could create such an object would be able to do whatever they wished to us and so logically to me this means they must be here in peace and even possibly to help us. I am 32 years old and have been a professional in the advertising industry for 10 years. I have traveled quite a bit to several countries and lived overseas in Switzerland during high school. I have never seen anything resembling a UFO before. I have never had hallucinations before. I have not been interested in UFOs prior to this event. In fact, although I believed that there were very likely more evolved beings in the universe, I did not actually think they were showing up here in the numbers people were claiming.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length over the telephone and found her report to be quite sincere and convincing.

I was half way down the block, and I saw a round fireball appear just out of nowhere in the skyline. It was greenish- blue and had a &quot;tail&quot;. It scared me because it was much bigger than any shooting star I&apos;ve seen. My gut feeling was that if this thing hit,it would cause some damage. It appeared to have just burned out in the sky.

I sat right in front of the church, police yard and high school a bit off a ways, when I was so amazed that something had just flew right in front of me at a super high speed rate, it was so close that it almost felt like a bomb or something but just a radiating light that was fast and quiet.  I was with an ex-boyfriend at that moment and we both couldn&apos;t grasp even that it might been out of this world experience and just pretty crazy that we were actually together instead of being alone when it happened.

Sky was mixture of clear and very high clouds. The light was very noticeable and began to move from southwest to southeast at a very slow pace. Appeared to be very high, perhaps 10,000ft. Slowly dropped down to about 2,000ft, remaining extremely bright intense white light, then dimming to a tiny pin point of light, then getting extremely bright again. I got into my car and drove to a friends&apos; house approximately 6 miles southeast of my location, hurried in to tell her to come out and see it. When we went out, there it was, with 5 other ones, that were drifting down and hovering over the tree lined hills to our immediate south. We watched them move down under the tree light and observed them disappear and appear quite some distance away to the southwest. No sound, except that of a commercial jetliner heading northeast over us. We went in because it was getting too cold and windy outside. When I was driving up to her place, my radio was picking up a lot of static which is unusual.((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain what the witness observed, but we do observe that the report is not inconsistent with a &quot;twinkling&quot; star.

Whilst on holiday in Hannover last month visiting a penpal and also to see EXPO 2000, after a tiring day I went to bed on Monday 28th August.  At about 1.30 am I was suddenly awoken by a bright white light that only lasted a second, rather like the flash of lightening.  I lay in bed listening for the thunder to follow but this did not happen.  Within a minute there was another flash of white followed closely by a third.  Now I could have been dreaming the first but I was wide awake by now so the second and third were not my imagination. Wanting to visit the bathroom at this point I went through to the en-suite bathroom which has a skylight and looking through the glass I saw that the stars were out and there was some cloud also.  In the distance quite high up I saw 4 circular shapes and as I looked they all moved together into the centre to form one circle of light, then moved out to become four again.  This happened repeatedly.  I thought that perhaps there was a reflection on the glass of the skylight so I opened it to look directly at the sky but the circular shapes were still there and doing the same thing.  Moving into the centre, becoming one shape then moving out again to become four.  The lights were not bright and glaring but more a dull &quot;white&quot;.  I stood and watched this for maybe 15 minutes then went to bed. Next morning I questioned my friends to ask if they had seen the white flashes but they had not.  We then checked to see if any reports had come through on the radio or later in the newspapers, again nothing had been reported.  In an effort to explain logically what I had seen we wondered if the lights had come from EXPO ie maybe laser lights but EXPO does not run that late into the morning and the distance was too far away.  There is a radio mast not far away which is lit up at night and I wondered if this had somehow caused the lights but the size of the lights made this explanation unlikely. Regarding the television programme the other evening about UFO&apos;s, there was extensive coverage on the different sightings over the years including video footage of what people had seen.  The commentator then said &quot;In Germany there has frequently been reported that circular shapes have been seen&quot; and they showed examples identical to what I have just described.Over to you?

At about twilight my husband noticed a bright light in the southern sky.  To my naked eye it looked like a large, bright star.  When observed through binoculars, I saw three lights arranged in an inverted triangle.  The bottom light appeared more red than the two at top, initially, which looked more yellowish in color.  It appeared stationary to me at this point.  We went outside (had been on our enclosed patio) and saw two neighbors, to whom we gave the binoculars to observe the lights.  One (occupation unknown) noted that the lights were moving.  I looked again, and noted that through the binoculars small darting movements could be observed, although the lights remained in the same relationship to each other and in the same general location.  As we watched, the lights became more reddish in color, and gradually became smaller and smaller, until they were no longer observable.  Neither my husband nor I have ever seen anything like this before and aren&apos;t sure what to make of it.  We saw a plane in the general area.((NUFORC Note:  The report is somewhat reminiscent of the red lights that have been reported over Arizona, Illinois, and several other states since February of this year.  Generally, when a stationary light at night is reported to us, we attempt first to eliminate the possibility that is is a &quot;twinkling&quot; star, planet, or other celestial body.

We had a clear view south and I noticed a couple of planes on the horizon along with some else to the south east that I guessed was a plane also.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend and we both kept an eye on it while I continued to drive.  Clearly it was not a plane and now took a crved C shape while it floated around.  Now I thought it was a parachute and I looked for a man attached under it.  But there was no man and the object did not drop down, instead it continued to float and contort.  I pulled over around La Brea and Santa Monica blvd and we watched.  The object was silver in color and now straightened out, then bunched up, then formed a V and continued turning over.  The whole process resembled an earth worm contorting around in the sky.  About this time I noticed a small white sphere under the larger object.  In the air around the sphere there seemed to be some sort of disturbance.  Giving the appearance of an &quot;exhuast,&quot; if you will.

It was late and already completely dark. It was in a street with very few streetlights, a lot of trees and almost no houses, so there wasn&apos;t a lot of light pollution. At a certain moment we all looked up at the same time and saw a big black object obscuring the stars in the sky not very high above us. It is difficult to tell the height, but it was maybe 300 feet or so. It moved very slowly over us and was covered by lights of all colors, which strangely enough didn&apos;t illuminate the object. The object was too low and too slow to be able to be a plane or helicopter. We heard no sound.((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1980 is approximate.

It seemed very low and had no FAA required strobes,and was silent. I&apos;ve never given much thought to seeing a UFO but here was one, Ive lived near airports all my life and can tell most aircraft just from their light pattern. It took about 3 seconds to realize this was nothing Ive seen before. It passed directly overhead slowly then faded into the light pollution to the west. I was freaked out about it, and as I stood there a brilliant light shot back in the opposite direction that the triangle had come from at a teriffic speed. Five seconds later a commercial airliner from Love Field came into view, headed east. It must have been seen by the 737, but I dont know if they reported it. I haven&apos;t till now. I keep up with aircraft developments and this didn&apos;t fit the bill. It doesn&apos;t even make bad sense to make a secret test flight the wrong way down one of the most crowded outbound flight paths in the US. Needless to say, I look up a lot since then.", "These objects appeared to be meteorites of a very large magnitude.In the western sky, traveling from south to north, a fireball appeared.  At first it appeared to be a jet on fire.  The object appeared to be fragmenting.  It left trails of smoke, similar to jet vapor in the sky, easily marking the trail of travel. bright yellow balls with blue and green tails moved slowly across the sky. It was near sunset, but not dark yet.  The objects were visible only until they reached the edge of an approaching cold front, producing strong thunderstorms. As they passed behind the veil of clouds, several glows were visible until the objects reached the horizon.  This was very visible to hundreds of football fans, as we were at a football game with a very open view to the sky.

We had spent a afternoon of fishing and were enjoying seeing the stars as we were away from the light pollution of the cities, We were concerned about the fire in the Ochoco National Forest and were aware of theairplanes that were flying and we also were seeing shooting stars. But to the North of us about half way up from the horizon we could see this very large light which was stationery when we first noticed it , however there where airplane lights flying towards it several maybe as many as three or four. All of a sudden the large light very quickly moved up and down in a vertical line, severnal times, very rapidly, then it moved side ways in a horizonal movement, then it went in a circle, a very tight small circle and then just took off at a amazing rate of speed to the northwest and disapeared there was no way the planes could even begin to follow.

At one point a Southwest Airlines jet looked like it was going to hit the sphere. The event lasted about 30 min. I took pictures and called the Houston Police Dept and was told it was a weather ballon. It moved from very fast, to slow, to still. It seemed to continue to move to the north until out of site. I also looked at it with 60x28Mc field glasses. It was round 3d and very shiny or spinning possibly. It moved very smoothly, not in a jerking fashion.

Initially I just stared due to the conspicuous nature of the craft,  it had such large luminous lights  running along the underside . There were five lights and they were round.  I have seen  many objects in the sky but never anything I could not identify as a planet, rocket test, etc. The experience was somewhat surreal  as it was very unexpected.

I was experimenting with recording the image to video tape.  I have captured many meteors and satellites and airplanes. At 20:18 I noticed what looked like a slow moving meteor.  As it travelled across the monitor it made two abrupt ~15 degree turns. I did catch it on the video tape, so if you would like a copy, I will send it. After thinking about it for a day, I was pretty sure that it must have been a slow meteor that changed course because of its shape, but the following night I had another siting.

Its speed seemed normal but, it flew a little low and close to my house. This wasn&apos;t a normal flight path. It slowed down, almost hovered for about one minute, at about 100 to 200 yards from my home, over a woodened area. Its strobing light was at the tip of a short appendage, which was off to one side of the craft. As the craft moved, slowly, this strobing light moved, clock-wise, around, towards the right side of the craft. Some of the strobe&apos;s light illuminated the craft&apos;s body, during the flashes which, revealed its very, dull, graphite-colored surface and oblong, rounded, disk-like shape. It had no protruding wings. I saw no other lights on it, other than, a few small areas of very unusual, dim, multi-colored lights, along the sides of its body.  There was a slight rotation of the craft, as it hovered, before, moving west, at moderate speed. As it departed, its strobe was, now, on its right side and no longer at the front of the moving craft.I heard no sound from this craft. For about ten minutes, about ten smaller crafts flew by, one by one, following it.

We were traveling South from Ames Avenue on 60th Street when we noticed a set of lights proceeding North / North - West, fairly low in the sky. At first, we didn&apos;t think anything of this, as we live near a major airport, and this would not be an unusual approach for an aircraft heading for a landing. As it got close, however, my daughter said that it seemed odd that there were no strobe or red / green lights typically seen on planes that go by. All this one had was a series of white lights, of equal amplitude, that seemed to be spaced out all along and around the edges of the object. Even though she had a migraine, this was so strange that she asked me to turn off the road we were on and West, just so we might catch a better look at the object as it passed overhead. We did this, quickly, and were almost directly underneath the object as it moved on its North / North-West path. There were no airplane engine sounds, and more important, we could not see any fuselage. The object was triangular in shape, and there were lights along the edges and at the corners. We watched as it moved out of sight...never making the &apos;turn&apos; to the East that one would normally expect an airplane heading for Omaha&apos;s airport to make. We then went on to the Hospital.", "I saw a bright light in the sky (similar to Venus, but opposite Venus ),  then it dimmed to a tiny dot and dissappeared.I was driving East just as it was getting dark.  I noticed (what I believe are) Jupiter and Saturn in front of me.  Then I noticed a very bright light just to the right (South) of the planets.  It was about the brightness of Venus, but it was not Venus.  My first thought was that it was a plane but as I continued to watch it I noticed that it did not move or blink at all.  I commented to my daughters that it must, then, be a planet and I was amazed that either Mars or Mercury would be so bright.  As I was watching the light it dimmed to a tiny dot (without moving from it&apos;s position) and dissappeared.  There were virtually no clouds in the sky at this time.", "Bright light flashing low in sky after sunset; video later revealed a sound similar to submarine sonar.My girlfriend and I, after visiting friends on South Camano Island, were getting in our car to leave when we noticed a very bright starlike multi-colored light &quot;twinkling&quot; and flashing about 30 degrees above the southern horizon (the hill of Whidbey Island).  I assumed it was a normal aerial craft (plane, helicopter) - but it seemed too bright and the lights weren&apos;t flashing in a regular rhythm.  I grabbed my 8mm video camera (analog) and recorded 90 seconds before it disapeared completely. Optical zooming revealed that indeed this was not Venus, another planet nor a star. The pattern and colors of the flashing lights were also not like any aircraft.  Several times before - and also once while filming - it faded out completely (not from a cloud), only to instantly reappear.  I digitally zoomed (24x) and then one could really see the strange pattern of lights ebbing and flowing throughout the disc of light now resolved by the lens.  I yelled for my friend to go tell the people in the house to come out to see this, but it disappeared again, and after a long wait, never returned. I think this is definitely a UFO.  I know many people have captured video footage of strange lights.  However, what makes this footage unusual (as far as I know), is that - when we played it back -  THERE IS A SOUND THAT SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIGHT!  We did not hear anything when filming or observing it, and it seemed to be too far away (several miles?) to hear any sound, unless it was creating a loud sound like a normal aircraft. The sound is loud enough to easily hear after the light reappears; but after you have heard it and know what to listen for, you can hear it during the first part of the tape also.  It is not camera noise from the zoom or focus motors, and there was nothing in our environment that I can imagine could have caused it.  It repeats in a regular rhythm 6 or 8 times.  It is very similar to the sound you hear submarines make with sonar in the movies. I am going to digitize the tape and have the video - and especially the audio - digitally enhanced.  I&apos;m sure the audio signature can be compared with - for instance - a sonar sound to see if it matches it, or any other known source.", "Bright red light in the night sky.Sometime later separate fluorescent white light falls from the sky to the ground.I was sitting on my terrace when I saw a bright red light in the sky.At first I thought it was an aeroplane but I noticed that it didn&apos;t have any other color lights nor did it seem to move.I have no idea how high it was but judging  by the planes that were on their way to land at San Diego&apos;s airport my guess is a couple of thousand meters.I told my husband to come outside and look at the red light,he thought it might be a balloon(the flame that is) but it didn&apos;t look like fire to me.Then it just died down and I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.We went inside and about 20 min.later my husband said wow something just fell out of the sky...at first I thought he was pulling my leg, but he wasn&apos;t.He said he saw a huge white fluorescent light fall from the sky behind some trees that are on the adjacent property.I don&apos;t know if the two incidents are related or what the were? but I thought I&apos;d report them anyway.", "2 lights flashing in some sort of pattern moving rapidly across the sky making sharp turns((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness may mean a nightime sighting.

As we approached, this is what we saw: Three triangular shaped craft were sitting in a break in the trees.  Lights were pointing down off each point of the trianles and were pointing towards the ground.  The strange beings that piloted these ships were conferencing outside.  They were tall and had very thick hair that covered their body, and seemed to speak tonally.  As we approached they smelled the air and glared in our direction.

The stationary lights were the same color red and green as the things below them, but were flashing or pulsating.They looked identical to one another in size and were at the exact same height(there was about 75 ft distance inbetween these large lights).It was very difficult to see an exact shape, as it&apos;s very dark on the lake, and because of the brightness of the larger lights it was almost like looking at headlights on bright, where it&apos;s difficult to distinguish what&apos;s around the lights, but I thought I saw a rim of dark grey metal along the backside of the large lights.The metal appeared to have multiple slats along the edge, as though they were vents of some sort, and I got the impression that it was the outer edge of something, and that the 2 large lights were connected/part of this metal thing.The balls of light continued to travel in the same area directly below the stationary lights,never going above the big lights,nor any further than about 30 ft to the left or right of the big lights(I got the impression that they were shooting along the outside of some larger thing connected to the 2 large pulsating lights).Once I noticed the metal along the back edge,I became frightened,believing at that point that I was looking at something not of this earth.I distinctly remember thinking it was going to shoot down a ray of light to the ice, so I looked beneath it and could clearly see the ice below all of this.I would guess that I probably initially looked at all of this for approx 2 minutes, before seeing the metal part and moving away from the window.We also have! a large picture window overlooking the lake with the drapes wide open and a chandalier type light lighting up this room which was on.I pulled the plug on this light, as I would have had to walk in front of this window to turn off the light at the switch and didn&apos;t want to be seen by anyone/anything(As I was alone and stunned by what I was seeing,I didn&apos;t know what to do, and had no phone or believe me I would have dialed 911 at that point)!After I pulled the plug to turn off the light, I went to the picture window to close the drapes, and the view from this window prior to closing the drapes was the same as what I have described from the other window.I then went to the room furthest away from the lake,which is by our backdoor, as I wanted to be as far away from whatever was out there as I could be.I stood by the back door for I would guess about 10 minutes, before going back to peek out the patio door,and everything I had described earlier was gone.I never saw any of the lights leave and was deliberately not looking anywhere near those windows as I was afraid, I guess, of what else I might see.After I got over the shock of what I had seen, and was sure that whatever I had seen was gone, I looked more closely out over the lake, and saw a small triangle shape of light(red,green and white lights) all the way across the lake almost to the shoreline directly opposite ours.I have no idea what this was, nor if it was related to what I had seen earlier(although other than the colors being similiar it didn&apos;t seem to be related).However, there is no house over there and I have no idea what this could have been.I looked with a pair of binoculars and could clearly make out the lights, but it was very small, even with the binoculars.I didn&apos;t see this triangular thing move at all.I looked at it  periodically, and it remained there for several hours, as I recall it was still there at 2am and was gone when I looked again about 230am before going to bed.I should also note that we have a dog(3 yr old siberian huskey/yellow lab)w! ho alert s at any type of movement/noise around the cottage, and he did not move at all during this event.I also heard absolutely no noise,nor saw any blowing snow around the lights, which one would expect with any kind of hovering type craft like a helicopter.We had to leave the cottage early the next day to return to our home, and I have not talked with anyone else on the lake to see if they may have seen anything that night.If anyone else did see anything,I will certainly inform you of this.((NUFORC Note:  The following addendum was sent by the same witness 5 days later.

The underside had three very bright white lights equally spaced in the corners. In the center was a flashing red light (smaller). The right side had what appeared to be illuminated rectangular windows. there were two rows of either three or four on the horizontal. The rear of the object had three more very bright white lights in a linear line-up. THey were so intense that they gave off a prizmic effect. They also sort of pulsed which also gave a random moving effect. They seemed to be located behind some kind of a grid. Two other aspects were that it was very large, though my perspective was difficult having nothing to measure it against. It just appeared large. It was also very quite and gave off a magnetc sound.

It must have been 7:00 (sun was already up) when I noticed 2 objets south of us and parallel to the beach. They were flying in  military formation so I told my friend that this could be 2 helicopters flying towards us from south to north. About 5 minutes later I looked again and told my friend that they wey flying super slow at a low altitude( less than 3.000 feet compared to the hotels) And that&apos;s when I noticed that they weren&apos;t helicopters but grey and ovale objects. That&apos;s when I started to get excited and looked at my watch, it was 7:05 am. A few moments later I told my other friends who were in the Ocean but they said it was some birds and kept on playing in the water. My friend and I kept on sterring at the objets as they were getting closer. Let&apos;s say it took them almost 10 minutes to go from the southern tip of South Beach to approximatively 10th street. At the closest point we saw them they were still at the same altitude and we could almost see a pulse or a vibration from left to right and back and up. (Please excuse my English) We saw no strobe lights or id number. At that point my eyes started to be tired from sterring and I had to look somewhere else for a few seconds. Then 7:10, both objets caught up altitude  heading east toward the horizon and stopped in mid-air (I couldn&apos;t say how high) I was pretty hard to see them but I used a boat that was right below to find them when my eyes would loose them. That&apos;s when one of my friends said that he could see a third one at a higher altitude coming from the south. This third object stopped as well but at a higher altitude. They kept steady for 5 minutes. Then at 7:15, they disappeared in one snap, leaving no sound, no trail.

When I slowed down to look at it, it just flew very low to the ground without making any sound. It was flying right next to the highway light poles. Again, no sound. It then slowed down, hovering in the air and then it took off at a very high speed rate. The whole thing was brightly illuminated by a blue light.

His face was a light grey almost white, thick brow, menacing eyes and the thing that stays in my mind most was his stature or the way he was standing, his back arched, broad shoulders, his elbows poining towards his back, his head tilted down just a bit looking at the tops of peoples heads, scoping them out.....it was a normal day, people going about their business and there was this thing standing right in broad daylight?

I turned my head northward to watch an east-moving plane--I like to see the &quot;tail&quot; they leave behind.  I then saw a north traveling object; it was moving ever so gently, as if just glidding.  I was so shocked because I observed I was about to witness a mid-air collision.

I stopped her from talking further and told her to stop and let me tell her what I had seen.

That&apos;s when I saw my first ufo or rather I should say it saw me and I&apos;d like to add that I&apos;m not prone to hallucinations nor strong drink. I think my sighting is very unique in that I was pulled over by a ufo. Let me elaborate. I left my house to go to my dads one evening about dark. I didn&apos;t have far to go as he only lived about 5 miles from me. As I was about halfway there, I saw revolving blue lights in my rearview mirrow. As I was in the city limits of town, I thought naturally that it was the local police pulling me over for a traffic violation, so I pulled  over and stopped. I looked rearward and was shocked to find no one there. No police car, nothing. I then looked to my immediate right and saw an immense object just sitting there over a citrus grove. I had the distinct impression that it was observing me and I felt like they wanted me to see it. To say that I was apprehensive is a bit of an understatment. Yet, I was fascinated. It was an absolutely beautiful craft. It was huge. (I estimated it to about 50 to 75 yards in diameter.) It was well enveloped in light which didn&apos;t seem to radiate outward much if at all.  It appeared to be made of a metal similiar to aluminum.(bright and shiny) There was absolutely no sound whatever. Having read of numerous abductions as I&apos;ve always had an interest in the ufo enigma, I felt that my best recourse would be to leave. (I was scared stiff) After I left, I looked back and it was gone. I don&apos;t know why, but for a long time after that, I couldn&apos;t seem to tell anyone about it. Like it wasn&apos;t important or something. I didn&apos;t have any missing time so I&apos;m quite sure that I wasn&apos;t abducted. Another strange thing about this is that the ufo or whatever it was didn&apos;t arrive and leave in the conventional matter. It just appeared and then dissapeared. Poof, gone.

I noticed a bright white light that seemed to float a little bit off the ocean almost to the horizon.  it became brighter then it moved like nothing I&apos;ve seen before from the left to the right.

I yelled to my wife, &quot;I just saw a UFO&quot; i said.  then I pointed it out to her just before it went over the horizon, she saw it too.  I noticed it was pright enough to shimmer off the waves giving a better representation of its distance.

I lived on a hill, giving an excellent view of the river and the craft from about 1/4 mile away.  My friend and I had just returned from a coffee and pie outing at the local Perkins.  We walked around to the back of the house and entered through the sliding glass door.  The two children were in an almost hysterical state, shouting about the &quot;tornado&quot; which had passed over our house at a very low level.  I tried to calm them down, and told them to draw me a picture of what they had seen (in separate rooms).  They drew virtually identical pictures of an upside-down &quot;ice cream cone&quot;  with spinning marks and colored lights.  They estimated that it barely cleard the top of my 1-story rambler.  It continued to the river and either landed or hovered just above the opposite bank. (north of our house.  Evidently it had come from the south &amp; traveled north.  As we spoke, the kids pointed to where the object still was, on or near the river bank.  I saw only a red (sometimes light green) pulsating light on or near the river bank.  We watched it for 1 hour and 55 minutes exactly.  During this time, it kept getting brighter; then dimmer.  As it brightened, it seemed to become larger.  I watched it thru binoculars, but could not make out a shape behind the light.  My friend, the kids, and the 15 year old babysitter, watched and talked.  Toward the end of the sighting, it did some spectacular things; the babysitter had gone home, but my friend stayed and watched with us.  During the time we watched, we all tried to come up with some type of explanation for what it could be; we all concluded that it could not be human made; it was just too bizarre looking.  There was no road or path it could have taken to get where it was.  It was basically a swamp.  We went there the following day to see if it had left any evidence of itself; it had not.  We had to go on foot, climbing over fallen tree! s, etc. Anyway, just after 11:30, it suddenly turned an intense white, shot to the center of the river, and dispensed a laser-like dirty-white light onto the river. This lasted about 5 minutes or so.  Then it suddenly turned that intense white again and took off up to the top of the opposite river bank; a distance of approx. 1/4 mile.  So now it was a full 1/2 mile away.  It stopped above the only other house in the area; a new, large multi-level home.  The object shined a spotlight-type light that lit up the whole house and the yard; it looked like a helicopter search light, but much larger and brighter.  The house lights had previously been off, but when this light show happened, all the house lights came on.  I don&apos;t know if they actually saw this thing; and I haven&apos;t called them or discussed it with them.  The owner is the county court administrator, and currently the mayor of Cloquet.  I was just too embarrassed to ask a county official if he had seen the ufo.  I was also too embarrassed to make a report right away.  The next day I did call the local police to see if anyone else had made a report; none had.  After about 2-4 minutes of scoping out this new house, the ufo suddenly brightened and shot off over the top of the hill and out of sight.  I told the kids to go to bed; that they&apos;d never see anything like that during their lives.  I barely got out that statement when Zoom!! Back it came, shined its blinding whit light DIRECTLY AT US for several seconds before shooting off to the north and out of sight.

It&apos;s impossible!!  During the sighting, the kids flicked on the floodlights to see if it would respond. It did.  The kids turned the lights (6 of them) on and off three times.  The object responded by brightening three times.  I had the feeling it could hear what we were saying and thinking, because of the ways it seemed to r! espond t o us.

Within hours of a similar craft reported by police.I was smoking a cigarette outside a friends house in Dupo, IL at 11:35 pm. I normally look at the sky and watch planes in route to Parks air field and Lambert International Airport (These are usually much higher altitude).  While looking to the north I followed some lights I thought were a plane. Will I watched I noticed there was no beacon (I was able to see beacons on other planes flying in the sky).  The crafts lights were also much bigger than any I had ever seen on a plane, and in an unusual delta ( compared to the other high flying jets that night).  My distance from the craft was hard to judge, but I would say about 3/4 to 1 mile and about 500 to 750 in altitude. The craft appeared to be banking to the north toward downtown St. Louis on it&apos;s slow journey (the slowness also set this craft apart). It seemed to be as slow as a blimp but much more stable in its route (I had seen many blimps use Parks Airfield on other occassions).  I finished my cigarette and went back inside.  I did not mention this to anyone inside because I thought they would think I was crazy.  I went home about 15 minutes later to meet another friend and told him the story.

The bright areas were not right beside one another but had some distance between them. They were not real bright(soft lighting) but very noticeable and appeared to be forming the circumference of a circle ( quite a large diameter).

I apologize for being so vague on the specific date; it&apos;s been so long ago.  But the actual experience is still very vivid in my mind and something I will never forget.  To the best of my recollection it was 1977, but may have been 1978.  I do know it was approx. 2:30 in the morning, as I had left my boyfriend&apos;s house in Downey and was traveling northbound on the 605 freeway heading for the 210 freeway.  I was not under the influence of any substance.  As I was traveling northbound on the 605, just past Rose Hills Memorial Park, I saw something ahead of me hovering over the freeway.  Being very familiar with that area, I knew the incredibly large object I was approaching did not belong there - had never been there before.  That particular part of the freeway was very desolate - nothing in the way of commercial buildings, etc.  Just a duck farm to the west and Rose Hills to the southeast.It was within close proximity to the 60 freeway as well.  I recall virtually no other traffic at that time as I neared the object.  It was hovering, completely still, maybe about 500 feet above the freeway.  I slowed as I approaced it, looking at it in disbelief.  When I was under it, I came to a complete stop on the freeway and just stared in amazement.  It was incredibly huge - like something from Battlestar Gallactica.  It wasn&apos;t shiny, but was metallick with circular indents - like pores - about it.  It was a very peculiar shape-nothing you could describe as a definate rectangle, circle, etc.  It has many configurations.  But the size just overwhelmed me.  I remember not feeling frightened, but just astounded.  I sat there for awhile just staring at this thing, oblivious to my surroundings or the fact that I was sitting still on the freeway.  I couldn&apos;t tell you if another car came along or not.  As I slowly began to p! ul away, I kept my eye on it, continually looking back, and then it was gone.  I&apos;ve always wondered if someone else may have reported a similar experience, or if there was documentation of unusual activity in that vicinity in &apos;77 or &apos;78.  It has disturbed me for more than 20 years (I am now  45), and I was hoping someone could substantiate it for me.  Thank you for allowing me to share this with you.

I was on a traffic stop at the time and was stationary, when I looked into the north east sky and saw very clearly, 4 orange, bright lights that formed a diamond or box shape.  The lights were constant, not flickering, and were drifting to the east. The lights then drifted together as a unit either behind a cloud or they just went out because it appeared as though they kind of fizzled out like a flare going out or as if they were going behind cloud cover.  Immediately after this event, I scanned the sky looking for additonal objects and noticed a cluster of 9 additional lights that again, were moving in a pack but these lights were moving independant of each other and creating different geometric shapes.  I had a pair of field glasses in my squad and viewed the lights. I was unable to see any structure between the lights or anything hanging or connected to them.  Over the course of about 10-15 minutes, this cluster of lights which seemed to rotate and move about each other, drifted east in the sky never gaining or losing altitude and when it reached the same spot as the first cluster, the lights all one at a time seemed to &quot;burn out&quot;.

It was larger than any conventional aircraft that I know of, including the huge military personel and equipment carrier planes that occassionally are seen flying from the vicinity of Vandenberg Airforce Base (Lompoc, California = approximately 35-45 miles from the Los Padres Forest witness site). 2.  It was &quot;boomerang&quot; or chevron shaped, much the same as pictures I have seen of stealth bombers.  I could roughly make out its shape because of the time of day in which it was seen.  The event took place during dusk/sunset.  I watched it fly and then bank near the summit of the Santa Barbara side of Hwy. 154.  I watched it on this side of the mountain for approximately 30-40 seconds. 3.  I have never seen anything, other than a rare helicopter, fly so close to the summit/mountain top.  The craft was witnessed by us to be heading over the summit of the 154 pass, towards the Santa Ynez Valley.  It was approximately 200-300 feet from the summit/mountain top.  This placed it very close to the cleft in the mountain pass when it banked to the right.  This banking maneuver struck me as unusual for something so large.  I brought this to the attention of my mother. 4.  It had 3 white lights at each point of its chevron shape.  This also struck me as unusual because I am under the awareness that all conventional aircraft must use red and green lights.  As the craft made the banking maneuver it &quot;turned on&quot; some red lights which seemed to &quot;pulse&quot; more than to blink.  These were only on a few seconds.  My mother witnessed these also.  Thereafter, on the Santa Ynez side of the mountains, at a distance of about 3+ miles, I witnessed the object for a short time  (approximately 20-30 more seconds) to be flying very close to the ridge tops of some neighboring foothills.  I pointed out to my mother that I thought that the object was SO large still, even though it was getting further away from us.  Its sheer size is and was a mystery to me.  When I viewed it after it had &quot;banked&quot; it no longer had any red lights on (only the aforementioned white).  Total sighting time (including Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez sides of the mountains) = 1+ minutes. FYI:  I am almost 30 years old, college educated and employed in the medical field.", "round, bright white light that changed into orangeI was on my porch, which faces west and I saw a really bright star looking object in the distance, however it was much brighter than any star.  It rapidly came closer and I could see that it was round with many thin pieces sticking out of the object.  Twice it stopped and changed directions, and then continued on the orginal path.  When it was almost directly overhead, it began to change into an orange color and then back to the white.  When it changed color it did so gradually, and started in the center, and then worked it&apos;s way to the thin pieces that were attached to the circle. The thin pieces then began to flash orange and white.  Even though it was very close, it was silent.", "3 balls of light seen at Kilkenny ireland.I was going to work in my home city of Kilkenny Ireland .I work in the Heborn park in Kilkenny I dropeded the person off at work as i locked up my car  trough my winscreen i saw 3 yellow to white glowing....balls of light hovering up and down in the field behind where i work .", "((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was at my dads brothers weding reseption some place out in the country. I had not been drinking :) i was too young for that. any way i vidly remember being outside with sombody and seeing a shooting star. the person i was with says to me &quot; that means u are going to have good luck&quot; Not to long after i went out back of the wedding reseption to the large outside garden that lead onto the country side. i remember how fresh the air was and how clear the night sky was. i remember that the garden was softly lit by a flood light witch was no good as the garden was to large to be fully illuminated by it alone. i recall the calm fealing and stillness of that night. I remember walking over to the far fence away from where the wedding reception building was and behind the pond area that was surounded by furn trees. i looked at the sky abouv the towering fence then saw a second shooting star. seconds later i remember a silent &quot;ship&quot; flying down and hovering abouv my hed. the ship slowly tilts forward and i see a pain of wraparound sunglases for windows. well they looked like windows all tinted out and black. it felt  like i was beeing watched, looked at through them. the &quot;ship&quot; hovered silently abouve me for a fiew seconds then it tilted its front end back up while roling over to my left so tat it was facing the other way and it shot off as fast as it arrived. ship details. i include a rough 10 second sketch to show you what i belive to have seen. the metal or material that the ship was made off was a greeny grey colour more grey i think. it also looked to be made from panal sections. the windows where like a shiny black colour not tto diferent to a shiny plastik, well sort of inbetween plastick and shades or sunglasses. they was verry dark. also i recall lots of grood looking apendijes like areals on the object and some thing on the top of it... one thing i remember was the strange triangle shaped thing at the bottom of the ship. there was no light flashing no hazes no flames or anything. it looked like somthing that had been used, somthing that was weathered in.. not shiny and gleaming nothing like a saucer shape. i remember that. the shape was very long looking at the back i supose like a sauser but streatched out and it had overhanging rims to the lower part.. the most rememberable thing was the shades for windows... also i recal numbers or simbols on the fromt of the object... i dont know what but i remember syimbols... i think when it was hovering over me there was a strange low leval humm almost like wind sound. it might have been the wind. I also remember while looking at it that i was not upset or skered in any way. i felt pecfull. after this i ran in and told my mom i saw a plain. my mom confirms today that i was all exited and was pestering her and my dad to come out side and look at the plain.

We were camped at Lynx Lake, near Prescott Az; camped south of the lake in a wide spot about 50 yards south of the dam.  It was VERY cold. (The cold is my primary memory of this night). I had two teenagers, one preteen, one todler two adults and one tent. About 2300 I was trying to rearrainge the beding to provide some relief from the cold. Went to my pickup for a ground tarp. My ex-wife had abandoned the tent and was sleeping in the cab of the pickup with the engine running and the heater on. The kids were all with me in the tent. As I recall, the pickup engine stoped for several minutes; Tina woke up and nearly wore out the starter trying to get it going again. Vehicle was 1969 GMC 1/2 ton (with several dozen USMC sticker on it). I heard a sound that I initially thought sounded like a water fall. Looking up, I saw a large object that I initially thought was 4 military helicopters flying in a formation. I did not see any red or green lights, only white ones. I then noticed that the stars behind the paralagram formed by the four lighted helos were occulted.  The sound was not the typical (womp womp womp) made by military helos (I spent 2 years in the Marine Corps and 6 years in the Navy, I know what helos sound like.)  It sounded more like a waterfall, using a bass voice. The object(s) were traveling slowly west to east. Their speed was about the same as a flight of helo as seen from the ground. It is difficult to guess the altitude, however I have seen military helos overhead many times. The altifude of this object(s) was similar. The shape was not square, or prehaps square seen from an odd angle. Assuming a 3 to 2 ratio of the object, (3 lenght and 2 width) the northern leading light was 1.5 units farther east than the leading southern light. At the time I &quot;assumed&quot; that it was military aircraft with a net or something strung between them, but I remember the sound. It was not a normal helo sound.

It appeared to be disc or perfectly round in shape and was sharply defined. Not like the shimmering of a star. It was located between the rear view mirror and the top of the windshield. (See my graphic UFO_1st_sight.jpg)  It was at an angle of about 45-50 degrees above the horizon and about 10 degrees to the right of my westerly heading. It caught my attention because it was not the usuall red color I have seen on aircraft or helicopters (I live not far from the sheriff station and helicopters are based there and usually fly over my house. I am also familar with aircraft navigational lights). The color appeared as a bright crimson red and about the size of the largest star. However it DID NOT have a glow to it. There were no other lights visible such as associated navigational light nor was an object visible     which might have been seen from reflected light off the object. As I continued west I had to move up closer to the winshield and peer up as the object seemed to be moving in an easterly direction.(See graphic UFO_5-6secPlus.jpg).  When it was about overhead it dissappeared. However the way it dissappeared was unusal. It DID NOT JUST BLINK OUT but appeared to move up and away so fast the it was like a dissappearing cone. (See graphic UFO_15-20secPlus.jpg). I stopped in a dark parking lot to see if there were any further traces of it but observed none. I have tried to create an animated graphic of the final observation but have been unable to do so yet.  I have not been able to get the right color that the object appeared.((NUFORC Note:  We will post illustration at a future date.  PD))", "A huge, sharp &apos;V&apos; formation of apprximately 25 to 30 round white disks flies slowly over a suburban areaAs I was walking out to my car at an apartment complex parking lot, my attention was drawn to a clear night sky full of stars. Standing by my car I looked directly above me as something caught my eye. A gigantic &quot;something&quot; was moving very slowly ( a person on a bicycle could have kept pace with it, or the traffic on nearby I-90 was moving at three times the speed)), heading due west toward the city of Spokane (my location was east of the city by approximately 10 miles in what is known as the Spokane valley). This is the best way to describe the object: take a very sharp, narrow &quot; V &apos;, lay it on its side so the apex points westward...and making up the &apos;V&apos; formation were about 25 to 30 perfectly round, whitish disks. The disks were not bright but appeared as any white object would, in the sky at night, reflecting the glow of Interstate 90 and a busy shopping area. It is difficult for me to judge distance according to feet, but if you held your arms above your head and spread them a yard (36&quot;)apart, that was the length of the &apos;V&apos;. As I observed the object at a distance of about 1/4 of a mile away, about 15 minutes later (described below)it appeared to be as high up as a 30 to 50 story building. There was absolutely never any noise, the object was moving much slower than, say, cars on nearby I-90, there were no lights observed at anytime. The craft was paralelling I-90 with apparently no need to let other flying objects (airplanes---there is a small airport nearby, not the Spokane International Airport) know it was there (flashing lights ect)?? I was, to say the least, dumb-struck, but remained still as I watched it slowly moving westward. At one point a man and his son walked to their vehicle across the parking lot, never looking up or noticing anything because there was no noise. I wish to this day I had spoken up and asked the man to look up. How can something that large move so slowly and not make any noise?? Anyway, the really strange aspect of the object was its BEHAVIOR. Several of the disks appear! ed to be slightly &apos;fluttering&apos;, as leaves on a Tamarac tree would flutter in a breeze. The other disks did not. As I continued watching, the &apos;fluttering&apos; of some os the disks suddenly stopped and the top string of disks began to lengthen as the bottom string began to get shorter. I stared at the apex of the &apos;V&apos; formation to see if I could observe each disk from the bottom string &quot;round the corner of the apex&quot;, so to speak, and that was what was so weird. Each disk from the bottom just grew less in number as the top string grew longer in number, but I couldn&apos;t actually see the disks moving to and around the apex. The top string of disks was just growing in length but at no time did any disks appear to disappear, nor did they appear to flash on or off. I hope this isn&apos;t confusing. I find it difficult to explain this. I remained standing by my car for several more minutes and before I left I was able to see the actual object, I&apos;d say, a good 1/4 of a mile away towards the west, as it was headed toward the city of Spokane. I was able to see the shape of the object because the city lights/sky glow from Spokane, further west and ahead of the object, provided contrast. What I saw shocked me. If you take two large plates and set one on top of the other so the rims meet, that&apos;s what I observed, but it was at least three times larger than the &apos;V&apos; formation (which was apparently attached under it?)The entire mass was solid black. One more thing, which I think is worth noting; I finally got in my car and returned some rental movies to a business about a mile away and went about my evening. I felt stunned and said nothing to anyone. Three days later I suddenly felt scared over MY behavior, as I could not understand why I didn&apos;t at least follow the object(which would have been so like me to do). I had never witnessed anything like this and why had I been so cavalier about the whole thing.... It was as if I suddenly &apos;woke up&apos; to the realization of what I had witnessed and my very unusual subdued reaction.

Then it struck me that the lights were rather bright and the dipper is not orange, besides this being the wrong time of the year for it. I watched the lights for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes trying to get some kind of clue to what the were. The lights were moving from west to east at a rather slow rate of speed so I didn&apos;t take them for aircraft. The sky was mostly cloudy and the lights occasionally moved through one of these cloud banks. I didn&apos;t hear any aircraft noises and the lights seemed to be moving rather aimlessly along their path anyway. I would have taken them for a group of hot air balloons except I don&apos;t think anyone would be crazy enough to take balloons that high at night in the middle of a January night. The lights were circling each other and changing formations rather aimlessly as they headed east. There were no aircraft in pursuit of these lights nor did any chase while I watched them.

It reminded me of the saucer from Lost in Space...the craft with very bright and colored lights went clockwise.

PD))truly bizarre &quot;anomolous satellite-like&quot; observation21:20 local time (evening) Tuesday 2nd Jan near Sydney, Australia. (ie, Roughly Monday morning in USA.) 50 miles north of Sydney. Conditions perfectly clear, warm, 70 deg F., dark country area.  Event happened roughly in Orion (roughly overhead at that time). I am an mildly experienced skywatcher, meteor-shower watcher, aircraft spotter and satellite watcher. I have a science degree major in phyics and math. I am 36 years old and own a programming company and was perfectly sober. At about 21:20 I noticed what looked exactly like a satellite moving through the sky, just as when you see a LEO satellite moving through the sky. Oddly it was moving on a North to South (approximately) track (perhaps 10 or 20 degrees west of North to 10-20 East of South, but not sure). Of course satellites generally move in east and west lines, not north and south lines. I thought to myself &quot;cool, that must be a polar satellite&quot;. The point of light looked exactly as it does when you happen to see a satellite moving overhead.  Similar magnitude. The speed was somewhat faster than the typical satellite. At one point there happened to be a conventional wide-body jet also overhead (on a normal track to Kingsford-Smith airport) for comparision; in short the object looked exactly like when you see a satellite (except it was wierdly going N-S). Amazingly enough the object deccelerated, and then STOPPED (!)  I watched it clearly do this and kept concentration on it the whole time.  I notied it&apos;s position relative to some stars (near the west-south &apos;foot&apos; of Orion).  Obviously I yelled in amazement, told my fiance etc. Then, maybe 10 or 15 seconds later I happened to see another identical &quot;satellite&quot;, which was moving on a parallel track, but coming from SOUTH TO NORTH.  The two tracks were maybe 1 or 1.5 degrees apart. Amazingly the first satellite (or whatever) then STARTED MOVING AGAIN, but this time NORTH, ie backwards, the way it had come from. IE, the first &quot;satellite&quot; started moving again (in the reverse direction) when the other one approached it (the first one staying about 1/2 a degree ahead of the second). Both then moved at the same speed and direction, in &quot;formation&quot;. Although &quot;unspectacular&quot; this was (of course) the strangest and most bizarre thing I have ever seen in my life. Satellites don&apos;t stop, pause for a few seconds, and then go the other direction.", "I was watching this oval object from my house on a full moon night and the sky was clear as it appeared to change to red and green.On this date a @ 21:00 hrs me and my father in law were taking the garbage down the drive and I noticed a bright round light approx 200 feet above the tree line.  I asked my father in law if he sees that light and he said no only the tower with red lights I told him to look left of that  and he then saw it and said he didn&apos;t know what it was and went home.  I went into my home and got my video camera and binoculars.  It was a full moon and everything was bright,  so I put my camera on low light setting and could not see anything with the camera.  I then got my binoculars and could clearly see a roundish bright object that had been hovering in the same place for approximately 25 min.  On occassion it had changed color from bright white to green to redish orange.  This whole time the object never moved.  I noticed movement  @ 2130 in a downward vertical movement until it got into the tree line, then it moved southeast in the tree line and I lost sight of it.  I went in and called the hempstead county S.O. and the miller county SO  and asked if anyone had reported a light over or around the town of Fulton, Arkansas.  they both said no.  I went to the door approx 10 min later and saw the light out again but it was now what appeared to be over the small town of Fulton or in that area.  I watched it with my binocs and watched an airplane vear off its flight path and fly towards the light. After the plane came near and made an upward left banking turn the object again changed colors and went into the tree line and started moving south southeast.  The airplane continued to circle the area for approx, 15 min and then flew toward the town of Texarkana, Arkansas.  There is a minimum sized regional airport there, and my house is in the flight path of may planes.  I live on top of a hill in a rural community and have seen planes turning with their landing and wing lights on, and in fact the plane tonight had his/hers on for a while, when circling over the tree tops in the approx area the light dissapeared.  The second sighting lasted only 10 min and I came back and and called both SO&apos;s again and made a report.  The Miller County SO had sent deputied that way but did not see anything.  I explained that the main reason I called back was seein the airplane circle and look for the light and flew back toward their airport.

My mother in law was in the car when he saw the light but I am not sure she observed the object. The object appeared only to move in verticle and horizontal directions.  It could change directions quickly.  Once during the second sighting the object appeared to zig zag for a couple of second while changing colors before moving south east and out of sight into the tree line. I am amazed that my video camera would not pick up the bright light on such a clear full moon night.((NUFORC Note:  The witness does not state explicitly what direction they were looking.

I lived a stone&apos;s throw from the Edgewood Arsenal in Edgewood, Maryland so I was familiar with their routine paratrooper drops and helicopter activity around that area.  It was a sunny, beautiful day with bright blue skies and cottonball-like, low cumulus clouds.  I was standing on my front porch about to run over to play with friends when a bright reflective-like flash caught my attention.  I looked (east?) over the railroad tracks and saw a chrome-colored ball just sitting in the air.  I would guesstimate that it was approximatly 500-750 feet above ground.  I remember freezing in complete silence as I immediately knew that I was observing something peculiar.  I would best describe it as a ball bearing that was highly reflective, probably 30 to 40 feet in diameter.  I remember standing as still as I possibly could, because even as a kid I must admit that I was intrigued by UFOs.  I remember thinking, &quot;oh my God, just be still and watch it and don&apos;t blink your eyes!!&quot; My parents were not home as my mother got back from work usually and hour after me, so I couldn&apos;t call for anyone.  I&apos;m sure that if someone else had been outside nearby I would have called for them to look at it with me, but strangely nobody was outside in earshot.  The object stayed completely still for approximately 30 seconds.  I remember thinking maybe it was a balloon or a Radiosonde, because I had found one of those in a nearby patch of woods years prior. I remember feeling almost paralyzed with an anxiety-like fear.  I knew I was seeing something I wasn&apos;t supposed to.  It&apos;s almost as if my body reacted to it also.  After remaining still, the object began to move laterally, from right to left.  It was almost like it was being pulled sideways on a string.  That made me even more scared because balloons usually drift up, ya know?  As it was moving to the left, it stopped,(like putting on the brakes)an! d slowly moved back to the right, and then I had this weird feeling that it knew I was watching it beacuse it changed direction again and disappeared behind a thick cloud.  I kept watching and the strangest thing happened.  I continued staring at the cloud in hopes of seeing it come out the other side, but it seemed to poke out barely from the right edge of the cloud, almost as if it were peeking to see if I was still there watching. I got the feeling that it knew I was there. (Weird!) I continued watching to see if it would come back out but it never did. The whole episode was probably less than a minute in duration. The object never moved up or down, just perfectly sideways. I never told my parents because they wouldn&apos;t have believed me anyway.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On my return home is when I witnessed something I can&apos;t clearly explain. I&apos;m not certain what it was I saw, and would love for you to respond to inform me what I saw was a series of meteorites burning up in the atmosprere or a formation of non-conventional aircraft. However, whatever it was, wasn&apos;t of the norm. I&apos;ve tried to dispell what I saw as not what it appeared to be, but I can&apos;t let it go. In summation, I hope the following will help to determine what I witnessed in the western skies of Oklahoma. I was traveling generally west into the setting sun on the Chickasaw Turnpike just on the outskirts of Ada, Oklahoma. It takes roughly 15 minutes to drive from begining to end of the before mentioned roadway. I was approximately two minutes into the first part of the turnpike when I noticed three strangely shaped objects suspended in the sky. My first thought was thin clouds reflecting the setting sun. Still driving and annalyzing these objects I noticed what appeared to be in a formation. One following the other. Maybe a quarter of a mile seperating one fron the other. Further, what was once three was now four. My next guess involved some type of aircraft. I pulled the car to the side of the highway to see wether or not the objects I was seeing were moving or not. After coming to a complete stop I exited my vehicle and stood on the side of the road. Whatever these things were, they were definately moving and moving quick. Like I said, I was travelling west. These objects were moving from the northwest going to the southeast. Driving an hour both ways to work everyday, a person sees a lot of planes flying on the horizon. These looked like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen. From my viewpoint, the two nearest objects were throwing what appeared to be flame hundreds of feet behind them. Also, they moved from a speck on the horizon to possibly a half-mile away to completely out of site within minutes. My last thoughts before the objects suddenly vanished from site, was they could be some type of meteorite or space debri plummeting to the Earth. This thought was a litle scary. I like to watch the Discovery Channel and have seen severel documentries showing what type of damage an object hitting the Earth can do. I attempted to find out some kind of news about just such a thing the rest of my journey home with no such luck. I then spent the weekend wondering if television would report some type of occurence. Once again the answer was no. I don&apos;t know what I saw. I&apos;m asking you. I&apos;m not some mental case who makes up things either. I have a steady career and a solid home life.

After the object blinked, it would move to a different place and blink again. We just stared in awe. We had never seen anything else like this before. This happened for about 15 seconds. Then it disappeared. We walked around the yard to see if it went anyplace else. We found no trace of it again that night.

It was the Summer of 1957 and I was at boy scout camp.  One evening we had a sleep out in an open field under the stars.  It was an extremely clear night.  I was laying on my back staring at the enormous number of stars.  The Milky Way seemed wider and clearer than I had ever seen it. I must have been lookin directly overhead for a number of minutes when I realized that one of the &quot;stars&quot; was moving! I was convinced it was an illusion, so I looked away and looked back again, and couldn&apos;t find the &quot;moving&quot; star right away, but after about 30 seconds, I saw it again.  It was just another white dot like all the other dots, only it was moving! It&apos;s impossible to say how much area it covered or how far away it was, but I&apos;d say that it seemed to be travelling in an area about that appeared to be about four inches by, maybe, 6 inches of the sky, from my perspective.  I guess this would mean that it was happening quite far away.  It moved very &quot;slowly&quot; in an up and down meandering sort of way as it weaved a path between the fixed stars.  I then turned over and went to sleep. I never said anything to the other scouts, probably because I was sure they would kid me.  but I have never forgotten this event.  In later years I mentioned it to some people and one person pointed out that it might have been sputnik(?), which I guess was around that time, though I wouldn&apos;t think it was visible to the naked eye.", "Silver disc hovering very highup in a specific triangular pattern.One silver disc or sphere.

For aprox. ten minutes it hovered in a triangle pattern. It was a very specific pattern directly overhead and was not drifting. I looked away for a moment then looked back and it was still there. After another minute or so I looked way and when I looked back a minute later it was gone . I was with my girlfriend at the time and my sister in law.

Maybe penlighs or those lights that can be used when camping where you break the glass tube inside the plastic tube.  I do not think it was anything from another world.

As I started to cross a wide tressle across the river I happened to look up and was suprised to see a grey/silver cylinder dead ahead at 60 degrees against the clear blue sky. The object appeared small. Its length was about 1/2 my thumb nail&apos;s width at arms length and it was about 1/2 as wide as it was long. It looked metallic but I could not discern any other distinguishing features. The sky was completely cloudless and I could see no other air traffic in the vicinity. I took about 5 careful steps while watching this stationary object which just seemed to dangle in the sky. As I was crossing a railroad tressle I was soon forced to look down to confirm my footing, and when I looked up the object was gone. I stood still looking for the object for at least a minute but saw no sign of it from horizon to horizon. As I was crossing the very wide Susquehanna there were no trees to occlude my view.

Sometime before 0402 hours today, have the feeling I was visited.  For the past five years (since 1995) while sleeping have dreamed that my house, a two story is tilting to the west and crashing into the street.  This morning, I awoke for some reason.  I lay awake and suddenly hear a low frequency buz or vibration and then hear noise, not sure what it was but almost at the same time sense I and my entire house tilting again to the west as one.  I said ... gee, my house is going to colapse on top of me.  I braced or tried to brace myself for this (thinking maybe an earthquake as the noise preceeding this reminded me of an earthquake when I lived in Japan) and expecting to hear furniture hitting each other as well as the west wall.  I mean the angle was about 45 degrees now.  However, I neither heard furniture slamming into anything and to my amazement, my ceiling fan was turning as normal and not at an angle.  That clued me into something weird.  All this time while I was trying to brace myself, but then I realized I was fully imobilized, could not move any limb or my head.  The only thing that would move were my eyes and they were open.  At this time, I forgot about the tilting effect when I looked to my right toward my skylight and see a beam of blue light that I sensed was searching and it found me.  To my left (west side) I also saw light coming from the window.  I realized somethign was not right, yet could not move let alone get up.  I now felt as if made semi unconcious yet fully awake and being examined in bed.  I looked around and could only make out a small dark figure to my left, above my head and to my right.  To my astonishment, directly in front and a little to the right of me about 10 ft away I saw what appeared to be a holograhic figure or what tried to be one, or perhaps that was the beam of light that found me.   I asked these thing what they wanted, but got no response and sensed they were intent on examining me.  I definately experienced fear! , yet no thing I could do.  Then suddenly it stopped, and they left at least it felt that way, and I look quickly at the clock and it was 0402 hours.

This occured at 5:58 pm, this Sunday.  I didn&apos;t drive, so I was passing the time looking at landmarks, lights, and stars in the sky.  As we were passing Benicia on hwy 680, I noticed, at my 1 o&apos;clock, what at first appeared to be a low-level aircraft passing to our right.  What caught my eye is that it didn&apos;t have standard lighting: I saw no red/green indicator lights, tail lights, forward lights.  My attention was drawn to a light or lights on what appeared to be the leading edge of the object, gold in color, and blinking in a random fashion.  I would almost describe this point-source as &quot;sparkling&quot;.  Within a few seconds of my initial sighting, this point-source grew in size.  At that point, the light would &quot;blink&quot; randomly, and as it did so, it would grow into a triangle whose longest sides pointed down.  The triangular light&apos;(s)  downward-facing vertex was approx. 4 times as tall as the shortest side.  All edges of the light were of the same sharpness and intensity.  As the light grew, it appeared to be composed on many smaller lights, and it continued to blink in an irregular fashion. Naturally, this caught my attention, since it didn&apos;t exhibit conventional aircraft lighting or other recognizable features.  I continued to watch as it appeared to angle away from the bearing of the highway.  It appeared to grow distant, and the shape of leading-edge light returned to a point source, which appeared to sparkle.  As I continued to watch, there was one point where this object was briefly illuminated, perhaps by city lights (it appeared to be reflected light)  It was at this point I could see a lighter outline in the night sky.  My first impression was the shape was similar to a blimp, except it was more elongated, and the &quot;ends&quot; of the shape weren&apos;t at all like a blimp (no stabilizers or canopies were visible).  The shape ended in squared-off points, and the edges leading to the more curved shape in the middle appeared jagged. Otherwise, the shape was roughly elliptical, with the long axis approx. 3 times longer than the short axis. The point-source was clearly on the front &quot;point&quot;, and the light appeared to change shape randomly.  I saw this object for about 30 seconds, from 30 to 15 degrees from the horizon (its apparent position lowered over time), and when the illuminated shape subtended about the width of a nickel at arm&apos;s length.", "a report of the incident that occurred today, December 15th 2000 involving a siting of unknown flying objects over New York City.At approximately 16:15 hours, I went out to the East facing entrance of my office building for a cigarette break, I was accompanied by one of the Engineers (((name deleted))).  We each had a cigarette, he returned inside.  We were together about 3 min, a truck pulled up then the driver pulled the truck into the bay and went inside. I was looking up in the sky, as we have a very large crane in front of the building, I was looking at the top of the crane, amazed at its height.

Looking East, there is an UPS office, with another larger building a block behind that one.  Over the top of the 2nd building, I was what appeared to be an airplane at a very high altitude. It appeared to be moving quite slow.  It was small, and appeared to be very high up (miles).  It was noticeably black in color. As it moved from East to West, I remarked to myself that it no longer looked like an aircraft, but it looked more like a flock of birds flying; it a appeared to be in a &quot;formation.  This was not a &quot;strict&quot; V formation, as it looked sort of, well, like a flock of birds. Then the object stopped moving.   It seemed as if it was hovering, or just stopped moving. It remained in the same position for about 2-min, but the shape of the object changed again.  It looked more like a small black square, with a small protrusion on its side.

Although it did not display any physics-defying manuevers it was extremely fast, much faster than any other flying craft that I have ever seen.

We were southbound on US-395.  It was approximately 9 PM and it was pitch black outside.  There are no lights at all in this area.  This area (Owens Valley) is a long N/S valley that is bordered on the E/W by mountain ranges in excess of 14,000 Ft.  As we were driving south of Lone Pine, my brother told me to look at a light that was to the left of the vehicle.  I looked and I saw a green light.  It was off to the east of the roadway by approximately 3 to 4 miles.  It was only about 400 to 500 feet off the ground.  It was moving at approximately 150 to 200 MPH.  It had apparently come from behind us, out of our view, and we noticed it as it passed us to the left.  We watched it as it continued south.  Since it was doing approximately 150 MPH faster than us, it gradually got further away until we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  We expected to see it get higher as at the end of the valley, there was a ridge of foothills that it would have to climb over, but we never saw it again.  This light very well could have been an airplane as all airplanes have a green navigational light on the right wingtip.  But, there were no other lights other than the green one.  No flashing strobe lights or other lights indicative of an airplane.  Also, the green light was more like a luminescent &quot;glowing&quot; color, very different from the green color that is typically used on an aircraft.  Unless this was a military aircraft with night vision capabilities, there would have been no way for a pilot to see the terrain.  If you look on an aeronautical map, the section where we saw this &quot;light&quot; has mountains as high as 14,000 feet and it is pitch black out there with no ground lights to use for visual reference or dead reckoning.  Although we didn&apos;t stop the vehicle to listen for aircraft noise, we never did hear any noise.  If it was a military jet, even at 3 to 4 miles distant, we should have heard some jet noise.

They looked light very bright stars, and one in particular was moving up and down, side to side stopping on a dime, and moving from one axis to the other at 90 degree angles. I called a friend that lives a few miles away, and he witnessed the same thing. A second person that was in the house with me witnessed the same thing. These objects were located in the sky at about a 45-degree angle from view (elevation) and South Southwest to the left and slightly below Orion&apos;s Belt (I think). There was a triangular constellation of similar objects to the left and slightly below the initial object that were moving around also, but they were dimmer. The objects resembled stars, but seemed to change from bright white to red and blue. They were also flickering between colors. It seemed as though the object left a small trail at times, and sometimes it looked like two stars connected by a thin beam of light before they merged into a single light source. I watched the objects for about 90 minutes before going back to bed. I thought that this object could possibly be a satellite.

I&apos;ve been seeing about four UFOs per year in recent years although, my first sighting occurred during the 60&apos;s, though, this is only the second sighting I&apos;ve ever reported. My first reported sighting was of a black triangle, on 12/09/00 about a mile from this sighting. I&apos;ve seen about 20 UFOs in my lifetime and all of them have occurred within this two mile radius. I&apos;ve begun to noticing that these UFOs tend to &quot;wink-out&quot; at similar points in the sky and I think that these similar locations might indicate some sort of flight path or &quot;entrance-exit doorway of some kind.&quot; I really don&apos;t like seeing them. They baffle my mind quite a bit. Anyway, I drew this image at a friend&apos;s request and thought I might as well send it to the UFORC, too. :-) My report : At 6:25 PM, from my kitchen window, on December, 15th, 2000, I noticed a large, intensely, bright, bluish-white strobing light flying north from the Beaver or Vanport area of western Pennsylvania . Its speed seemed normal but it flew unusually low and close to my house and was perhaps, only 200 feet away from me for 5 seconds or so. This wasn&apos;t a normal flight path. As the strobe flashed, about once per second, it  illuminated the craft&apos;s body, momentarily and, I could then, see that this craft was oblong, wingless, disk-like and of a dull, dark, brownish-gray color. There were also a few areas of very hazy, dimly lit, multi-colored light, of red and yellow-green, around the right side of the craft which,  seemed like windows but with no apparent structural definition or frame work around them. These window-like areas seemed to merge with the surface of the craft&apos;s outer surface. The disk seemed to be about15 feet wide as, it passed just behind a tall tree in my yard.  I heard no noise from this craft at this close grange nor at any other time. Immediately after this craft passing by my window, it made a sharp 45 degree, westerly turn, towards an open field and hovered about 100 feet above the ground. about 75 yards from my window. This dark craft had no other lights. At this angle, the disk looked very black except for the small surface area being illuminated by its flashing strobe.  Although, the outer countours of the craft were  barely distinguishable from the darkness of the surrounding landscape, the craft&apos;s slight drifting movements provided  me with some indication of its disk-like shape. The strobe was located at the tip of a short, thin appendage, about three or four feet in length, along the center portion of the disk&apos;s side.  As the craft moving very slowly  westerly while low in the field and about100 feet from the ground, I noticed that its strobing light seemed to be rotating, clockwise about a fourth of the way around the side of the disk. But perhaps, there is another was of viewing this apparent rotation. I noticed, too, that this strobe light was always pointing towards the north, even though, this craft was in the process of making a sharp, 45 degree turn towards the west and the strobe light was always pointing north, in spite of the disk&apos;s varying flight path . This fixed, northernly directed pointing of the strobe&apos;s appendage  remained consistent throughout my sighting or at least, during the time that I could  see the craft clearly before, it departed far into the west.  When the strobe was at it closest, low over the field, I could see this strobe&apos;s appendage wavering, back and forth, a few feet CW then, CCW, every three seconds or so as it hovering. This slight wavering or gliding back and forth movement of the appendage sort of reminded me of the subtle wavering of a compass needle. These wavering movements were quite obvious though, not perfectly rhythmic or uniform in the length or duration of each swing. This disk then, stopped and hovered, a seconds time, about 250 to 300 feet above ground and about 150 yards away.  The strobe no longer at this disk&apos;s front end, as it had been during its approach towards my house from the south, was now casting enough light upon the craft&apos;s surface to illuminate and reveal its very dull, dark brownish-gray color, very faintly. This color resembled that of a darkened, tarnished penny though the craft, itself, always looked very black in the areas not being illuminated by the strobe. I observed this craft for about one minute before it continued on westward, at a slightly higher altitude and speed than that of an airliner. As this craft gradually faded out of sight in the distant western sky, it didn&apos;t visually descend towards the horizon but rather remained high in the mid-sky.  The sky was very heavily over-cast at that time and no stars were visible. As the craft headed west, I sighted smaller crafts following it. These crafts flew passed, one by one, about one minute apart, over a period of about ten mintues. Each followed the disk&apos;s path, though, none of these smaller crafts flew in close to my house and hovered there.  All of these smaller crafts flew directly in the direction of the departing disk.  These crafts, also, flew slightly faster than airliners and they did make engine noise. One flew close enough that I could see its underside with binoculars (I hadn&apos;t had time to grab them when I really needed them for viewing the disk) With binoculars, I could see two bright, bluish-white, flashing lights, one on each of its wing tips. These bluish-white, alternatingly, flashing lights seemed to create the illusion of a blue line running from wing tip to wing tip, on the underside of the plane.   Or perhaps, I was actually seeing a single light that moving rapidly from one wing tip to the other, in a manner similar to how I might draw long lines of light in the air by waving or writing in the air with a hand held flashlight. When viewing the closest of these approaching small planes, its bright flashing bluish-white lights would reflect back upon the underside of its wings which seemed to be unusually broad and of a similar color to that of the disk, itself. Towards the rear on its underbelly were two broad clusters of non-blinking, dimly lit lights. One cluster was red and the other amber. In side view, from a distance, these crafts displayed what appeared as a single small, yet, very bright, flashing light that alternating between rhythmic flashes of jerky pink and white light.  The disk&apos;s strobing light, on the other hand, seemed to more in a straighter, smooth line without this visual jerky motion. I noticed no electrical disturbances during my sighting.", "First thought to be an airplane, but its color, shapes, and hovering motion was unexplainable.orangish in color hovering in a southeast pattern disappearing one by one moving at slow rate of speed.", "The picture window in my living room faces almost due north.  With the curtains drawn and the room lighted, I saw the outline of a fireball with a green/blue tint come down almost vertically.

It reminded me of a firework with a trail behind it, and since it appeared to come straight down over my neighbor&apos;s house that&apos;s what I thought it was.

The object were moving against the wind in the upper atmosphere above the cloud covering which was coming over the Atlanta area at that time.  The fading away of the object could have been due to the clouds.  It is not possible to define if the brightness of the objects was due to their own light or if it was reflection from the sun.

When I crossed the road I was drawn to look to my left.  I stopped my car as I saw in the sky, a brilliant white sphere across the lake.  I sat there watching it, amazed.  All of a sudden a search light came out of it, it was shinning on the clouds in front and to the sides of it.  I just sat there watching it.  The search light went out, and within seconds, the bright sphere went out.  I sat a while longer waiting to see if there were blinking lights which would have made it a plane...there were none.  There was also no noise of any kind to be heard.  When planes fly on that side of the lake, it echo&apos;s to our side.  No noise, and the object was gone.

While driving home from shopping, I saw an bright glowing white object. It was like seeing a bright, white florescent light tube flying smoothly in a steady path from south to north at approximately 2000 ft altitude. I&apos;d estimate it was approximatly 60 ft in length and about 15 ft diameter and it was cylinderical/cigar shaped. It was not moving very fast, approximately 100 to 200 mph and it was completely silent. It was heading in my general direction from the  south west. As it got closer I noticed a slight trail of smoke behind it but heard no engine sounds and observed no flames or anything else to accound for the smoke trail. The smoke trail made me think that someone might be playing a prank and sent up a small rocket with a light tube inside it. However, I observed no wings and it moved horizontally at a constant velocity and was not falling or descending as a rocket normally would without any propulsion. So I dismissed the &quot;prank-rocket&quot; and was left not knowing what it was. There were no marker lights, windows or any other lights aircraft normally have.   While driving south, I watched it through my windshield for about 1/2 minute as it got closer. Then I turned off highway 29 at the Dry Creek Exit to better observe it and to make sure I don&apos;t pass it. I watched it for a few more seconds and then I realized that I better park the car safely off the road to avoid someone rear ending my car. I took my eyes off it for just a few seconds to park off the road and get out of the car and when I looked up again it was gone.  All that was left was a thin trail of smoke that ended abruptly where I last observed it.", "Only witnessed A bright 2 second flash of light from inside the house and the house shook about 20-30 second thereafter.Was inside of the house getting ready for the day, When witnessed A big flash of light that lit up the entire sky &amp; surroundings.

Then all at once we could hear some noise like a computer would sound when connecting to the internet, it was deafening.  We ran inside to call the cops and came back out and they had gone.  We have seen them often about every three weeks now.((NUFORC Note:  To the best of our knowledge, we have not received other reports from this part of Kansas for this date, or the earlier alleged dates.

I tried to say something to my husband who was sleeping next to me but everything I tried to say seemed to be coming out in slow motion.  At a few different intervals the light grew more intense and there was a sutble noise.  Kind of like the sound an x-ray machine makes. At the same time the light would intensify and I could feel a vibration though my body, like a very weak electical current. I kept trying to say &quot;what is that?&quot;  but my husband was asleep and I really couldn&apos;t seem to move or make any real sounds.  I&apos;m not even sure this has anything to do with UFO&apos;s , actually my first thought was the nuclear power plant about 30 miles from us.

I had visual contact for 1.5 seconds or so. It was a brilliant white ball with a blue and tuquoise type of halo around the core following back to the tail. The tail was impressive. It was a bluish and turquoise color but what was unique, it had two tails of smimilar thickness and length. It was at about 50 degrees above my visible horizon and pased very quickly from east to west then faded like a regular run of the mill falling star.  It seemed to be closer to the earth with more of an arc in it&apos;s flight trajectory. Size about a dime at arms lentgh. What really struck me was it&apos;s beauty as it passed. When we got to our destination I asked the driver in the lead truck if he had seen it, He got a bit enthusiastic about it and remarked on the brillinace and the many colors and stated it was kinda pretty wans&apos;t it.

We watched for a few seconds, and the lights totally disappeared, as though behind a cloud.  The trajectory was from the Northeast.  We had the impression the lights were getting closer because the distance between the two lights in the front increased.  These were not falling stars, as the trajectory appeared to parallel the earth, rather than descend to the earth.  The lights were 15-20 times brighter than the brightest of stars (closer to the size of car headlights at a distance).  There was no noise associated with the lights.

The night was clear, cloudless and cold with the temperature hovering around 0 degrees F.  The light was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and at first I thought it was a star because of the twinkling light it emitted.  But it seemed too bright and low on the horizon to be a star or a planet.  I continued to drive north on Route 83 and then merged onto Interstate 55 (Stevenson Expressway) heading in a southwest direction. The light was still in the same position when I headed southwest on I-55; the time now was about 7:15 p.m.  I still thought that the light was probably a star at this time.  About 15 minutes later I passed Route 53 in Bolingbrook, IL and the object remained in the same position.  At this time I ruled out that it was a commercial jet/plane coming in to land at O&apos;Hare International airport.  All planes coming in to land at O&apos;Hare will fly by within 5 - 10 minutes; it had now been 20 minutes since I first spotted the light.  Within the next few minutes I noticed the light to twinkle more and once or twice blink out for between 1/2 to 1 seconds (this is only an approximation).  There also seemed to be a slight change in altitude in that the light descended just a bit.  I then exited I-55 and proceeded north on Weber Road (between Bolingbrook and Romeoville, IL).  I then turned west onto 119th St. and drove several miles further to Book Rd. (just south of Naperville, IL across from the Naperville polo club) and turned south onto Book Rd. stopping to observe the light from a stationary position.  At the same time a white pickup truck also stopped on Book Rd. behind me just north of 119th (to observe the light I assume).  The light remained hovering in the sky in a position WSW of me.  I was now close enough to it to discern only that it was no! t a star .  Its altitude was not easy to determine, but I did notice that planes, some distance behind the light flying into O&apos;Hare airport, were higher.  After a minute or two the light grew in intensity and became very bright, it appeared to twinkle with multiple red and white lights.  At this time (now about 7:45 p.m.) I decided to get out of the car to take a picture, but I was too late.  The light disappeared.

This object was not a plane, it was not clouds(the sky was clear at that time), it was not the smoke from my neighbors chimney or a falling star(meteor)and it was not a flock of birds flying in formation(although the latter did crosss my mind at first because of the formation it was in but it was traveling much too fast). What I saw was something shaped roughly like a boomarang, it made no sound, left no trail in the sky and the only thing that defined it&apos;s shape was what seemed to be dots of white light, several rows of them. It wasn&apos;t light like starlight or streetlight or any light I have ever seen, it was just white dots of light, glowing white dots. It seemed to be traveling northwest to southeast at the time I saw it and I watched it till the tree branches obscured it and it disappeared over the housetops. It&apos;s shape never fluctuated from this boomarang formation. I stood there saying to myself, &quot;what the @#&amp;* was that?&quot;, and would have probably just left it at that but as I was standing there contemplating what it was I just saw I noticed this same shaped object with the white light further down the horizan. It was further south closer to the downtown area of the city(Buffalo) and now seemed to be traveling east to west till it disappeared.  This thing was so strange I probably would have talked myself out of believing I had seen what I had just seen if I had not seen it twice. After I saw this object the second time further down the horizan I stayed out for probably another 10 minutes or more searching the sky for this thing till my toes were getting numb before going in. I don&apos;t know what it was that I saw that night but I do know what it wasn&apos;t and I&apos;m wondering if there were any other reports in the Buffalo, Western NY area regarding this strang object close to the time I saw it??  Thanks", "A burning object, with the speed ofthe light,came from onwhere. stoped,turned right  and left,then left this earth??It was comming from nowhere!!! the speed was like a shooting star!!  it traveled 2km on one half of a second. And it was all just a fireball!! the strange thing was that after the 2km,it stoped,and whent in a horizontal manuver right!  with the same speed,and we could see it like a huge fire-stripe. Suddenly it whent to the left! And then,whit the speed of the ight, it was gone over the mountains,up in space.. No one belived us! so we didn`t tell anyone.", "The object was a brillant white light standing out against the bright arizona skyI have never reported this before but a local sighting here encourages me. My wife and i were fishing on the colorado river at willow beach arizona some 90 mile or so from las vegas. It was getting dusky down by the river but it was stilll broad daylight above us,no clouds at all. i was laying on my back staring up at the sky when i saw a very bright white light flying over us from east to west. I immediatly jumped up shouted to my wife. Could see no shape just brilliant white light and then it began to move in a sharp zig zag pattern rapidly still going due west. I know aircraft and i knew it was something unusual. Its passed out of sight in probably less than 30-40 seconds. a few seconds later we saw another one just like the first traveling in the same zig zag pattern going west and just as quickly. i was astounded. I remember at about this same time there were reports in the las vegas paper of sightings in the mountains west of the city.", "We chased a craft emmiting a pure shaft of light   onto back country roads and watched it disappear into the night sky.This happened so long ago but I feel it&apos;s important to tell you now! My family and neighbors saw red lights (which were perceived to be on 8 individual crafts) in formation over a shopping center near my home.  I can&apos;t be specific as to the shape of any craft but the lights were clearly visible. They moved back and forth in sinc then they started to take off from the formation each craft going a different way. My boyfriend(Mike) and I and my sister decided to chase one.  I don&apos;t remember how we were able to jump in the car and keep track of the craft but now I feel that the craft was somehow waiting for us as if it was going to &quot;guide&quot; us. I remember seeing a pure blue round light shine down on the grass next to the road we were on. (left side).You could see through the light clearly and it illuminated the grass next to the road.  I felt as if we were driving 100mph but the speedometer registered about 35 mph! I remember feeling as if this thing was leading us out away from the city and onto a remote country road which is what it did! I was mesmerized by the light!  I had never seen such a pure bright intense light before! I just remember thinking &quot;pure&quot;.  Mike was trying to look up to see if he could make out any kind of craft and drive at the same time but he told me just recently (he is now my ex-husband) that he was unable to really see it.  I wish I had looked up!I believe my sister was unable to see anything because she was on the passenger side of the car.  After we had followed it for what seemed like awhile I was overcome with intense fear and told Mike to stop.  I realized what it was doing (leading us out into the country).As soon as Mike hit the brakes it shot up into the sky. It was dark which made it difficult to really see but we could see the light disappear and it seemed as though I was able to &quot;perceive&quot; it. At that point we were able to get out of the car and look up into the night sky. It was a dark object. The red lights appeared again. As we watched it bank to the left a jet approached it from behind and followed it. They both disappeared in the distance. The next day the paper said what we had seen was &quot;swamp gas&quot;! I don&apos;t think so. It was so long ago but you&apos;ve stated on the Jeff Rense radio program that no matter when they happened these sightings should be reported.  I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t fill in some of the details but I will tell you that this was REAL and it scared the heck out of me! ! I must t ell you this although it seems a bit &quot;crazy&quot; to me but when I told Mike to stop the car I heard a voice say &quot;You&apos;re not ready.&quot;! I&apos;ve never told anyone that! Nothing since then has happened to me but my ex-husband has seen other ufo&apos;s here in Colorado.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "small white circles that fade in and out and remain motionless for minutes at a timeWe were watching the east horizon to see the sun rise, on a beautifully clear day. I noticed a white speck over the Cascade mountain range slowly fade into vision. It was small, very far away but a definate circular shaped object that remained motionless for about 3 or 4 minutes. It did not change shape,color, or size. It faded slowly back out of vision, and as it did so, another one the same way as before faded in and remained motionless for a few minutes, then faded out. I saw another one faintly do the same thing after that. It was much smaller, but followed the same pattern.((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  We wonder whether the witness might have been observing contrails by commercial jet aircraft approaching from the east.  PD))", "WE SAW AN OUT OF SPACE OBJECTTHIS OBJECT WAS LIKE A PLATE WITH A CUP IN THE TOP(UPSIDEDOWN),WITH LIGHTS AT THE BOTTOM(YELLOW,WHITE AND RED)SOME OF THE LIGHTS STEADY OTHERS BLINKING AND AT THE TOP OF IT ALSO SOME LIGHTS BUT KIND OF STEADY TO ME,I JUST REMEMBER SEEN SOMETHING AROUD IT BUT NOT TOO CLOSE THEY LOOKED LIKE STARS TO ME BUT THEY WERE LIKE FOLLOWING THE OBJECT,MAYBE THREE OF THIS LITTLE THINGS.THE OBJECT WAS NORTH OF ME AND IT WAS MOVING WEST,WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE APT.TO SEE IT AGAIN IT WAS GONE,I WATCH THIS THRU A WINDOW.THAT THING WAS BRIGHT IN SOME PARTS.ALSO THE LIGHTS I TOLD YOU BEFORE HAD SOME KIND OF MOVEMENT OR IT WAS THE OBJECT ITSELF THAT MAKE ME SEE THAT ,LIKE A ROTATION,THIS IS WHAT I STILL SEE IN MY MIND .IT WAS A SHORT TERM ONLY 33 TO 35 SECONDS.(EXCUSE MY ENGLISH PLEASE)", "Fireball Over North Central KansasAt the above stated time I was on my way home from work headed west on the Tipton road about 3 miles west of the Highway 14 and the Tipton road junction.  My actaual location was approximately 3-4 miles south west of Beloit Kansas.  A yellow-orange ball with a bluish trailing edge appeared to fall to the ground at a high rate of speed.  It did not appear to be perfectly round.  It was as if the effects of falling through the atmosphere were effecting it&apos;s shape, not actually causing a distinguisable tail but rather making it somewhat egg shaped.  The object appeared to be dense and not transparent at all, but also it appeared to me to be a ball of fire rather than a solid object.  It fell at not quite right angles to the ground.  I would say more like 80 degrees in relation to the horizon moving from right to left as it fell.  I would say that from the time it entered into view in my windsheild and disapeared behind the horizon was a little more than one second. I was in a low spot and when I topped out on the next hill I saw no further evidence of the object.  I neither heard, nor felt, nor saw any impact, but as far as I could tell it had to have hit the ground because it disappeared behind the horizon.  As far as size I would say that if it were possible to extend my arm infront of me and try to cover the object with my thumb it would have just barely covered it.  Because I have no way to know it&apos;s exact size it is impossible to accurately judge the distance it was away from me.  However, I had the sense that it may have fallen somewhere around the Solomon Rapids or Glen Elder lake area and between the Tipton road and Hiway 24 which run fairly perallel to each other about 5 miles appart.  I contacted the 911 dispatcher and within about 10 minutes a deputy Sheriff contacted me by phone.  I related the event to him and he told me he had been on the tipton road also but had not seen it.  He said that if something had fallen it must have been behind him or he would have seen it also.  His location at th! e time w as west of glen elder eastbound heading toward me. He did not tell me how far west he was but I was about 7-8 miles east of glenelder at the time.)  If the object was behind the officer it would have to have been atleast 8-10 miles away from me.  If that is the case, in my estimation the oblect had to be fairly large for it to have appeared as large to me as it did."]
